After bar setting movies like When Harry Met Sally Sleepless In Seattle and Four Weddings and a Funeral the constant stream of lazy efforts in recent years can cause one to be seriously jaded by the genre. So it is with this skepticism and desire to switch off my brain that I pop Over Her Dead Body into my DVD player. It is apparent from a mere glance at the synopsis that this film will not last long in my memory change my life or be any kind of profound filmic experience for me but I was entertained. The script was amusing the delivery from the four leads Bell Rudd Biggs Longoria precise and well timed. The premise was an interesting spin on an oft used plot device.So what's not to like? An entertaining funny and endearing romantic comedy. At best a competent entry into the genre quite a way ahead of most of it's type and at worst a movie that feels like a sitcom without a laughter track. As someone who likes sitcoms that isn't a particularly bad thing. In a nutshell you could do a lot worse.".

Moreover the story fails to stay focused as it wonders whether to focus on Eva and Lake's battle or Lake and Paul's love story. As someone mentioned it tires to combine 'How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days' and 'Just Like Heaven' both movies which I enjoyed but fails to reach that level. None of the characters are likable. I found them to be quite irritating. The only bright light here is some of the comedy which manages to get some chuckles. Eva Longoria repeats her Gabrielle Solis act of 'Desperate Housewives' except that this time her character is dead. She does provide some eye candy and is funny in some sequences. Paul Rudd looks careless throughout the entire movie. Lake Bell though she doesn't act bad there is something missing. Jason Biggs does well with what he's given. 'Over Her Dead Body' is just a weak and forgettable movie.".

I figured just to go ahead and see the horror before my eyes but actually this wasn't too bad. I was just expecting this horrific movie but it seems like the writers meant no harm but the casting of Eva LongoriaParker sorry she seems a little off set for the movie. I think I may have found it to be a little better without her just she does annoy me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable. But you have to admit there was no point to this movie it was one of those quick paychecks for the actor type of thing. The movie could've been funnier if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast.Henry just lost his bride to be Kate who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day. But when his sister takes him to a psychic Ashley Henry falls for her but Kate is haunting her from beyond the grave. Kate is jealous and doesn't want Henry to move on so quickly and she will make sure that Ashley doesn't get him by torturing her day and night with her rambles believe me with Kate's voice that's scary.Over Her Dead Body is an alright movie not sure if it's worth the money but I'd give it a rental for you if you want to see it or are curious. Eva Longoria just doesn't have enough star power to make the film work no offense to those who love her she just belongs on the small screen over the silver screen. Not to mention the character of Ashley she seems still not too likable with everything she pulls or her gay friend Dan just again not really likable. Just with some rewriting and proper attention this film could have been better but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with with an empty feeling.410".

Hollywood is not very imaginative when it comes to think outside the box thus all films follow the magic and boring formula of a beginning a middle and an end.

This movie has that scene too but the disappointing script passes over it too quickly and with not much result for the plot.The highlight of the movie is the acting of two leads Paul Rudd and the surprisingly funny Lake Bell.I've long had a growing admiration for Rudd who has developed a style similar to that of Chevy Chase at his best. If ever a serious production of sequels to the Fletch movies gets a green light the casting agent would do wisely in considering Rudd.Lake Bell is rather new to me and I was severely impressed by her comedy talent. She could easily be pictured in overthetop comedy things and take on a female lead over Jim Carreys character in Dumb  dumber or Ben Stillers in There's something about Mary. The Farrelly brothers could have a new star in her.In conclusion this film was watchable. Ghosttown is a better movie in all considerations but Rudd and Bell are a joy.".

I know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a screwball comedy but you usually don't really care because you are laughing. This movie is so unfunny that you actually sit there and wonder about the unlikely series of coincidences and completely unbelievable behavior involved. Events were placed in the film just to move the characters from one scene to the next or to provide exposition. Sure this is how all movies work but you shouldn't notice that it's happening. Inelegant. That's the term I should use.There was almost no one in the movie who was really likable. I didn't care who ended up with whom as long as they all stayed the hell away from me and I didn't have to listen to them talk about it anymore. Why would the only really cool character in the movie the Paul Rudd character want to have anything to do with the completely bitchy condescending control freak played by Eva Longoria? Also almost all of the characters involved consistently picked the sleaziest solution to any situation. A straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out and bathe with with a woman he is attracted to? The best feelgood moment they could come up with was to tack on a happy ending for the same schmoe where he gets together with Rudd's equally annoying lying kleptomaniac sister?

Of course the best were the Topper movies in the late '30searly '40s. And more recently Warren Beatty's Heaven Can Wait 1978 which was a remake of 1941's Here Comes Mr. Jordan. These were wellwritten funny entertaining comedies all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels.Now comes writerdirector Jeff Lowell making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable bitchy young woman Kate Eva Longoria Parker who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist Ashley Lake Bell who is falling for Kate's fianc Henry Paul Rudd. One thing that is clear at the outset Longoria Parker is no Constance Bennett Marion Kerby in the first two Topper films who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured.There is a line right at the beginning when Henry's sister Chloe Lindsay Sloane tells Henry You don't smile. That aptly described my situation throughout this film.The main problem with the film is that the script just isn't very funny. But it's made worse by Longoria Parker's presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen. Just to start out with compounding her lack of comedic talent she is covered with so much pancake makeup who knows what she really looks like? Kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue. She's so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her well she actually just fades out so Kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is.Chloe wants Henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after Kate's death from what I saw of Kate he should have felt a wonderful relief so she introduces him to Ashley who really doesn't know what she's doing as a spiritualist she is also a cateress to make ends meet to see if she can get Henry back in touch with Kate. There's a lot of meshugaas that goes on.The vacuity of the film is epitomized by a B story revolving around Ashley's assistant Dan Jason Biggs. This is thrown in near the end but the way Ashley handles it indicates that she's as much of a boob as Kate. Since Dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women he deserves whatever he gets.Eventually Kate appears to Ashley and the fun should begin. It doesn't and more's the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny. As it is Norman Z.

It is the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy giving the caterers an earful about her demands for food presentation. But horror of horrors the angel ice sculpture ordered by Kate arrives without wings. In an ensuing fight with the sculptor the heavy ice maiden falls on Kate and sends her to the hereafter. Now one year later Henry's sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward. Yet the lovely medium Ashley Lake Bell becomes interested in Henry herself much to the chagrin of her catering partner Jason Biggs.

Can anything be done to return Kate into heaven for good? This is an abysmal romantic comedy one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen. No its not the cast as they try gamely to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fianc and Bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise infectious. Biggs a funny thespian too is totally wasted. As for Rudd a very gifted performer see Anchorman Knocked Up or Clueless please he tries hardest of all and in truth is the main reason to see this clunker. His charm looks and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable. But nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner absolutely nothing. So if you are a dyedinthewool fan of romantic comedy think long and hard before you fork over any money for this one. Even were free tickets to fall into your lap be warned that this movie is a neardeath experience for those who adore loveandlaugh cinema.".

It is the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy giving the caterers an earful about her demands for food presentation. But horror of horrors the angel ice sculpture ordered by Kate arrives without wings. In an ensuing fight with the sculptor the heavy ice maiden falls on Kate and sends her to the hereafter. Now one year later Henry's sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward. Yet the lovely medium Ashley Lake Bell becomes interested in Henry herself much to the chagrin of her catering partner Jason Biggs.

The only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a noholdsbarred satirical farce. Instead wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy inoffensive and warmhearted romantic comedy Lowell engages in boring halfmeasures every step of the way tamping down the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality. Indeed Over Her Dead Body is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it's hard to know where exactly Lowell thought he was going with it. Virtually every setup joke and sight gag in the film is flatfooted and poorly executed with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament. How else to explain the halfhearted lifeless performances of Paul Rudd Eva Langoria Parker Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? I choose not to blame the actors some of whom have proved their talents in better vehicles in the past that is particularly the case with Rudd.

Unfortunately she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features Jason Biggs tolerable and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like Leo DiCaprio at the end of Titanic. Over Her Dead Body actually pied me off because of its laziness and utter lack of effort. I started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this.

I should add that I have never seen and will probably never see an episode of Lizzie McGuire the nowdefunct Disneyowned television show that spawned  surprise surprise  this Disneyowned family release. I suppose this movie was a farewell to the Lizzie McGuire character  but I swear it'll be lost on you if you are one of those who has not seen the television show. Take for instance the whole subplot about Lizzie's younger brother and his blonde cohort's reason for trying to show up Lizzie at every turn which was totally lost on me and classmate Kate's reason for being such a bitch to Lizzie ??.But anyhoo bubbly Lizzie heads to Italy with her classmates to see the sights of Rome but spends very little actual time with them. The extras playing her classmates must have felt quite wooden making this movie having nothing much to say or do. On the other hand Lizzie's motormouth teacher Borstein a former MAD TV regular plays or should I say overplays the role of Miss Ungermeyer and as a result comes across as very grating. The scene where teacher and students visit the Trevi Fountain is especially grating and cringeworthy. Ungermeyer with an American flag conspicuously in hand cuts a swath through the local population  and 'mows down' any cultural sensitivities by obnoxiously barking Scusi and Grazieat the locals.Without venturing into too much detail about the fairly tame and somewhat lame storyline Lizzie's transformation from school student to freshfaced singer is mildly amusing but an ohsoobvious marketing ploy by Duff's music label. TIRED is one word to describe this same old 'girl comes out of her shell' storyline that's been done a million time before. Private Benjamin Protocol Educating Rita Romancing the Stone Legally Blonde and The Princess Diaries come to mind as a few more successful titles of this particular genre.So if you're looking for screen chemistry you may find some between leads Duff and Gellman. If you're looking for a movie that showcases Rome's beauty this movie won't disappoint. If you're looking for something above average with a touch of magic to it you probably won't find it here.510".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lizzie McGuire Movie is a nice film to watch if you have nothing better to do as its harmless entertainment. Lizzie McGuire and her pals Gordo Kate and Ethan all pack their bags on a class trip to Italy. Once there Lizzie is mistaken for pop star Isabella and begins to falls for Paolo who is Isabella's exboyfriend. When Lizzie's mom dad and brother Matt get wind of this they all jet their way to Italy. While Lizzie is transformed from a normal teen to a beautiful pop star. The plot follows the last episode of Lizzie McGuire and this film is pretty much just another episode. I do watch the TV series sometimes and its not a great show but it isn't terrible either. Hilary Duff stars as Lizzie and she does a good job of playing her. Many people claim that she is a terrible actress but she does have some charm in the roles she plays. Most of the cast from the show appear in the film except for Lalaine. Adam Lamberg plays Gordo and I think he does a good job kind of an annoying character though. Robert Carradine and Hallie Todd play Lizzie's parents. They both do a good job but don't really appear in the film very much. Some other characters that appear are Matt who is Lizzie's brother and Kate who is Lizzie's exbest friend. There are a couple of new people in the film as well like Alex Borstein. She steals the film and gives a funny performance. Yani Gellman plays Lizzie's love interest and I thought he did a poor job but it was his first major role. Jim Fall directs this film the same as if it had been a regular episode so don't expect anything out of the ordinary. While I did enjoy the movie at times it felt like it was just made for money purposes and not entertainment value. It does feel sitcomAsh which isn't surprising. Though that sometimes does get annoying. It was predictable but that was expected. It was kind of cheesy at times but its still good fun. It wasn't made to win Oscars it was made so its audience could have some fun and I think most people will. It's a short inoffensive film and just don't expect too much. So if you like the show then you will probably like the film since it's the same. If you hate the show then you should just skip this movie. In the end this is harmless entertainment that wouldn't hurt you if you watched it. Rating 710".

I am into mostly classics of the 60s and 70s such as Chinatown the Godfather and other movies of the time peroid. But like other genres also like horror sci fi good dramas. And every now and then a good old fashioned family film is fun to watch. I had read about Hillary Duff and that her show lizzie Mcguire was a big hit which my little niece watches it so I was like what the hell try it out. I loved it! It was real cute and fun with a little message behind itwhat family film doesn't. I think Hill is so much more nice and sweet then all these other sleazy trampy young girl stars out there. Hell I have to admit even the songs weren't that bad kind of catchy. That girl from Mad TV was great! I laughed my ass off as soon she came into the picture. She rules!So anyway about all these bad messages posted about this film and Hillary. I know people have the right to their opinions but come on it's a family film! What do you expect Chinatown! Disney makes makes movies for everyones viewing. Can't expect something deep and disturbing. You can't review this film to heavy because it's family oriented. And as far as Hillary goes come on she's only what 16 17? Can't expect her to do academy award workesp for Disney! Maybe she will get better when she is older if not who cares! She seems like a real smart down to earth gal with a good head on her shoulders. She is smart to not stooping low and cutting down Avril like she has been doing to her saying things like she's such as mommys  girl and belittling her. With all the violence and hardcore language in films today sometimes it's nice to watch a nice feel good light family film which is is what Lizzie Mcguire has to offer.Hill if you are out there I am behind you 100! Keep up the good work! Dave from PA. PS just ignore Avril. You are above that".

The film sets it's stall out straight away with a lively musical number and the clich of teenage girl and nosy little brother etc. The animated add ins are not nearly as funny as they think they are but they are all part of the charm and energy that made this film watchable.While it is clearly aimed at girls younger than McGuire herself it is quite sassy and energetic. The plot is utter nonsense from start to finish but it bussles along just about well enough to get by. Duff herself is quite nice in the role  she is quite bubbly plus she isn't exactly hard on the eye! Borstein as Ungermeyer is worth a laugh or two but the majority of the teenage cast are average  esp Gellman who is given very little to do outside of talking 'ina da stereotyped Aitalian's accento!'.Overall I stress that I have no intention of ever actually watching this movie again but can't pretend that it's sassy bubbly and energetic style helped me forget my flight for 90 minutes and also just about manage to find the find the fun hidden within the absurd plot.".

I rented it in August hoping it wouldn't be a cheesefest and it wasn't. It was much worse. I can't believe you people gave this film a 4.9.  It deserves a 0!  The film has a cheesy lame Cinderella story plot which resembles earlier this year's What a Girl Wants and 2001's The Princess Diaries and awful acting.  Sadly being young and goodlooking is a good substitution for talent. The opening scene in which Lizzie is trying to find a graduation outfit while singing and dancing like a geek to The Tide is High while her little brotherMatt tapes her with a remote control car is very weak and cheesy so I figured it could get better.  I mean how many films have bad and boring beginnings and turn out to be a masterpiece?  The film now moves on from here to Lizzie's graduation.  The graduation goes smoothly with the character Kate bullying Lizzie about being an outift repeater whatever that is.  Next thing you know it Lizzie trips and the backdrop falls down. It only gets worse from here.  Lizzie goes to Rome on a summer trip which school do they do that in? with her class.  Mrs. Ungermeyer is the extremely annoying chaperone.  Lizzie makes a wish in a fountain and soon appears one half of a lame international pop duo. A woman gives Lizzie cheese and the Italian popstar claims Lizzie looks exactly like the other half of the duo and convinces Lizzie to pose as her for the VMA's or whatever.  Lizzie skips all of the tours with her class to sneak out with this greasy Italian slimeball.  Kate who Lizzie shares a resort room with becomes suspicious and soon figures out what Lizzie's doing.  Hilary Duff's acting and singing as the movie yet she has made a career out of both. The weird thing is Kate decides to cover for Lizzie.  The other odd thing in the movie is that all the people hardly have accents or their accents are overaccented.  Lizzie and the guy now have to find something to wear to the VMA's so they try and find something to wear by giving Lizzie a makeover. The fashions in the fashion show are cheesy ugly haute couture ripoffs. Lizzie and Paolo rehearse the song that they are supposed to sing for the VMAs Paolo convinces Lizzie to lipsynch to the song.  Next Lizzie and Gordo get a hold of Isabella who tells her that Paolo is a poser. Meanwhile Matt tells his parents that he misses his sister after discovering Lizzie is famous.  The family jets off to Rome.  The ending is very gay and idiotic. Lizzie and Paolo go to the VMAs Gordo some how messes with the sound system turning off Paolo he's the one who lipsynchs! mic off Paolo walks off the stage embarrassed then Lizzie and Isabella take the stage singing their renedition of the song while Lizzie's family and friends are cheering her on in the crowd.  Next Lizzie gets grounded for the rest of the summer that's the worst thing that happens to her. Typical awful Disney film.  I can't believe I had to give this a one because there was no 0.0.010.0".

	schema:reviewBody ". . .takes the cake. I just finished watching a copy of this film and I must say. This movie is horrendous awful and without a doubt the worst movie I have seen in my whole life! Aside from Hilary Duff's extremely mediocre performance with hints of horrid acting ability.  Do not believe the high user ratings  they have clearly been corrupted by insider voting! When I saw this movie there were very few people in the audience some walked out during the movie and several of the rest made very negative comments when the movie was over. This movie is artificial stupid pretentious and boring. It's not really worth my time to write about but when I saw the voting results here I felt compelled to insert a strong warning to discerning viewers. To clarify there is nothing particularly offensive about this movie it's just very very bad. And aside from Ms. Duff's unconvincing Italian accent and acting ability this movie is atrocious. Worst movie ever made. There was more potential in this movie but we're left behind with the results of bad acting no creative twists but twists nonetheless or story layers and weak dialogs. The musical score does lift some scenes up though and the overall look from The Lizzie McGuire Movie has a certain flaw to it due to the stereotypical character of Lizzie. I've seen worse but it's not worth your time unless you're a real fan of  wholesome familyteenage movies and the likes.Very horrible film not even worth the price of a video rental. Very confusing film has little logic and just gets more tiresome as it goes along.Stay away from this movie at all costs. I was suckered into watching this movie in a bet to see which one of us knew the worst movie of all time. Needless to say this one won hands down. It is long and drawn out and has no purpose or plot from what I can gather. A movie about a girl who travels to Rome and meets an Italian pop star. The twist is anything BUT creative. If you are extremely bored and have no life watch this movie. But if you rather keep your sanity stay AWAY. This movie was crap. The script is so full of holes I can't see how the producers agreed to finance it.We are never given an explanation of ANYTHING. The acting is horrible. The plot sucks. This movie was obviously written for those 8 and under.I have to say this who goes to Rome for an end of school graduation?  And wouldn't the people who were feeding food to Lizzie notice she has no cheesy fake accent??Oh the dialog. Do we really need the lines Wow evil and smart. Fear it. Embrace it. Thanks for the tip I could never put that together myself. It never gets any better.Why does Lizzie talk the way she does even in the beginning?This movie is a very very bad rip off of all the other wholesome teen movies. It's a really awful What a Girl Wants The Princess DiariesSabrina Goes to Rome slopped together by a 10year old writer. It's not cheesy enough to laugh at it's just an incredibly frustrating bore. This is easily one of the worst films I've seen in many years. I started viewing the film not expecting much and that is exactly what it delivered....not much! In fact it ended up delivering even less than I expected. My first reaction when I saw the opening portions of the film was that I would probably end up rating it a 4. I thought that it seemed to have reasonably good photography and a cheery atmosphere.As the film progressed however the rating kept going down and down in my mind mainly due to pedestrian acting and a plot that went from being just plain silly and tasteless at the beginning to being both silly and repugnant near the end. By the time the movie was over I was willing to rate it no more than a 1. Hilary Duff is the world's worst actress.  Her facial expressions were cringemaking her delivery was horrendous and she was so overthetop it's unbelievable. I cannot believe there's people out there who think she's a good actress.  And while there may be people who find this film funny delightful charming and great GET OUT MORE!!!!!!!!!!! Not to mention get your head examined. This seems like a BAD student film. Just like too many TV shows now it has the characters addressing the camera and saying things that are not interesting or funny. In fact it sometimes seemed much like a bad sitcom but without the fast pace and professional craftsmanship of a bad sitcom. Every scene was both fake and unfunny. It's too bad because I have liked both the stars in the past. It's amazing how a horrible script and a bad director can make even the most appealing actors look bad. I see 5 movies a week and this is the worst one I've seen in over a year.This film seems to have fallen out of a cookie cutter for even wholesome teen romantic comedies. Everything that happens in this film is cliched and predictable. The acting is badespecially Hilary who has two expressions one and only emotion displayed and a very hollow sounding voice but the script is worse. It creates boring and stereotypical characters.The dialog is hokey and irksome. You can almost predict what the characters will say before they say it. A horriblehorrible film. Hilary Duff was terrible in her role as Lizzie. Every single scene she's in she's horrendous atrocious and amazingly horrible.The Lizzie McGuire Movie is a terrible movie. I had heard terrible things about it as have many others. I wanted to see it for those reason. It's just one of those things...you have information leading to the fact that it will be bad but you have to see just HOW bad. I cannot believe I wasted my time and money on it. Teens traveling to a foreign place has been grounds for a a lot of movies. However most of those movies to it in a more tasteful and watchable fashion. I felt nothing from this movie except anger for the better things I could have put my money towards. The shock value of this movie is not enough to watch it. Pure garbage. In a nutshell I am an embarrassed watcher of one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The Lizzie McGuire Movie is one of THOSE filmes. You know the kind that goes out of it's way to be as unfunny nonsensical and stupid as possible so the creators can tell everyone that doesn't fall over worshipping it because of hype they've heard from the creators look at most of the people commenting here. Academy take notice Hilary is AWESOMEGreat Family Film Sweet movie Excellent little movie Delightful magic? PLEASE. that they have no sense of good film or that they can't truly understand the work. That's like saying Future War was a revolutionary masterpiece you just don't get it. The Lizzie McGuire Movie in short is one of the worst films ever made possibly the worst film ever made. . The ending is incredibly stupid. The worst I've ever seen. A nonsensical random romp through Hell. To reiterate one of the worst ever made. And no I am not a 30 year old manwoman. I am an 18 year old. My parents rented it thinking it would be a cute family movie I'm an 18 year old female who suffered so much because I decided to watch this incredibly pointless movie. I left halfway even my little preteen cousin thought it sucked. My parents regretted getting this movie. And really don't waste your time on this piece of nothingness. Don't listen to the other positive comments. Its a trick to get you to suffer as well. I'm serious ........ what a waste of time and money ......... I have really no complaints about this movie except for how badly it sucked! I rented this movie and was sorely disappointed. That girl from the TV show of this was horrendous and the boy Gordo has like no depth in his voice. The other actors in the movie were not convincing at all and times when the movie tried to be dramatic it was not. In fact dramatic scenes I found were the most humorous! My sister is a singer and had several complaints on how unconvincing her singing was. Seriously fix the movie and maybe I'll be satisfied. Horrible casting  that's all I have to say. Don't waste your time brain or money on this one.".

	onyx:emotionText ". . .takes the cake. I just finished watching a copy of this film and I must say. This movie is horrendous awful and without a doubt the worst movie I have seen in my whole life! Aside from Hilary Duff's extremely mediocre performance with hints of horrid acting ability.  Do not believe the high user ratings  they have clearly been corrupted by insider voting! When I saw this movie there were very few people in the audience some walked out during the movie and several of the rest made very negative comments when the movie was over. This movie is artificial stupid pretentious and boring. It's not really worth my time to write about but when I saw the voting results here I felt compelled to insert a strong warning to discerning viewers. To clarify there is nothing particularly offensive about this movie it's just very very bad. And aside from Ms. Duff's unconvincing Italian accent and acting ability this movie is atrocious. Worst movie ever made. There was more potential in this movie but we're left behind with the results of bad acting no creative twists but twists nonetheless or story layers and weak dialogs.

I saw the movie on a free ticket and with a deal with my sister that right after it we would clense ourselves and go to the Matrix Reloaded which ruled.

I hade the entire plot set out in my mind before the movie started and i was 100 right. Girl goes somewhere I don't care where because the culture in that place is always misrepresented and surprise surprise the Itlalians aren't realistically shown at all girl has problem 99 of the time its that she isn't cool enough or doesn't have the right friends or her boobs aren't big enough and Disney does a disgusting job of getting rid of that problem and that sure is setting the good old example of being yourself and beauty from within to our already media brainwashed kids girl meets stereotypical pretty boy nuff said girl has stereotypical happy ending set to some Brittany Spears song. This movie does throw me a curveball for all of .02 seconds in the fact that she doesn't even discover happiness by not having her dreams fulfilled but to my utter disgust she becomes a big flashy fake talentless brainless MTV driven fan brainwashing freak of a singer even though it was painfully obvious her voice was altered to sound good by computer i was the only one in the audience that noticed. Why do i know this? I stood up after the movie and asked!.

Hmmm wonder why? 2 The picture quality made remarkable progress the movie was very high quality and bright and if you compare it to the TV series boy you can see a huge change! 3 No more funny music! In the TV series it had this weird goofy music playing in various scenes but I'm so glad it didn't in the movie instead it had very dreamy and fun music only in special occasions of the movie though! 4 Lizzie's personality has changed I mean in the TV series she's a shy average American girl but in the movie I heard her say Bye bye Lizzie McGuire hello fabulous! and has became more confident and more happy about herself which is great! But to bring it to the conclusion I thought this movie was one of Disney's best work ever! The performances from the cast were brilliant especially the beautiful Hilary Duff Lizzie McGuire and the plot was great I think it was a little dodgy in some parts but thankfully not all! And it's so cool they made a movie of Lizzie McGuire as for me a typical Lizzie McGuire fan loved it and hope to see more of her! So are you bored? Have nothing to do? A Lizzie McGuire fan? Then look no further rent this movie on either DVDVideo grab the delicious popcorn and Coke turn on the TV and get ready for over a hour of fun excitement and laughs with Lizzie!".

But faith changes for Lizzie where she meets a cute Italian pop star named Paolo played by Yenti Gellman and gets mistaken for his former partner in crime Isabella who is also played by Hilary Duff with a brunette wig....oh JEEZ Hannah Montana anyone?? But is Paolo the greatest singer in the world or not??The story is cutesy and cheesythe cast is pretty OK I only watch it for Hilary Duff whom I used to be a fan of back when she was in A Cinderella StoryCheaper By The Dozen and now this movie that's based on the TV series. The plot has been DONE TO DEATH already I mean we've seen this a million times before in The Parent Trap with the twins looking alikeMaid In Manhattan where JLo had to pretend to be a guest just to impress some dudeand Monte Carlo where Selena Gomez had to pretend to be a heiress who is ALSO played by Gomez. Do you see what I mean its like that Micheal Buble song Hollywood is OFFICIALLY DEAD.Bottom line if your looking for a cute teen flick to just sit back and enjoy Hilary Duff and seeing Rome then be my guest. For those who hate brainwashing teen flicks then avoid this one. Not the best Disney movie ever but still its pretty average.510".

But whatever it was I was in LOVE with Lizzie McGuire. To me she was this amazing girl who i could look up to who was always put together well who had 2 amazing friends who never had any problems that didn't get resolved in 30 minutes. I WAS A KID. So when i heard the series was ending I was heartbroken. And then I see a preview. A MOVIE?!?!? One more chance to see my favorite real TV star in action? THANK YOU GOD! So i went and i absolutely totally LOVES this movie. A couple of nights ago I'm flipping through channels and I happen to come across Disney channel. They're showing this movie. I decide What the heck? I loved it years ago. And I realized something. My mom must have unending patience considering how many times i made her sit through this movie with me. I couldn't believed I ever liked this movie. Its so cheesy its scary Lizzie looks like an idiot that one guy everyone has a crush on name? looks ugly as sin and Gordo... don't even get me started. Plus the entire time this figure as a little girl i had LOVED is acting like a total idiot. Why did i never notice? Lizzie is such a bimbo! Christ! I mean Gordo OBVIOUSLY likes her and the Spanish singer OBVIOUSLY is a lying bastard. And the ending? Just... wow...So I guess it all depends on your age. If your a little girl you're going to love this film more than likely. Older person? You will either hate it or laugh your ass off at the cheesyness of it.I'm rating a 6 purely for my old love.".

The first one I saw was Tokyo Story pet of film historians which disappointed me although I've later learned to love it like any other Ozu. After that came End of Summer and Late Spring which both floored me with both emotion and intellectual delight. Even after seeing it I can't stop thinking about Late Spring and now I'm ready to herald it as one of the greatest films I've ever seen.Late Spring perfectly encapsulates Ozu's one and only theme the inevitable sadness of life caused by change. It's a theme that never goes away. However hardly no one else than the Japanese were able to tell you about change in the 1940's. Mind you Ozu made his greatest films during a period when Japan became under the Western influence Coca Cola and baseball became commonplace industrialism and capitalism accelerated rapidly and the concept of a traditional Japanese family and society became to fall apart. Considering the value of traditional Japanese culture this change shouldn't be underestimated. Unlike Wim Wenders in his Ozu documentary Tokyoga Ozu's point of view in this matter isn't preachy however. What makes his films so fantastic in the end game is his sophisticated yet simpleminded philosophy of life change and sadness are both essential and inevitable in life and we have to accept it.Not that Late Spring isn't amazing when forgetting its context. Ozu's relentlessly formalist visual style his apparent here and both Chishu Ryu and Setsuko Hara deliver what are staggering performances. The film is brilliantly lyrical especially the ending which I consider one of the saddest and most touching movie endings aside Robert Bresson's Au hasard Balthasar the father Chishu Ryu returns to home from his daughter's wedding sits down to peel an apple but soon understands his loneliness and how inevitable it is. From here Ozu cuts to a simple shot of waves hitting shore without trying to underline or prove anything. The End. This is what movies are all about.".

The women of 1949 Japan had her mannerisms that we will probably find annoying.This is a difficult film for those who are not used to Eastern style of films. Especially ones from the 1940s.

	schema:reviewBody "Through an eBay auction I was so lucky to find a DVD of Yasujiro Ozu's Banshun Late Spring since it's not available yet in the US where I imagine it will be released some day through the Criterion Collection. This is how new viewers like myself have discovered the other two classic films of his Noriko trilogy 1951's Bakush Early Summer and 1953's Tokyo Monogatari Tokyo Story. This 1949 film is perhaps the most Japanese of the three as it concerns the rather unearthly devotion a daughter named Noriko has for her widowed professor father Shukichi. While an American film would have touched upon the incest angle under Ozu's immaculate direction there is nothing unseemly about the relationship. She thoroughly enjoys taking care of him but her father knows she must get married.A meddlesome aunt named Masa aggressively sets up an arranged marriage with a supposed Gary Cooperlookalike though we never see him. Noriko resists all efforts until Shukichi and Masa convince her that he is getting married to a woman she eyes with remorse at a Noh play. Noriko reluctantly agrees to marry but never really accepts the reasoning that she needs a husband. In a beautifully economic scene only Ozu could convey Shukichi peels an apple after the wedding and sadly bows his head to cry. Even though the later Tokyo Story deals with death this is the most emotionally naked of the trilogy as it is palpable how Noriko cannot truly succumb to the supposed joy of marriage.It's no wonder Setsuko Hara became a huge star in Japan with this film. She plays Noriko with a wellspring of emotion from scene to scene  headstrong petulant flirtatious the sliced pickle comment is pretty saucy blindly devoted masochistic and guardedly happy. Ozu gives her the full glamour treatment as well having the camera linger in a medium shot on her beautiful often smiling face for instance during the fanciful bike ride on the beach and the lengthy Noh play scene. Even though Hara plays three different characters in the trilogy all named Noriko it's fascinating to see how she seamlessly manages the evolution from highspirited daughter here to emancipated working woman choosing to marry on her terms in Early Summer to resigned widow lost in her solitude in Tokyo Story. She is memorable.Familiar Ozu regular Chishu Ryu gives his most sympathetic and accessible performance as Shukichi with a touch of appropriate absentmindedness. The rapport between the two feels genuine and it amazes me how they can be so convincing as fatherdaughter in one film and brothersister in the next. Another Ozu mainstay Haruko Sugimura excels at willful often irritating characters and her unrelenting portrayal of Masa exemplifies her unique talent. It's intriguing that Hara and Sugimura have an almost duplicate scene in both Late Spring and Early Summer where the older woman cajoles Noriko to marry  the actors play the scene with sweetness and surprise in the latter film whereas turmoil and regret fill a similar turning point in this one.There is some wonderful acting on the sidelines  the comically cherubic Masao Mishima as the unclean Mr. Onodera I love the scene where he keeps pointing in the wrong direction to get his bearings in Kamakura Jun Usami as Shukichi's assistant Hattori a seemingly perfect suitor for Noriko who turns out to be unavailable but not overly so and Yumeji Tsukioka as Noriko's worldly divorced best friend Aya. Note Aya's completely Western home ironically filmed at Ozu's typical tatamisitting eye level one of many interesting American touches in the film including the anachronistic use of Here Comes the Bride to introduce the wedding scene. The Kyoto sequence is particularly affecting with a fine use of real locations Kiyomizu Temple Imperial Palace and the moving scene when Noriko and Shukichi come to their mutual understanding of the future.This is said to be Ozu's personal favorite and I can understand why as the director tells a simple story with relatable truths and honest intensity even though the relationship is rather unusual by Western traditions. A holistic view of the Noriko trilogy shows Early Summer to be more comical and Tokyo Story more universally poignant but Late Spring is a gem all on its own. This DVD gratefully has English subtitles though the translation can be a bit sketchy at times. The print transfer is not pristine some scenes are overly dark but not as bad as I feared. There are no extras as I expect there will be once Criterion does decide to release this classic.".

The ending with the father left all alone is devastating it is difficult to express in words how the act of peeling an apple can be made to convey so much emotion but Ozu's mastery is such that he is able to make this gesture seem as earthshattering as the most specialeffects laden action climax.".

In Late Spring that description holds just barely as the characters belong to the extreme academic elite. I did a postdoc in Japan but didn't move in circles anywhere near that rarefied.Late Spring tells the story of a widowed father and his single daughter. The father a professor of considerable status is very much an iconoclast with a familiarity with foreign cultures that is deep and broad. The daughter at ease among her father's colleagues casually eats bread and bakes cakes herself. In many circumstances these behaviors surely precipitate hails of abuse faster than you can say Masao Miyamoto. Yet the father has not hardened into a simplistic contrarian or provocateur but shows a broadminded appreciation of the variety of things wanted from life and a farsighted sense of the effort needed to attain them.Although the daughter is growing a bit old for marriage she and her father have a comfortable and interesting relationship and they could easily go on for some time as they are.  Marriage would be an unpleasant disruption as the father is otherwise alone and the daughter not in love with anyone cannot expect to find a match as sophisticated and companionable.  But there is no future for her in remaining single.Like and in contrast to Spielberg's A.I. with its negative illustration that love entails a concern for the other's future Late Spring has a strong positive illustration of this  the father's love for the daughter is especially palpable.  The movie follows father and daughter feeling out things during the course of work at home and among friends.  While the plot is in one sense pedestrian in another sense this is a critical point in their lives and it is extremely dramatic not despite but because of the absence of false melodrama. And it is a pleasure to spend two hours observing these thoughtful and fully human characters.By most descriptions the father merely pretends to toy with the idea of remarrying so his daughter will let go and in fact plans to live out his days alone. But I don't see the father as having completely closed off the possibility. A marriage is arranged for the daughter one that strikes me as realistic and nice.  What does come poignantly to an end with the daughter's wedding is the life shared with her father.".

	schema:reviewBody "A typical Ozu film at its finest It is easy to state what Late Spring is not about it is not about a young woman trying nobly to sacrifice herself and her own happiness in order dutifully to serve her widowed father in his lonely old age. If Noriko resists the social pressures that compel her into marriage Ozu's comprehensive analysis of those pressures shows them convincingly to be ir resistible it is because she is thoroughly aware that she will never be as happy as she is within her present situation. The film precisely defines the choice that contemporary society postwar Japan with its conflicts between traditional values and Americanization offers her subordination to a husband in marriage or entrance into the emancipated world of alienated labour i.e. subordination as secretary to a male boss. The latter option is embodied in Noriko's best friend Aya a young woman so completely modernized that her legs get stiff if she has to sit on a tatami mat. Far from denouncing the breach with traditional values Ozu presents Aya with immense sympathy and good humour the emphasis being on the constraints of her situation. On the other hand traditional marriage is never presented in Ozu's films as in itself fulfilling and especially not for the woman Norikio's father informs her that her mother wept through most of the first years of their marriage.With her father Noriko has a freedom that she will never regain she can go bicycling by the sea with handsome young men visit sake bars with casual associates enjoy relatively unrestricted movement. And movement and its suppression is the film's key motif and structuring principle. The first half contains for Ozu an unusual amount of camera movement accompanying or parelleling Noriko's sense of enjoyment and exhilaration the train journey the bicycle ride. The last camera movement in the film occurs in the scene in the park where her father and aunt finalize plans for her marriage. The film then moves inexorably to Noriko's entrapment in an irreversible process her immobilization beneath the heavy traditional wedding costume and final obliteration the empty mirror that replaces any depiction of the wedding ceremony. The film's final shot of the sea is commonly interpreted in terms of Zenian resignation and acceptance Ozu once remarked that western critics don't understand his films so they always talk about Zen or something it can equally be read as a reminder of the bicycle ride and the lost freedom.".

The first half contains for Ozu an unusual amount of camera movement accompanying or parelleling Noriko's sense of enjoyment and exhilaration the train journey the bicycle ride. The last camera movement in the film occurs in the scene in the park where her father and aunt finalize plans for her marriage. The film then moves inexorably to Noriko's entrapment in an irreversible process her immobilization beneath the heavy traditional wedding costume and final obliteration the empty mirror that replaces any depiction of the wedding ceremony. The film's final shot of the sea is commonly interpreted in terms of Zenian resignation and acceptance Ozu once remarked that western critics don't understand his films so they always talk about Zen or something it can equally be read as a reminder of the bicycle ride and the lost freedom.";

I am still amazed at the level of intensity of feelings reached in this film with apparently so little effects. I also discovered Setsuko Hara in that film and I was hooked from that unforgettable moment when her smile fades from her face on hearing her aunt mention the possible remarriage of her father. Ozu's films made me discovered a new way of filming people and their relationships to each other. For instance the often mentioned low camera position he used emphasizes the feet of his actors and makes the viewer aware of the different footsteps of each character Setsuko Hara's feet for instance seem to dance barely touching the mattatami. We thus experience a perspective on the human body different from western films which tends to focus on the upper part of the body and make little case of feet. I think Ozu's films are a striking example of the possibility to reach out to a distant viewer both in space and in time while remaining rooted in its specific culture without concessions.".

	schema:headline " wonderful family drama in postwar Japan";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the first film by Ozo that I have seen and it's a revelation. I have the feeling that I entered a new world which I am eager to explore further.The film is made in 1949 four years after the defeat of Japan but there are no ruins in sight on the contrary landscapes are proper and well maintained homes are clean and nothing seems to be missing people live their lives in a way that seems to go on for centuries. The American presence is just hinted by a CocaCola sign or English inscriptions at train stations. Maybe a political statement by Ozu about the perennial continuity of the Japanese civilization despite the destruction Japan had just gone through.The war is also hardly remembered and hidden back in the past. We learn that the principal hero Noriko wonderfully acted by Ozu's preferred actress of the period Setsuko Hara was interned in a labor camp during the war but nothing in her demeanor and certainly not her radiant smile lets anybody feel about her suffering. She loves being at home and taking care of her father Chishu Ryu another favorite actor of Ozu with a devotion that is troubled only by the insistence of the family to get her married as social customs demand for a young woman of her age. Eventually she will be curved into accepting a marriage arrangement under pressure by her caring aunt and by her father who would make anything to have her happy but only according to the customs and their own conceptions.It's wonderful to watch how this delicate family drama is being filmed with a taste and aesthetic balance that makes of each scene a masterpiece worth being seen for its own. Ozu is also a master of using soundtrack and his matching of visuals and sound sometimes equally effective in creating emotion reminds the use that Hitchcock makes of music in his films.There is a lot of symbolism in this movie and I certainly have lost some of the more subtle messages because of my lack of familiarity with Japanese customs and culture. And yet this film is at the same time simple as well as modern and universal in look we can resonate with the characters and I had less difficulty in understanding their emotions than in many other Japanese or Far East movies seen through the perspective of my 'western' eyes. At the same time the film has a wonderful human dimension we can see on screen a story of love and affection between two people who need and are willing to make a huge sacrifice in order for the other one to be happy. This combination of emotions simplicity and art cinema makes of this movie a real treat.".

While I have seen and reviewed several other of director Ozu's films this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. Most of this is NOT because of the plot as the plot itself is very very simple. Instead the masterful way in which the film is constructed is highly reminiscent of a Japanese paintingone that is neither hurried nor unreal in any way. The story is a touching and lovely look at the relationship between a 56 yearold father and his unmarried daughter and it takes a very slow and gorgeous journey. Many of the best scenes are the quiet moments at home between the two leads or their friendsas the relationships seem so real and natural. In most films superhuman and extraordinary people are featured whereas in this one the basic humanity and beauty of average decent people is the focus. And while this description may sound awfully dull it certainly isn'tespecially since so many of the moments in the film are incredibly touching and honest.The main plot line involves the happy man and his daughter living contented lives with each other in postwar Japan. While the father is a widow and he had no other children he appears to be a genuinely happy and kind man. The daughter is also very content with their life and sees no need to marry. However outside forces friends as well as a meddling aunt push themtrying to get the girl married despite her objections. And after a short time the father too begins to feel this is for the besteven though it will mean losing the most precious person in his life. This struggle is just amazing to watch and is dealt with so honestly and beautifully that I strongly recommend you see this film. An amazing film you just need to see for yourselfjust don't be put off by its slow paceit's all part of the overall artistry of Ozu.".

No matter how poorly I accomplish this task I expect that reading this review will still be more interesting and entertaining than watching the film! Indeed boring is the most apt adjective to describe this trite work of cinema.On the positive side the film portrays a historically interesting social context postwar japan a time when the old clashes with the new and the influence of the US is felt throughout. However it lacks not only enough density of interesting information but also depth. With regards to the storyThe main plot tells us of a 27yearold girl and how she becomes mildly sad because of the marriage her caretakers arrange for her. You will see the occasional cocacola sign and baseball reference signaling postwar USA presence and some circumstantial evidence that timesarechanging in Japan e.g. her uncle is divorced her girlfriend works as a secretary for a living. And there will also be the occasional scene showing us how change comes slowly such as a traditional Japanese theater or the main plot theme. The two provide a nice oldvsnew theme to the whole movie which might be really nice if it was well executed.Unfortunately the events are presented in a sparse disconnected whole. Most characters particularly female characters fluctuate between shallow and histrionic. Several of the characters such as her cousin or the professor's assistant are disposable and serve little purpose other than to fill the movie with distractions I wouldn't write this if only the scenes in which these characters appear were significant or even just beautiful but they are not. It is not that the story is bad  I think that the same story could possibly make a great movie  it is simply that it is badly told.With regards to the shooting There are some beautiful scenes. These are mostly indoor scenes but also the theater scene and one or two outdoor scenes. But it is hard to make nature look pretty in black and white and the cinematographer was no Yusov. However the various dull poorly chosen poorly filmed outdoor scenes go on forever.The acting is not worth mentioning. The actors were not given difficult roles but they were not up to playing even those. Occasionally I got the feeling that the actor was reciting his lines esp. the father or that the actor was overplaying them esp. the girlfriend.Overall it makes for an extremely dull piece of cinema.

	schema:headline " Great film";
	schema:reviewBody "If one were to think of an equivalent to the film style of director Yasujiro Ozu it would have to be long novels suffused with detail but never superfluous detail. Books such as Herman Melville's MobyDick with its descriptions of the whaling industry and vessels John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath with its detailed rendering of the lives of migrant workers and especially Betty Smith's A Tree Grows In Brooklyn with its childlike view of a world that overwhelms fresh senses come to mind even though the film checks in at a midlength range of an hour and fortyeight minutes. Ozu's cinema is utterly shorn of melodrama for all that occurs within its frames advances some aspect of narrative character development or social commentary. Yet some of the most affecting scenes in the whole of his 1949 film Late Spring Banshun are realistic shots of toenail clippings or apple peels designed to allow the viewer to feel they are intruding in on the reality of the characters. Then there are seemingly throwaway details that also lend authenticity such as when a meter reader from the electric company comes and requires a stool to read the meter. It has nothing to do with the tale nor symbolism but immediately 'realizes' the situation for most viewers especially when a more important character has to get the stool for the ephemeral character.This film not only was a change in technique and tenor for Ozu from more socially blunt works but marked the beginning of the final phase of Ozu's long career where his focus became almost exclusively the Japanese family unit in the postwar transition years and his camera movement started to become more and more static with every film released. The film was penned by Ozu and longtime collaborator Kgo Noda from a novel called Father And Daughter by Kazuo Hirotsu. The very naturalistic style of the screenplay and camera work lends an air of realism to Ozu's style that has often been compared to Italian NeoRealism of the same era although Ozu's work from this era was never as overtly political as that of the Italian filmmakers. The film follows the life of an aging father a professor Shukichi Somiya Chishu Ryu and his twentyseven year old daughter Noriko Setsuko Hara who still lives at home. Worried over her ending up alone and prodded on by Noriko's aunt Masa Taguchi Haruko Sugimura sister of Shukichi or his wife it's never delineated he tries to push his daughter out of the nest and into marital bliss. We never learn what happened to the wife and mother of the household but we can guess she was killed in the war. We do learn that Noriko was in a labor camp and was very ill and skinny but has now gotten healthy and plump according to one of Shukichi's Academic colleagues Jo Onodera Masao Mishima whose remarriage Noriko deems distasteful and filthy. Onodera is a jovial man and merely one of many who seems to obsess on Noriko's marital status. What makes Late Spring a great film is that like great classic novels it is never preachy nor condescending but involving. Think of the great novels I compared it to and then think of the crap put out in recent years by big name authors such as Joyce Carol Oates T.C. Boyle or Toni Morrison and then think of this film and preachy PC films like Brokeback Mountain or Crash and the comparative difference is manifest. Late Spring can be political when a character takes up an empty seat with his belongings or when Hara forces a smile. One need not have a character stick his tongue down another male character's throat nor his fingers between a female characters' leg to denote the political stance of the film and filmmaker.Then there are the terrific technical cinematographic aspects of the film by Yuharu Atsuta such as Ozu's patented low angle shots eyeline mismatches limited camera movement such as when Noriko and Hattori go biking yet it seems as if the world moves by them not the other way around the lack of interstitial fades and dissolves as well as narrative devices such as ellipses as when we see Noriko's devastation at her father's supposed remarriage and then transition to her seemingly positive and happy reaction to meeting 'Gary Cooper' and transition shots of unidentified locations to link themes and elided time intervals. In many ways the camera of Ozu frames life similarly to that of Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer or the great Dutch painting masters where space the tension built by spare movement and the relative positioning of characters is all important. Ozu has tritely been labeled the most Japanese of all directors by lazy critics as opposed to his two great contemporaries Kenji Mizoguchi and the far more famous Akira Kurosawa both of whose reputations were made with historical dramas but Ozu is actually the most modern of all the classic directors from Japan and probably the most Western if not in approach then in attitude. Late Spring shows this to be true and considering that the film was a distinct reinvention of the man's art its success is all the more noteworthy. It's akin to a minor dime store novelist from the late 19th Century all of a sudden morphing into Mark Twain. Were most midlife crises handled as ably nay greatly as this the work of such an artist as Yasujiro Ozu would not be needed to illumine the problem. It almost makes one wish for the human race to be continued to be plagued with ills for only then will the relevance of such artistic rendering still be appreciated right along with the greatest of novels and novelists.And the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.".

One need not have a character stick his tongue down another male character's throat nor his fingers between a female characters' leg to denote the political stance of the film and filmmaker.Then there are the terrific technical cinematographic aspects of the film by Yuharu Atsuta such as Ozu's patented low angle shots eyeline mismatches limited camera movement such as when Noriko and Hattori go biking yet it seems as if the world moves by them not the other way around the lack of interstitial fades and dissolves as well as narrative devices such as ellipses as when we see Noriko's devastation at her father's supposed remarriage and then transition to her seemingly positive and happy reaction to meeting 'Gary Cooper' and transition shots of unidentified locations to link themes and elided time intervals. In many ways the camera of Ozu frames life similarly to that of Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer or the great Dutch painting masters where space the tension built by spare movement and the relative positioning of characters is all important. Ozu has tritely been labeled the most Japanese of all directors by lazy critics as opposed to his two great contemporaries Kenji Mizoguchi and the far more famous Akira Kurosawa both of whose reputations were made with historical dramas but Ozu is actually the most modern of all the classic directors from Japan and probably the most Western if not in approach then in attitude. Late Spring shows this to be true and considering that the film was a distinct reinvention of the man's art its success is all the more noteworthy. It's akin to a minor dime store novelist from the late 19th Century all of a sudden morphing into Mark Twain. Were most midlife crises handled as ably nay greatly as this the work of such an artist as Yasujiro Ozu would not be needed to illumine the problem. It almost makes one wish for the human race to be continued to be plagued with ills for only then will the relevance of such artistic rendering still be appreciated right along with the greatest of novels and novelists.And the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Noriko Trilogy as some call it comprises arguably Ozu's three best known films Late Spring 1949 Early Summer 1951 and Tokyo Story 1953 all with a key character in some case THE key character named Noriko.Tokyo Story was first introduced to the Western world nine years after Yasujiro Ozu's 19031963 death as both the late Roger Ebert and the New York Times film critic not sure if his name means much to today's movie fans or whether he is the late or not sounded a little embarrassed and apologetic in their respective reviews published in 1972. Today Tokyo Story has a place in any alltime top ten list anywhere in the world.The three Norikos all played by Japan's eternal screen goddess Setsuko Hara 19202015 living a long life but resolutely left the movie industry soon after her mentor Ozu's death are very different characters. Noriko in Tokyo Story is a widow. The Norikos in Late Spring and Early Summer superficially appear to be quite similar in being a daughter at the age to be married off some likens the plot line to Jane Austin's. They are however very different. As I watched the Noriko Trilogy backwards chronologically I am going to focus on Late Spring which I watched just recently. For background to facilitate comparison here is my IMDb posting on Early Summerhttpwww.imdb.comtitlett0043313reviews27 Late Spring is very much the intimate story between father and daughter and immediately brings to mind more recent works such as Poppoya 1999 where Ryoko Hirosue and Ken Takakura play daughter and father Hana to Airsu 2004 and Flowers 2010. In the latter two the fatheranddaughter story plays only a small part in the multiplotline film. In both the daughter is portrayed by Yu Aoi who also plays Noriko in Tokyo Family 2013 Yoji Yamada's remake of Tokyo Story in tribute to Ozu. In Toyko Family however Noriko is an entirely different character but Yamada cleverly attributed some of the dialogues of the original Noriko to her.Enough too much in fact background. With apologies I shall now really focus on Late Spring. In Ozu's unhurried pace we see the gentle blissful life of Noriko and her widower father an academic in which her remaining unmarried is just a minor issue. Her father's gentle nudge is laughed away when she tells him that this potential perfect candidate a student of his that is on very friendly terms with her is in fact engaged to be married soon to another woman. As well her buddy a recent divorce seems to be a perfect argument for Noriko that marriages are not made in heaven.Then dark undercurrents gradually surfaces in the father's apparent intention to remarry. Noriko's reaction not in words but in facial expression is bitter. This development in any event has the effect of having her argument for not marrying swept from under her feet. The bridegroom by all accounts he never materializes on screen is a heavensent match. The final revelation to the audience only is that the father lied to her to make sure that she does not sacrifice her life and happiness caring for him. The closing scene is much talked about the father alone in the house peeling an apple for himself.I don't think written words can do justice to the richness and depth of emotions carried by Ozu's minimalist style.".

	schema:reviewBody "Noriko is twenty seven and perfectly content in dutifully serving his father in the domestic household. This is an affront to Aunt Masa who is of the opinion that a woman of her age is much too old to be staying at home cooking and cleaning and resolves to set her up for dating and eventually well a little quicker than that marriage. For Aunt Masa this is not just a personal crisis but a cultural one she represent the traditional past in which Noriko's rightful place is in the domestic sphere but alongside her own husband instead of her ageing father. Late Spring engages with this cultural clash borne out of the modernity of postwar Japan. The previous year a law had passed to allow those over twenty to seek marriage without the consent of their parents. Remarrying and divorce are key actions expressed within the film. And yet for Shukichi it is not a matter of parental permission given to Noriko it is vital that he trick her into marriage rather than allow her to do so via his patriarchal authority. For Shukichi marriage is not so much a means to further his own lineage as tradition states but an opportunity to birth new love and life. Ironically his daughter has the opposing view she begs forgiveness for even entertaining the idea of enjoying another man's company and leaving his home and is offended by the thought of him remarrying. Yoshiyasu Hamamura without a single word spoken makes this clear in his editing.Late Spring navigates the Japanese home with the utmost attention to geometry and the intimacy within those spaces. Amongst the tea parties the Noh performances the grooves of the pagodas and the meditative zen gardens the characters are locked in the most rigid of compositions in the domestic sphere. Ozu is infamous for his lack of camera movement  one prominent effect of this being that the compositions are never marred and retain their full force throughout the shot A similar way in how Kubrick zoomed rather than tracked in Barry Lyndon. Even if a scene calls for the camera to move Ozu is steadfast in his compositional rigidity in the bicycle ride scene the camera follows Setsuko Hara smoothly maintaining the confines of the frame and suspending her beaming face aloft in the air with a bizarre daydreamlike quality. Most of the time it is placed right next to the characters as if it was another person kneeling on the tatami mats itself. The flat perfectly symmetrical POV head shots thrusts us into the intimacies of their conversations immediately. Ozu is less concerned with logical sequencing than he is with letting the image and actors speak for themselves. At times he will simply linger and let the natural ticking of the clock prolong our patience and make the mundane a closed door an empty room agonising. Late into the film there is an insert of simply a vase but when we cut back to Noriko tears are streaming down her face. This seems to me and it has been highly contested to be the perfect crystallisation of the still unmoving life in which she yearns to linger in just a while longer. But she is twenty seven. Setsuko Hara steals much of the spotlight. How could she not with her beaming radiant smile sharply accentuated nose and wide eyes that flutter when she laughs and leak when she begs forgiveness from her father. She is so content to be the housewife or housedaughter that when circumstances force a change in her lifestyle you can visually see the color drain from her face and her features crease up. Ozu at times uses the camera as a feeble attempt to shield these fragile emotions. A heartbreaking scene sees Noriko suddenly decide she has 'other plans' and scurry away across the other side of the road away from her father where they both then continue to walk along this mimicry of form was used more than once by Ozu. We do not see her face but we can guess what is streaming down it it also causes us to reevaluate every breaming smile she has flashed. Another effect is a momentary pause in Shukichi's stride for just a slight moment  perhaps he has finally been convinced that his daughter can no longer be shackled to his home. There are many of these moments in Late Spring. The ending is often talked of but I think the climax of the film's emotions comes earlier. Shukichi has up to that point uttered dialogue mostly consisting of quiet affirmations and modest little Ums and Ahs with his bowed head. But he sees his daughter's hesitation at leaving the household and being married off and slowly and softly begins a monologue that recalls his own marriage. The late wife and mother was not always happy initially but the two worked hard together and found happiness and a life to share. It is not only his blessing for Noriko but also an open acknowledgement of the changing times and values the two marriages have begun in different conditions and she has a chance that he never had. For me the power of the film lies here not only does it heartwrenchingly encapsulate the painful truth of growing up from the father's perspective but it also casts shade on the rather impromptu decision to wed the widow Miwa. We can gleam such an ageold and tested relationship that appears between the cracks even after one of them has passed on and the father too wants his daughter to experience this. I think we can guess from this scene that he never had any intention of marrying Miwa but simply wants the best for Noriko. The speech makes his character whole and utterly unselfish.".

	schema:reviewBody "After having seen and loving Tokyo Story a film which is widely considered to be not only master Japanese filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu's best film but also one of the greatest films ever made I was very eager to see more. Many consider Late Spring another of his absolute best works and I can happily say that it most definitely met my very high expectations. As with Tokyo Story this a deep masterfullyexecuted and penetrating film examining family life in Japan and the societal and generational pressures which shape it.As with Tokyo Story we enter this tale of father Shukichi Somiya and daughter Noriko Somiya in the middle. 27yearold Noriko lives together with her father and they appear to be very close. Naturally questions begin to arise in the mind of the viewer where is Noriko's mother and why hasn't she ever married? Ozu does a fantastic job of coaxing these questions out in the film's early stages and gives us hints at what has transpired but never spoon feeds us by explicitly explaining the backstory. We learn that Noriko had been seriously ill at one point during a period of war and hardship but has since recovered. Her mother is a mystery for much of the film but it slowly becomes clear that she has died and that Shukichi is a widower. With this context the film examines the fatherdaughter relationship between Noriko and Shukichi and the pressures on them both to have Noriko finally marry and leave the nest so to speak.The strength of this film and Tokyo Story alike is how subtly and effectively it tells this story. The screenplay and pacing of the film are phenomenal in slowly and carefully peeling back the layers of the family dynamic. Throughout the film we question the actions and underlying motivations of each of the characters. By the end the full vision snaps into focus and we are left with a melancholy ending that really sneaks up and packs quite an emotional punch.Let's begin with Noriko. For the length of the movie she is adamantly against marriage especially remarriage. As the details of the backstory filter in her reasoning begins to become clear. Noriko lost her mother which has obviously affected her very much. As a result she is very close with her father and wary of leaving him behind. Her mother's death obviously must have been very hard for her father as well and she references the fact that he needs her to take care of him. She feels that she must be there for him because she fears he may be lonely if she leaves and won't be able to cope as a widower. She is also understandably protective of her father  she is afraid to lose him like she did her mother. Thus she can't bear the thought of him ever remarrying which in her mind could potentially jeopardize their relationship. As the film progresses though pressures on Noriko to get married come from all sides  her aunt father and best friend and ironically divorce all urging her that she must take this long overdue and necessary step. To her the relationship she has with her father is more than enough and brings her contentment. However she is made to feel like she is being selfish in staying home with him especially when it is suggested that he wishes to remarry. Thus she eventually gives into these pressures and marries at the end of the film but is clearly devastated and unhappy with her choice.Shukichi can be analyzed in the same way. He seems to be very happy with his daughter home and with the lives they are leading together. It isn't until his sister Masa makes the observation that Noriko has gone far too long without marrying that he begins to question things. He too begins to pressure Noriko that she must marry and begins to insinuate that he wishes to remarry as well and that she need not worry about taking care of him. Many conversations seem to have taken place between Shukichi and Masa offscreen as at the end of the movie it is revealed that Shukichi's plans for remarriage were fabricated by both he and Masa in order to influence Noriko in her decision. Shukuchi feigns happiness at Noriko's wedding as does Noriko quite poorly but at the end of the film we see him return home to his empty house in a devastating scene where his true distress becomes apparent. In this moment the movie strikes a powerful note as we realize neither Noriko nor Shukichi wanted for this marriage to happen and neither are happy with the outcome. They were both made to feel selfish by others around them  Shukichi for keeping Noriko home so long with him and Noriko for keeping her father from remarrying. In reality neither of these two things are true but the characters are made to believe them through the pressures of their family and friends. Now they find themselves in places that neither of them wanted or needed but that society has deemed correct for them. It's a poignant and thoughtful tale which is marvelously achieved by the strength of spectacular direction and acting. Setsuko Hara is absolutely radiant and Noriko. She shines in every single scene and has such an effortless quality to her acting that makes her every move feel completely natural. Chish Ry as Shukichi is equally brilliant as a caring father who is conflicted between keeping his daughter by his side and shooing her out the door to a more socially acceptable life. And everything of course is tied together by Ozu's absolutely masterful direction which makes for a film that is deep thoughtprovoking and emotionally resonant.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is one of those strange coincidences that occur in life that on the very day the passing of Japanese acting legend Setsuko Hara is announced the world premiere of the digital restoration of one of her greatest films Late Spring happens at MOMA in New York.The restoration is a godsend to those who have seen this film only in poor quality circulating prints. There is no more flicker no more warpage. One of Yasujiro Ozu's greatest achievements now looks the part.Words cannot do justice to the magnificence of Setsuko Hara's performance as Noriko. Her face and eyes convey her inner torment as her perfect existence is shattered by society's and her reluctant father's demand that she marry.Near the end Noriko is shown in a mirror in her wedding kimono. Her smile never wavers but her eyes reveal her despair. Hara's work here is one of the few performances to rival Falconetti's in Dreyer's La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc.But Ozu does not neglect Chishu Ryu whose last scene is heartbreaking.This film is a minimalist Vertigo.

	onyx:emotionText "It is one of those strange coincidences that occur in life that on the very day the passing of Japanese acting legend Setsuko Hara is announced the world premiere of the digital restoration of one of her greatest films Late Spring happens at MOMA in New York.The restoration is a godsend to those who have seen this film only in poor quality circulating prints. There is no more flicker no more warpage. One of Yasujiro Ozu's greatest achievements now looks the part.Words cannot do justice to the magnificence of Setsuko Hara's performance as Noriko. Her face and eyes convey her inner torment as her perfect existence is shattered by society's and her reluctant father's demand that she marry.Near the end Noriko is shown in a mirror in her wedding kimono. Her smile never wavers but her eyes reveal her despair. Hara's work here is one of the few performances to rival Falconetti's in Dreyer's La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc.But Ozu does not neglect Chishu Ryu whose last scene is heartbreaking.This film is a minimalist Vertigo. That is to say it's one of the greatest films ever made.";

We'll be seeing re runs of Friend for years to come. I think that will remain the Jennifer Aniston that everyone knows and likes.";

The movie was fast and edge of the seat almost from the start. I found some parts predictable but that didn't ruin the movie for me. Some of the things that I predicted happened but not when and how so it still keeps you guessing. I buy a lot of DVD's and this movie is going on my list of movies to buy for sure.

Well Charles Schine gets an offer he can't refuse. When the beautiful and sexy Lucinda Harris offers to pay his fare he is grateful for it. Promising to return the money he becomes restless as he remembers about the angel that saved him.Charles Schine lives in a suburb of Chicago. His pretty wife Deanna is a school teacher. They have a teen aged daughter who suffers from diabetes. Both have nice jobs but they are by no means rich. Charles makes a mistake when he goes after the kind woman who rescued him in the train Lucinda Harris. She is a financial adviser who works for a prestigious firm. Unfortunately the sexual attraction for Lucinda gets the best of Charles. A sad mistake!When Lucinda decides to spend time with Charles they end up in a somewhat seedy hotel. Lucinda has refused several well known ones from the taxi ride because her husband might see them. After they begin making love a guy breaks in the room. This guy wants to rob them but he has more in mind. Charles is hurt badly and Lucinda was raped. He suggests calling the police but Lucinda declines citing how she can't create a scandal. The attacker doesn't take long to contact Charles to demand money from him in order to keep quiet. This menacing guy LaRoche wants more and more. Charles realizes he can't keep meeting his demands but takes money that has been marked for Amy's possible kidney operation. With the help of a former inmate now working in his office Charles puts a plan in action but it backfires on him. What can he do? He is really trapped and must keep on paying in order to get LaRoche away from him and his family.Mikael Hafstrom a talented Swedish director making his Hollywoodd debut directs Stuart Beattie's adaptation of James Siegel thriller. The film while vilified by most comments in this forum offers some interesting points. It's not as bad a film as some people make it out to be. Of course in a way the ending is not satisfactory. We have been presented a weak Charles Schine who's supposed to be an intelligent man. Yet Charles takes the easy way out yielding to the brutish LaRoche who's gotten the best of him. Charles Schine never have cheated on his wife but the sexual Lucinda Harris makes him lose his head and his dignity even if their affair is short lived.Another thing that doesn't work quite as well in the film is the Lucinda Harris as portrayed by Jennifer Aniston. As a femme fatale this actress seems to have been miscast. She is much too wholesome and pretty to project malice. There is a problem of credibility as to why Charles Schine who would have taken an earlier train happens to be in the one that Lucinda Harris is riding. She is by no means in the same category of a Barbara Stanwyck or even Glen Close although her work in the film is more than adequate. Also the ending kept reminding us of the Richard Gere's character in Unfaithful and it appears to reaffirm that yes crime does pay just don't get caught!Clive Owen a good actor is seen as Charles Schine the spineless man who tries to pay his blackmailer in order to keep him away. Jennifer Aniston's Lucinda is another story as noted before. Vincent Cassel has done his share of creeps in other European movies. Melissa George who plays Deanna is only seen briefly. Tom Conti a great actor who is not seen too often these days has a couple of good moments although one would have liked to have seen him more. Giancarlo Esposito comes only at the end as a Chicago detective investigating Winston's death.The film was beautifully photographed by Peter Biziou who shows us some Chicago views. Ed Shearmur's music plays well in the context of the film. One could only wish better material for Mikael Hafstrom on his next film.".

No way. Meanwhile Jennifer Aniston's character has no protection other than these assumptions. Once the scam has started she has to sit at an office pretending to be someone she is not and where the victim knows where to find her for days even weeks. She must have spent every day sweating. When the victim came to see her it would only have taken one coworker to call her by her real name and the scam would have been up.

The crook always fronts you a few bucks to make you think they're good people. Second they both could have gone to the police and asked that their spouses not be told. It happens all the time. The mere fact that she wouldn't even go to the police and talk to them...she didn't have to file the report...that made me suspicious. At the point he was conned for 20K why didn't he get a policeman to follow him or get a wire? Nobody would be so stupid. I tell you this has got to be Jennifer Aniston's best comedy yet. Hard to believe that Hollywood thinks this garbage is worthy of a budget. I've seen more compelling porn in my life. If I wrote this piece of crap I would change my name. In fact I'll issue a challenge to every studio head producer out there I can write a better thriller than this in 1 month's time. This is about as compelling as IMDb's threat to add you to a blacklist if you don't point out spoilers...OHHHHH I'm scared...".

	schema:headline " Fatal attraction Redux";
	schema:reviewBody "Derailed is being advertised as Jennifer Aniston's big breakout role since the breakup with Brad Pitt. This film should be advertised as another Fatal Attraction or you reap what you sew.The set up for this film is very much like the Adrian Lynne film from 1987 where you have a chance meeting between a beautiful woman Aniston on a train and an unhappy married man Clive Owen with a young sick daughter. The two of them hook up in a seedy hotel and get mugged by a thug. When the thug threatens Owen for money after the fact everything snowballs into disaster.The first reel of Derailed is very good. This guy just gets in deeper and deeper and the more he tries to handle things himself the worse he makes things. It's obvious he should've gone to the police but Aniston's character says no and he can't resist those beady little eyes. Clive Owen's mistakes begin to get frustrating to watch. The second reel is more of a thriller and when more things unfold the film gets more and more interesting. It also gets more convoluted as the film goes on.This movie is loaded with problems. The two leads are very good but it's hard to believe that Owen's wife would put up with a lot of the nonsense that he pulls to save his skin. Aniston cast against type is also very believable in her role. She handles her toughest scene well. My issues are with the believability of the story and with many of the things going on with the leads. There is also a tacked on ending that simply does not belong. They added it because it seems that every movie these days needs to have a twist.This movie succeeds only on the level of the performances and the effectiveness of the tension in many scenes. It's got a lot of edge of your seat moments but afterwords when you think about whats happened in the film you'll be scratching your head. It's certainly entertaining though and worth a look on DVD. 12".

Unfortunately instead it's only reference because Derailed turns out to be one of the most predictable unthrilling noir movies to hit theaters in a long while.There's nothing surprising about Beattie's script. Seconds after Charles gets on the commuter train you know exactly how this film is going to unwind. Once again here is a Hollywood movie that is so utterly predictable that the audience instead of being spun in various directions by a twisty plot figures out the whole endeavor in minutes and then just bides time waiting for the characters on screen to do the same.The plot follows all the expected points in such a mystery. It never once manages to do something novel slightly different just to keep us edge. No Beattie and Hfstrm seem quite content to just unravel this bythenumbers.Owen's good in his role but he's better than this awful material and he's been in thrillers that are vastly superior to this one. Aniston has proved she is more than just Rachel on Friends. She was terrific in The Good Girl 2002. She's a good actress but she's not exactly femme fatale material. At least not yet. And this story needs a genuine femme fatale. Honestly Aniston's Lucinda Harris would've been eaten alive by the likes of Barbara Stanwyck's Phyllis Dietrichson in Double Indemnity 1944 Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy in The Maltese Falcon 1941 or Jane Greer's Kathie Moffat in Out of the Past 1947.This isn't bad noir. It's worse. This is dull noir. There really is no use twisting a plot when the audience knows them 30 minutes before they happen. Where's the thrill in that?What's ultimately surprising about Derailed is that somehow the makers managed to talk Owen and Aniston into being in it.".

What that means is that it wasn't a final version but very close to it. Well I must say I was eager to place Owen into contention for an Oscar nomination after last year popular Closer. I'm sorry to say that he is out and it's due to the poor predictable script.The story was very underdeveloped and a bit unrealistic but the performances of Owen Aniston and Vincent Cassel kept the film moving. This movie was Unfaithful meets Matchstick Men meets Reindeer Games. I would recommend the film for a good popcorn flick but in terms of Oscar I would take it out of the game. Owen captures the nature of his character but flops in terms of staying in the location meaning his American accent. Although he is truly the hero of the story and you love the character. He got a couple of claps during the film. Aniston gives a very different performance than what we're used to but it works. She's very talented and I would love to see her nominated in the next coming years.The standout of the cast is Vincent Cassel who's villainous dark performance will go down in the books as one of the greatest villainous performances in the past years. He truly makes you hate him and you leave with a feeling in your stomach from him on screen. The worst part of the entire film was the terrible musical score which is very distracting and annoying but hopefully with better editing they'll get rid of it and hire someone new. Soso script and good performances make a pretty decent flick.".

Unfortunately the movie is very bland and very predictable. It has a very interesting style to it but it has very little substance to support it. First the most obvious flaw is that the film is predictable and without any suspense the film is kind of dull and pointless. What's the point of making a thriller if you're not going to surprise your audience? Or at least keep them guessing a little? Second the movie is completely unrealistic and a lot of the scenes are over the top. Whether or not that was the intention is unclear but a lot of the scenes were pretty ridiculous. Third the lead character was kind of unlikable. Even though he had a sick daughter and he needed the money it was a little hard to feel sorry for him since he was unfaithful and he was still protecting this woman he hardly knew.The acting could have been a lot better and one performance really brought down the movie. Jennifer Aniston may be good on Friends but she is horrible in Derailed. Her performance is so unconvincing that she seems to be reading her lines off a cue card or something. She also isn't very appealing so I don't understand why Clive Owen would cheat on his wife with her. Clive Owen actually gave a good performance and he was pretty convincing. Vincent Cassel was great as the bad guy though he was a little over the top at times. Xzibit was terrible and his character was kind of pointless. Melissa George was okay but she was underused.There were some good things about the movie though. The scenes with just Clive and Vincent were actually pretty entertaining to watch. Some of the performances were good as well and the last scene was also nicely done. The film could have been a little better if Jennifer Aniston wasn't involved but the script and the direction were also weak so there would have to be a lot of retooling to get the film really rolling. In the end this bland thriller is better left on the shelf. Rating 410".

A little known fact about the film is that the actual campaign manager David Wilhelm refused to participate in it. He didn't like the idea of a camera crew roaming the headquarters and recording conversations that he felt should have been private. Clinton overruled him of course. As a result the documentary skews history a bit. The nuts and bolts of running a campaign are ignored while the craft of spin doctoring is glorified. In a visual medium that's not altogether surprising and it may even have been unavoidable. But the misrepresentation  or rather the selective representation  has had the unintended consequence of contributing to public cynicism about political campaigns which now appear to be all about the spin the framing  the very things that make voters feel like they're being manipulated. Perhaps a stronger emphasis on the heavy lifting of doortodoor canvassing phone banking meetings with interest groups outreach to local officials event setup and the like would have given a more complete picture. Then again those aren't exactly telegenic activities and documentary filmmakers may have been hardpressed to incorporate them even if Wilhelm had cooperated.

However I think the film misses a few point where it could focus on the actual strategies being made but it chooses more to focus on the people making the strategies. It gives an interesting look into the reality of the campaign but leaves the overall strategies left mostly unexplained. Still a good film though enjoyed it a lot.

The audience bursts into prolonged applause. Fonda rises to his feet and remarks There will now follow four minutes and thirty seconds of a carefully choreographed spontaneous demonstration or something like that. The scene was evidently intended to instruct the audience that not everything in a presidential campaign or by extension in politics is what it seems. We've come a long way baby. That audience is now a LOT more  well either sophisticated or cynical depending on your view of human nature.The War Room covers the Democratic side of the 1992 presidential campaign and election in which you'll remember Bill Clinton was pitted against George Herbert Walker Bush and Ross Perot. Kids  Clinton won.Some of the calculation that went on in the war room the collective name for Clinton's campaign staff presided over by James Carville and George Stephanopoulis surprised even me. I'll give one example with rough quotes.Carville is sitting around with his dozen or so coconspirators and one of them brings up the idea of flooding the floor at the Democratic convention with signs in favor of gun control. We've only got twelve hours somebody says so where are we going to get signs? Can't we get the people to print the signs themselves? Somebody says No no. That way you're going to get a scattered couple of signs. Some will be red on white other will be white on blue. It will send a mixed message. I just don't think it will have the same impact as a whole SEA of identical signs all over the floor. They're talking about this problem as if they're trying to solve it for the delegates and visitors on the floor of Madison Square Garden  just being helpful you know?  whereas the WHOLE THING is their own idea! For all they know there may not be a single guncontrol thought among the multitude of Clinton supporters let alone enough to create a sea of signs! They carry on in the same way about most of the issues of the time and most of the current events. Bush's campaign is having its posters printed in Brazil. Can this fact somehow be turned against them? Not that the other side is virgin pure. Stephanopoulis has to deal with someone on the phone evidently a journalist inquiring about a rumor that Clinton has had a child by a black prostitute. Curiously similar to the rumor circulated about McCain when he opposed Bush during the 2004 primaries. In McCain's case the rumor was accompanied by photos of the black child who was actually a Bengladesh girl that McCain and his wife had adopted. Nineteen ninetytwo was only thirteen years ago but things have gotten a lot dirtier in that time.As a movie The War Room is informative shot casually as the events transpired. There are no long speeches. But it's unfocused too and the editing sometimes leaves out important developments which we learn about later. I suppose this can happen when you're just pointing the camera around and not providing a voiceover. And the film makers must have faced the additional problem that there is no logical narrative to the story. Stuff happens abruptly and unexpectedly. It's not the careful reconstruction of an historic contretemps like The Thin Blue Line or Ken Burns' The Civil War. The candidates aside the most memorable people in the film are James Carville George Stephanopoulis and Mary Matalin Carville's opposite number on the Republican side. The two of them are from different political poles. Someone should be doing a cinema verite copy of their MARRIAGE. But they have a lot in common too. They're thickskinned devoted have a sense of humor and are animated. Carville's face is so curiously constructed that it looks devilishly lively even in repose. He comes from an old New Orleans family. The hospital for lepers at Carville is named for his ancestors who founded it.I can't say I like George Stephanopoulis too much. He looks like the president of my senior class in high school. He's selfcontained intelligent thoughtful cleancut handsome and is much younger than I am. I could live with all the other stuff but his youth is inexcusable. I'd have liked him a lot better as a stuttering kyphotic octogenarian who was able to touch the tip of his nose with the tip of his tongue. And his hair was styled so boyishly that I didn't like THAT either.The personality that's most memorable is Carville's though. He sits there smiling on election eve and begins imagining what Clinton would say at his concession speech should Bush win. And between the chuckles he spins out an improvised absolutely spoton bythenumbers speech for the Governor. I would like to congratulate President Bush on his victory tonight and assure him that all of us are behind him and that this will be a better America with our help and God's and my family most of all my wife Hillary and Chelsea and all those of you who have worked so hard on this campaign I'd like to mention SoandSo and our prayers are with the President and let us all cooperate now and move together towards a greater American coprosperity sphere no not that but a more prosperous and happier American which with God's blessing and blah blah blah.

The best scenes are shown in the campaign room when you hear the plans and game plans of the two most important Clinton insiders that being James Carville and George Stephanopoulos. Carville the outspoken and fiery southern who ran the campaign with charm and hard working passion. Really an emotional moment is when James gives his speech at the end by breaking down and crying really a touching moment for the viewer. While Stephanopoulos the brilliant and young bright mind who was an ex Rhodes Scholar does a fine job as the communications director helping Bill dodge and maneuver around such scandals as Gennifer Flowers and the draft dodge. The film also has plenty of highlights from the debates speeches campaign tours and highlights of final election results too. Really a fine documentary of how a political campaign should be done which most will find both educational and informative.".

The story is fascinating the characters are very interesting and its all real.  Even the music adds to the frenetic pace of the film.The documentary follows the 1992 Clinton Campaign from the doldrums in New Hampshire through the Democratic convention in New York to its summit on election night in Little Rock.  But Clinton spends very little time on the screen.  The film captures the behindthescenes action of James Carville George Stephanopolis and the rest of the cast and crew of Clinton campaign headquarters.  The film shows how TV spots are written how interviews are managed how the candidates' message is distributed and how the spin doctors do their stuff.The pace is quick. Staffers come into and out of scenes constantly and there is a great deal of offcamera dialogue much like an emergencyroom scene from E.R. The mix of standard documentary footage with news reports and interviews is terrific.  Some of the best scenes are of the pols watching the news reports and reacting to what they see.The central character is James Carville who is more interesting than anyone else in the campaign much moreso than the candidates themselves.  He reveals that his Ragin' Cajun image is genuine for he is truly passionate about his work.  But it also reveals a mind working on overdrive and a sensitive nature that you wouldn't expect to see.  His people will say you are lucky speech to staffers at the end of the film is as moving as anything written for the studio and moreso because it is genuine.Stephanopolis came off less well.  Behind his youthful looks and seeming intelligence comes a certain shallowness.  Much of his contribution was more of a me too nature than anything truly creative or deep.  He also had a moment at the end of the film when in a room with a starryeyed female staffer he's describing how he feels.  And the conclusion is not much. It is not hard to understand why years later George was a washout in the Clinton White House never managed another campaign and is now earning his living in front of the camera.After all is said and done it is clear that the candidate is secondary in a modern presidential election.  He's like the hand your dealt in a game of poker.  It's important but what you do with it once it is dealt to you is much more important.  And these guys are pros.So are the filmmakers.  There were several times when I had to remind myself that this was a documentary and not a work of fiction.  In fact if you see it immediately after seeing Primary Colors you'll see that truth is not only stranger than fiction but it can be more interesting as well.".

In fact the scenes that we are allowed to get into through good editing and cinematography are great but the rest is just annoying and confusing. Also it's hard to keep track of all that goes on in the war room and although that was never going to be easy to do it should have been done better. Still a lot of it is very good and worth a look because the concept the most important thing in a direct cinema film is very interesting and now that we know how things ended pleasant to watch unless you're a republican...

It was reissued in 1981 with all the cut footage restored it now runs 165 minutes and the critics raved about it! Go figure. After that however it seemed to disappear. Too badit's actually good.It's about clarinet player Jimmy Doyle Robert De Niro falling in love with Francine Evans Liza Minnelli. She's a singer and they preform together in the same band. But Jimmy has serious temper problems and when Francine gets pregnant things go out of control.The film is certainly stunning to look atthe sets and cinematography are just great. Some of the sets are quite obviously fake but it actually works in this movie. It seems to be a homage to the big splashy Technicolor musicals of the 1940s and 1950sbut has its characters act like real people and deal with adult situations. The direction by Scorsese is of course wonderful. What's especially surprising is his directing of the big Happy Endings musical number which was originally completely cutwho knew Scorsese could direct a musical?The acting is goodalmost too good. Minnelli is very good as Francineshe's just magical when she sings and there's a powerful sequence when she just explodes in the back of a car. De Niro plays Doyle as an insensitive jerkand that's the main problem with this film. His character is loud immature obnoxious and always pushing Minnelli around. More than once I wanted her to turn around and punch him out. His character is so unlikable it's hard to really give a damn about him. But Minnelli is beautiful and likable and the sets are unbelievable. The music is great and when Minnelli sings New York New York you can't take your eyes from the screen. Also old time stage actor Larry Kert who sadly died on AIDS in 1991 pops up at the Happy Endings sequencewhat a voice!A lot of people find this film sick and too darkit is but it IS a Martin Scorsese film. It should be reissued again and find a new audience. It's been over 20 years. Well worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " Often Brilliant In Spite of Major Flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1977 Martin Scorsese's NEW YORK NEW YORK instantly divided critical responseand facing box office competition from no less than STAR WARS proved a major financial failure. A significantly edited rerelease followed not long afterward but proved even less well received and even less profitable. Although a double VHS release eventually brought the film to the home market the film remained unpopular and made barely a ripple in public consciousness. In 2005 however NEW YORK NEW YORK received an unexpected release to DVD. At long last it may begin to reach a significant audience.As a story NEW YORK NEW YORK draws from a number of oddly Noirish musicals made at Warner Bros. in the late 1940s. Most particularly according to Scorsese's commentary it drew from MY DREAM IS YOURS a film that not only starred Doris Day but actually reflected her life in its tale of a talented big band girl singer trapped in an abusive marriage with a musician. Although the film forcefed the audience a happy ending later films would not. In the mid1950s Doris Day's LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME and Judy Garland's A STAR IS BORN offered stories of a gifted female vocalists locked into disastrous romances that played out to a very distinctly unhappy ending and NEW YORK NEW YORK draws from them as well.Scorsese not only repeats the basic stories and themes of these films he also repeats the artificially heightened visual style typical of Hollywood films of the 1940s and 1950sit is no accident that Liza Minnelli looks and sings remarkably like mother Judy Garland in this filmbut he does so to an entirely unexpected end. The bravado performing style of such films is completely snatched away and the characters are presented in an almost documentarylike realism. In theory each aspect of the film would emphasize the other in fact however this was precisely what critics and audiences disliked about the film when it debuted. They considered it extremely grating.But perhaps the passage of time has opened our eyes on the point. I saw NEW YORK NEW YORK in its 1977 release and music aside I disliked it a great deal. I expected to retain that opinion when I approached the DVD release but I was greatly surprised. It holds up remarkably well and most of the time the balance of artifice and reality works very well. But there are significant flaws. In a general sense the film has a cold feel to it that occasionally becomes so downright chilly you begin to detach from it. But even more difficult is the character of Jimmy Doyle the abusive husband of the piece.The recent DVD release includes a noteworthy director's commentary and Scorsese states that both he and actor Robert De Niro sought to push the character far beyond the extremes of MY DREAM IS YOURS LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME or A STAR IS BORN. They were perhaps more successful than they expected. The result is a character you actively do not want to watch or hear and although we are eventually allowed to see beyond his annoying qualities that moment comes much too late in the film to make him acceptable in any significant way. It makes for more than one bout of uphill viewing.Overall I recommend the filmbut it is very much a Hollywood Insider film that is probably best left to those who know a great deal about film history and who can recognize the numerous antecedents from which it draws.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

A significantly edited rerelease followed not long afterward but proved even less well received and even less profitable. Although a double VHS release eventually brought the film to the home market the film remained unpopular and made barely a ripple in public consciousness. In 2005 however NEW YORK NEW YORK received an unexpected release to DVD. At long last it may begin to reach a significant audience.As a story NEW YORK NEW YORK draws from a number of oddly Noirish musicals made at Warner Bros. in the late 1940s. Most particularly according to Scorsese's commentary it drew from MY DREAM IS YOURS a film that not only starred Doris Day but actually reflected her life in its tale of a talented big band girl singer trapped in an abusive marriage with a musician. Although the film forcefed the audience a happy ending later films would not. In the mid1950s Doris Day's LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME and Judy Garland's A STAR IS BORN offered stories of a gifted female vocalists locked into disastrous romances that played out to a very distinctly unhappy ending and NEW YORK NEW YORK draws from them as well.Scorsese not only repeats the basic stories and themes of these films he also repeats the artificially heightened visual style typical of Hollywood films of the 1940s and 1950sit is no accident that Liza Minnelli looks and sings remarkably like mother Judy Garland in this filmbut he does so to an entirely unexpected end. The bravado performing style of such films is completely snatched away and the characters are presented in an almost documentarylike realism. In theory each aspect of the film would emphasize the other in fact however this was precisely what critics and audiences disliked about the film when it debuted. They considered it extremely grating.But perhaps the passage of time has opened our eyes on the point. I saw NEW YORK NEW YORK in its 1977 release and music aside I disliked it a great deal. I expected to retain that opinion when I approached the DVD release but I was greatly surprised. It holds up remarkably well and most of the time the balance of artifice and reality works very well. But there are significant flaws. In a general sense the film has a cold feel to it that occasionally becomes so downright chilly you begin to detach from it. But even more difficult is the character of Jimmy Doyle the abusive husband of the piece.The recent DVD release includes a noteworthy director's commentary and Scorsese states that both he and actor Robert De Niro sought to push the character far beyond the extremes of MY DREAM IS YOURS LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME or A STAR IS BORN. They were perhaps more successful than they expected. The result is a character you actively do not want to watch or hear and although we are eventually allowed to see beyond his annoying qualities that moment comes much too late in the film to make him acceptable in any significant way. It makes for more than one bout of uphill viewing.Overall I recommend the filmbut it is very much a Hollywood Insider film that is probably best left to those who know a great deal about film history and who can recognize the numerous antecedents from which it draws.Gary F.

Liza Minnelli as his wife is also great.  Of course her singing is incredible  in standards like The Man I Love the delightful You Brought A New Kind Of Love To Me which in true Hollywood fashion she launches into out of nowhere and performs so well Backed up by De Niro on sax that they both land a job at a club and You Are My Lucky Star and new songs written for the film by Kander and Ebb like But the 'World GOes Round and of course the title tune  and her acting is also subtle shaded and sympathetic.  Not to mention how fetching And eerily like her mother Judy Garland she looks in Theordora Van Runkle's period costumes.  She is just as good as and perhaps even better at times than she was in her more famous performance in Cabaret.  SHe and De Niro really should have been Oscarnominated for their powerful performances here and Scorsese really should've gotten a nod as well.  But the film flopped so the Academy didn't notice.  Which is really too bad because this movie definitly deserves another look especially in its restored version which includes a fantastic production number cut from the original print Happy Endings performed by Minnelli and Larry Kert Tony in the original Broadway production of West Side Story that does a great job of reiterating the movie's themes.  True the film is a little too long and slow at times and there's more than a little unneccessary footage that didn't really need to be there but all in all it's a very interesting underrated gem.

It's getting more respect nowadays actually that began in 1981 when a longer version the version I watched was released but it's mostly considered one of his least good movies. I'd definitely agree with that but it is interesting. The film has two major faults first De Niro is simply despicable. I mean he is in Raging Bull too but you always know you aren't supposed to like Jake La Motta. Jimmy Doyle on the other hand I think we're supposed to kind of like and sympathize with. But from his first appearance where he pesters Liza Minnelli to a degree that would even make Gene Kelly in An American in Paris think he's a possible rapist I just couldn't tolerate him. I kept thinking Girl get away from this guy. He's dangerous. At the very least he's going to beat you silly. We never quite understand Doyle like we do La Motta or even Travis Bickle. He just comes off as a baby not as a pathetic schlub. The second flaw is in the film's basic gimmick the art design is artificial in a way that recalls the classic Hollywood musicals of the '40s and '50s but the acting and level of realism is much more in line with the gritty films of the time. That in itself is fine but I kept thinking Scorsese was trying to say something with that. Yet it never comes through what that is. The only answer I can think of is that he was trying to criticize Hollywood in its Golden Age. That's fine by me but he never brings that argument up in the text. Personally I think he just wanted to do it and had no deeper reason. So what's good about the film? Well I do like the art design even if it never really makes any sense. Liza Minnelli is quite good. The music is pretty good too. I especially liked the half hour or so that works up to the climax. And that scene in the hospital is exceptional and the only time where De Niro rises to the talent he normally displays.".

	schema:reviewBody "Martin Scorsese's deconstruction of the golden Hollywood musical is a meandering disaster.New York New York is damn near unwatchable. It tells the VERY slight story of a jackass saxophone player Robert De Niro who falls in love with a nightclub singer Liza Minelli and proceeds to emotionally abuse her until her life is miserable. De Niro is consistently one note in his performance creating a character without a single redeeming feature. In his early scenes I think we're supposed to be charmed by him and by extension understand why Minelli's character would fall for him in the first place  unfortunately he comes across more as a creepy sociopath than anything Travis Bickle with some musical talent. Minelli's role is utterly thankless but she's absolutely the only thing that kept me watching. The last 40 minutes of the film is practically a Liza Minelli concert. Her character has vaulted to film stardom and left her loser husband in the dust Scorsese devotes what feels like half an hour to a movie within a movie featuring Minelli in one of those epic ballet scenes that always derailed Gene Kelly musicals. It does the same to this film but the diversion was welcome since it meant we could enjoy a nice break from De Niro.The movie grinds on for 163! minutes. At the 120 minute mark I wanted to cry. At the 150 minute mark I was beaten into submission by indifference. By that point the film had been going on for far too long yet at the same time I couldn't believe it would be ending in 10 minutes because it didn't seem to be moving toward any kind of resolution.Scorsese seemed to be unaware that this story had already been told  maybe he'd never heard of A Star Is Born. More likely he was paying homage to that film but he created something that on its own terms has no reason for existence.Grade D".

	onyx:emotionText "Martin Scorsese's deconstruction of the golden Hollywood musical is a meandering disaster.New York New York is damn near unwatchable. It tells the VERY slight story of a jackass saxophone player Robert De Niro who falls in love with a nightclub singer Liza Minelli and proceeds to emotionally abuse her until her life is miserable. De Niro is consistently one note in his performance creating a character without a single redeeming feature. In his early scenes I think we're supposed to be charmed by him and by extension understand why Minelli's character would fall for him in the first place  unfortunately he comes across more as a creepy sociopath than anything Travis Bickle with some musical talent. Minelli's role is utterly thankless but she's absolutely the only thing that kept me watching. The last 40 minutes of the film is practically a Liza Minelli concert. Her character has vaulted to film stardom and left her loser husband in the dust Scorsese devotes what feels like half an hour to a movie within a movie featuring Minelli in one of those epic ballet scenes that always derailed Gene Kelly musicals. It does the same to this film but the diversion was welcome since it meant we could enjoy a nice break from De Niro.The movie grinds on for 163! minutes. At the 120 minute mark I wanted to cry.

	schema:reviewBody "New York New York is an ambitious failure. There are a lot of good things in it but rarely do they ever seem to quite fit together into a consistent whole. You have to give Scorsese credit for trying to do something new as he has done throughout his career despite the oftrepeated charge that he does the same thing over and over again. In this case however his gamble didn't pay off. Some of the tensions inherent in the New Hollywood's attitude towards Hollywood's past can be seen in New York New York. With this movie Scorsese sought to create a tribute to the bigband musicals of the 40s while placing at its center a typically hardtolike protagonist. Robert De Niro plays a talented but abrasive saxophonist who seemingly can't get along with anyone for any length of time least of all his wife played by Liza Minnelli. In the extended opening sequence they meet cute at a VJ celebration though in a sign of things to come the way in which De Niro tries to pick up Minnelli is distinctly creepy in its aggressiveness. She turns out to be a gifted singer and they become partners first singing together at a nightclub then going on the road with a band before his jealousy of her success finally drives them apart. After the lowbudget success of Taxi Driver Scorsese was riding high and he was given the chance to mount his followup on a big scale. Just as the story and situation mimic those of old musicals New York New York's production design aims to recreate those movies' stylized artificial sets and visuals. The sets are spare and designed in bold colors while the car scenes utilize obvious rearprojection. At the same time as he is replicating the world of Hollywood musicals Scorsese is also trying to subvert it's sentimentality by introducing his own brand of gritty emotional realism. Coppola tried to do something similar in One from the Heart Scorsese's movie is much better but it still doesn't work. At times he seems to be doing a runthrough for his next and much better movie Raging Bull. In both films De Niro plays a volatile jealous character who makes life difficult for everyone around him and never learns from his mistake. Of course Jimmy Doyle is a little more bearable than Jake La Motta but the fact remains that the character is just too unpleasant for the context of a musical. As despicable as he was La Motta seemed to belong in the tough world of tenements nightclubs and boxing rings in which we saw him. If his character never really changed then that was one of the main points of Raging Bull. In New York New York though the characters are similarly unchanging but they also remain strictly on the surface as superficial as the studiobuilt world they inhabit. Scorsese seems to have mistaken unpleasantness for profundity.".

	schema:headline " Hollywood fantasy clashes with Scorsese's vision of reality in this underappreciated quasimusical";
	schema:reviewBody "The first thing that needs to be said about Scorsese's highly underrated New York New York is that it can't possibly be fully appreciated by anyone who hasn't seen films like An American in Paris and Singin' in the Rain. Scorsese's film is very much a pastiche or parody depending on your perspective of these earlier musicals by MGM. The entire formula for the film is based around them. Stylistically attractive visuals light and witty dialogue a romance at the center of the story and a foray into narratively digressive musical territory toward the end of the film. It's all there. This hypotextual reflection of Hollywood's golden age however is only half the picture. The other half is that this is very much a Scorsese film despite many claims to the contrary. Scorsese's hallmarks are all over it. We have Robert De Niro in the lead role playing an oppressive dominant alpha male personality type amplified by a bit of that good oldfashioned ItalianAmerican upbringing that Scorsese knew so well. Harvey Keitel played this character in Who's That Knocking at My Door and Mean Streets and even Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in a lesser role and now for Taxi Driver New York New York Raging Bull and even Casino it's De Niro. I've seen nineteen Scorsese films and this is by far the most cinematographically impressive of them all. The lighting is flawless the direction exemplary. Scorsese has always been a top talent in terms of his technical skills as a director but visually this film is stunning on an entirely different level. The film's aesthetic seeks to mimic the visual attractiveness of those classic Hollywood musicals Scorsese even gives us a few false backgrounds just for good measure and in that way it was very successful. This film is eye candy on a par with Wong Karwai's In the Mood for Love Korine's Spring Breakers Refn's Only God Forgives or Fassbinder's Lola. As for the film's content about which too little has been written the entire thematic core of the film is reflected in the casting of its two principal parts First we have Robert De Niro the classic Scorsese casting choice playing very much the same character we've seen him play in other Scorsese films. On the other end we have Liza Minnelli the daughter of none other than Judy Garland the ultrafamous musical actress of Hollywood's glory days. And Liza's father? Vincente Minelli director of famous Hollywood musicals like The Band Wagon Gigi and An American in Paris. Scorsese throws these two characters together in a violent tempest of passion and suffocating possessiveness. But we the audience are also witnessing two worlds being thrown together De Niro represents Scorsese's world  his vision of a reality steeped in alpha male aggression and hyperpossessiveness over females  and Liza Minnelli daughter of the golden age of Hollywood represents that other makebelieve world of American culture  that unique brand of lighthearted escapism and pure cinematic fantasy that Hollywood produced so enticingly in the '30s '40s and '50s. Cinematically we are watching traditional Hollywood fantasy pitted against a vaguely Cassavetesesque realism.What will happen when these two disparate realities attempt to coexist? Well Scorsese doesn't offer an outright answer except to say it will be difficult  extremely difficult. Hollywood fantasy has created in the American mentality a world of misplaced priorities and unrealistic expectations regarding life. When the film begins Minnelli's character seems to have her life together in a way that few Scorsese characters do naturally since she's not from Scorsese's world  she is born of that distant land called Hollywood. And then De Niro enters her life from the other end of the spectrum and emotionally shatters her to pieces. And so it's very much a film about the conflict between reality and fantasy. Ultimately reality obliterates fantasy. The musical detour the filmwithinthefilm at the end of the movie has been the source of a lot of criticism but once again no one who's seen An American in Paris or Singin' in the Rain would be surprised by it. It was a structural necessity if the film was going to accurately echo the formula of those older films as it clearly intended to do. That being said I will admit that at 160 minutes in length to abandon over two hours of plot and move into a musical digression so late in the film certainly tests the viewer's patience. There is a moment in this segment however that makes it all worthwhile. In this moment we see movie theater viewers sitting in their seats watching a film looking straight at us the camera is placed behind what would be the screen of their theater and behind them is the projector casting its image directly at us. And so just as we are sitting in our theater watching them stare at the screen at us they are perhaps sitting in their theater watching us stare at our screen. And so Scorsese subtly implicates us into the film's themes of fantasy versus reality. Their reality has become our fantasy and possibly our reality has become their fantasy. The final shot of the film is a reference to Gene Kelly's most memorable moment from Singin' in the Rain. De Niro is in the street. He stands still propping himself up with an umbrella. The camera pans down to his feet pausing on them for a moment. The credits roll. We are left to savor the bitter and disenchanting taste of a reality so contrary to the one that Hollywood has offered us. De Niro was standing on a road that could have very well been the same one on which Gene Kelly sung in the rain with his umbrella. But there is no singing here the umbrella is closed and those feet aren't dancing. Reality has decimated the Hollywood fantasy.RATING 8.00 out of 10 stars".

	schema:headline " Grandiose aspirations overload what might have been a dark and modest nostalgia piece";
	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere inside Martin Scorsese's bloated New York New York there's a trim taut little movie trying to claw its way out.  Apparently envisaged at one point as an epic retromusical over four hours long! it was sweated down to just over two for its theatrical release Scorsese blamed its lukewarm reception on studioimposed cuts.  Later he managed to restore at least some of his footage which didn't much help the clunky moviewithinamovie extravaganza just added to the aimlessness.

The best part of the movie is this dreary routine the comforting tedium of the road with its slapdash tourist courts and ritzy roadhouses and card games on the bus.

	schema:reviewBody "In one of those stunning displays of illogic that can only exist in truly bad films Martin Scorsese has slavishly recreated the look and feel of oldtime movie musicals only so that he can tell a dark and abusive story designed to show just how artificial those oldtime musicals were.  The result is less a celebration than a eulogy. Indeed even his template for this film is not anything by Astaire and Rogers or Gene Kelly or even MGM but the torch song tearjerking melodramas like A STAR IS BORN or LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME. Musical salutes to domestic violence as it were. Leave it to Scorsese to resurrect a comatose genre only so that he could recreate its most depressing subcategory.To his credit Scorsese certainly did nail the look of those old Hollywood films. Actually he surpassed them. The art direction is a clever blend of the somewhat realistic and the obviously artificial and the cinematography catches the richness and the textures of the pseudoTechnicolor. Some scenes in the film are sights to behold. Nobody should doubt Scorsese's eye for visuals. It is his empathy for humanity that so often falls short.Even so NYNY as a musical isn't much to talk about as a love story it is a disaster. The two stars Liza Minnelli and Robert DeNiro have no chemistry personally plus they come from two different acting backgrounds that don't mesh at all. Liza is theatrical pizzazz while Robert is grunt and groan method. This is made worse by a screenplay in which they are given little to do beyond argue. The incongruity of the two styles the two characters and the two actors remains at the forefront since so many of their scenes are confrontational. In concept I suppose the oilandwater idea of a show biz sassy Sally Boles sharing the stage with an inarticulate schmo like Jack LaMotta seems amusing in action its just embarrassing.Minnelli no doubt was hired because she was the biggest musical movie star at the time and being Judy Garland's daughter didn't hurt either. DeNiro is here because well because it is a Martin Scorsese movie. Whatever the case the two actors do not register as a couple. Minnelli comes off best and at least gets the opportunity to belt out a couple of songs. It is not surprising that her best moments come when she is center stage alone. Her rendition of the title song is the film's showstopping highlight indeed it is the only reason to endure the rest of the movie. Unfortunately DeNiro once again giving a onenote performance of a onenote character is insufferable. He rants and raves and generally overacts never once revealing a positive or even engaging aspect to the character a paranoid possessive and selfobsessed creep. Sort of a Jake LaMotta with a saxophone. Had the film allowed us to see a side of him that would make him appealing to Minnelli if not the audience or even showed him to be a clearcut villain exploiting Minnelli's talent to enhance his own career then at least there would be a reason for the romancemarriage to exist. As is the two are a couple as a plot device only. Indeed as the lumbering story builds to a finale in which the big question is whether the two will reunite the only genuine response is Who cares? The maddening thing about NEW YORK NEW YORK is not just the utter emptiness of the drama but the waste of effort that went behind it. Scorsese obviously went to great lengths to recreate the look sound and tone of 194050's movies then squanders it all on a story that had little hope whatsoever of being anything but dull and dreary. Once again as a stylist Scorsese is a master as a person with a sense of empathy and a soul he doesn't even bother. Great movies are made with the heart as well as the eye. As the old saying goes he can play the notes but he can't play the music.".

Supplies are limited must have a daddy complex no purchase necessary you can rent it at your local video store.The misogyny and misanthropy on full display in Raging Bull get a tryout here. Pardon me if I still think Scorcese is a great filmmaker while not loving one of his most successful movies instead of real drama I found most of Raging Bull to be SMACK! Were you looking at him!? Were you Smack! then cut to six months later SMACK! Well it is a stretch of the imagination to think that nobody would have killed Jimmy Doyle in New York New York just for being so unremittingly irritating. He's such a scumbag that when the band fails under his command he says it was the musicians' fault which is proved wrong when the uptight but consistent piano players turns the band into a success and Jimmy shows he has no class by disrupting their show. I think DeNiro became confused between avoiding pandering and creating a character that we would root to see fail. And look how much it takes for her to finally leave him he has to leave her and his child for six years first beforeher great triumph is that she doesn't come back for even more.Who wouldn't want the father of their child to say to them after an incredibly successful concert I'm proud of you in a way. In a way I'm not but in a way I am? This film just doesn't cut it mainly because of that. The old sets are great the recreation of the MGM musical Happy Endings sequence is great the songs are all right and if they could conquer what DeNiro did to the character they could turn it into an okay stage musical. One surprising thing is how poorly Liza Minelli lipsynchs. She'll be hitting a high note and not opening her mouth at all when we all know she looks like an open airport hangar whenever she tops out.I'm sorry this film was so irritating it just makes me want to snipe at it. If anyone ever says that DeNiro had irresistible charisma then this film proves them wrong. He blew it.And by the way Liza Minelli plays a girl who has to struggle but makes it big then in the play within a play Happy Endings she plays a girl that only makes it big in her dreams. In reality it is a lot more convenient to be born the daughter of Judy Garland.".

Years later it was all there reel 7 and the whole number but the labor requited to just sit there all through it....well I haven't been that bored since I saw the stupidly cruel remake of Cape Fear and the second half of CASINO. NYNY should be soooooooo good. I wish it was.";

There are some problems with this film that are apparent like the ending. I don't get it. He brings together Robert DeNiro and Liza Minnelli but it's Liza's film especially in the musical numbers. The film is over 2 hours and 43 minutes long. It should have been edited. There was some problems with the script. Of course Liza and Robert are brilliant in their roles of a USO singer Francine Evans and musiciancon man Jimmy Doyle. Like I said there was a lot that could have been cut from the film to condense it into a solid film. The performances were excellent. You really get to the stars' acting skills and the title song is classic. I don't know why it wasn't awarded the Oscar for original song because it's one of the most played songs about New York since it debuted.".

I must admit to a certain amount of nostalgia for this kind of film which could usually be found languishing on the bottom of a latenight horror double bill at a provincial fleapit cinema here in Blighty and it's not too difficult to imagine yourself watching INSEMINOID in between visits to the hot dog concession and the toilet as you wait impatiently for something like THE EVIL DEAD or ZOMBIE FLESH EATERS to start. Norman J.Warren a maverick director who knew a gap in the market or the opportunity for a quick cashin on an established craze when he saw one is actually a pretty decent director and he gets ample opportunity to show his tightlyhoned skills here particularly during some of the more competent action sequences. The set design may be no great shakes  the film looks more like a bigscreen version of the cult TV series BLAKE'S SEVEN than anything Ridley Scott put his name to  but the caverns that double as the subterranean outerspace dungeons are none too shabby and quite convincingly lit just forget about the silly redfiltered shots of the planet's surface so obviously shot in a quarry somewhere and John Metcalfe's widescreen photography makes the lowbudget production look expansive if not exactly expensive.In short INSEMINOID is the simple tale of a bunch of incompetent to say nothing of downright disagreeable cosmonauts who touch down somewhere in the outer reaches of the galaxy and promptly tamper with the ecosystem including some malevolent crystals and some sinisterlooking pods. Before you can say quatermass! the crew members start getting bumped off going crazy cracking up sawing their own feet off a strong contender for the most cringeinducing scene in the movie and in Judy Geeson's case being forcefully artificially inseminated by a huge glowering crustacean lifeform whose alien seed resembles lumpy green porridge. If you remember Geeson as the lovable dolly from TO SIR WITH LOVE then it will undoubtedly come as a shattering revelation to you that she forgoes the usual pregnancy pangs and cravings for unusual foodstuffs in favour of a bloodthirsty spree of murder and cannibalism eventually giving birth to a couple of naked Muppets who just can't get enough of that chewy human stuff. To a large extent it's Geeson's hypertense performance all quivering facial tics throatrending screams and popping twitching eyeballs that holds the film together in its later stages as the plot contrivances and dumbasmud antics of her shipmates get a little too tedious and often to be believable. Still if you're stupid enough to want to tackle a superstrong loony blonde singlehandedly with no blunt instruments to help you you really deserve a swift messy death right? INSEMINOID is truly a mad crazy paranoid shambling mess of a film but it still exerts a strong kinetic energy that fights off boredom and keeps you watching. There's also a surprisingly atmospheric electronic score Stephanie Beacham in her underwear one for the boys! and quite a lot of the sticky red stuff to keep the gorehounds salivating. Warren was never going to be another Pete Walker but he wasn't another Andy Milligan either. If you're still not convinced check out TERROR or SATAN'S SLAVE. If they whet your appetite roll out INSEMINOID and enjoy.".

To a large extent it's Geeson's hypertense performance all quivering facial tics throatrending screams and popping twitching eyeballs that holds the film together in its later stages as the plot contrivances and dumbasmud antics of her shipmates get a little too tedious and often to be believable. Still if you're stupid enough to want to tackle a superstrong loony blonde singlehandedly with no blunt instruments to help you you really deserve a swift messy death right? INSEMINOID is truly a mad crazy paranoid shambling mess of a film but it still exerts a strong kinetic energy that fights off boredom and keeps you watching. There's also a surprisingly atmospheric electronic score Stephanie Beacham in her underwear one for the boys! and quite a lot of the sticky red stuff to keep the gorehounds salivating. Warren was never going to be another Pete Walker but he wasn't another Andy Milligan either. If you're still not convinced check out TERROR or SATAN'S SLAVE. If they whet your appetite roll out INSEMINOID and enjoy.";

YES!! YES!! YES!!  but was too young to rent it from my local video shop.

As everyone's already pointed out it's shte of the highest ordure  'nuff said.In answer to the fellow countryman who also endured it on Saturday as a first and last time viewer obviously I've no idea if it got cut. I imagine the scene that the Beeb would naturally be most sensitive about is the 'xenorape' scene.What was shown was a slightly confusing collage of bugeyed alien leering down at parted thighs as if seen from the viewpoint of the inseminee intercut with shots of a crooked leg behind which you could see a clear plastic tube  the alien's penis?  filled with what looked like meatballs floating in green pea soup. Presumably the tube was being used to penetrate and impregnate the alien's prey.Does that sound much like the uncut version you saw way back when? As I say it was pretty confusing and felt like it might have been cut but given the generally shoddy state of the direction and editing it's hard to tell what's the director's original 'vision' and what's been snipped by the censor's scissors.Pippip The Hutt".

After having read reviews that claimed it to be a rip off of Alien then I was a bit reluctant to watch it. I will say however that while it shares some similarities with Alien then it wasn't a rip off.The story is about a group of interplanar archaeologists who stumble upon a cavedwelling alien creature. The creature impregnates one of the crew members and slowly she started to turn into a crazed killer while the alien offspring grows inside her.Now the movie is driven by its story and acting talents and barely relying on the special effects. This wasn't a special effects extravaganza not by a long shot.As for the acting then I will say that people were doing good jobs all round which was crucial for the movie.You can't really have an alien creature movie without a proper alien being. The alien in Inseminoid actually looked rather interesting and was nicely made. It just wasn't shown as much throughout the entire movie as I would have liked.All in all Inseminoid is an enjoyable SciFi horror movie. But given its age it is not a movie that stands out as memorable in comparison to the SciFi horror movies that come out nowadays.".

It can't compare to the likes of Alien but is fairly entertaining for what it is. It's not very strong on coherency and the story and characters could have used more colour. As things are they're both rather nondescript. Still undemanding genre fans who simply want to have a good time may find themselves enjoying Inseminoid even if the movie itself isn't as cool as its title.A group of astronauts are on a mission on a distant planet trying to discover what happened on an illfated previous mission. As team members begin dying one of their number Sandy Judy Geeson has a vision of being raped by an alien being  after which she appears to go insane and start slaughtering all the team members that are left. As the amount of survivors dwindles those that are left try to eliminate the crazed Sandy.Warren does one good thing in taking a page from John Carpenters' book shooting the film in widescreen that is the 2.351 aspect ratio to give this little film a bigger feel. And the cinematography by John Metcalfe is quite good helping to give Inseminoid the atmosphere that it needs. The cave sets are also well done for the budget. This movie may lack a really strong story but it does have a feel of true doom  gloom to it and it's got just enough gore to keep some of us genre fans happy. The cheesy music score by John Scott is a little too silly at times but for the most part it's good schlock movie music.The acting from the mostly British cast is generally pretty good with familiar faces like Stephanie Beacham and Victoria Tennant. The ladies in the cast also including Jennifer Ashley Rosalind Lloyd and Heather Wright are an attractive bunch which is a bonus. There's some breast shots for those of you who are interested. Top billed actor Robin Clarke is pretty stiff however.The aliens in this movie are an amusing bunch but it is a good thing that they're not seen too often.Best recommended to die hard B movie aficionados who should appreciate the way this thing ends.Six out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember first encountering this film back when we were all itching for another actual ALIEN movie and disliking it intensely. And after going back again and watching it as an adult there is little to really be fond of about it the film is cold distant cruel sickening barbaric perverse twisted and rather dull for periods of time.Yet HORROR PLANET has a very devoted cult following due to the presence of whacko director Norman J. Warren  who's 1976 satanic shocker SATAN'S SLAVE is a bizarre masterpiece of trash period horror  and the presence of cult favorites Judy Geeson DOOMWATCH A CANDLE FOR THE DEVIL and the very British DD cuped aristocratic Stephanie Beacham fondly remembered by this commentator for her appearence in DRACULA A.D. 1972. I am not overly fond of HORROR PLANET as a film but the movie itself is a fascinating production that has a bizarre history that is almost more interesting than the story it tells. This is because HORROR PLANET is the second of the three big Space Sleaze Epics released in the immediate wake of ALIEN. The reigning king is still Bruce Clark's mesmerizingly awful GALAXY OF TERROR 1980 my favorite of the three with the likewise Roger Corman produced FORBIDDEN WORLD MUTANT by director Allan Holzman from 1982 rounding out the trio.Of the three HORROR PLANET is the least fun the most gory the most horrifying and the one that seems to have suffered the most from the cutting shears of various home video marketers over the years. Originally released as the more revealingly titled INSEMINOID in 1980 it was a British made production with a Dr. Who like budget conveniently staged entirely underground or in space station sets so that no major special effects were needed beyond the gore effects.And like FORBIDDEN WORLD and GALAXY OF TERROR especially HORROR PLANET embraced all of the sexual aspects of the ALIENhuman interaction's possibilities doing so with attractive B supporting actresses known for their willingness to do exploitation work to help get a film done. GALAXY OF TERROR presented the world with the timeless image of CAGED HEAT's Taffey O'Connell having a close encounter of the most unwholesome  slippery kind with a giant space maggot in a scene that is pure exploitation that will live in infamy forever that is available in it's squishy entirety on Laserdisc and on an imported UK DVD. But HORROR PLANET which came first gives us more of a big insectoidslug which impregnates Ms. Geeson with it's disgusting human skinned but insect headed progeny and director Warren depicted their emergence such unrelentingly graphic slop that the original cut of INSEMINOID was Rated X by the MPAA.As such INSEMINOID could not find a distributor in the US in 1980 and was apparently banned in certain parts of Europe including the original lobby poster design which was deemed to be obscene only finding a release in Japan where as we all know they will watch just about anything. In 1982 a significantly cut version  now called HORROR PLANET and again distributed by Roger Corman  was finally granted an R rating and it's across the board bomb reviews for being apalling gross perverted ALIEN sleaze sort of guaranteed it's cult following when the movie turned up for home video in 1983 and again in 1988 on Laserdisc as well all of which quickly went out of print and are now collector's items. There was also a home video issuing of another version also called INSEMINOID in the mid 1990's but was cut even further than the HORROR PLANET tapes and it too quickly went out of print. Used examples of these videos are readily found at places like amazon.com's reseller shops and would prove an interesting if somewhat distasteful diversion for fans of recent garbage like SPHERE EVENT HORIZON RESIDENT EVIL and the like.But others should be rightfully warned or appropriately titilated by noting that this movie is gross this movie is painful this movie is difficult to watch has little or no artistic sensibilities worth commenting on or unusual plot elements to discuss. There is a cold distanced and documentary like method to the storytelling that leaves very little need for deconstruction  what you see on the screen is pretty much what you get. But if watching Judy Geeson being impregnated by a giant worm give birth to twin alien maggots and then murder  cannibalize the rest of the cast in some warped space feverdementia is your idea of a good time well Norman J. Warren made this mean spirited sick little movie just for you.Enjoy.  out of a possible ".

	schema:reviewBody "On a far off planet a team of space explorers open an underground carven. First off two explores who enter the cave first were effected by some unknown origin. One dies and the other goes crazy and then is killed by one of his fellow workers. As they struggle to work out what's going on a female team member is kidnapped and raped by an alien who impregnates her with its alien spawn. When she comes around and finds she is back in the base she suddenly turns on her team by transforming into a unnaturally strong psychopathic being that lusts for their blood.What an inspiring viewing! Ah actually I'm thinking of something else. Inseminoid is my first taste of a Norman. J Warren exploitation film and I thought it was modest attempt. I heard and read some decent things on this British director's other films such as Satan's Salve and Prey but honestly this one didn't really blow me away. The version I got is the uncut uncensored take and these gory moments is what made the film for me. Gee I can just imagine how tame and weak the cut version must feel because it relies on its unpleasant and shocking effects to entertained because the story is well been done before but better and the acting is reasonably lifeless in giving dud performances. Most of them came across as dead as wood. Though except for Judy Geeson memorable performance as Sandy the real victim of all of this. And that weak script is filled leaden dialogue to match that of the dire acting. It's not that I hate it but from a couple of scenes I saw on the makingof featurette Norman. J Warren sounds like a pretty interesting fella and who has a good sense of humour but that didn't entirely eventuate into this film for me. It just felt rather stale with its stodgy pace and I was waiting for some humour to break up some dry moments but it just didn't come.But hey what am I to expect when really this is lowbudget ripoff of Alien which its main focus is to show us pretty woman and many graphic violent scenes that make you feel uncomfortable because they're plain unpleasant. It just makes you shudder because there's a over abundance of it and sometimes it's not executed in a inventively swift manner but actually come across as dumb. But there are some well staged moments with a certain profound vibe the main points have to go to the brutal attack in the caves the eerie as hell alien rape and going into labour scenes. They were just damn right unnerving and that was helped a lot by the chilling synthesisers that overwhelmed those moments. They really did kick in! But everything else is rather tensionless and lacked intensity with most of the action organised is an unbelievable manner. Merely it's the gore in those scenes that provide the thrills. Don't go in hoping for a whole lot of bloody terror from our alien guest because there isn't much. You don't really get to see the big fella clearly but though the offspring get a bit of screen time towards the end. It's Sandy and her growing hunger who causes the real devastation! Speaking of the aliens there designs look no less but peculiar. What stood was their ugly big heads and the massive eyes. The father alien somewhat reminded me of a caterpillar! I guess that's the budget for you. Another key factor was that I didn't get any real sense of atmosphere sure there's a couple of scenes that are risible but for me it wasn't sustained and there was no real feel of dread or panic.The plot screenplay had plenty moments that reminded me of ala Alien but that's far from my concerned because is basically filled obvious clichs and a convoluted narrative. Not much is explained on and if so it's confusing tell what's happening and the characters seem to come and go with little purpose. Sometimes it's just cringe worthy with some stupid actions and dialogue occurring in some ridiculous scenarios. At times it ain't easy to watch! That really goes to that laughably goofy ending. These foolish characters are plain boring with nothing to like about them. It just got a lot better when they started to dwindle as I didn't have to listen to these obnoxious people. Look at the names of the cast who mostly are British and you'll be expecting more than what you got here. Robin Clarke Jennifer Ashley Stephanie Beacham Steven Grives Victoria Tennant Barry Houghton and Judy Geeson. Out of those only one stood out that was Geeson who gave it her all. Screaming those lungs out and getting up to grisly mischief. While the rest were less animated and paper thin. But what wasn't paper thin was the robust soundtrack which was filled with 80style synthesisers that really overpowered some sequences and weren't bad to listen either. Camerawork was steadily achieved with some nice tight nit angles and shots but too it would be all over the place. Overall stolidly done especially the lighting composition amongst the caves with it generating a neat hyper colour scheme. The production design was ho hum bits of it worked but most of it came across as cheap and rather dated. But that's its charm you could say?Reading what people have commented on it I can see why they frown upon it but I don't share that same thought. Okay yeah I'll admit it's bad. I found it dull and repetitive number of times but really something about it stops me from trashing it. Maybe I'm not right in the head? But I did see it no more as a gory cheesy throwback with a couple decent stuff in the mix. This experience won't stop from trying to check out more of Warren's work it actually has enhanced it!".

And that weak script is filled leaden dialogue to match that of the dire acting. It's not that I hate it but from a couple of scenes I saw on the makingof featurette Norman. J Warren sounds like a pretty interesting fella and who has a good sense of humour but that didn't entirely eventuate into this film for me. It just felt rather stale with its stodgy pace and I was waiting for some humour to break up some dry moments but it just didn't come.But hey what am I to expect when really this is lowbudget ripoff of Alien which its main focus is to show us pretty woman and many graphic violent scenes that make you feel uncomfortable because they're plain unpleasant. It just makes you shudder because there's a over abundance of it and sometimes it's not executed in a inventively swift manner but actually come across as dumb. But there are some well staged moments with a certain profound vibe the main points have to go to the brutal attack in the caves the eerie as hell alien rape and going into labour scenes. They were just damn right unnerving and that was helped a lot by the chilling synthesisers that overwhelmed those moments. They really did kick in! But everything else is rather tensionless and lacked intensity with most of the action organised is an unbelievable manner. Merely it's the gore in those scenes that provide the thrills. Don't go in hoping for a whole lot of bloody terror from our alien guest because there isn't much. You don't really get to see the big fella clearly but though the offspring get a bit of screen time towards the end. It's Sandy and her growing hunger who causes the real devastation! Speaking of the aliens there designs look no less but peculiar. What stood was their ugly big heads and the massive eyes. The father alien somewhat reminded me of a caterpillar! I guess that's the budget for you. Another key factor was that I didn't get any real sense of atmosphere sure there's a couple of scenes that are risible but for me it wasn't sustained and there was no real feel of dread or panic.The plot screenplay had plenty moments that reminded me of ala Alien but that's far from my concerned because is basically filled obvious clichs and a convoluted narrative. Not much is explained on and if so it's confusing tell what's happening and the characters seem to come and go with little purpose. Sometimes it's just cringe worthy with some stupid actions and dialogue occurring in some ridiculous scenarios. At times it ain't easy to watch! That really goes to that laughably goofy ending. These foolish characters are plain boring with nothing to like about them. It just got a lot better when they started to dwindle as I didn't have to listen to these obnoxious people. Look at the names of the cast who mostly are British and you'll be expecting more than what you got here. Robin Clarke Jennifer Ashley Stephanie Beacham Steven Grives Victoria Tennant Barry Houghton and Judy Geeson. Out of those only one stood out that was Geeson who gave it her all. Screaming those lungs out and getting up to grisly mischief. While the rest were less animated and paper thin. But what wasn't paper thin was the robust soundtrack which was filled with 80style synthesisers that really overpowered some sequences and weren't bad to listen either. Camerawork was steadily achieved with some nice tight nit angles and shots but too it would be all over the place. Overall stolidly done especially the lighting composition amongst the caves with it generating a neat hyper colour scheme. The production design was ho hum bits of it worked but most of it came across as cheap and rather dated. But that's its charm you could say?Reading what people have commented on it I can see why they frown upon it but I don't share that same thought. Okay yeah I'll admit it's bad. I found it dull and repetitive number of times but really something about it stops me from trashing it. Maybe I'm not right in the head? But I did see it no more as a gory cheesy throwback with a couple decent stuff in the mix. This experience won't stop from trying to check out more of Warren's work it actually has enhanced it!";

There was a movie made later that had just about the same concept only it was set on earth and in modern times. This one is set in space and boy they do not really follow science at all in this one. Still though it is better than some Alien clones but it is still not all that great. For the most part in fact it is pretty bad. However it is watchable at least. I have only seen the cut version I would imagine the only thing that was cut down was the rape scene because I don't remember all that much. The kills are pretty standard and the ending is fairly predictable if you are a horror fan. Another movie this reminds me of but just a bit is The Beast Within.

Read the novelisation by Larry Miller which was fairly gripping for pulp scifi horror. The budget of the film seems a bit low but it works surprisingly well and the alien is used sparingly Geeson herself does much of the work and is very convincing changing constantly between scared vulnerable and helpless and homicidal and cannibalistic when she goes mad she is very scary and intimidating and shows sadistic relish for her victims eating dead bodies and even eating a man's intestines just after shooting him while he is still alive and watching. There are plenty of murders and a fair bit of cannibalism so it's never boring. The mine set is a good choice this is enhanced by lots of runningcreeping around dark corridors and tunnels which adds a certain intensity the sets look a little cheap but it's forgivable. There is a startling sequence in which Geeson flashes back to her alien rape which is fairly explicit but it's the murders which score. One scene in particular not a murder but self mutilation is fairly shocking but the film can also be understated yet very nasty for example when Geeson looms evilly right over the dead bodies of some of her colleagues ready to feed. There is plenty of violence and creepiness even if some moments look low budget. Stephanie Beecham is fair support as a Ripley lookalike the rest of the cast play more convincingly than expected no real character development but they all look dirty and stressed which plays well there is a certain feeling of conviction to it if you accept that they are all workers on a longterm space mission. A fairly good low budget shocker with a parental subtext the mother is both the killer and the victim. She's only trying to protect her young in the end.".

For one I've never seen it on TV and every time I tried to purchase the Video I've had to return it as the company who produced it kept releasing faulty batches. Then came along the DVD player and even then I had to wait quite a long time since the DVD copy is far more expensive than the Video! Be warned  this is not one of those 'cheapo' releases. I had to pay 14.99p the cheapest I could find anywhere!OK so I'm not a massive SF fan so why did I buy it? Simple I purchased it and was always after purchasing it for the same reason because Judy Geeson was in the Movie! and I like her for her work not as a 'sex symbol'She's always been great and dreadfully underrated as an actress. you should really see her in 10 Rillington Place to give you an idea of how great she is and what she is capable ofI had no idea what part or how big she played in this Movie and along the same lines as great stars of the past like Diana Dors Judy often plays in movies where her parts are small or she gets killed off quite early on so you can imagine my delight when not long after the film gets going a possible spoiler here when it looks like she gets killed and I was ready for disappointment it's actually only the beginning of her taking over and leading the whole Movie!After just reading the other 23 reviews from viewers and how awful this film has been slagged I'm not going to join forces for two reasonsFirst I've only seen it the once and while many people may despair at my saying that any Movie should be seen twice before writing 'critical' comments such as I've read at least I don't agree that every single Movie that is made has to be so realistic that it's too real. We know no Movie is real the instant we begin to watch so hey  don't be spoil sports!When I first purchased the Video like I say there were numerous manufacturing problems and so all I saw was the intro. to the Movie which basically involved a lot of beautiful atmospheric colour and some beautiful haunting music and so it 'looked' and sounded good even though I was to wait a long time to see it.So no I won't be returning the DVD for my money back yet not until I've seen it at least once more and then I'll return here to leave a more comprehensive review.I just think everything deserves a chance. This Movie is worth owning for Judy Geeson alone  she makes any film worth watching!   ".

Simple I purchased it and was always after purchasing it for the same reason because Judy Geeson was in the Movie! and I like her for her work not as a 'sex symbol'She's always been great and dreadfully underrated as an actress. you should really see her in 10 Rillington Place to give you an idea of how great she is and what she is capable ofI had no idea what part or how big she played in this Movie and along the same lines as great stars of the past like Diana Dors Judy often plays in movies where her parts are small or she gets killed off quite early on so you can imagine my delight when not long after the film gets going a possible spoiler here when it looks like she gets killed and I was ready for disappointment it's actually only the beginning of her taking over and leading the whole Movie!After just reading the other 23 reviews from viewers and how awful this film has been slagged I'm not going to join forces for two reasonsFirst I've only seen it the once and while many people may despair at my saying that any Movie should be seen twice before writing 'critical' comments such as I've read at least I don't agree that every single Movie that is made has to be so realistic that it's too real. We know no Movie is real the instant we begin to watch so hey  don't be spoil sports!When I first purchased the Video like I say there were numerous manufacturing problems and so all I saw was the intro. to the Movie which basically involved a lot of beautiful atmospheric colour and some beautiful haunting music and so it 'looked' and sounded good even though I was to wait a long time to see it.So no I won't be returning the DVD for my money back yet not until I've seen it at least once more and then I'll return here to leave a more comprehensive review.I just think everything deserves a chance. This Movie is worth owning for Judy Geeson alone  she makes any film worth watching!   ";

Soon the usual assorted crew members of the archaeological expedition are getting needlessly separated doing stupid things like walking backwards down dark corridors and generally doing everything they can to get eaten.When the highlight of the movie is someone attempting to cut off their own foot with a hedgetrimmer and just exactly why an exoarchaeologist is wandering around an alien cave system carrying a hedgetrimmer is never explained you know you are in trouble.There are many bad movie moments in this film. Including a couple of classically bad fights with actors 'punches' missing each other by yards. Stephanie Beacham is the best thing in this movie and acts everyone else off the screen by doing as little as possible in the hope that no one notices her. And I got so bored staring down Judy Geeson's mouth as she screams moans mugs and grimaces her way through her part that I started to count her fillings. I mean how bad does a movie have to get before you find the lead's dentistry the most interesting thing on the screen? And it never ends! It just goes on and on and on  and the music is AWFUL!!! Please make it stop!!!!A Serious Bad Night Out Award of the week this one.The UK Stonevision DVD release of this film has a very amateur Documentary on the director as an 'extra'.

Turkeys like Species 2 Wild Wild West Speed 2 and DNA seem like masterpieces in comparison. I didnt have high hopes for Horror Planet more than it might be so bad that it would become entertaining. But no. I cant remember when I was so bored the last time.The confusing and stupid plot is about a group of scientists who search for some kind of diamond I never quite understood what they were looking for on a remote planet and discover something else. They discover a scary creature which looks more like a gigantic lobster or something. One of the female scientists gets raped in one of the least convincing scenes in movie history and becomes pregnant and possessed. She starts killing the crew one by one but since the audience doesnt really know who of the scientists is who we dont really care. Horror Planet might seem like a monstermovie at first but after a brief and embarrassing performance by the creature it is not seen anymore. The female crew member is the one who does all the killing. Cheap for the film makers but very dull for the audience.Everything is bad with Horror Planet. The script is a predictable ripoff of the masterpiece Alien made only two years earlier. The special effects look really crummy the monster is lousy and not very convincing even though it is almost not showed at all. The synthesizer based soundtrack makes the experience even worse. And the acting! I almost feel sorry for the actors. A friend of mine bought Horror Planet in a fleemarket and he thought that he might have found a decent horror movie to enjoy. I guess that the tag line on the cover Makes Alien look like E.T made him excited. Well after we had watched the movie he threw it in the trash can. Where it belongs.

Over the course of the day they run into countless mishaps and misadventures and come close together to understand each other in a sort of nonromantic romantic way.The first time I saw One Fine Day it was 1996 and I was seven years old. I didn't like it.  I found it tedious and boring.  Now I'm fourteen and I just finished watching and I love it?  I get all the jokes I didn't get now all the clever oneliners spoken with a bright witty confidence that is reminiscent of Frank Capra films.And clever they are!  I have to say when you subtract a few very few somewhat cheesy lines from the script it becomes perfect.  I'd go as far as to say Oscar worthy.  Yes you may think its cheesy that Jack's a famed newspaper columnist bringing down a mob member and the mayor and Melanie's an architect working on what we imagine is a multimillion dollar deal with big businessmen but the way it's presented is not that it makes sense it's that you don't care.  And that's not the focus of the film either the movie would rather be about the minglings of the two leads.And I have to say Clooney and Pfeiffer have great perfect chemistry. Clooney is his usual cool intense self whereas Pfeiffer is an uptight worrisome hard worker.  They play off each other perfectly.  It's not just their chemistry either their performances stand alone as emotional funny and smart.  I'd go as far as to call Pfeiffer's Oscar worthy.The style and direction in the film is also notable.  There are splitscreen conversations some long steadicam shots the whole placing of the camera fits perfectly with the lighthearted nature of the film.A fun witty lovable family film 7.510.".

Most of the moviegoers today expect blood gore darkness of warped minds and it seems that films which don't have that have a hard time getting a good review. It is time we step back and enjoy some of the subtleties of life and people and laugh at ourselves when it's all presented in a believable and funny way.The film takes us through one fine day of a single mother and her son and a single father and his daughter. Due to his error they miss their kids field trip and are reluctantly helping each other out take care of kids. While he obviously likes her but has a problem with trusting again and a questionable flirting tactics she is more obviously shell shocked and uses every opportunity to put him down.

Both kids were much better then I would normally expect them to be I am always put off by artificial adult gestures and too cool for you acting of today's kids in Hollywood films and expected that this time it would be the same but it was not.The humor in this film is subtle and you may actually miss it altogether if you expect things to blow in your face. I loved those brief encounters between Melanie Pfeiffer and Celia Amanda Peet in which a beautiful perfectionist with a heart Pfeiffer meets her less polite match... Amanda Peet was also fantastic! Just notice how Pfeiffer's facial expression changes when she realizes who she's talking to. Another one to watch and enjoy is the episode with Melanie's boss.Also this film can be watched more then once as there is a lot to appreciate about it. ps.

Maybe I was just at that age when I was starting to appreciate romance when I saw it in the cinema 3 times but I still feel this is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen and would definately recommend it to anyone. It's a great shame that a gem like this is so underrated. ALL of the acting is suberb. George clooney is entertaining as always in this film he made whilst it was still being debated as to whether he could transcend tv and become a movie star.".

Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney did a very good job playing two people who are divorced with a child afraid to commit to someone else and with a hectic life. One day they accidentally meet at the school where their kids go to school and during the day they keep meeting however they hate each other and don't want to see the other ever again. But as the movie progresses the relationship between the two changes from hating each other to liking to ... this is a romantic comedy I don't have to explain everything I hope.Even though some parts aren't excellent the entire movie is actually quite good and enjoyable. It shows a lot of stereotypes of course like the exhusband who doesn't want to help his exwife when she drowns in all the work and who needs him to take care of the kid the man who still seems to act like a little child... But when you can see past that it's an excellent movie to watch together with your wife or girlfriend. You'll both enjoy it. I give it a 710.".

This requires 2 main things 1. Two great actors with wonderful chemistry 2.

I loved all these movies for they simply worked to charme me. One Fine Day fits perfectly to this list. George Clooney  who proves that he can be a very funny guy and Michelle Pfeiffer  who gives a great performance in this movie have very good chemistry and the script is very funny and romantic with some really great oneliners. This movie entertained me very much and it wasn't boring as I saw it the second time. For it's charme and fun I give this movie 910.".

Two people meet and fall in love in a big city and they have a miserable time doing so. They don't realize they like each other until the end where they embrace in a passionate kiss. If that doesn't sound too fun to you there's the comedic side to the film. The two leads are played by Michelle Pfieiffer and George Clooney who seems to be filling in Mel Gibson's shoes in an otherwise wellsuited role. Clooney plays Jack Taylor a divorced newspaper reporter for the New York Daily News. Pfieffer plays Melanie Parker a busy working mom whose job has something to do with architecture.Both parents have kids. As always there is a boy and girl and the male Clooney has a daughter Maggie Mae Whitman and the female Pfieffer has of course a little boy Sammy Alex D. Linz. Is there a mathematical law in cinema that makes it mandatory for a member of a certain sex to have a child of the opposite sex?After missing their children's school trip both parents are left taking care of the kids. Melanie has an important job interview at 200 p.m. so she makes a deal with Jack He watches both children until 300 and she'll watch them for the rest of the day since he has to get a column for the newspaper written which supposedly takes an hour.Why do romantic films always make the leading man have a hardpressing job usually as a reporter and the leading woman have an even harderpressing job? We never fully grasp what Pfieffer's job really is but we know it must be very important otherwise she wouldn't need to be running around to job meetings all day which coincedentally she never really seems to be at  she's always in a cab or walking along a busy street blabbering away on her little 1996 cell phone.One Fine Day's alternate title could have been Cell Phone Tag because basically the two leads just walk around all day on their cell phones. Other hilarious segments include a child getting a marble stuck up his nose the two parents constantly losing their kids and other such humorous adventures.But the interaction between Pfieffer and Clooney seems real enough. They throw punch lines and verbal digs back and forth and we suspect that any minute one of them will jump through the other end of the phone slap each other and then embrace passionately. We know they are going to get together we sit and wait and sit and wait just waiting and the film drags on just about twenty minutes too long  and then they finally kiss as the kids watch The Wizard of Oz in a nearby bedroom and then she goes to freshen up and when she comes back he is asleep on the sofa and so she falls asleep next to him and then we pull up towards the night view of a backlit New York City with the image of two children watching their parents asleep on a sofa giggling and laughing. The first thing I thoughtpondered is Those kids look up to no good they're probably going to take their parents' credit cards and order gallons of ice cream and stay up all night watching Rrated movies. I guess I'm naughty.35 stars John Ulmer".

The high point of the movie was Robert Klein's cameo as a psychologist to whom Jack confides his feelings about Melanie.  In front of a 6year old they use the funniest barrage of word substitutions since the scene from Mel Brooks' High Anxiety where a youngster sits amidst a convention of psychiatrists discussing Freud's theory of peepee envy!But now as a recent George Clooney convert I admittedly rewatched this movie through rosecolored glasses. Both Clooney and Pfeiffer are convincing as frazzled single parents despite the fact that neither of them were actually parents offscreen. They also break two cardinal rules of acting never share a scene with children or animals. But they manage to do both well without losing audience attention or treating the kids as wooden stage props.Clooney wears his paternal role with a generous dose of charm and humor ... and a thin layer of dark chocolate! Contrast this with his portrayal of a bankrobbing vampire slayer in From Dusk Til Dawn and you'll realize the range of his craft! Pfeiffer is as beautiful an actress as they get but that asset is underplayed in this movie as in most of her movies. They make a good screen couple Their battleofthesexes banter is perfect and ontarget. There are just enough sparks between them to anticipate the denoument which is sweet and satisfactory.There is a lot of New York in this movie Central Park midManhattan the Circle Line the Museum of Natural History.  This is a wonderful light comedy for any Clooney or Pfeiffer fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Malle made only two films after this one Damage and Vanya On 42nd Street and it's tempting to view Milou en Mai as a rehearsal for Vanya though in the end the differences outweigh the similarities. It IS set on a country estate that is running to seed and there IS a 'Vanya' figure in Milou himself Michel Piccoli who more or less tends the estate in the absence of his siblings  one deceased one pursuing his own career. There IS a family gathering with all that that implies bickering truthtelling laughter tears accusations recriminations etc. Perhaps above all it is a MOOD piece which does put it in the same universe as Chekhov but it is ultimately too easy to read it in this way. It was a masterstroke to place it at the time of the student riots in Paris May 1968 and this strengthens the links with Chekhov who of course wrote his own masterpieces at a time when Russia was undergoing changes unacknowledged by his gentlefolk with their heads in the metaphorical sand of dachas serenely remote from the turbulence. This is a film of great lyricism and melancholia with a gentle Jazz music score by Stephane Grappelly and the action such as it is is kickstarted by the death of Milou's mother which necessitates summoning the family for the funeral. Again like Chekhov what we have here is an ensemble piece rather than Leading Man Leading Lady Juvenile Ingenue etc and the acting is uniformly excellent from MiouMiou as Milou's daughter Camille to Francois Berleand as the family lawyer who drives a red Alfa Romeo and still carries a torch for Camille to Valerie Lemercier in the small but telling role of Madame Boutelleau. The events in faroff Paris punctuate but are not allowed to dominate and barely to influence the action leaving the family  and nonfamily  to quarrel couple failtocouple and relate the occasional home truth. In short a lovely Autumnal movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Malle made only two films after this one Damage and Vanya On 42nd Street and it's tempting to view Milou en Mai as a rehearsal for Vanya though in the end the differences outweigh the similarities. It IS set on a country estate that is running to seed and there IS a 'Vanya' figure in Milou himself Michel Piccoli who more or less tends the estate in the absence of his siblings  one deceased one pursuing his own career. There IS a family gathering with all that that implies bickering truthtelling laughter tears accusations recriminations etc. Perhaps above all it is a MOOD piece which does put it in the same universe as Chekhov but it is ultimately too easy to read it in this way. It was a masterstroke to place it at the time of the student riots in Paris May 1968 and this strengthens the links with Chekhov who of course wrote his own masterpieces at a time when Russia was undergoing changes unacknowledged by his gentlefolk with their heads in the metaphorical sand of dachas serenely remote from the turbulence. This is a film of great lyricism and melancholia with a gentle Jazz music score by Stephane Grappelly and the action such as it is is kickstarted by the death of Milou's mother which necessitates summoning the family for the funeral. Again like Chekhov what we have here is an ensemble piece rather than Leading Man Leading Lady Juvenile Ingenue etc and the acting is uniformly excellent from MiouMiou as Milou's daughter Camille to Francois Berleand as the family lawyer who drives a red Alfa Romeo and still carries a torch for Camille to Valerie Lemercier in the small but telling role of Madame Boutelleau. The events in faroff Paris punctuate but are not allowed to dominate and barely to influence the action leaving the family  and nonfamily  to quarrel couple failtocouple and relate the occasional home truth. In short a lovely Autumnal movie.";

The film begins when a grandmother's death in the spring of 1968 reunites three generations of family at a country estate in southern France. But their mingled grief and affection is soon overshadowed by news of the student riots in faraway Paris and their already fragile bourgeois equilibrium is unbalanced by the distant echoes of uninhibited anarchy. The parallels between the family crisis and the world at large are obvious but rarely has a corpse lying in state been surrounded by so much activity private longings public declarations old resentments and new romances are all given sudden priority over preparations for the old woman's burial.

	schema:reviewBody "As the story begins an elderly woman is seen in her kitchen. Suddenly something strikes her and she dies in front of our eyes. Milou her oldest son living in the estate tries to notify the family that are scattered all over France. It is a difficult time for the country. May of 1969 marked a serious time for France as hordes of left wing individuals took to the streets in protest against one of the most beloved figures General Charles DeGaulle. As the family pours in the situation begins to turn ugly. Even in this peaceful corner in rural France people are seen in the country lanes singing The International and carrying communist flags. The first to arrive is Camille Milou's daughter. Married to a doctor and with three children her mind is on whatever can be sold to be divided among the heirs. Her love toward the dead grandmother is clearly not so strong.The other sibling Georges comes in with his English wife Lily a sensual woman much younger than her husband. Claire a niece by way of Georges and Milou arrives with a female companion showing obvious signs of being in a lesbian relationship. Claire's parents died in an automobile accident leaving her to claim a third of whatever is made out of what the family decide to sell.Everyone is surprised when Daniel the notary comes to read the dead lady's will. Adele the loyal servant has been made a lawful heir so the estate must be divided by four. Calculating Camille has taken care of stealing an emerald ring from her grandmother's jewelry chest without telling anyone. Claire is the only one that questions her cousin. Much bickering goes on as nothing is found to have great value but the land and its vineyards might bring a decent prize but Milou having lived in the place all his life does not want to part with it. To complicate the situation there is a problem with the burial of the dead lady. The grave diggers at the local cemetery are on strike so the woman continues to be laid out at the house without no clear solution in mind. That problem does not interfere with some merrymaking from the family as they get giddy with drink. The arrival of a truck driver who could not continue his journey because of the barricades and some scared neighbors make the group abandon the house and go into the adjacent woods where all kinds of mishaps befall them until the political situation gets clear and everyone can go back to their lives but leaving Milou alone in the house with his memories of happier times and abandoned by the clan.May Fools was one of Louis Malle's best films yet it is seldom seen nowadays. With a screenplay by Jean Claude Carriere and the director the film evokes Uncle Vanya a theme which Mr. Malle explored in his wonderful Uncle Vanya on 42nd Street on his last work for the screen. Against the turmoil in France during that fateful May the creators work to create an atmosphere about a family in crisis juxtaposing the action against the political situation reigning at the time. The idea of upcoming changes in France caused panic among the bourgeois family members as it presented a menace to their way of life as they knew it. The younger relatives took a different view in contrast with what was expected of them.The great Michel Piccoli made a wonderful patriarch figure in his take of Milou. His work in the film was among the best things he was called to play. Milou was powerless in the machinations that were all around him. Miou Miou's Camille shows a callous woman who is only interested in her own welfare not caring for the rest of the family. Dominique Blanc is excellent as Claire. The supporting cast impresses especially Harriet Walker Francois Berleand Michael Duchaussoy Bruno Carette Martine Gautier and Paulette Dubost who is the dead Mrs. Vieuzac throughout the film. Lovingly photographed by Renato Berta and with a jazzy musical score by Stephane Grappelli May Fools is worth a look by serious fans of the Louis Malle.".

	schema:reviewBody "While France is threatening to erupt into revolution during the beautiful spring weather of May 1968 a family of the haute bourgeoisie assembles at a large country house in the lovely Gers area of the SouthWest for the funeral of the matriarch and the division of her goods. The former is delayed because municipal workers including the gravediggers have all gone on strike while the latter is disrupted by two events. First the notary arrives to read the will which gives 25 of movables to the young housekeeper who has been comforting the eldest son Milou leaving only 75 for the family. Then the old lady's jewels are found short raided by a granddaughter who promptly renews an old association with the notary in the hay loft.So the time passes between and during meals with wrangles over material goods and many amatory diversions. One might almost think that this group of people most of whom who have little or no concern about the events convulsing their country are interested only in food money and sex plus a bit of music and marijuana. Aftre alarming reports of impending disaster on the radio and from rich neighbours panic seizes them. Abandoning the delightful house and without taking anything useful they irrationally hide in the woods. Cold wet and hungry they are saved by the housekeeper who finds them to give the news that President de Gaulle is back in charge of the nation and everything will return to normal. After at last burying the old lady the family return to their preoccupations the spectre of revolution has passed.Altogether it could be a posthumous piece by Buuel which is not surprising as the script is by his longlived and prolific collaborator JeanClaude Carrire. Surrealism has several outings from the opening where the eldest son calms his bees by declaiming Latin verse to the ending where his dead and buried mother returns to the empty house to dance with him. While the impotence of the bourgeoisie imprisoned in their obsessions recalls the trapped party in El ngel exterminador as well as the couples on their inescapable carousel in Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie the subsequent flight into wilds that are not Eden evokes La muerte en este jardn. In the end the character who really shows common sense and care for others is the housekeeper a workingclass woman.Despite many echoes of the provocative Spanish maestro this work is wholly French in feeling and execution. Even the one foreign actress Harriet Walter playing an Englishwoman speaks the language excellently.".

After her alcoholic father's death she decided to move back to her childhood home but once she got back in her old neighborhood she was immediately warned by her neighbor about the local paperboy who seemed to be a strange young sociopath with supernatural abilities. Unfortunately the boy immediately took a special interest in her and when he started calling her show reciting eerie nursery rhymes an unnerving game of catandmouse begins. As the game dangerously escalated she suddenly found herself in a terrifying allout war one that forced her to redefine her perception of sanity and had her fighting for her life.This is not a movie with pails of blood pouring out or tons of gore spewing about but I thought it was a nice mild suspense thriller that reminded me of the Twilight Zone days. If you're into stories like that then this is definitely one you wouldn't want to miss.This actually got a lot of negative review but I thought it was quite nice. Something you'd love seeing on TV on a slow weekend sort of thing. One of the many complaints made was the actor who played the antagonist and his being inappropriate to be cast as a paper boy. Granted he doesn't look like a boy but take into account his acting skills here I thought he made a pretty good job on his role.The story itself isn't perfect and yeah some choices the characters made were a bit questionable but isn't that how movie people have always been? Like how they go into a room when we're screaming for them not to? All in all I thought the actors were great and the story solid enough to see it through.".

The story is slightly similar to other movies of the past but because this has the supernatural twist and the constant guessing throughout it makes it not just a rehash if something already done in saying that this is really a film that will leave you guessing right up until the end and you may or may not like the ending but I guess it's 50 50.Rose McGowan has a great screen presence she has a kind of sweetness and honesty to her that really make you like the characters she plays and she can carry an entire film quite easily I think I hope more directors see what a great investment she could be. The youngster who plays the villain is is also really good the fact that he is always smiling kinda creeped me out a bit which is good because that's the point I guess.Yes it's no Jeepers Creepers but it is something a little different people should give it a go they may enjoy it just don't go in expecting full strength horror expect a thrilling drama that will scratching your head afterwards.

I couldn't give it any more than a 3 out of a sense of duty because someone had obviously put effort into this just a shame it is so mediocre.";

	schema:headline " Solid psycho thriller for genre fans";
	schema:reviewBody "Rosewood Lane is a quite solid mixture of a gripping psycho thriller and a haunting supernatural horror movie. It may not be an excellent film but it's an entertaining intense and suitable B movie for genre fans.The plot isn't the most original one and somewhat predictable for genre fans. On the other side the fact that the viewers might guess that certain events are going to happen even adds to the anxious anticipation. The movie's atmosphere plays with the audience's expectations. I also liked the somewhat controversial ending of this movie.Honestly said some of the characters in this film are rather shallow and quite stereotypical. Their actions are as predictable as stupid. Still the frustration and nervousness the viewer feels towards the characters raises the emotional connection to the film itself which is a positive element.The acting isn't extraordinary but solid enough to keep the audience interested until the end. The cameo appearances of cult actors such as Lin Shaye and Ray Wise are a nice gimmick for genre fans as well.The movie is directed by the controversial Victor Salva and has a similar style as his other movies such as the surprise hit Jeepers Creepers. This film includes several autobiographical elements since the director has had a complicated relationship with his family like the main actress and since he has already worked as a delivery boy similar to the main villain. These elements are well integrated into the story line and add some content to an ordinary plot depth to an average acting and emotions to an otherwise predictable effort.The atmospheric elements of this film are solid. The lighting techniques are suitable since a lot of scenes are taking place in the dark. The Locations are simple but efficient. The sound techniques are quite good and include uneasy moments of silence nervewrecking whispers and quiet sounds but also sudden noisy movements and spoken word passages. The score isn't unique but it adds to the sinister atmosphere. All these elements offer at least a handful of creepy moments throughout the movie and one or two light jump scares which is what I'm expecting from such a movie.Overall Rosewood Lane is a well done horror movie that turns out being entertaining over ninety minutes. It's not the kind of movie I would watch at the cinema purchase at full price or judge as a genre highlight but I would definitely watch it again suggest it for a horror movie night with a couple of friends and tell you that the harsh reviews are a little bit too cynical exaggerated and serious. Genre fans should try this flick out without any hesitation.".

While the death via catdoor was preposterous and foreshadowed like everything other scene it was still creepy and makes a good 30seconds of film. Unfortunately beyond that what's left is an hour and half of deadair.Rosewood Lane was one of those movies that would only work as one of those halfhour TV horror anthology episodes and even then it would only be a thirdranked show like Monsters. As a feature length it was just simply awful.Inept writing terribly predictable  including the enormously clichd camera anglessetups and a wandering plot that never narrows down the viewer to what it's really about are all just the tip of the eyesore this was. Further it was inconsistent incoherent unbelievable and it all led to an incredibly stupid ending that looked more like a deleted scene than the actual ending.Dr. Sonny Blake McGowan and her distractingly puffed up lips decide to move from the big city to the burbs one year following her abusive dad's death. Immediately she's warned to stay away from the paperboy but that didn't last long. The obviously evil paper boy reallife 29year old Daniel Ross Owens instantly begins his stalking of her.We know he's evil because 1 the old kook next door says to stay away 2 he's got black eyes  literally and 3 because he's far too old to be delivering newspapers on a 13yearold's bike.At any rate the stalking continues some characters believe Sonny some don't. Then they do then they don't. Then the police look somewhat concerned then not. Then they do again but finally they don't believe her. And all the while he's in and out and on her house more often than she's there  but no one doesdoes not believe her.See what I mean? This movie's all over the place it opens ideas and then rapidly shoots them down. It makes attempts at foreshadowing and even though most of that works to the point of utter predictability some of it doesn't.If the movie ain't bad enough you have to look at Rose's lips over and over and they are hideous. Before you think I'm criticizing her from an outward appearance I 100 believe she had to have botched plastic surgery. Oh those ugly LA girls and idiot surgeons. The fantastic parody group The Key of Awesome! did a well awesome job spoofing this with Pump Up Lips Parody  httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vZhCS8ZErTE.Side Note Even though this is the reverse effect I will never use the company Two Men And a Truck because of the hilariously OVER productplacement in the first act.

	schema:reviewBody "Rosewood Lane has a premise that would be a sheer nightmare to experience first hand. To see it happen to shallow characters lessens the overall experience into a drab ineffective muddle from a director clearly capable of churning out suspense on demand. Perhaps he works better with a higher budget and atmospheres that do not mirror those of soap operas.Despite being surrounded with controversy regarding his molestation case on the set of Clownhouse one of his first films I've always respected writerdirector Victor Salva in the field of suspense and ideas. The original Jeepers Creepers is a truly suspenseful horror film with solid writing aware directing and credible memorable suspense. Its sequel is a tad hokey with many flaws in its plot points and aesthetics but overall a capable horror film able to at least erect aspects that have made past thrillers successful. I didn't thoroughly despise it.Rosewood Lane feels like a work in progress. Its actors are wellfitted for the roles but everything else is the slowest of slowburn only it isn't building to much of anything. Take Ti West's Innkeepers a horror film released earlier this year. The film was selfaware of its atmosphere and completely capable of creating smart characters and intelligent realistic dialog. Rosewood Lane feels cold and tone deaf never achieving any suspenseful heights nor does it ever appear to be fully trying. Slowburn horror is one thing but a film that progresses slowly as a distraction to show it doesn't totally know what it wants to do or what it's doing is an unfortunately lethal blow to a film's attempt at likability. The needless cat murder doesn't help its reputation either.The plot Dr. Sonny Blake Rose McGowan is a talk radio psychiatrist working the late shift giving random callers life advice and direction. Dr. Blake decides to move into to her childhood home after her alcoholic father dies and upon moving in meets the deeply inept sociopath paperboy Derek Barber Daniel Ross Owens who lives next door. The paperboy who may or may not have had some sort of relationship with her father pesters Blake into oblivion but the results are not taut and scary but almost inherently laughable. Her first clue that something strange is up is when she sees that her dresser of nicknacks has been rearranged by someone not herself. For a TV horror film made for a network like USA or even Lifetime perhaps that would be mildly frightening. For an audience hungering for tricky tactics of suspense from the man behind Jeepers Creepers this is pretty thirdrate material.The performances are clearly gifted. Rose McGowan is admirably convincing in scenes that rest on her shoulders and one of my favorite character actors Ray Wise is present playing a detective hellbent on convincing Dr. Blake that nothing is happening. Despite something clearly being up he persists that there isn't and scenes following ones of that nature continue to play out this long winded excursion of strange kid does something victim notices victim contacts boyfriend and detectives they say she's crazy etc.One wonders if Victor Salva aspired to make something more frightening and one contemplates if the clearly miniscule budget paralyzed him to work with just the bare basics of horror filmmaking. If life is kind to him he will make more films. Ones more impressive than Rosewood Lane hopefully. And hopefully ones that don't feel gridlocked to conventions.Starring Rose McGowan Daniel Ross Owens and Ray Wise. Directed by Victor Salva.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most people are going to hate this movie and completely disagree with this review. However. that's the beauty of movies and your reactions to them every one has their own opinion and I really liked this film. Directed by Victor Salva of Jeepers Creepers fame the film centers on Sonny a young radio psychologist who after learning of her fathers death moves into his old house a year latersince she wasn't able to sell it. Almost immediately entering into the neighborhood she is warned not too interact with the creepy paperboy. After a creepy little introduction she begins getting harassed by him. But with no evidence and him being a minor no one takes it very seriously. But the harassment escalates to a violent level and she soon finds herself targeted as his next victim. There could have been a better film here if they elongated it in certain scenes cut back some goofiness and really went for a crazy kick ass ending. And Yes it sounds so terrible I know. A killer paperboy even I shun at the idea. But by some miracle they make the concept work for the most part. I was completely engaged throughout the proceedings the film is competently made and builds a surprising amount of tension created through some of the most ridiculous circumstances. As for the lead performance from Rose McGowan it's good enough to keep the movie moving along but nothing special. And as far as killer paperboy movies go this is the best of them lol. It's a really creepy suburban nightmare that never really explains whats going on but spends enough time indulging in the pure weirdness factor of it as well as completely committing to the concept for better or worse to creep you out. Sure the whole dogs chasing thing and the slightly annoying last scene are a bit much but it all makes for a surprisingly entertaining creepfest thats just a little unintentionally funny. 3.55".

This was a very eerie movie and not at all boring. I wouldn't call it a horror movie but a psychological thriller. Many in this genre have murdering psychopaths within them. Even though the story could be glossed over as reminiscent of this or that movie it still had it's own differences. Movies like this always have the characters doing something that the average person would not. They have to have that to move the story forward. I guess I'm the only one that noticed at the end there was one who died one who was only hurt and another not hurt at all. There appeared to be three of them. So to me there were three brothers who were identical and were doing all of these things. This explained why the old man said he saw him doing things a normal person couldn't because there wasn't just one. There were three triplets. Whether it was one that could divide up supernaturally that was never covered in this story and since one actually died I came to the conclusion by the ending there were three of them related to each other causing all the mayhem. They were all crazy and working together to terrorize first the father and next the daughter when she moved into her father's house. Obviously the whole town was scared of him them because they couldn't figure out how they could do some of the things like be in three places almost at the same time. The ending explained it.The acting was very good and Rose McGowan was an excellent choice for the lead. As for the actor playing the paperboy looking too old I have seen seventeen yearold young men that big and looking that old. Slicing and dicing all of the reasons they chose these actors particularly isn't helpful in a review. They wanted the characters to look a little off. It made you wonder what was going on and if there was something supernatural happening. I came to the conclusion there was not. There wasn't enough information to make one think so other than he was psychopathic. The conclusion explained why he could be on the phone and then be killing someone in the house. The character bled and could be hurt but it wasn't always the same person. I liked the movie and was never bored and on the edge of my seat. It isn't especially graphic which I liked. It could be that they had been separated at birth and found each other. I think they mentioned he had been adopted. I would have to watch it a second time I think to get all the details. The story left you wondering if the paperboy was a supernatural person or not. I decided that was what they wanted you to wonder and that the character was using the fact that no one realized there was more than one of them to terrorize the people of the town and Rose McGowan in particular. I am going to watch it again and see if I missed anything because I thought the movie was very good. Not a prize winner but entertaining.".

As for the actor playing the paperboy looking too old I have seen seventeen yearold young men that big and looking that old. Slicing and dicing all of the reasons they chose these actors particularly isn't helpful in a review. They wanted the characters to look a little off. It made you wonder what was going on and if there was something supernatural happening. I came to the conclusion there was not. There wasn't enough information to make one think so other than he was psychopathic. The conclusion explained why he could be on the phone and then be killing someone in the house. The character bled and could be hurt but it wasn't always the same person. I liked the movie and was never bored and on the edge of my seat. It isn't especially graphic which I liked. It could be that they had been separated at birth and found each other. I think they mentioned he had been adopted. I would have to watch it a second time I think to get all the details. The story left you wondering if the paperboy was a supernatural person or not. I decided that was what they wanted you to wonder and that the character was using the fact that no one realized there was more than one of them to terrorize the people of the town and Rose McGowan in particular. I am going to watch it again and see if I missed anything because I thought the movie was very good. Not a prize winner but entertaining.";

	schema:reviewBody "As one reviewer mentioned you can't really write anything about this movie that would be a spoiler. There is NOTHING in this movie that you don't see coming from a mile away. Well except for that by the end it never actually forms a cohesive story or gets any better. SPOILER!The opening scene was a foreshadowing of the movie's extremely flawed logic and believability. Our protagonist Rose arrives at her fathers house where the police are investigating the circumstances of his death. He's just been found dead at the bottom of the stairs to the basement. The detective not only lets her into the house but also asks the police to give her a moment alone with her father's corpse on the basement floor you know standard police procedure. It's been laying there for some time and has begun to decompose and she places her hand on his forehead while sobbing uncontrollably. This is MEANT to be an emotional scene a daughter grieving for the loss of her father and not WTF creepy. Seriously!From there is just does a logarithmic downward slide into dumb. The entire movie is a series of stale and tired horror clichs. Anything that could be thrilling is broadcast from miles away so NOTHING is surprising when it happens. The nursery rhyme thing is embarrassingly clich and makes the killer's even dumber and less convincing. While the movie gives you some history about the protagonist explaining why she should exist in the context of the story it never develops the paperman's character. Is he just a psychopath? is he some sort of supernatural evil being? Why hasn't anyone complained to the newspaper that their deliveryman is a monster who scares the hell out of them? He breaks into a women's house assaults a District Attorney and the police do nothing why? Speaking of which what the hell happened to the DA at the end of the movie? His disappearance and a threatening call to the main character's show a nursery rhyme...ughh was the setup for the final conflict but then they just completely forget about his character and never explain what happened to him. The movie ends at the paperman's funeral but WHO THE FK ARE THESE PEOPLE AT HIS FUNERAL!?!?! Who the hell would have even paid for it?!?! Nothing anyone does in the final scenes of the movie make ANY logical sense. The climax is laughably stupid. It's one of the worst and least satisfying endings I've ever seen. If you still feel compelled to watch because you want to know what is this disastrous ending we reviewers are talking about then here's what you do Watch the first 15 minutes then fast forward to about the 1hr 1min mark. Enjoy! All you need to know is that at some point in the movie the DA tells Rose a story about his childhood in which some bullies buried him in a hole with just a snorkel for air yeah I know that means he couldn't have been buried much more then 1.5 feet and should have easily been able to escape but whatever.. and he wasn't found for a long time. Also that's not her dog where did it come from? doesn't matter!. There is no point at all to watching anything in between. You're welcome!".

	schema:reviewBody "The films of writer producer director Billy Wilder are regarded as some of the finest works of cinematic art in the history of motion pictures. Wilder who with a handful of film pioneers such as John Ford Howard Hawks Anthony Mann John Houston and Henry Hathaway et al forged and created a unique style in the production of films that today are looked upon as enduring inspired and unsurpassed classics. In the case of Wilder such dramatic and sublime fare as Double Indemnity 1944 Ace In the Hole 1951 and Hollywood's greatest film about itself Sunset Boulevard 1950. Plus his comedies like The Apartment 1960 and Some Like It Hot 1959  regarded by many to be the funniest film ever made  can never let's face it be equalled. There is a timelessness and ageless quality about them that reaches out to anyone who watches them regardless of their generation. Contemporory film maker Cameron Crowe observed Wilder's work is a treasure trove of flesh and blood individuals all wonderfully alive.It is hard to believe that one of Wilder's earliest Hollywood efforts FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO was made in 1943. It seems to be a much later film in look approach and concept. Yet this quite intriguing spy drama was the result of the day's headlines being utilized by Wilder for the movie's scenario. Based on Lajos Biro's play Hotel Imperial it was superbly written by Charles Brackett and Wilder and sharply photographed in monochrome by John Seitz. It was produced by Brackett for Paramount Pictures and was masterfully directed by Wilder. Franchot Tone is British tank Corporal John Bramble who stumbles into a Sahara oasis hotel after crawling through the desert during the North African campaign in 1942. The Germans also arrive at virtually the same time headed by none other than the infamous German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel Erich Von Stroheim. Rommel and his command take up residence in the hotel run by nervous local Arab Farid Akim Tamiroff and an attractive Alsatian maid Mouche Anne Baxter. To conceal his identity Bramble pretends to be the hotel waiter and as such tries to find out from the formidable quest exactly where on the map the German arms dumps are located. With help from Farid and the maid and gaining Rommel's confidence he eventually acquires the information but not before Mouche sacrifices herself so that Bramble can leave and get back to the British lines.Performances are uniformly excellent! Tone gives an engaging portrayal of a reluctant spy. Anne Baxter has rarely been better than here in the role of the illfated Mouche and the amusing Akim Tamiroff as the ever fearful and stammering Farid is as appealing as ever. But the picture belongs to Von Stroheim! His striking performance just steals the show. Although the actor didn't resemble Rommel in the slightest his embodiment of the character is exactly what you would imagine the great German battlefield strategist should have perhaps looked like. Rommel himself died in 1944. It is interesting to ponder if he ever saw the picture and what his thoughts on Von Stroheim's flamboyant portrayal of himself might have been.Complimenting the picture throughout is the terrific score by Miklos Rozsa. Rozsa was one of Wilder's favourite composers and wrote the music for some of the director's best films like Double Indemnity 1944 Lost Weekend 1945 and The Private Lives Of Sherlock Holmes 1970. For FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO he wrote a spirited and heroic march to point up the British forces movements and a reflective and ravishing character theme for the maid Mouche which is given lovely renditions on solo violin.FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO is a superb and suspenseful spy thriller set in an atmospheric war background. And thanks to the great Billy Wilder it's a great movie that simply refuses to age in its appeal.Classic moment from FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRORommel sitting up in bed as Mouche Anne Baxter enters with his breakfast I don't like women in the morning he declares and when she pours his coffee and with a gesture of the back of his hand he instructs her to take two steps back please.".

	schema:headline " Billy Wilder Looks At Erwin Rommel";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1941 in the middle of a long list of bad news items from North Africa Prime Minister Winston Churchill did something very unusual for wartime. In addressing the House of Commons  Churchill admitted that the British were facing an enemy led by a brilliant general. It was the first time in modern history that an enemy leader gave a wave of approval in it's way to an enemy commander. That leader was of course Erwin Rommel the Nazi German commander of the fabled Afrika Corps.Churchill's note of admiration was one more element in the creation of the legend of the Desert Fox who defeated one British Army after another until defeated finally at El Alamein by a plan created by General Auchenleck but carried out by his replacement General Bernard Montgomery. Actually El Alamein simply stopped Rommel's drive to the Suez Canal  he and his men remained a viable opponent to the Allies in North Africa for another year even winning a humiliating defeat of American forces at Kasserine Pass in 1943. Then Hitler ordered Rommel back to Europe and his replacement lacking Rommel's genius was finally defeated. Rommel sent to stiffen the Western Wall in France from invasion eventually got involved in the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler and would be forced to commit suicide or find his family endangered by a vengeful Fuhrer. By the actions of 1944 Rommel the best known German military genius the Second World War produced gained a posthumous place as an eleventh hour member of the Allies.Rommel would of course be the first Axis figure to be honored by a film biography from Hollywood  THE DESERT FOX starring James Mason. But in 1943 he represent Prussian militarism. So when Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett made FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO they did not water down the nastiness of Rommel. Eric Von Stroheim former silent film director and now widely respected character actor was chosen to play Rommel and the character fit the brutal caricature with some light touches fortunately that Von Stroheim had developed a quarter century earlier when he played German soldiers in World War I films or when he played the commandant of the prison camp in Jean Renoir's LE GRAND ILLUSION.The plot begins when a British tank appears that has just been in battle with the Germans. It's crew is dead but for one man  Franchot Tone. Tone manages to stumble into a desert hotel that is run by Akim Tamiroff where there are two members of the staff. One is Anne Baxter a French girl and the other is a male servant who is not around. Subsequently Tone finds that the male servant has been killed in a bombing of one of the hotel's supply buildings. He assumes the identity of the dead man. Tamiroff is doubtful about this act of duplicity but remains silent out of a sense of pity for Tone's safety. Baxter is more openly hostile  she has lost family to Allied bombings in France and has been reduced to working in this backwater. But she keeps a watchful quiet on the scene  leaving Tone wondering if she will betray her or not. As she soon is taking up with German Lieutenant Peter Van Eyck Tone's his concerns for her increase.He realizes as the number of German troops coming grows that there is something big here. Soon he learns that Rommel is coming to the hotel for a brief rest before resuming his stunning sweep across North Africa. We see Rommel arrive but do not hear anything until later  when we see Rommel dictating a letter to High Command in Germany. He is standing like a colossus with his back to us playing with a swagger stick. He ends the letter comparing the speed of his advance through the desert with the forty years in the desert of Moses.When Von Stroheim learns that Tone is in the hotel he starts talking somewhat archly to him. Tone realizes that the servant was actually a gifted German spy. He keeps up the pretense to see what Von Stroheim might tell him. It's all centers on what the German calls the Five Graves to Cairo and Tone tries to figure out what it all means.I won't go into the rest of the story but Wilder does very nicely with it. His Rommel is not the future ally that Mason created in the 1950s but the cold ruthless brilliant enemy. He is a little arrogant  giving a military lecture to captured British officers led by Miles Mander but also capable of regretting the loss of promising German officers. Wilder stressed that not all of the enemy were bad. Fortunio Bonanova plays an Italian general who is a liaison to Rommel's army  and is extremely friendly and likable. Actually he is totally ignored and despised by the Germans who had sent the Afrika Corps to North Africa in 1941 after Italy was smashed by General Archibald Wavell's men in Libya. Bonanova's appearance and personality resemble the then famous Italian Fascist Minister of Aviation General Italo Balbo who had wanted Italy to remain friendly to the Allies or neutral as opposed to the views of Mussolini. For a film meant to beef up America's war effort and will to fight even while looking somewhat awestruck at a remarkable enemy figure FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO is a surprisingly sturdy film sixty three years later. I recommend catching it when it appears on television.".

	onyx:emotionText "In 1941 in the middle of a long list of bad news items from North Africa Prime Minister Winston Churchill did something very unusual for wartime. In addressing the House of Commons  Churchill admitted that the British were facing an enemy led by a brilliant general. It was the first time in modern history that an enemy leader gave a wave of approval in it's way to an enemy commander. That leader was of course Erwin Rommel the Nazi German commander of the fabled Afrika Corps.Churchill's note of admiration was one more element in the creation of the legend of the Desert Fox who defeated one British Army after another until defeated finally at El Alamein by a plan created by General Auchenleck but carried out by his replacement General Bernard Montgomery. Actually El Alamein simply stopped Rommel's drive to the Suez Canal  he and his men remained a viable opponent to the Allies in North Africa for another year even winning a humiliating defeat of American forces at Kasserine Pass in 1943. Then Hitler ordered Rommel back to Europe and his replacement lacking Rommel's genius was finally defeated. Rommel sent to stiffen the Western Wall in France from invasion eventually got involved in the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler and would be forced to commit suicide or find his family endangered by a vengeful Fuhrer. By the actions of 1944 Rommel the best known German military genius the Second World War produced gained a posthumous place as an eleventh hour member of the Allies.Rommel would of course be the first Axis figure to be honored by a film biography from Hollywood  THE DESERT FOX starring James Mason. But in 1943 he represent Prussian militarism. So when Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett made FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO they did not water down the nastiness of Rommel.

It's also interesting as a film made while the war was still going on far from demonising the enemy it provides a generous portrait of Rommel an unpleasant but human German army and a comedy Italian general for light relief. The plot also features a cynical Frenchwoman and a slightly racist realisation of an Egyptian in some ways it's surprising to see how little this almostfresh picture differs from those made later if anything since we discovered Auschwitz it's been harder to make a film that shows that humanises the Nazis.

	schema:headline " Excellent WWII adventure from Billy Wilder exciting literate and clever";
	schema:reviewBody "This WWII movie is an unexpected delight although coming from Billy Wilder the unexpected should be expected. The action in Five Graves to Cairo takes place in a fleabitten mud brick hotel on the edge of the North African desert. It's 1942 and Tobruk has fallen. Rommel and the Afrika Corps are driving toward Cairo and the only thing that can stop them is a lack of supplies. The English are worried. The Egyptians are testing the wind. And Rommel seems to be supremely confident. We shall take that big cigar from Churchill's mouth and make him say 'Heil'! he says with a smirk. He has reason to be confident. It's not the supplies which reach us he says. It's us who reach the supplies...thousands and thousands of gallons of petrol... and water ammunition and food. The only things that can stop him is a British tank corporal John Bramble Franchot Tone the fearful Egyptian owner of the hotel Farid Akim Tamiroff and the angry resentful hotel maid Mouche Anne Baxter. Bramble stumbled into the hotel after a tank battle that left the rest of his crew dead. Farid took him in reluctantly. Hours later Rommel and his army roared up and took over the hotel. Bramble had to disguise himself as Davos the clubfooted waiter who had been killed in an airraid and whose body lies buried in the hotel's basement. Rommel Erich von Stroheim arrives imperious and dynamic and suddenly greets Davos by name. It seems Davos had been a German agent. John Bramble now has to play a very careful game for his life...especially when Rommel brags about the work of a German archaeologist Professor Cronstettler who in the late Thirties supervised a number of digs...five to be exact...along the North African coast between Tobruk and Alexandria. Rommel shows Davos his map of Egypt. Could it be Bramble suddenly realizes that where the five letters...E G Y P T...are placed might also be the locations of...? Bramble must escape to Cairo. His information could prove the tipping point in Montgomery's plan to defeat Rommel. And Rommel believing Davos is a German agent decides to send Davos to Cairo to prepare the way for Rommel's triumphant entrance to the city. He wants no bombs thrown at him hidden in bouquets he says. He'll require a Lukewarm bath in the imperial suite. Oh yes and a command performance of Aida in German...omitting the second act which is too long and not too good. And then an ambitious German lieutenant discovers the real Davos' body in the basement. Now Bramble must leave before he is discovered. Farid must think of some plausible excuses. And Mouche must deliberately become a distraction. What is Mouche's role? Is there a romance? Not exactly. When the German's arrive she wants to turn Bramble in. Just give me five seconds before you do he asks her five seconds before you call the Germans. Just five seconds. What do you want to tell me about she asks cynically blood sweat and tears? Instead he scribbles something on a piece of paper and hands it to her. This is the address of my wife in London he says. He wishes he had something to give his wife and his son. Mouche looks closely at him then does not turn him in. Mouche however has a younger brother in a German concentration camp. She's prepared to do almost anything to save him. When it turns out to be too late she proves to be braver than almost anyone else. Five Graves to Cairo is a literate amusing and exciting war adventure. It works in part because of the clever script by Wilder and his partner Charles Brackett. It also works because of the performances of Franchot Tone and Erich von Stroheim. Tone was a fine actor undone by time and a messy personal life. He might not have been anyone's first choice as an action hero but in this movie we need a hero who is as clever as he is brave who is believable in being able to outfox Rommel and resourceful enough to get away with it. That he and Anne Baxter as Mouche do not fall into each others arms only adds to the sophistication of the film. von Stroheim dominates every scene he's in except when he comes up against Tone's underplaying. As Rommel von Stroheim sports a shaved head a horsehair fly whisk and an ostentatious German officer's hat. He's charming and he's imperious he's calculating and he's cynical. When Mouche pleads with him to intercede for her brother he simply stares at her and says This is a familiar scene reminiscent of bad melodrama. Billy Wilder delivers an unconventional war movie which remains entertaining and moving.".

Bramble had to disguise himself as Davos the clubfooted waiter who had been killed in an airraid and whose body lies buried in the hotel's basement. Rommel Erich von Stroheim arrives imperious and dynamic and suddenly greets Davos by name. It seems Davos had been a German agent. John Bramble now has to play a very careful game for his life...especially when Rommel brags about the work of a German archaeologist Professor Cronstettler who in the late Thirties supervised a number of digs...five to be exact...along the North African coast between Tobruk and Alexandria. Rommel shows Davos his map of Egypt. Could it be Bramble suddenly realizes that where the five letters...E G Y P T...are placed might also be the locations of...? Bramble must escape to Cairo. His information could prove the tipping point in Montgomery's plan to defeat Rommel. And Rommel believing Davos is a German agent decides to send Davos to Cairo to prepare the way for Rommel's triumphant entrance to the city. He wants no bombs thrown at him hidden in bouquets he says. He'll require a Lukewarm bath in the imperial suite. Oh yes and a command performance of Aida in German...omitting the second act which is too long and not too good. And then an ambitious German lieutenant discovers the real Davos' body in the basement. Now Bramble must leave before he is discovered. Farid must think of some plausible excuses. And Mouche must deliberately become a distraction. What is Mouche's role? Is there a romance? Not exactly. When the German's arrive she wants to turn Bramble in. Just give me five seconds before you do he asks her five seconds before you call the Germans. Just five seconds. What do you want to tell me about she asks cynically blood sweat and tears? Instead he scribbles something on a piece of paper and hands it to her. This is the address of my wife in London he says. He wishes he had something to give his wife and his son. Mouche looks closely at him then does not turn him in. Mouche however has a younger brother in a German concentration camp. She's prepared to do almost anything to save him. When it turns out to be too late she proves to be braver than almost anyone else. Five Graves to Cairo is a literate amusing and exciting war adventure. It works in part because of the clever script by Wilder and his partner Charles Brackett. It also works because of the performances of Franchot Tone and Erich von Stroheim. Tone was a fine actor undone by time and a messy personal life. He might not have been anyone's first choice as an action hero but in this movie we need a hero who is as clever as he is brave who is believable in being able to outfox Rommel and resourceful enough to get away with it. That he and Anne Baxter as Mouche do not fall into each others arms only adds to the sophistication of the film. von Stroheim dominates every scene he's in except when he comes up against Tone's underplaying. As Rommel von Stroheim sports a shaved head a horsehair fly whisk and an ostentatious German officer's hat. He's charming and he's imperious he's calculating and he's cynical. When Mouche pleads with him to intercede for her brother he simply stares at her and says This is a familiar scene reminiscent of bad melodrama. Billy Wilder delivers an unconventional war movie which remains entertaining and moving.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's remarkable how interesting a war time espionage film can be while at the same time requiring major suspension of disbelief throughout the story for various reasons. The major one here for me related to the character of actor Franchot Tone impersonating a German undercover spy. Throughout the entire film not one German officer or soldier thought it appropriate to address him in the mother tongue. There were plenty of opportunities as German was used sporadically in the story at various times. At least in the interest of being cautious with captured British officers around one would think Field Marshal Rommel Erich von Stroheim or Lieutenant Schwengler Peter van Eyck might have addressed BrambleDavos in German especially in the early going when all the characters at the Hotel Empress would have come under suspicion.Which brings me to my next point. You probably wouldn't need to know a thing about General Rommel to question why he would speak freely of German military strategy in the presence of English officers. I don't think so. As for the casting of Erich von Stroheim as Rommel there was no physical resemblance to speak of. My idea for the role would have been someone like Conrad Veidt who portrayed Major Strasser in the Bogart film Casablanca. Although with the timing of this picture shooting schedules might have overlapped between the two.One more thing before I'm through. I thought the gimmick with the map and the letters spelling out 'EGYPT' was a fairly clever plot element but there again a bit of thought brings a big question mark. Given that any of the letters on the map might have represented an area covering hundreds of square miles the resolution for the Allies wouldn't have been as precise as the story suggests. Even given a general area in which to unearth the hidden military supplies a fair amount of time would have been needed to discover a weapons cache.Still even with all the perceived glitches in the story I fond the story intriguing enough to hold my attention. All the principals did a good job and I particularly liked the character of Farid Akim Tamiroff who was downright hilarious at times under stressful circumstances. I was also moved by Bramble's response to the Alsatian maid Mouche Anne Baxter who had an overbearing concern for her younger brother who was a prisoner of the Nazis. It appeared Bramble made his point when he stated  It's not one brother that matters. It's a million brothers.".

As an average little suspense story it is OK not particularly thrilling and with a rather simple storyline.Why do some people praise Franchot Tone for his acting? Balderdash! This Englishman doesn't even have an English accent. But apart from that he only manages to get the job done in a sort of uninspired way Imagine what Bogart could have done with the role!. His portrayal of a meek cringing clubfooted waiter is so unconvincing as to be almost laughable.The Turner Classic Movies Network showed this movie as an example of a portrayal of Arabs in a positive light. Gasp! I can't believe somebody down there at TCM considers the character Fareed as a positive image. He's all cowardice handwringing forever flustered and running in circles begging not to be hurt in sharp contrast to the brave Englishman the tough French woman and the strutting Germans. He borders on being a comic character certainly a minor one who merely adds local colour and shows how superior the Europeans are. The only thing positive about his image is that he is working against the Germans although he's pretty much forced into that position after the single act of hiding the Englishman behind the bar when the Germans arrive afterwards he keeps begging the Englishman to go away and muttering to himself in a trembling voice about being shot against the nearest wall. The TCM presenter thought the Englishman's comment You're a great man Fareed was a great moment in American cinema but in fact Fareed had done nothing wonderful at all simply having opened a drawer and happening to notice that its newspaper lining had a familiar name on it. The Englishman called him great just out of his own excitement meaning nothing whatsoever about the character of Fareed. It was a complete nonmoment.Most reviewers admit that being made in 1943 it has propaganda elements. But the truth is that it's much worse than that dealing in the barest stereotypes so bad as to be cartoonish. An Italian general can't stop singing opera arias and shrinks like a sullen scolded child when the Germans put him in his place for stepping out of line. The French chambermaid is pretty and offering to trade sex for favours was that supposed to be a French accent Anne Baxter was speaking with?. The Germans are arrogant and dominating. The English officers are easygoing and likable. The Arab is timorous and cowardly.".

The only thing positive about his image is that he is working against the Germans although he's pretty much forced into that position after the single act of hiding the Englishman behind the bar when the Germans arrive afterwards he keeps begging the Englishman to go away and muttering to himself in a trembling voice about being shot against the nearest wall. The TCM presenter thought the Englishman's comment You're a great man Fareed was a great moment in American cinema but in fact Fareed had done nothing wonderful at all simply having opened a drawer and happening to notice that its newspaper lining had a familiar name on it. The Englishman called him great just out of his own excitement meaning nothing whatsoever about the character of Fareed. It was a complete nonmoment.Most reviewers admit that being made in 1943 it has propaganda elements. But the truth is that it's much worse than that dealing in the barest stereotypes so bad as to be cartoonish. An Italian general can't stop singing opera arias and shrinks like a sullen scolded child when the Germans put him in his place for stepping out of line. The French chambermaid is pretty and offering to trade sex for favours was that supposed to be a French accent Anne Baxter was speaking with?. The Germans are arrogant and dominating. The English officers are easygoing and likable. The Arab is timorous and cowardly.";

	schema:reviewBody "As you may have read in the trivia section on IMDb for this film none of the four leads are the actual nationality of the characters they are portraying. While three of them do very credible jobs the leading man Franchot Tone sounds absolutely nothing like an Englishman. If they had said he was a Canadian as many Canadians DID serve in North Africa it could have worked a bit better. This isn't saying that Tone's acting was badhe was very good. He just didn't have the proper accent or anything close to it.The film is a reworking of the film HOTEL IMPERIALa film doomed because of massive problems with its female leads. This problems with HOTEL IMPERIAL are discussed at great length in the book The Hollywood Hall of Shame The Most Expensive Flops in Movie History. In light of this it's very surprising that FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO was such a great successboth at the box office and when seen todaysince it holds up very well.The film begins with the defeat of the Brits in a battle with the Germans in North Africa. Franchot Tone is separated from his army and wanders into a hotel in an oasis town. He is delirious with heat stroke and collapses on the floor. The manager Akim Tamiroff aids him and hides Tone when the Nazis enter the town. Later after Tone has recovered he passes himself off as an Alsatian native. The ruse works only too well as the big bossman Erich von Stroheim as Field Marshall Rommel meets with Tone and begins talking about Tone's job as a German spy! It seems that the dead man who Tone is impersonating was working for the Germansand bit by bit Rommel tells him about a very important secret that might assist the Germans to take all of North Africa. Tone has to decideshould he murder Rommel or learn about the plot and get back to the British? See the film to see how all this works outand to see how a very pretty young Anne Baxter fits into all this.Overall the film is well acted directed and has nice writing. Apart from Tone's being cast as an Englishman there isn't much I'd change about the film as it manages both to be a good propaganda film AND a film that still is interesting today because it lacks many of the usual clichs you'd see in most WWII films made during the war. Exceptional.".

Soon the Nazis arrive led by Erwin Rommel a commanding performance from Erich von Stroheim and Tone takes the place of a German spy working at the hotel who was killed the night before. It's not typical Wilder perhaps but it is interesting with a lot to recommend about it.

	schema:reviewBody "Trapped in a hellish copyright limbo for over a decade Thom Eberhardt's Night Of The Comet is a film whose reputation is due for a serious rehabilitation. Generallyand wronglycategorized with typical 80s teen horror films Comet is in fact a smart skillful parody of the lowbudget scifi horror classics of the 50s 60s and 70sand a wry commentary on teen culture in the 1980s as well. For those familiar with the original films the parody clues are all over the placenot least of which is that the early part of the film takes place in the back of LA's classically offbeat El Rey movie theatre which is showing lowbudget B horror movies. Most of the scary scenes are preceded subtly or otherwise by the famous red light warning used commonly in the 60s and 70s. And the apocalyptic plot settings and dialog especially among the scientists are straight out of the 50s. Catherine Mary Stewart is by far the centerpiece of the movie as Reggie the only teenage girl in Los Angeles who's both a lowlypaid theatre usher and an expert with assault weapons. She is most definitely not a Valley Girl. A preVoyager Robert Beltran is Hector date night in the barrio Gomez the classic bmovie hero and far more engaging here than his stoic dryasbones role for the McTrek franchise. Kelli Maroney brings the totally 80s camp value as Valley Girl Samantha who realizes with horror that her pool of potential Izodclad boyfriends has just shrunk dramatically. Geoffrey Lewis sheds his mostly Western image here as the deliciously megalomaniacal leader of the researchers whose taste for superscience soon gives way to a craving for hot buttered gray matter. Eberhardt is a canny director who doesn't miss a trickthe scares are rare but when they come they'll get you. The gore is minimal but the atmosphere of malevolence gets progressively thicker until the climax. The tightrope between comedy and fright is skillfully toedundead droog stockboys anyone? The effects may not be the digitized visual pablum people take for granted these days but in a way they're more engaging for their rawness. Anyone who thinks this was a lowbudget movie has never tried to completely empty out downtown Los Angeles at 7 am for a film shoot. Thom Eberhardt should be hailed for his brilliantly sharp funny script and his deft execution as director. Veteran scifiindiehorror actress Mary Woronov is Night Of The Comet's direct physical and spiritual link to the golden days of the genre. She's passing the baton here to a new generation of camp scifihorror fans. That nobody has thus far picked up that baton is a tragedy. To address a distressingly common misperception the comet in question is not Halley's comet. Both infilm plot elements and the film's tagline suggest this comet only appeared once before when it wiped out the dinosaurs. Halley's comet on the other hand has had more comebacks than Cher.Night Of The Comet works pretty well the way a lot of people view itas a simple 80s cheesy scifi comedy. But as with Rocky Horror if you've seen the original material it's spoofing the results are a hundred times more rewarding. A future DVD release is a must.".

Halley's comet on the other hand has had more comebacks than Cher.Night Of The Comet works pretty well the way a lot of people view itas a simple 80s cheesy scifi comedy. But as with Rocky Horror if you've seen the original material it's spoofing the results are a hundred times more rewarding. A future DVD release is a must.";

	schema:reviewBody "There's a lot worth forgetting about the 80's but one of the few things that decade of big hair and keyboarddrownedmusic had was some of the best horror and scifi comedies of any time. There have been funny scary movies before and scary funny movies since but some of the best examples of those perfectly balanced action horror and science fiction comedies were made in the 80's. I'm thinking of other good ones like Fright Night American Werewolf in London Big Trouble in Little China and on maybe a level or two below films like Return of The Living Dead and Toxic Avenger. Some people use the term spoof when referring to a lot of these movies but that's the wrong word in my opinion. Naked Gun and Airplane were spoofs movies like Night of the Comet and Fright Night were genuine horror films that had a nice mixture of scares drama and tongueincheek laughs. All of these elements of different genres are what made these movies unique.While classic might be a little too strong of a word to describe Night of the Comet I agree with most other folks here that it is a great lowbudget 80's movie maybe not lowbudget but definitely not bigbudget. There was a vast amount of postapocalyptic lowbudget horror films in the 80's but this is one that stands apart due to writerdirector Thom Eberhardt's sharp don'ttakeitalltooseriously slant. Just the idea alone of two valley girls being among the small group of survivors of a world ending disaster is pretty cool. It took a familiar science fiction idea and made it somewhat original. But more importantly it was perfect for the times. Take Dawn of the Dead mix in Valley Girl and Fast Times at Ridgemont High and you've got an excellent foundation for scares action drama and of course laughs.The acting all around is very good for this type of flick and while it certainly isn't perfect the entertaining and fun spirit of the movie make up for any flaws. It also can't be said enough that the presence of Catherine Mary Stewart definitely helps to elevate the movie. She was one of the most beautiful and underappreciated actresses of the 80's and despite being in a few bigger movies and shows The Last Starfighter Nighthawks Mischief Weekend at Bernie's Days of Our Lives etc... she just never really became the household name she seemed destined to be. Although no doubt she has plenty of fans like me. Unlike many lead actresses of the day in this genre she was actually a very capable actress. Both she and Kelli Maroney give knockout performances as two teenage girls just trying to cope with braineating zombies and the end of the world.If curiosity about this movie has led you here then I would pay little attention to the few negative reviews and trust the fact that the large majority of comments here are positive about this film. Maybe Night of the Comet isn't a forgotten classic by the normal standards but it was certainly a cut above the typical lowbudget horrorpostapocalyptic movies of the 80's and deserves to be seen by many. What it doesn't deserve is its current state of obscurity its toolow rating on IMDb and to not be available on DVD. That's the real shame of it all.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've seen any film such as The Day After The Stand Armageddon Independence Day or even the recent extravaganza The Day After Tomorrow the end of the world would seem to be pretty serious business for us to have to deal with sometime down the road. Film directors one and all want us to believe it's all doom and gloom what with asteroids zooming around haphazardly in space aliens needing to ravage us and the planet global warming screwing up the weather or some deadly virus escaping some government lab infecting mankind with a super flu. Thom Eberhardt doesn't quite find it such a dreary proposition and in fact finds quite a bit of humor in the situation by way of telling the story of two of the survivors teenagers Reggie Belmont Catherine Mary Stuart and her sister Sam Kelli Maroney.Somewhere out there in the final frontier where no man has gone before is a comet zipping around with nothing better to do but to pay all of us here on earth a quick friendly visit. No it doesn't exactly have earth's name on it but it does want to take a cue from Top Gun and do a major fly by just so it can get up close and personal. Of course since we're a partying kind of planet we decide to have one big planet wide comet festival just to welcome it into our solar system. There are comet tee shirts comet hats people have comet barbecues and everything is just one big comet celebration. One of these comet parties is being held by Doris Belmont wicked step monster to Reggie and Sam. Reggie and Sam's father is off doing army duty and it's left up to Doris to keep the two girls safe and out of trouble or as in Doris's case be a first class bitch while screwing the next door neighbor on the side. After an argument with Doris Reggie ends up in a projection room at a local theater and Sam ends up.well more about that in a moment. Eventually the comet does pass overhead and being the grateful kind of comet that knows how to treat its host it leaves us all a present by turning the vast majority of the human population into orange pixie dust.Of course if you happen to be one of the very lucky few like Reggie and Sam you may have survived. It turns out if you were in a dwelling of some sort completely encased by steel then you also woke up the next morning to see the dawn's early light. Reggie having spent the night in the theater projection room which just happens to be steel lined does survive. Sam who found herself somehow spending the night in a trash dumpster survives also. However if you were only partially protected by a steel enclosure then you only get to survive temporarily which also means you get to play zombie for a while before you disintegrate into a pile of dust bunnies. Then there are those scientists who were aware of the danger but instead of warning us all to momentarily hop into our Kenmore refrigerators they built themselves a huge enclosure to protect themselves with. So not only are they extremely selfish scientists they are also straight out of the Fred MacMurray School of Absent Minded Professors because although I'm sure they wear their seat belts and lock their car doors they somehow forget to close the vents on their Comet Proof Bomb Shelter. What that means is they need to track down Sam Reggie and other survivors who may pop up here and there in order to find a cure before they have to begin their own auditions for George Romero.If it all sounds kind of goofy and wacky it certainly is all of that. Early in the film you may have a bit of trouble buying into the proceedings but you'll eventually be seduced by the perkiness and charm of Stuart and Mulroney and the witty dialog that inhabits Eberhardt's script. For instance when Reggie returns with an arsenal to fight off zombies Reggie complains that Dad would have gotten us Uzis'. And what are two teenage girls to do when faced with the apocalypse? They play D.J. on the only radio station still broadcasting they vie for the affection of the only guy available and they lift their spirits by going shopping at the mall to the music of Girls Just Want to Have Fun. As for special effects they aren't much to speak of but we don't care because it's the script carrying the film anyway. It's obvious that Eberhardt was working from a somewhat miniscule budget and although there are a few scary moments when Zombies pop out of nowhere it's the whole premise of two Valley Girls trying to survive in a desolate Los Angels while being chase around by monsters and evil scientists that will win you over. It's obvious from the narration in the opening moments that this is a B movie but Eberhardt keeps things on track by never taking himself seriously or asking us to which is a major requirement in a film of this nature.Night of the Comet is not currently available on VHS or DVD. You may catch it on Cable at some point if you don't own it. Your only other alternative is to purchase it on Ebay at your own risk. I was lucky enough to have taped it some years ago and am glad of having done so.It takes an offbeat sense of humor to make a film like Night of the Comets and have it succeed as well as it does. It takes a quirky sense of humor for someone watching it to appreciate the film for what it is a cheesy plothole ridden B movie with a lot of odd but good natured humor and with two lead actresses that are good enough to take us along for the ride. I bought it hook line sinker cheap special effects and everything else that went with it. And if I can buy into all this I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Night of the Comet is a B. Now excuse me for a second while I go check out the vents on my comet shelter.".

Its the ultimate fantasy film asking the question most people have asked themselves namely what would it be like to be the last people alive on earth.Reggie and Samantha are two bickering teenage sisters only united in the passionate hatred of their stepmother Doris who has an equal hatred for the girls. The Comet is big news and everyone is getting ready for the big event except for Reggie and Samantha who have other things on their mind... The next day comes and mixed with all the revellers party hats is a mysterious sand. No one seems to be around....The premise of the film is good and whilst the acting is not the best it is still perfect for this kind of film. The characters DO have development and aren't just cardboard sketches. The zombies aren't the biggest part of the film but when they make their appearance they do please.This film is always missed off from the classical zombie flic list usually due to its 'hollywood teenager' aimed audience. Most zombie fans ignore it on the basis that it doesn't seem to be a zombie film whilst the nonzombie fans miss out because they don't like the science fiction element. I'd love to see this film transfered and cleaned up for DVD release especially now that more and more films of this genre are making their appearance on DVD.Don't expect a brilliant script or brilliant actors. I'd say this one is similar to the film 'dead heat' in terms of its zombie load expect to jump once at least and 'my best friend is a vampire' for its fantasy element.".

	schema:reviewBody "Night of the Comet is a truly fun and engaging little genre effort of the 80's but surely some of its hardcore fans are slightly overestimating the value and significance of this film. I've encountered reviews stating that Night of the Comet is a quintessential gem of 80's horror and that it's easily one of the most intelligent tributesparodies to older Bmovies ever made. Okay the script is quite clever and writerdirector Thom Eberhardt definitely knows a lot about all the postapocalyptic classics of the 50's and 60's but I honestly doubt it ever was his intention to direct the ULTIMATE homage. Night of the Comet is more like a miniaturetribute! All the obligatory story lines and sub plots to create an endoftheworld epic are present but Eberhardt's only disposed of a limited budget and thus the elaboration is only smallscaled and rather cheesy. There are mutated zombies crazed scientists and hostile groups of survivors on the rampage but all just in small doses. The movie opens during a bright summer evening when the entire world is preparing to see a mesmerizing and onceinalifetime ecological phenomenon namely the passing of a comet. Two highschool teenagers who missed out on the event sisters moreover what are the odds? wake up the next morning and slowly realize that the comet's radiation killed every human being in L.A only leaving behind small piles of red dust. They entrench themselves in an abandoned radio station meet up with another sole and male survivor battle the occasional mutated zombie and  of course  go shopping without credit cards. Things get slightly more dangerous when a bunch of dying scientists who predicted the extinction of the human race try to abduct the survivors to steal their still uncontaminated blood. The tone of Night of the Comet is continuously lightheaded still director Ebarhardt manages to maintain a more or less sinister atmosphere which never allow you to forget that the whole of mankind just got wiped out. The girls although mostly concerned about fashion trends and pop music understand the seriousness of the situation and deal with it the best way they possibly can. There are still a handful of creepy sequences the confrontation in the mall and welldeveloped SciFi ideas the diabolical scientists but the emphasis largely lies on the two girls and their typically 80's popculture lifestyles. I've never heard this many campy popsongs in one movie not even in a musical and the special  makeup effects are kept to a minimum. The acting performances of Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney are more adequate than you'd expect as it certainly isn't easy for young actresses to portray teenage character that are stereotypical ignorant fashionable and yet likable at the same time. Night of the Comet certainly isn't brilliant probably even a bit overrated by its fans but still worth a peek in case you have a weakness for 80's cinema.".

That's why I feel a little bad for rating it 510 because this is not completely boring and it is also a little funny.The plot is simple the world ends for ridiculous reasons not worth mentioning with most people disappearing while people that accidentally spent their night in a metal case survive. Some are in between in which case they disintegrate slowly and behave like aggressive zombies. The survivors in our film are two adolescent girls. They are as cute as they are clueless so 80's aerobic music and automatic guns don't help at all. There are also some scientist guys that seem to be part of another movie until they meet up at the end.After the first 15 minutes you feel the heroin is dumber than a doorknob but she smarts up considerably at least in a relative sense when her sister enters the scene. Any science is absent from the movie. The scary parts are few and not really scary. What brought out a sense of terror in me was the soundtrack which is all 80's dance music. Thankfully for Robert Beltran his role was small so the exposure was minimal. The girls were cute and there were some semi dressed scenes but the 70's were over and the prude period had already started in the States so nothing of importance.Bottom line The goofiness factor here is off the scale. The movie is both below average and completely funny. The hair of the girls alone is 10 of the entire footage. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone but it might make a nice MysT3k film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Night of the Comet starts as the world prepares for a once in a lifetime event the passing of a 65 million plus year old comet. Instead of watching the light show Regina Belmont Catherine Mary Stewart decides to spend the night with cinema projectionist Larry Dupree Michael Bowen in his booth... They awake the next morning  as Larry attempts to leave the cinema he is attacked  killed by a zombie the same zombie attacks Regina but she manages to escape where upon she discovers that almost everyone on the entire planet has been turned into red dust. Almost everyone because by some amazing coincidence the only other person to survive happens to be her sister Samantha Kelli Maroney they desperately search for more survivors  meet up with a long distance trucker named Hector Gomez Robert Beltran. Meanwhile an evil bunch of scientists need human blood to develop a serum to save themselves from turning into dust  they're on the look out for unwilling donors...Written  directed by Thom Eberhardt I found Night of the Comet a pretty rubbish viewing experience I'm surprised at the amount of positive comments on IMDb about it because I just thought it was boring crap that never lived up to it's potential. The script starts off 100 miles an hour with the obliteration of the entire population of Earth  a zombie attack but then it goes absolutely nowhere  then eventually introduces the sinister blood stealing scientists towards the end of the film because by that time the slim story has run it's course. There are plot holes too if these scientists want blood why shoot the three or four gang members  save the two sisters when the guys would have provided more blood for their experiments killing them just seemed a totally bizarre  an almost suicidal thing to do considering they need blood to develop a cure it just doesn't make sense I mean if your going to die  you need to experiment on human blood would rather have five or six donors providing blood or just two? I'm not having the fact that the two sisters survived independently of each other I mean what are the odds on that? When Hector confronts the female scientist for the first time she never mentions Samantha or where she was or where the underground facility was where they took Regina before she committed suicide so how did Hector know these things? I also thought after the first twenty odd minutes the film slows down to a snails pace  became incredibly boring  dull to watch after hearing so many good things about it Night of the Comet comes across to me as nothing more than an overrated boring piece of crap.Director Eberhardt does a really good job I liked the look of the film with it's red tinted sky  he manages to create a really cool atmosphere of isolation. Unfortunately there are far too many shots of empty streets there are constant montage's of empty streets deserted roads  abandoned buildings  it gets extremely repetitive  dull. OK we get it there's no one else about so there's no need to keep ramming it down our throats by constantly showing roads without cars on them. The zombies are totally wasted there are two zombie attacks in the entire film  that's two individual zombies as well although there are a couple of effective nightmare scenes. Night of the Comet pays homage or ripsoff whichever you prefer several other much better films including the obligatory end of the world shopping spree in a mall lifted from Dawn of the Dead 1978. Forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any.Technically Night of the Comet is pretty good the special effects are decent enough  the production crew were obviously very good at closing streets off. The acting was alright expect for Maroney as Samantha the airhead blonde who became highly irritating.Night of the Comet was a big disappointment for me I had hoped for so much more. Persoanlly I found this film dull boring uneventful  the puke inducing sequence where the sisters go shopping to the tune of 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' is probably the worst moment in the film. Really bad  I just don't get why so many people like this I'm sure I'll get slaughtered for saying it so let the abuse begin I can take it...".

	onyx:emotionText "Night of the Comet starts as the world prepares for a once in a lifetime event the passing of a 65 million plus year old comet. Instead of watching the light show Regina Belmont Catherine Mary Stewart decides to spend the night with cinema projectionist Larry Dupree Michael Bowen in his booth... They awake the next morning  as Larry attempts to leave the cinema he is attacked  killed by a zombie the same zombie attacks Regina but she manages to escape where upon she discovers that almost everyone on the entire planet has been turned into red dust. Almost everyone because by some amazing coincidence the only other person to survive happens to be her sister Samantha Kelli Maroney they desperately search for more survivors  meet up with a long distance trucker named Hector Gomez Robert Beltran. Meanwhile an evil bunch of scientists need human blood to develop a serum to save themselves from turning into dust  they're on the look out for unwilling donors...Written  directed by Thom Eberhardt I found Night of the Comet a pretty rubbish viewing experience I'm surprised at the amount of positive comments on IMDb about it because I just thought it was boring crap that never lived up to it's potential. The script starts off 100 miles an hour with the obliteration of the entire population of Earth  a zombie attack but then it goes absolutely nowhere  then eventually introduces the sinister blood stealing scientists towards the end of the film because by that time the slim story has run it's course. There are plot holes too if these scientists want blood why shoot the three or four gang members  save the two sisters when the guys would have provided more blood for their experiments killing them just seemed a totally bizarre  an almost suicidal thing to do considering they need blood to develop a cure it just doesn't make sense I mean if your going to die  you need to experiment on human blood would rather have five or six donors providing blood or just two? I'm not having the fact that the two sisters survived independently of each other I mean what are the odds on that?

Both Stewart and Maroney are good in their parts but I can't say I loved either character. There certainly wasn't enough zombie action.Again if you love this picture then I can understand why.

All that remains of their friends neighbors and city dwellers is dust marking the clothes they wore before the comet disintegrated them. Those that didn't receive immediate exposure to the radioactive comet..and weren't lucky enough to have been inside a metallic structure like Regina and Samare slowly dying by a plague slowly turning them into zombies. Regina and Samantha make it for a radio station believing the voice across their radio is a survivor find that it was a recording but do meet HectorRobert Beltran. Hector is a kind truck driver who was in the back of his truck trailer with a female hitcher when the comet came across the sky. Trying to reach out for other possible survivors across the air waves are heard by scientistsincluding cult fave Mary Woronov and character actor Geoffrey Lewisslowly dying from the plague. The scientists believewell not Woronov who has accepted her fate as the plague has accelerated causing loss of memorythat blood from those not effected by the comet can create a serum. This is probably false hope stemming from desperation as the scientists are losing their memory and becoming not only for irritable but dangerous as their plague is taking over. Certain peril often comes Reg and Sam's way as they pursue some sort of life outside of the apocalyptic situation probing a mall. In that mall is a pack of dyingnearly turninginto zombies and insane gang of thugs who wish to kill Reg and Sam. They will square off in a gun fight. Also Reg will have to deal with the scientists wanting to extract blood from her while they believe Samdue to her scratching around the neck because of bad nerveshas received the plague. Hector will return to San Diego for a short spell to try and see if his mother was a victim. Returning he'll have to rescue Reg from possible doom as those scientists also plan to extract blood from a couple of healthy kids found.Irresistible genre mixer combining elements of zombies Valley Girl satire apocalyptic scifi and counterculture humor. It all works surprisingly well as this film is quite entertaining. But the female leads are so wonderful to watch that they overcome some of the film's shortcomings. There's nothing funnier than seeing Sam firing off a semiautomatic at a car as her target for practice. To explain how these girls are able to escape some scruffy situations is that their father was a Vietnam vet who finally figured out that his children were girls. Not gory at all as zombie films often are. The film plays up the apocalyptic angle more and is successful at that. I think the 80's nostalgia factor is what makes the film so easy to like because the females are a product of yuppie consumerism.".

Smug pretentious knowitall smart alecs get wasted while mindless selfcentered children survive and then prevail. You would just have to be unaware of American social structure not to get it. I saw it because I loved Mary Woronov. The final joke of the movie was that everyone thought it would be a star vehicle for Mary Elizabeth Stuart and instead it was Robert Beltran who went on to hit it big with Star Trek Voyager. I'll bet this movie was prominent on his resume when he auditioned for Roddenberry.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Night of the Comet was a witty comment on the America of the 1980's. I remember seeing the movie right after it came out and I thought whole thing was a hoot. Smug pretentious knowitall smart alecs get wasted while mindless selfcentered children survive and then prevail. You would just have to be unaware of American social structure not to get it. I saw it because I loved Mary Woronov. The final joke of the movie was that everyone thought it would be a star vehicle for Mary Elizabeth Stuart and instead it was Robert Beltran who went on to hit it big with Star Trek Voyager. I'll bet this movie was prominent on his resume when he auditioned for Roddenberry.";

	schema:reviewBody "This the French La Femme Nikita directed by Luc Besson is one of the strangest most bizarre yet psychologically truest movies ever made. The story on the surface is absurd and something you'd expect from a grade 'B' international intrigue thriller. Anne Parillaud plays Nikita a bitter drugdependent unsocialized child of the streets who is faster than a kung fu fighter and packs more punch than a Mike Tyson bite. She's killed some people and is given a choice between death and becoming an assassin for the French government.This premise should lead to the usual actionadventure yarn with lots of fists flying guns going off people jumping off of buildings roaring through the streets in souped up vehicles spraying bullets etc. as blood flows and bones shatter. And something like that does happen. However there is a second level in which Nitika becomes the embodiment of something beyond an action adventure heroine. She is coerced and managed by society. Her individuality is beaten out of her so that she can be molded into what the society demands. She comes out of her 'training' with her individuality compromised her free and natural spirit cowed but undefeated and alive and she sets out to do what she has been taught to do. And then she falls in love. And she notices somewhere along the way amid the murder and the mayhem that there is something better than and more important than and closer to her soul in this world than killing and being killed. She finds that she prefers love to hate tenderness to brutality. She sees herself and who she is for the first time but it is too late. She cannot escape. Or can she?Parillaud brings a wild animal persona tinged with beauty and unselfconscious grace to the role of Nikita. Marc Duret plays Rico the tender man she loves and Tchky Karyo is her mentor Bob whom she also loves. Jeanne Moreau the legend has a small part as Amande who teaches Nikita lipstick application and how to be attractive.Now compare this to the US remake called Point of No Return 1993 starring Bridget Fonda. Please do not even consider the vapid TV Nikita. What's the difference? Well Fonda's flashier I suppose but nowhere is there anything like the psychological depth and raw animal magnetism found in the original. The Fonda vehicle is simply a onedimensional action flick stylishly done in a predictable manner. Besson's Nikita is a work of art that explores the human predicament and even suggests something close to salvation.As always with a French film get the subtitled version. The dubbing is always atrocious and anyway there's really not that much dialogue.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

At first I was drawn to the action elements being young and somewhat immature in my dramatic tastes but I was blown away by the romance and character interplay. I loved the composition of the scenes the noirish lighting and the quirky humor. This movie along with Pedro Almodovar's films really opened my eyes to European films particularly those with a signature style.The performances are great across the board. Anne Parillaud plays all facets of Nikita well from her rebellious drughazed beginning to her growing confidence and her near breakdown as her mission falls apart. Tcheky Karyo made a huge impression mostly through his body language and his eyes. He says more with an expression than most actors do with dialogue. Jeanne Moraeu is a treasure a truly beautiful woman in appearance and spirit. JeanHughues Anglade has the harder part the normal guy who Nikita falls for. He is adept at comedy but is tender in the love scenes. He carries himself well in his faceoff with Bob. Finally the actor who really stands out in memory Jean Reno. Reno oozes charisma and talent even in bad films. He steals the film the moment he enters.Luc Besson is a tremendous stylist. His films are beautiful even when the story is a bit obtuse. He is adept at using light to portray and enhance emotion and his compositions are stunning. His main fault is that he lets style overtake story but he gets away with it because the style is always interesting. He is a fine writer although more care seems to go into the scripts he directs than those he has written for others.Finally one can't discuss the films of Besson without discussing the music of Eric Serra. Serra creates an atmosphere that is much a part of the setting as the lighting or set decoration. His compositions convey mood and emotion adding another layer to the story. His signature bass and percussion gets your heart pumping during action sequences while the melodies bring a softness to intimate moments. He demonstrates the proper way to use synthesizers to transform the music rather than make up for lack of an orchestra or talent. Serra's soundtracks were the first that I bought for instrumental music rather than for pop songs used in the film. This is a film that appeals to many audiences. There is plenty of action and intrigue for thrillseekers unique character studies quirky humor and above all romance. It has spawned many imitations Point of No Return Black Cat Nikita TV series but has never been equaled. If you are a fan of film noir actionespionage character drama or romance you should see this film then you should own this film. You'll want to watch it again and again.".

	schema:headline " plenty of verve and style and a rightfully perennial favorite of French spy thrillers";
	schema:reviewBody "Luc Besson was on a hot streak in the late 80searly 90s and La Femme Nikita or just Nikita for short is almost as good as he got at putting his own distinctive stamp on a genre that many auteurs have trouble molding. The spy thriller is great for blockbuster audiences but to make it into a strong romantic drama is always tricky as there's the chance for too much onedimensional theatrics or more attention paid to the plot convolutions than actual human emotions. Nikita squares this problem away just with the protagonist a young punk Anne Parillaud in her most recognizable near starmaking performance who kills a cop in the midst of a shootout is sentenced to life but then sort of resurrected following the lead of a member of a covert spy organization and given an ultimatum become a spyassassin or die. She complies and in a few years time turns into Josephine who gets orders on the outside from time to time to do tasks like dress up in a maid's outfit to serve potential targets or to ready herself to kill someone longrange at a moment's notice.Besson crafts his main story by creating a sort of love triangle between NikitaJosephineMarie her boss Bob and her conventional lover Marco a grocery store cashier who doesn't know what she really does. Besson tools with the elements for a much more conventional thriller and from time to time it could appear like La Femme Nikita will veer into that realm and not return. But Besson is smart he crafts the first hour like a kind of 'Taming of the Shrew' saga or 'Taming of a Shrill Badass' filled with juicy dark humor ranging from the ultraviolent pencil in the hand anyone? to the silly and playful training with karate instructors. And as pure director of action sequences Besson shows himself as one of the more distinct masters it's succinctly fresh and tense while holding the ingredients for what mainstream audiences crave chiefly in that centerpiece as she is told to kill someone on the night of a seemingly hot date with Bob. Even in the little things like the scene where she watches the spy put together the concoction for the target in the hotel works on the purest technical terms.But La Femme Nikita for the most part also works on emotional levels too. Besson won't be above throwing in a hardboiled killer in the midst Jean Reno's Victor my favorite supporting character if only for a few pivotal scenes and a precursor to Leon but he'll also subvert it just a tinge for good measure. I loved seeing when Josephine has to take out the woman in Venice her shot in sight and is moved to tears through the words that Marco speaks to her truthfully not in any terms that deem him as the boring safe character but as her kind of salvation from a life that she's been forced into as a final alternative. As happens often in Besson's work in fact the female character is put into a realm of personal chaos that is created by or leads to murder and at the least harrowing times with the one she cares for or about i.e. Portman in Leon Leeloo in Fifth Element Joan of Arc even Angela in AngelA. It's not simply a gimmick in having the character be a woman it's essential to Besson's track as a filmmaker and Praillaud is excellent for the sort of ups and downs the character goes through sometimes in the same scene! This isn't to say there are a few minor liabilities if only from my perspective the music is usually effective in that early electronictechno beat style for a modern thriller yet sometimes it's also a cross between a softcore porn and Weather channel muzak the ending felt abrupt or at least on a first viewing albeit it's hard to top the scene at the ambassador's HQ and as a minor criticism what happened to showing how Nikita learns how to smile? Seems a little crucial as something of her personality that's skipped over when made to seem like a big stepping stone by Jeanne Moreau's enigmatic character. Otherwise a mustsee and one of Besson's best films.".

Mentored by a man whose compassion for her is only matched by his ambition and Machiavellian sadism Nikita ventures on a rollercoaster ride leading a doublelife as assassin and cleanliving young woman in love. Her passionate affair with Marco and the clarity of her undrugged consciousness combine to promote the development of a conscience  a dangerous thing in her line of work. Nikita is nevertheless a victim of her circumstances and like the rest of the characters on both sides seems stuck in a very bad situation. In addition to the artistry with which this story is told this film has a very nihilistic sense of justice and notsosubtly points out the fact that state authorized murder is still murder. Jean Reno fans will enjoy his brief typecast cameo as the cleaner.This is one of the best if not the best of Besson's films. It is extremely well paced starkly and beautifully shot and features some of the best acting and writing of the entire action genre. The script is just a little better in French than English. Nikita does not have the feel of an action film but rather feels like a fatalistic drama riddled with almost continuous tragedy and heartbreak and spiced with just a tad of hope. Parillaud's multilayered and complex construction of her character is so mesmerizing that it is frankly difficult to think of anything else while attempting to reflect on this film.".

It's nice to be able to say that the movie was just as exciting and entertaining as I remember the show being.The plot is about a young drug addict who kills a cop when she and some guys are caught robbing a pharmacy. The French government fakes her death and she's given little alternative but to join a training program to become an agent in the government's employ. The stress of living a violent life that she doesn't want and having to keep it secret from her fianc eventually becomes too much for her to cope with.La Femme Nikita has several impressive action sequences but it's more than just an action movie. Nikita transforms over the course of the story from a druggedup junkie with nothing to live for to a capable and dangerous woman who wants control over her own life.All in all I thought La Femme Nikita was a solid blend of assassination and drama. The heroine is probably one of the most interesting female action protagonists ever put up on the big screen and it's hard to overstate the impact Nikita has had on other female protagonists in these kinds of movies in the last twenty years.

Still it's a good movie I think furthermore the incredible chemistry between Parillaud and Karyo the plot was moving and intense  it makes you want to know what happens after . Anne Parillaud is pretty good as the heroine who turns in violent tendencies to patriotic use  both as the antisocial rebel of the early scenes and the sophisticated seductive young lady of the later ones . It benefits enormously from a memorably assured performances from veteran as Jeanne Moreau  Jean Reno  Philippe Leroy and Jean Bouise whom is dedicated the movie . Atmospheric musical score by Eric Serra  though with excessive use of synthesizer . Colorful cinematography by Thierry Arbogast and perfectly remastered . The motion picture is lavishly produced and well directed by Luc Besson with his ordinary visual pyrotechnics . He often casts Jean Reno and music always by Eric Serra. Besson is the greatest producer and director from France with hits as Leon  Joan of Arc  The fifth element  the Taxi series  Big blue  Arthur and the Minimois  of course Nikita and many others .".

Atmospheric musical score by Eric Serra  though with excessive use of synthesizer . Colorful cinematography by Thierry Arbogast and perfectly remastered . The motion picture is lavishly produced and well directed by Luc Besson with his ordinary visual pyrotechnics . He often casts Jean Reno and music always by Eric Serra. Besson is the greatest producer and director from France with hits as Leon  Joan of Arc  The fifth element  the Taxi series  Big blue  Arthur and the Minimois  of course Nikita and many others .";

	schema:headline " An Amazing Transformation";
	schema:reviewBody "It's smart stylish and violent with numerous welldirected action sequences but what's more surprising about La Femme Nikita is its preoccupation with character development and the effective way in which it changes pace at various points to meet the needs of its story. Its wellwritten plot describes how a young woman who begins as a drugaddicted criminal is transformed into a more complex young lady who finds love and works for the French government as an assassin. The changes that take place as this originally hostile defiant and volatile punk is moulded into a slightly more polished disciplined and caring individual are really entertaining to watch not least because of her unpredictability which makes the whole process so challenging edgy and even on some occasions humorous.Soon after a group of junkies break into a Paris pharmacy a squad of heavilyarmed police officers arrive on the scene and the ensuing gunfight results in fatalities on both sides. In the mayhem all the gang members appear to have been killed but when one of the cops checks more thoroughly he finds a teenager called Nikita Anne Parillaud crouching down under a piece of furniture. When she's approached by the cop who hesitates because he isn't certain whether or not she's a gang member she callously shoots and kills him. After being sentenced to life in prison for her crime she's given what she suspects is a lethal injection and later wakes up in a white room where a man called Bob Tcheky Karyo visits her.Bob who works for an unnamed government agency shows her evidence that her death has been faked and recorded as a suicide with her body having been buried in row 8 plot 30 of the MaisonsAlfort cemetery. He goes on to offer her the opportunity of a new life working for the government which she readily accepts when she realises that the only other option is row 8 plot 30. Three years of intensive training follow during which she becomes proficient in the use of guns martial arts and computers as well as learning various points of etiquette and also how to act like a lady. After successfully completing her final test which involves carrying out an assassination in a restaurant Nikita is given her freedom and a new identity Marie. As a covert agent however she knows she'll be expected to respond immediately whenever she's called upon to carry out any assassinations.Nikita soon finds happiness in her new life as a result of meeting supermarket checkout man Marco JeanHugues Anglade who's goodnatured friendly and charming. The couple fall in love and move in together and although she's blissfully happy in the relationship Nikita feels uncomfortable about not being able to share any details of her past with Marco and also having to be disingenuous on certain occasions when she has to coverup for being involved in carrying out a hit. Despite this difficulty she manages to continue satisfactorily with both her relationship and her job until she decides that a change of course is necessary after Marco discovers that she'd lied to him about being employed at a hospital and she nearly gets killed when one of her government jobs goes horribly wrong.As Nikita Anne Parillaud is astonishingly good because she's equally credible as the nasty vicious and feral punk who's initially seen in the robbery as she is in the various stages that she goes through as she morphs into the more controlled and emotionally mature person that she gradually becomes It's unusual for an action movie to feature a character of this type and also for their portrayal to be so convincing.La Femme Nikita is an ultrastylish movie that features some great action sequences one of which culminates in a superb stunt when the eponymous antiheroine escapes danger by leaping down a laundry chute. Despite such excitement however what remains most memorable about the movie is its central character and the amazing transformation that she goes through.".

I like a few other Luc Besson films but this one is a notch or two above his other creations.Nikita is a story about a drug addicted woman who becomes a government agent or rather  an assassin.That part of the story is presented really well and provides more than enough excitement to support the entire film. But what makes this film so good is everything that happens below the surface complex relationships unfinished business never knowing if she will do this or that... yet none of it feels forced or contrived.

Carefully watching a film such as this one will go a long way toward enjoying it.Perhaps the only problem with La Femme Nikita is that it came out at the time when no one knew who Luc Besson was and with minimal if any promotion armchair filmcritics found it to be an easy target for unjustified negativity. Too many people are on a lookout for what seems like an easy target for their vitriol and this film did not come with any big names attached so they could not pass on the opportunity.The true greatness of this film is best illustrated by the fact that numerous TV shows and a remake or two were made soon after it came out. You know a film is good when other filmmakers are aching to make it again and they fail to exceed its high standards.The only other real problem with this film may be its subtitles. Since I speak French I simply listen rather than read but a few times that I took a look at subtitles I was shocked that they were so far off  it felt almost like someone was trying to change the story with their subtitles! If memory serves me well the original VHS actually had excellent translation as did the theatrical release but DVD and Bluray suffer from bad English subtitles maybe Bluray less so? Don't remember any more.All in all action packed brutally honest crime drama yes governments DO hire former criminals to be their assassins with a heart. The single most important point of this film is not action but the main character's arc. Enjoy it and discover it yourself.This is one of the finest examples of what French cinema is capable of. Hollywood cannot even come close.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember back in the 90's I had the iconic Nikita poster which had a very leggy Anne Parillaud kitted out in a little tight black dress while cocking a huge hand gun. It was one of the definitive movie posters of its day and went some way in adding to the film's overall reputation as something cool that had to be seen. Over the years Nikita has become less well remembered but it definitely remains one of the high points of the French cinma du look movement. It follows the story of a violent drug addicted young woman who is imprisoned for killing a police officer during an armed robbery. Recognising her skills as useful a secret government agency fakes her death and gives her the opportunity to be reborn in a new life as a professional killer.Directed by Luc Besson this is a fairly typical example of his work at its best where we have an actionthriller which is elevated by an ultrastylish presentation. It has a very glossy veneer to it with some chic fashions and ornate locations but in amongst that it does have some grit. The central character played by Parillaud really exemplifies this where she is moulded into a sophisticated killer but who underneath is a feral street fighter. Parillaud definitely covers a lot of ground here in a strong performance. She isn't afraid to play the character very unglamorous and annoying where required  the slinky creature on the poster is only part of the deal here! The transformation of this character is overseen by an enigmatic agent called Bob who develops feelings for his charge while reconfiguring her. It's a storyline which has definite parallels to Pygmalion. In fact much of Nikita isn't really in thriller territory at all. Much focus is made of the relationship Nikita embarks on in the latter half of the film with a shop assistant played by JeanHugues Anglade who in a neat role reversal plays a part which is typically played by women in most films of these kinds. Anglade is the good natured partner who is Nikita's anchor on reality while she embarks on her secret and deadly missions. One particularly exemplary example of this occurs in a scene in Venice where she assassinates a designated victim while having a conversation with Anglade through a bathroom door. It's scenes like this one and others where the central character embarks on her missions where the film usually peaks for me. In one of these latter sequences we are introduced to the sinister character of 'The Cleaner' in a role played by Jean Reno which was so striking that Besson based one of his next films around this idea namely Leon 1994.I think Nikita may be the best film that Besson ever made. The combination of an interesting central character good concept and stylised direction add up to an actionthriller of significant pedigree. It was remade in America with Bridget Fonda in the lead role under the title of Point of No Return 1993 a film which many people seem to hate but which I actually thought was a very good alternative. So my advice would be watch both and decide for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to spy cinema Americans generally know it through franchises like James Bond Mission Impossible the Bourne series and... Spy Kids. Those films generally paint two portraits of the spy life. Either glamorous and exotic or intense and brutal. Nikita is an interesting film in the genre. While it certainly leans more towards the latter it's one of the very films in the genre that both shows a realistic depiction of spy life but at the same time stylizes it. But does Nikita work as a film? Let's find out.The plot follows a teenage junkie by the name of Nikita who gets arrested one night after partaking in a drug store robbery that goes horribly wrong where she murders a policeman in coldblood making her guilty of serving a life sentence. However the French government fakes a suicide for her to become a spyassassin.What's interesting about Nikita is its look into the life of a spy. This isn't James Bond there's no gadgets no witty oneliners and no largerthanlife villains. What we have INSTEAD is a look into a woman being turned by the French government from a teenage junkie to a dangerous killing machine. Nikita is a woman who starts out with no meaning in life as she hangs around with junkies and is addicted to drugs herself but after she's trained to be a spy she becomes a lethal killing machine but in the meantime becomes refined mentally stable and even attractive. What's interesting about this is the MORALITY. On one hand she MURDERED a policeman so she deserves punishment but at the same time once she gets out of spy school she cares and appreciates not just for her life but also for society and towards the END she ditches her mission and runs away to leave the life of a spy. The film's message can be pretty much be chalked up to everybody deserves a second chance and it's delivered beautifully because it's not RAMMED down your throat with lines like Maybe Nikita deserves another chance. Maybe she never deserved this in the first place. which would have dumbed down the entire movie.Outside of the morality behind the film Nikita is also very stylish. Director Luc Besson directs this film with a strange mix of realism and style but somehow it works! This movie has its fair share of brutal realism with scenes like the Cleaner using acid to melt down the bodies of those he killed or Nikita trying to break out by threatening her supervisor Bob at gunpoint but there's also scenes of style such as the speech her instructor Amande tells about femininity and the means of using it or the scenes of Nikita training comically in spy school. The reason this works is because neither styles go too far so they end up complimenting each other and creating its own style rather than making for something inconsistent and jarring. The cinematography by Thierry Arbogast is also quite good at creating this gritty stylized look.But with all that good said this is not a perfect movie. One of its biggest flaws is the confused timeframe presented in the story. The movie spans over years of Nikita training to become a spy but the way it's edited makes it feel like only a few weeksmonths have gone by so when one of the heads of the organization says Nikita has been training here for six years. you'll just be left sitting there like Wait it's been six years?Another problem is the character of Marco. He's just really bland and uninteresting throughout. He's supposed to be the man who wins Nikita's heart and make her appreciate life more but the thing is while he seems like a really nice guy his interactions with Nikita aren't very interesting. He questions her here and there about things like why she never has friends or family over at her place or why she spends so much time in the bathroom ignoring him but it never amounts to anything more than that. I would've liked to see him actually get MAD at her at one point and have an argument play out I think that would've been a little more interesting.The last of the major problems is the score by Eric Serra. It just sounds incredibly bland and sterile throughout. There's some scenes in the film where I literally felt like ripping my HAIR out because of how mindinducingly dull it is. Although I did like the music when the Cleaner was taking care of business.However those problems aren't NEARLY strong enough to ruin the film because of the excellent cast. Anne Parillaud gives a truly spectacular performance as Nikita. Her change from teenage junkie to refined assassin is very believable and all her conflicting emotions about being a spy feel very real and believable. Tcheky Karyo plays Bob fascinatingly with a polite persona but with an underlying intensity that makes you really think and question his feelings towards Nikita effectively. While I thought his character was a little bland Jean Hugues Anglade does the best he can as Marco and remains likable the entire film. Lastly while the Cleaner doesn't get a whole lot of screen time Reno stands out as a cool and bada character in the film.Overall while it has some issues regarding the timeframe the character of Marco and the score. Nikita is still an interesting character study with stylish direction and an excellent cast. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "When it comes to spy cinema Americans generally know it through franchises like James Bond Mission Impossible the Bourne series and... Spy Kids. Those films generally paint two portraits of the spy life. Either glamorous and exotic or intense and brutal. Nikita is an interesting film in the genre. While it certainly leans more towards the latter it's one of the very films in the genre that both shows a realistic depiction of spy life but at the same time stylizes it. But does Nikita work as a film? Let's find out.The plot follows a teenage junkie by the name of Nikita who gets arrested one night after partaking in a drug store robbery that goes horribly wrong where she murders a policeman in coldblood making her guilty of serving a life sentence. However the French government fakes a suicide for her to become a spyassassin.What's interesting about Nikita is its look into the life of a spy. This isn't James Bond there's no gadgets no witty oneliners and no largerthanlife villains. What we have INSTEAD is a look into a woman being turned by the French government from a teenage junkie to a dangerous killing machine. Nikita is a woman who starts out with no meaning in life as she hangs around with junkies and is addicted to drugs herself but after she's trained to be a spy she becomes a lethal killing machine but in the meantime becomes refined mentally stable and even attractive. What's interesting about this is the MORALITY. On one hand she MURDERED a policeman so she deserves punishment but at the same time once she gets out of spy school she cares and appreciates not just for her life but also for society and towards the END she ditches her mission and runs away to leave the life of a spy. The film's message can be pretty much be chalked up to everybody deserves a second chance and it's delivered beautifully because it's not RAMMED down your throat with lines like Maybe Nikita deserves another chance. Maybe she never deserved this in the first place. which would have dumbed down the entire movie.Outside of the morality behind the film Nikita is also very stylish. Director Luc Besson directs this film with a strange mix of realism and style but somehow it works! This movie has its fair share of brutal realism with scenes like the Cleaner using acid to melt down the bodies of those he killed or Nikita trying to break out by threatening her supervisor Bob at gunpoint but there's also scenes of style such as the speech her instructor Amande tells about femininity and the means of using it or the scenes of Nikita training comically in spy school. The reason this works is because neither styles go too far so they end up complimenting each other and creating its own style rather than making for something inconsistent and jarring. The cinematography by Thierry Arbogast is also quite good at creating this gritty stylized look.But with all that good said this is not a perfect movie. One of its biggest flaws is the confused timeframe presented in the story. The movie spans over years of Nikita training to become a spy but the way it's edited makes it feel like only a few weeksmonths have gone by so when one of the heads of the organization says Nikita has been training here for six years. you'll just be left sitting there like Wait it's been six years?Another problem is the character of Marco. He's just really bland and uninteresting throughout. He's supposed to be the man who wins Nikita's heart and make her appreciate life more but the thing is while he seems like a really nice guy his interactions with Nikita aren't very interesting. He questions her here and there about things like why she never has friends or family over at her place or why she spends so much time in the bathroom ignoring him but it never amounts to anything more than that. I would've liked to see him actually get MAD at her at one point and have an argument play out I think that would've been a little more interesting.The last of the major problems is the score by Eric Serra. It just sounds incredibly bland and sterile throughout. There's some scenes in the film where I literally felt like ripping my HAIR out because of how mindinducingly dull it is. Although I did like the music when the Cleaner was taking care of business.However those problems aren't NEARLY strong enough to ruin the film because of the excellent cast. Anne Parillaud gives a truly spectacular performance as Nikita. Her change from teenage junkie to refined assassin is very believable and all her conflicting emotions about being a spy feel very real and believable. Tcheky Karyo plays Bob fascinatingly with a polite persona but with an underlying intensity that makes you really think and question his feelings towards Nikita effectively. While I thought his character was a little bland Jean Hugues Anglade does the best he can as Marco and remains likable the entire film. Lastly while the Cleaner doesn't get a whole lot of screen time Reno stands out as a cool and bada character in the film.Overall while it has some issues regarding the timeframe the character of Marco and the score.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is almost identical to the American movie The Assassin. The American movie is based so heavily on this movie that even the lines are identical. This movie the original is by far better because the Americans just did not use any imagination with The Assassin.Nikita is a wild drugaddicted punk who is caught in a drug store after a hold up has gone terribly wrong. She is a wild animal and when she is confronted by the police instead of pretending to be a frightened girl she blows his head off and is thus arrested and charged for the murder of the other officers. She is sentenced to life imprisonment and subsequently killed. The catch is is that the death is faked and she is revived in a secret government organisation and trained as an assassin.The American movie is very glizty as is typical of Hollywood. They made everything look nice and sophisticated including Bridget Fonda. Nikita is nothing like this. Luc Besson has the ability to use the dark and dingy effectively. Nikita is wild and her unkept appearance is made to reflect this. Through the movie we watch her as she is slowly tamed and made into a civilised woman. Even so we still receive glimpses of who she was.With civilisation comes morality. When she was wild she killed the cop without a second thought but as she is tamed she begins to realise the results of her actions. She is ordered to kill a woman and after the truth of her actions hits her. As she falls in love with a young checkout clerk Marco we watch how her passions rise up inside of her and how the sanctity of human life dawns upon her. We see a different woman retch at the sight of Victor the Cleaner pouring acid on a living body than when she kills a cop in cold blood.The action in the Assassin mimics the action in Nikita almost identically. Yet in Nikita we see that Luc Besson has created something that is real. The Agency is not a high tech cement bunker but the basement of an old building with walls with crumbling plaster. The bed is an old hospital bed and the floor is bathroom tiles. The major difference is that we see two worlds in the two movies. The Assassin is America and Nikita is France the new world and the old world Paris and Los Angeles. Nikita is by far the better movie.".

The lead actress I have read on here is apparently 'ugly'  well what does that have to do with the story? Did she have to be a hot piece of ass? No she didn't she was cast as she is a great actress who was physically right and most believable for the role. Luc Besson is not interested in satisfying horny teenagers he is making a 'proper' film that has stood the test of time. From the beginning the story grips you  Nikita is a teenage psychotic tear away with a group of friends equally as bad. After a cool shootout and the murder of a cop she is arrested and sentenced to life in prison. A story is fabricated that she committed suicide and she is given the option by the government to become their assassin or be killed. The whole first part of the movie is very strong as Nikita develops from a miserable aggressive psycho into a human being again. Her relationship with her mentor is very understated and interesting. She is released into society again after passing her initial 'test' or first assignment. This is the real highlight of the film  a cool shoot out in a restaurant. Once back into society she meets a man and falls in love and basically starts enjoying life with a new perspective and value for her own life and that of others. However the government are not far away with more assignments for her. All this is still very entertaining however as we edge towards the end I did feel it sagged a little. Her last assignment is not really gripping enough and I was getting a little bored however the very end as the two men who fell in love with her meet just after she has gone on the run is very satisfying and it stops at the right point to leave the viewer with an almost sad feeling. I like this film very much the lead actress is brave fearless and shows great range. I love the relationship with the mentor and the action is used at the right time. Apart from the end it would have been perfect. 810".

The list of parallels is endless.Yes you may have seen it all before. But this flick is worthwhile. Face it  the topic perhaps does belong more to Berlin need I say it the birth place of Neonazism than to Los Angeles. And the Germans have finally made a film about a culture they originated which is outstanding in many ways.The inside look at the old GDR East Germany is very informative and well told to nonGermans. Germans may think otherwise of this recurring East German theme a staple plot setting in German cinema for the last 12 years with no end in sight. But even if that is old to you there is so much to appreciate in the movie that it will not disappoint. Certainly the lead performance by the Berlin teenager age at the time of filming anyway is chilling and impactful. We watch accompany and feel his transformation intimately. In my last comparison with American History X I assure you the lead in this movie is every bit as dense and intense as Edward Norton was.Too bad it has not been shown yet perhaps to more international audiences. I saw it in late October 2002 at the So Paulo Film Festival. I do definitely recommend it my rating 1010. See this one on the big screen when it comes your way.".

Its a possible eyeopener especially for a younger audience realisticly depicting violence in prison and by neonazigroups against leftist Rats and foreigners. It strongly draws its realism from the real life of cowriter Ingo Hasselbach who in the early 90s was head of an notorious Neonazifaction that spread fear and violence in parts of EastBerlin. Later and with the help of director Winfried Bonengel he found his way out and cofounded the EXITprogram for former extremists.Mainly focusing on the friendship of two buddys Heiko and Tommy growing up in EastBerlin in the late 1980s it shows two punkish rebels with dreams about going to capitalist Australia because there you are completely free and can do what you like. Maybe this illusion just comes from seeing all the same faces everywhere or going to the same bar everynight. At first it's just minor offences like peeing on the official GDRnewspaper then burning the flag in the end they try to flee and climb over the wall. But they are caught and put into prison. This is where the film finds its center Faschist gangs and Skinheads are ruling the prisons in EastGermany even under Communist rule. The regime breeds its enemies while it officially preaches its antifaschist stance regularly as being the fundation and reason for the state. But in prison being nazi is the most extreme way to protest against the ruling ideology of socialist brotherhood.The two buddies at first choose different ways to survive the brutality in prison Tommy finds refuge by joining the rightwing group on the block while Heiko tries to walk alone  until he is raped in the bathroom by another inmate. He than joins hands with Faschistleader Friedhelm who feeds his followers with oldtime Naziideology. Tommy is able to flee to the West. But when he returns to Berlin a couple of months later after the fall of the wall he finds his friend hardend and as being the leader of the pack holding speaches wearing brown uniformshirts and setting fire to a foodstall because the owner is Turkish. After the death of young girl in a street fight Tommy turns away from the faschistgroup. And a dramatical final even Heiko finds a way out.Its a raw and energetic direct movie with minor weaknesses in characterdrawing and when it comes to finding a deeper explanation for the turnaround of the two buddies. Nevertheless its a movie that was highly necessary. The message to EastGermany might still be a shock for some people That faschism and neonazism racism and intolerance is not an import from the West but was lingering in the underground of their own GDR. P.S. Stringparts of the soundtrack are often highly irritating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fhrer Ex is a challenging harsh and intensely involving tale of the course of friendship of two young lads living in the 'prison' of Communist East Germany in 1986. Based on fact Ingo Hasselbach's book 'Die Abrechnng' adapted for the screen by Douglas Graham and director Winfried Bonengel this story relates the changes that occur in the close friendship of two boys torn by the confinement of the East German Communists vs the Western freedom of West Germany and the countries not under Communist control. It informs us about that transition with the fall of the Berlin wall and the subsequent adjustment to the new form of life East Germans found beyond the crumbled wall.Heiko Christian Blmel is fairhaired virginal nice guy who longs for adventure and more with his idolized friend Tommy Aaron Hildebrand an edgy guy unafraid to get into a bit of trouble Tommy is arrested for a minor crime and is released from jail shaved and tattooed. The two dream of escaping their rigid lives and fleeing to Australia. Tommy talks Heiko into running the risk of actual escape and together they break through the wires and walls that confine them but are apprehended in their attempt and sentenced to prison in a cruel Communist prison where they are separated Tommy joining a 'neonazi' group and Heiko falling under the 'protection' of a fellow prisoner who eventually rapes him. The two finally are able to talk and plan a mutual escape hopefully placing themselves in boxes to be transported to freedom. Tommy succeeds Heiko doesn't and remains in prison.Flash forward to 1989 and the Berlin wall is down. Tommy is living a comfortable life in the new Berlin and encounters Heiko in a true NeoNazi meeting that Heiko is leading. The tables have turned  Heiko is the miscreant and Tommy is the good guy. Convinced that Tommy is a traitor to the ideals of Heiko's political interests Heiko surfaces all of the hate that brewed in prison and is focused on unjust governments. An event occurs that alters their friendship and Heiko is forced to see that varying political climes and convictions pale in the value of treasured friends.The film is well paced and the acting is excellent. There are gaps in the script storyline that result in some confusion for the viewer but the overall impact of the 'biopic' nature of the movie is powerful and deserves attention. It is particularly fitting that this film comes out of Germany as though it may be a purging of sorts over the initial division of East vs West Berlin. And forgetting about the political aspects of the story this is a powerful document on the importance of commitment to longterm friends. Recommended. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Apart from a few disappointing aspects I really enjoyed the movie. I think the two main actors did an excellent job. Aaron Hildebrand as Tommy started out as a daredevil kind of bad guy awed by his friend Heiko and he kept up this attitude throughout the whole movie. It's only when the circumstances around him change for the worse especially in the last part of the movie when he's confronted with the NeoNazi's who want to tow him in that we see how in comparison with the others he has in fact the better character maybe a bit streetwise but with both feet firmly on the ground and loyal to his friend. Hildebrand definitely has charisma and a very easy and natural way of acting.Christian Blmel Heiko was very convincing too as the susceptible youngster who looses his innocence by brutal force. He's really a very promising actor see for instance the scene where he is visited in prison by the girl he loves he's just so moving in his bewilderment and happiness and shame all at the same time! But he especially deserves high credits for his performance during the crucial scene with the sexual assault in the showers in uncompromising full frontal nudity! he succeeded in making the emotional impact very believable totally overwhelmed not being able to counteract and at last physically and psychologically devastated. And later on in the movie Blmel's portrayal of the slickly groomed NeoNazi shouting his speech with a distorted face to a Sieg Heilyelling mob was very bloodchilling. On the other side there were several things amiss in this movie. For instance to me the transition of Heiko was too abrupt. He's jolted into the isolationcell as someone who loathes the Nazi's but when he at last stumbles out we see him shake hands with the local Nazileader and in the next scene several years later we suddenly see him as a NeoNazileader of his own. We don't get to witness any gradually change to make this understandable. Or are we supposed to believe that being locked up for who knows how long turns you so insane that you end up being a Nazi?The guards in this fierce communistic prison all seemed a bit puffy and aging as were most of the inmates who hardly seemed a realistic physical threat to an athletic boy of twentysomething. And the escape from prison by Tommy lacked any realism whatsoever it's totally unbelievable to me that an inmate in such a notorious and supposedly wellguarded prison can just hop into a crate in broad daylight and among a crowd of coworkers and guards and let himself be carried out into freedom. Weren't they supposed to check outgoing vans with dogs or something?? And then I was also a bit disappointed in the ending after the touching scene on the roof Tommy dying in the arms of Heiko we abruptly change to Heiko some undefined time later walking briskly and with a serious face through a sunny street in an undefined place. That's it the end. So what are we supposed to conclude? Did he come to his senses after Tommy's death? The fact that his hair wasn't slick anymore possibly refers to that. But then how did he escape his fierce Nazifriends?? Or did he maybe run of to Australia Tommy brought him the tickets right before he died. Maybe that's exactly what the director wants us to do to brood over this but to me this last scene doesn't work it doesn't add up to anything it's just confusing. If anything I would have preferred an ending with the scene on the roof Heiko like a Romeo with his dead Juliette crying out his despair and anger to heaven. All considered the positive predominates an emotionally involving and well acted movie.".

	schema:headline " Interesting but lacks depth";
	schema:reviewBody "The story of the rise and redemption of a neo Nazi leader in Germany this movie lacks the emotional depth when compared to American History X.We first see the two characters of Heike and Tommy as miscreants in the waning days of Communist East Germany. Typical of many youths of the era they know that the state ideology rings hollow and spend their days committing minor acts of vandalism and drinking beer.A minor run in with the law lands Tommy in prison and upon his return the two hatch a scheme to escape to the west. The plot fails and they end up in the slammer.The first part of the movie was pretty good. We see Heiko as a rather naive and well meaning kid albeit one without much of a backbone. His mother has a rather distant relationship with him and we see a rather interesting rotation of her male visitors throughout the movie. Unfortunately the film does not really touch upon his feelings on that matter much. Heiko hooks up with a rather wild girl whose impulsive behavior causes some problems but he seems to be rather quick to move past the situation.The character of Tommy is much stronger than that of Heiko. We see he's the more daring of the two but at the same time has much more strength to his personality than Heiko. Tommy is bad because he wants to be whereas Heiko is just along for the ride.Their stay in prison opens the second act of the movie and here is where the movie hits its peak and quickly deflates. Prison in East Germany is no different than anywhere else with the usual plot elements. Heike ends up joining the Nazis for protection while Tommy manages to escape to the west.And here is where the movie completely falls apart.We cut to Tommy returning to East Berlin after the fall of the wall where he encounters Heiko leading a Nazi rally. Tommy rejoins the movement and he is somewhat bothered at Heiko's attacks against the Turks and other enemies. There is a death and the disenchanted Tommy abandons the movement. Heiko is sent out to remove the traitor and the movie reaches its somewhat predictable finale.The movie has Acts I II and IV but act III is missing. We have the set up of the story in the first part the experience of Tommy and Heiko in prison and then cuts to them reuniting outside of prison. I wanted to see Act III what happens to Heiko after Tommy escapes how his indoctrination into the Nazi philosophy takes place his release from prison his adjustment to the new Germany his relationship with his girlfriend and mother as this goes on etc.Instead we practically cut from Heiko walking funny in prison to Heiko torching a kebab stand. Before and after works well for diet commercials but not movies of this sort. The whole point is the process of transformation and for some reason the director chose to omit this. In American History X this is accomplished through the prison narrative from Derek to Danny. We miss that part here.That being said there are a few reasons to see this film. The character of Tommy is well played Aaron Hildebrand bearing a striking resemblance to Freddie Prinze Jr which makes it kind of fun to watch. The setting is pretty interesting as well a time and place gone by. But overall this movie is missing that certain something to make it rise above mediocrity. To nonGerman audiences this might be worth while to watch for the sheer novelty value but if you're looking for some emotional depth to a film American History X is much better in that department.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fuehrer Ex is a film about East German Teens living in East Berlin in 1986. The Story revolves around 2 Characters Heiko Who looks up to his best friend Tommy and Tommy who is obsessed with escaping East Berlin to the west. Tommy got himself arrested because of AntiCommunist Behavior. In Prison Tommy got introduced to NeoNazism and was released as a radical who wanted to convince Heiko of his new found religion. Heiko had no interest but still remained a friend to Tommy even after Tommy slept with his girlfriend. Tommy Convinced Heiko to escape to the west. But they got busted and send to prison. In prison Tommy Joined the Skin head Gang while Heiko was being raped and abused by fellow inmates. Tommy still tried to protect Heiko even though Heiko did not join the skinhead gang. One day heiko decided that he had enough of being raped so he stabbed one of his cell mates and ended up in solitary confinement. One of the prison supervisors blackmailed Tommy by either informing the state of the neoNazi movement or his friend heiko will be left in solitary confinement to rot. Tommy agreed with the Stasi and Heiko Joined the NeoNazi Group. Tommy then escaped Prison and made it to the east while Heiko was left behind. Since Heikos protection was now gone he became really involved with the Neo Nazis. Years pass and the wall fell in 1989. Tommy returned to East Berlin to find Heiko but he as become a leader in the NeoNazi Community in the meantime it seams that Tommy curved his neoNazi views. Heikos superiors had a copy of Tommy's Stasi File and discovered that Tommy was working for the state as an informant they marked Tommy as a traitor and ordered heiko to kill Tommy. When heiko confronted Tommy Tommy told heiko that he went over the top and told him to forget the Nazis and run off to Australia with him. Then Tommy was killed by the neoNazi gang and the film ended with Heiko walking through the streets just like Mark did at the end of Trainspotting.The Film was good in a sense of its graphic depiction of East German life and prison violence. The ending was kind of week and the story took a long time to get to its point. it has its similarities with History EX but really it was a different story.".

Director here is Winfried Bonengel and he also adapted Ingo Hasselbach's autobiographic work for the screen. Still I think there is a reason why nobody from the cast really with one exception I come to that later is in famous fames these days anymore and same also goes for Bonengel who went on to direct terrible television series after this project and none of the works he made before or after this one comes close to this one in terms of popularity.The movie runs for 100 minutes and tells us about the lives of 2 GDR citizens who are sick of their country and try to flee. However instead of becoming respectable FRG citizens they switch to the other side and end up on the far right. Most of the movie is about depicting what happens when they were in jail. Easily the best thing about this film is Dieter Laser he is the one I was referring to previously as he is still wellknown today. He plays a prison inmate who killed his wife and talks all about selfdefense but it becomes so obvious that this is not what happened. That scene as brutal as it was was also pretty hilarious because of Laser's insane line delivery. Sadly the rest of the film is almost in its entirety forgettable and there are very few memorable moments. Even the ending does not feel authentic but just dramatic for the sake of it. I do not recommend this film.".

Several tales filmed in an anthology style based upon the E.C. Comics that the two enjoyed reading in their youths. With Stephen King writing and George A. Romero directing plus Tom Savini creating the gory special effects how can you go wrong? You just can't and the aforementioned duo delivers the goods.The story begins as a young kid is being punished by his overbearing and brutish father for reading trashy filth and is punished. During the night the tossed out comic book comes to life and plays out all the stories in comic book form with the Creepshow Ghoul' leading the way. Black comedy has never been funnier.All the stories are excellent and well directed. The set pieces are very well designed and are brilliantly executed. You have to love the lighting schemes. The cast is a mixture of new actors and classic ones. George A. Romero stated that he finally got to work with Fritz Weaver and Hal Holbrook and E.G. Marshall. Leslie Nielsen Adrienne Barbeau Ted Danson and Ed Harris costar as well. A couple of Romero regulars such as his wife Christine Tom Savini and who can forget Stephen King as Jordy Verill.Creepshow is a true modern day horror classic. I have enjoyed this as a child and I still consider this movie one of my favorite horror films. Sadly the two could never capture the magic they once had. Maybe they'll work together directly in the near future. This movie was near flawless in design. They set out to recapture the old E.C. Comics aura and they succeeded. Followed by a absolutely bad sequel. Highly recommended!".

There is a very good cast including Ed Harris Leslie Nielsen Ted Danson Adrienne Barbeau and E.G. Marshall whom all give good performances in the movie. The whole movie is tied in with the classic E.C. comics from the 1950s each story as if it were from a comic book. I thought that whole comic aspect was pretty unique and I liked the stories in the film The Crate is by far the best of them all the one with Leslie Nielsen is my runner up for second place.Bottom line  if you are expecting some serious intense horror movie this is not for you. This movie isn't scary at all I watched it when I was very young and it failed to even scare me then. Creepshow is a comical campy and welldone horror anthology. I only recommend it if you like this sort of thing because it is more comic than horrific. Otherwise it's really quite good for what it is. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is divided in five stories conducted by a leading segment where the stressed father of a boy that loves horror comic books throws his Creepshow magazine in the garbage. The wind changes the pages and discloses the tales listed below.Father's Day  While waiting Aunt Bedelia Viveca Lindfors for a dinner party the greedy family recalls that she killed her own father seven years ago. Now her undead father returns from the grave as a zombie expecting to eat his cake. This segment is weak and it is curious to see Ed Harris performing a minor role. 6.The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill  The redneck farmer Jordy Verrill Stephen King finds a meteor in his property in Castle Rock County and dreams on selling it for the local university and raising a large amount. However he is affected by the meteor and strange weeds growup on his body. This segment is the silliest and the greatest curiosity is Stephen King performing the lonely farmer. 5.Something to Tide you Over  Harry Wentworth Ted Danson is forced by the revengeful Richard Vickers Leslie Nielsen who is the former husband of his woman Becky Vickers Gaylen Ross to go to Comfort Point beach and to bury himself in the sand. Then he brings a Television and a VCR to show Becky buried in the same conditions. With the high tide their heads are submerged for the pleasure of the insane Richard. However on the next night he is visited by a couple of zombie lovers. This dark and claustrophobic segment is the scariest one and the only flaw is the lack of previous development of the characters. 9.The Crate  When the janitor of a university finds a crate hidden below the stairs he reports his findings to Professor Dexter Stanley Fritz Weaver. They open the container and sooner Dexter finds that there is a hunger creature inside that devours the janitor and another scientist. When the disturbed Dexter tells to his colleague and friend Henry Northrup Hal Holbrook what happened Henry sees the chance to get rid off his bitch wife Wilma Northrup Adrienne Barbeau. This segment is the funniest and the situations of Henry imagining killing Wilma are hilarious. 8.They're Creeping up on You!  The mean and selfish Upson Pratt E.G. Marshall lives in an expensive bugproof penthouse and treats his employees like garbage. During a blackout his fancy apartment is infested by coach roaches driving Pratt to a tragic end. This gruesome tale is simple but nasty with many coach roaches. 7.The lead segment ends with the boy using a voodoo doll to provoke pain in his father.This is the third time that I watch these entertaining horror tales now on DVD. I only regret that there are no sequels of these great stories. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Creepshow".

Some of the acting is good too particularly Adrienne Barbeau as a heavy drinking obnoxious faculty wife who gets what she deserves Hal Holbrook as her henpecked husband and E.G.

	schema:headline " Creepshow Sold Out!";
	schema:reviewBody "This was after Tales from the Crypt however Romero and King both where heavily influenced by these comics that they developed a movie that was sort of a satireparody of Tales but in the same time a tribute to that comic book. In this movie there are four scary stories being told some written by Stephen King from his short stories and some written by Romero and SK. These stores for that time were pretty scary and freaked me out when they came in theaters. There are many great things about this movie that I enjoyed but there was however one huge things that I did not like about this movie. Regardless it's about time for two horror geniuses to team up and do something good for a change.First off the movie itself is about a comic book similar to Tails and the four stories in the movie come directly from the Creepshow comic books. The reason why that this idea works in not only the principle of bringing a comic book to life but the way it was shot edited and lit. The camera angles had very defined and geometrical angels similar to those that you would see in a comic book. The lighting when something horrible happens turns red or if somebody is screaming the background turns to a shattered red background thereby giving each scene a more comic booklike feel to visual picture. It had choppy edits and quick cuts which we all know that comic books have. So we have a visual perspective of a comic the overall pattern and texture of a comic and now we have the quick stimulus of a comic.Between each story there is a substory dealing with a young boy who finds the Creepshow comic book and how little by little he becomes more possessed by it. These intermissions also incorporate The Creep or our host for the evening. This character is by far the Crypt Keeper or the Vault Keeper to our mockup of Tales. Like the Crypt Keeper in the actual comic he begins each segment with a scene setup and a conclusion however he does not talk he just blows around in the wind. With the beginning of each new story it starts out with a still scene of that story with heavy rotoscoping to make it look as if it is a comic book page then fades out to a reallife still image and then begins. The same could be said about the ending. The clever technique gives the viewer a further illustration that this is a comic book come to life.Though this movie strikes it rich on my scareometer there is just one thing that took me out of the movie just a little. I know what they where going at when they decided this concept and I understand it was a good idea but it doesn't work when it gets put on film. The campy oneliners the cheesy substory and the lame screams. Of course its predecessor did the same thing I don't think that it works as well on film as it does on paper. I think it was a nice try though.Overall I do believe that this is a horrorparody classic and that many horror fans if not cult horror fans would like this movie for what it is. I certainly enjoyed it even now I recommend this movie to anybody who loves the zombie king and the horror king. A movie worth buying a ticket for.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was after Tales from the Crypt however Romero and King both where heavily influenced by these comics that they developed a movie that was sort of a satireparody of Tales but in the same time a tribute to that comic book. In this movie there are four scary stories being told some written by Stephen King from his short stories and some written by Romero and SK. These stores for that time were pretty scary and freaked me out when they came in theaters. There are many great things about this movie that I enjoyed but there was however one huge things that I did not like about this movie. Regardless it's about time for two horror geniuses to team up and do something good for a change.First off the movie itself is about a comic book similar to Tails and the four stories in the movie come directly from the Creepshow comic books. The reason why that this idea works in not only the principle of bringing a comic book to life but the way it was shot edited and lit. The camera angles had very defined and geometrical angels similar to those that you would see in a comic book.

Next up is The Lonesome Death Of Jody Verill which sees Stephen King himself in the title role of a less than dumb hick who touches a fallen meteor and thus starts to turn into a plant monster. King has fun with the role but overplays it to dangerously annoying ham proportions but it's a tidy fable with a cool ending. We then get to my personal favourite of the bunch with Something To Tide You Over here we have a delightfully villainous Leslie Nielson burying his unfaithful wife and her lover Ted Danson in the sand up to their necks as the tide starts to come in naturally there is a grizzly twist a coming.The Crate sees the arrival of Hal Holbrook and Adrienne Barbeau into the proceedings a smart message of not opening crates marked with Danger Do Not Open and here we get a genuinely scary monster into the show. The final segment is They're Creeping Up On You which seems to be a favourite of many across the site and although it has creepy impact for those scared of insects it's not the crowning glory I was hoping for. We are then cut back to the boy and his thirst for revenge and the film finishes with a glint in its eye more schlock and camp than outright horror but still a great piece of 80s fun for fans to enjoy 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe this movie only ranks at a 6.6 on IMDb. Of course even at the time of its release back in '82 there was skepticism toward it. Headed by horror legends George A. Romero and Stephen King people seem to forget this movie exists to do one thing and one thing only celebrate the macabre and the sick. Note the title itself you douches consider their taste in film to be of the upper crust. Creepshow doesn't have the nihilistic undertone of Romero's usual work or King's expected psychological torture because it is meant to simply be a fun experience.If you're a horror buff you know Romero has long credited the classic EC horror comics of the 50s e.g. Tales From the Crypt as his inspiration. This is basically the whole point of the film to feel like a comic book brought to life. Hence things are bound to be marvelously overthetop in some regards. One of the best things about this film to me its strongest aspect in general is its visual style. It angles many shots as if they were cut outs from a comic there is some awesome usage of hand drawn animation I LOVE the opening credit scene and there is some BADASS use of extreme lighting shifts. To put this in perspective one second the room is darkly lit but not out of the ordinary per say. Next thing you know the room and all its objects are bathed in a bloodlike red making the photography so well done in this picture.Another aspect you have to embrace in order to fully appreciate the film is its tone. As I said before this isn't aiming to be cryptic and challenging like let's say The Shining which King also wrote or as realistic and seriouslytoned as Night of the Living Dead. If anything this movie is a blend of horror and comedy. Thing is it's a brand of comedy most people to this day don't get the dirty guilty pleasure of black humor. A zombie who wants his Father's Day Cake a hillbilly assuming a meteorite will fetch him a mere 200 a man feeding his naggingboozed up wife to a snarling beast the tales drip with not just blood but a comical yet stinging look at banal archetypes.And the cast let me tell ya is damn good. It's not like they're handing out Academy Award winning lines but the acting is pretty well done. Tom Atkins is pretty great as the abusive father Viveca Lindfore Bedelia was awesome and who can forget Mr. King himself as Jordy Verrill? Ted Danson Fritz Weaver Hal Holbrook YES E.G. Marshall and the alwaysstunning Adrienne Barbeau do spectacular jobs. My favorite performance would just have to be Leslie Nielsen. He was pretty awesome let's face it.Topping all this off is one of my favorite horror film scores by none other than John Harrison. He also composed for Romero's 1985 film Day of the Dead. Synthesizers and pianos not to mention an eerie chorus the music is just great. And the effects work of Tom Savini as always astounds. From creating the walking dead no pun intended to vicious cratedyetibeast to a horde of disgusting cockroaches he excels in his line of work.Creepshow is a damn classic and should be eternally revered by all means. My only gripe is that the U.S. DVD is crap seeing as it contains no special features aside a trailer. I haven't seen a DVD with this little effort since Sony Tristar released those awful '50th Anniversary special edition' Godzilla DVDs. If you truly appreciate horror and as I intend to do buy yourself a copy of the Region 2 DVD which comes with behind the scenes material commentaries and interviews with the masters behind the masterpiece. And trust me Region 2 DVDs should play on most bluray and DVD players. My region 2 Godzilla DVDs perform just fine on both.Where's my Father's Day Cake?".

Most interesting is the use of animation created masterfully by Rick Catizone.  It takes us from the reality of a child's world to the stirrings of the comic book monsters he reads about.  The animation draws us in and blurs the line between fantasy and reality.  Rick's artistry creates a wideeyed tender child just as easily as he creates the Creep who tells the stories and the effect of color that both connects the scenes as well as the stories.  The cast is fabulous as well.  Each one addresses the challenge of black comedy in a superb way  never going over the top or flying just under the radar. You'll never hear  Henry! or Glub.

I actually stopped watching that episode and didn't finish watching it until days later. This movie is very good. It's cheap looking at times yes but can you do better? If so give me a call and we'll talk. The last episode grossed me out and I didn't sleep well that night. Every time I heard a skitter or some small noise I would jump. I highly recommend this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my favorite horror movie anthologies.  All five stories are pretty good some of course are better than others.  This one is also a lot better than Creepshow 2 which had only one really good story to it.  The first story is an ok story involving this old man killed by his daughter. He comes back to life expecting a cake cause its father's day.  Nothing to surprising happens here but it is still pretty fun.  The next one involves the story that has Stephen King as the main star.  This is probably the weakest one of the five but it is worth a chuckle or two as King does a somewhat good job of playing a slow fellow.  This story involves a meteor that makes grass grow everywhere.  The next story is one of the best a revenge tale with Ted Danson and Leslie Nielson.  Danson has been having an affair with Nielson's wife so Nielson takes him to the beach and buries him up to his neck in the sand.  He had done the same thing with his wife and the tide apparently kills them both...or does it?  The next tale is rather good as well as it has Adriean Barbeau in it as this obnoxious wife.  Her husband finds out about a crate that may take care of her though.  And the final tale is about a doctor or something who is a bit of a clean freak. He lives in a special apartment that is supposed to be germ free but it apparently has a roach problem.  I don't even think he is a doctor but he seems to be wearing a doctor's clothes.  All in all Creepshow is a pretty enjoyable flick.".

The scenes always started out as comic book panel but morph into a live action scene. The stories have everything horror fans could want. Rotting zombies strange plants that won't stop growing cartoonish revenge plots monsters under the stairs and mass swarms of bugs that can't be stopped.

Not brutally scary so kids love it cleverly funny so adults love it and comic bookish so everyone loves it!To me this is the 'perfect movie' for a horror fan to show to their earlyteen to 'see' if the youngster likes scary movies or not depending on the child of course.It's presented in a comic book fashion which gives it an attractive element that kids will enjoy. It also has 'silly' parts such as The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill played by none other than the writer and Master himself Stephen King. It's family fun on Halloween night! To this day I have no idea as to WHY this movie has an 'R' rating. Some 'TV shows' which EVERYONE has access to are actually more graphic and more serious...i.e.  The Walking Dead also one of my personal favorites Z Nation etc.As with 'any' movie or TV show watch it first then do as you feel is right. I saw this at fifteen my Son saw it at ten kids nowadays probably see it at 6!?!? Considering what's now on television this movie may even appear to a child as unscary and pass  much like many of the the horror movies of the 1940s and 1950s were to my 1970s generation!?!?I LOVE HORROR MOVIES and this flick is one of my alltime favorites as it's 'nottootart and nottoosweet it's just right! It also brings me back to my teens when the most important subjects in my life were girls sports comic books record albums vinyl of course and the latest HORROR MOVIE! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!".

The stories are told with a witty and coherent script and lively pace a perfectly fitting electronic musical score and a great wraparound story brings it to a satisfying close.

	schema:headline " Pure gold Creepshow is truly my favourite movie of all time. A priceless horror classic.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a fan of most film types but I do like horror the best. Mostly 80's ones. I believe this film is responsible for my lifelong love of the genre not just the films but also books and short stories. I love discovering the truly great ones. I believe everyone has a favourite movie and if they don't then they just haven't seen it yet. 10 out of 10 doesn't begin to cover what this movie means to me. A million wouldn't be enough. When I watch this movie it makes me feel kinda happy! As a little kid I would always seem to watch this around Christmas time. So this fun but gruesome movie in which people get eaten alive and horribly killed actually makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside! It never scared me a bit. I always found it way too fun and enchanting to possibly be scared by it. There's just one thing I don't like. It's when some big scare happens and the colour of everything will change to some bright hue. I don't think it works it looks silly. For me it takes away from the movie rather than adding anything. This movie is not for all the sickos out there That is such complete bullshit. You're thinking of the slimy likes of Hostel there. All the music is fantastic and is a huge part of why I love it. Three little cues in Lonesome Death Tide and Crate are from Night of the living Dead. All the scores set the various tones so perfectly in all the tales... I love Vivica Lindfors performance in the first tale. So funny so bitter! The grave scene where she drunkenly rants at her dead father is both moving and funny. All those wonderful mannerisms she does with her hands. The most scary moment in the tale for me is when Bedelia arrives at the cemetery and imagines her father's voice. So creepy. The Grantham zombie is one of the best scariest zombies of all time. The worms in the face dirtrattling voice shambling walk. Love it. I've seen it tons but still feel the sweet anticipation of the final scene. Yarg! Head cake!!! So over the top so awesome. What the hell happened next is what I always wanted to know! This is a great tale. You can almost set your watch by it... The second is the most loopy and humorous tale. The one I like the least. I always thought of it as something to get over before getting back to the good stuff. It's not bad just a little less fun than the rest. Stephen King was never the best looking of guys. I thought he played the goofball Jordy very well. Bingo O' Malley was funny too in the surreal daydreams. Loved that meteor! With that weird dingdong sound it makes. I love the weird warbly space alien sound that hums throughout. And the grass! I do love the grass itself. It's cool how they made it look all strange and glowy rather than just ordinary grass! Space grass apocalypse!!! The whole tide coming in element of the third episode is quite claustrophobic and very impressively done. The scene where Leslie Nielson returns to the beach to admire his handiwork is very eerie. There is something uniquely creepy about a cold deserted beach with a ghostly wind blowing. When poor Becky and Richard come back as sea zombies you can still recognise Danson but Ross is completely unrecognisable. They look brilliant all puffy and wrinkled and drowned looking. It makes it all the sweeter when they get their revenge on Nielson! Die jerk!!! Tale number four is easily the scariest. Fritz Weaver's babbling always bugged me. I first saw Adrienne Barbeau in this so whenever I would see her in anything else I would always remember her as the drunkard harpy from hellBillie! She is magnificent. I love the horrible pitch she does with her voice. Even the monster can't stand the sound! Her funniest line for me is one involving Flipper! I actually feel a little sorry for her when she gets eaten face first! And it does sound like the monster growls thank you Henry! You never know! I love the monster's lair. There is something so marvellously simple and creepy about an ordinary placething housing some terrible and deadly secret and Stephen King knows this very well. I wouldn't bother with his short story version of The Crate though. Let's just say say they used the best parts of it. I just love mysterious creatures. This one's no mystery though. I'ts the Abominable Snowman. Hello?! ARCTIC expedition! Tazmanian Devil my ass Fangtastic monkey devil. Obviously some kind of demon. The longevity's a dead giveaway and the way that it can suck people up like a vacuum cleaner! Clearly crafted with such tender loving care. The ending is genuinely chilling with the monster glaring up from the dark depths with those horrible eyes of ancient evil... From the murk to the deceptively bright and clean. Obviously because it involves bugs the final tale is the one that most gets under your skin. The cold clinical atmosphere and crazy bug music really gets you thinking of crawling things. I thought E.G.Marshall was terrific as a rich and mean old git who gets his apples. The moment when all the roaches burst from the dead Pratt's chest. That is one of the greatest horror moments ever. It's spectacular. Thank you George for making my favourite movie thank you Stephen for dreaming it up with that brilliant mind of yours that understands the fun in horror so well thank you Tom for creating all your beautiful ghouls and beasts that so captured my imagination. Greatest horror anthology movie ever. Bravo gentleman bravo. I have nothing but love for this sweet jewel of a horror movie and I hope I expressed that well here today. Thank you for reading.".

I thought he played the goofball Jordy very well. Bingo O' Malley was funny too in the surreal daydreams. Loved that meteor! With that weird dingdong sound it makes. I love the weird warbly space alien sound that hums throughout. And the grass! I do love the grass itself. It's cool how they made it look all strange and glowy rather than just ordinary grass! Space grass apocalypse!!! The whole tide coming in element of the third episode is quite claustrophobic and very impressively done. The scene where Leslie Nielson returns to the beach to admire his handiwork is very eerie. There is something uniquely creepy about a cold deserted beach with a ghostly wind blowing. When poor Becky and Richard come back as sea zombies you can still recognise Danson but Ross is completely unrecognisable. They look brilliant all puffy and wrinkled and drowned looking. It makes it all the sweeter when they get their revenge on Nielson! Die jerk!!! Tale number four is easily the scariest. Fritz Weaver's babbling always bugged me. I first saw Adrienne Barbeau in this so whenever I would see her in anything else I would always remember her as the drunkard harpy from hellBillie! She is magnificent. I love the horrible pitch she does with her voice. Even the monster can't stand the sound! Her funniest line for me is one involving Flipper! I actually feel a little sorry for her when she gets eaten face first! And it does sound like the monster growls thank you Henry! You never know! I love the monster's lair. There is something so marvellously simple and creepy about an ordinary placething housing some terrible and deadly secret and Stephen King knows this very well. I wouldn't bother with his short story version of The Crate though. Let's just say say they used the best parts of it. I just love mysterious creatures. This one's no mystery though. I'ts the Abominable Snowman. Hello?! ARCTIC expedition! Tazmanian Devil my ass Fangtastic monkey devil. Obviously some kind of demon. The longevity's a dead giveaway and the way that it can suck people up like a vacuum cleaner! Clearly crafted with such tender loving care. The ending is genuinely chilling with the monster glaring up from the dark depths with those horrible eyes of ancient evil... From the murk to the deceptively bright and clean. Obviously because it involves bugs the final tale is the one that most gets under your skin. The cold clinical atmosphere and crazy bug music really gets you thinking of crawling things. I thought E.G.Marshall was terrific as a rich and mean old git who gets his apples. The moment when all the roaches burst from the dead Pratt's chest. That is one of the greatest horror moments ever. It's spectacular. Thank you George for making my favourite movie thank you Stephen for dreaming it up with that brilliant mind of yours that understands the fun in horror so well thank you Tom for creating all your beautiful ghouls and beasts that so captured my imagination. Greatest horror anthology movie ever. Bravo gentleman bravo. I have nothing but love for this sweet jewel of a horror movie and I hope I expressed that well here today. Thank you for reading.";

	schema:reviewBody "Stephen King and George Romero joined forces and brought us an anthology of short horror stories tied together as stories in a 1950's style horror comic book. The film includes five stories all written by King a deceased father returns from the grave for a special Father's Day reunion a smalltown simpleton dreams of riches when a strange meteor crashes on his property a jolted husband exacts revenge on his cheating wife and her lover a professor discovers a centuryold secret hidden in a crate beneath the stairs and a germophobic businessman's germproof apartment is invaded by cockroaches. The stories are all tied together as part of a comic book with some cool illustrations used as transitions between each tale.I was surprised by some of the good performances in this movie. My favorite would easily be Leslie Nielsen as Richard Vickers in Something to Tide You Over the husband getting his thrills from torturing his cheating wife and her boyfriend. I enjoyed seeing Nielsen in a role that wasn't comedic as I was used to. Instead we get a glimpse of his evil side. Oddly enough I also enjoyed Stephen King's cartoonish performance as the title character in The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill. The first time I saw the movie I found him annoying. Since then it's grown on me and now I enjoy his bit in the movie. We also get some good performances from Ted Danson and E.G. Marshall though it's said Ed Harris was given such a small role. It almost feels wasteful.As I had mentioned the entire movie is stylized to create the feeling of 1950's horror comics. This means we treated to plenty of gelcolored lighting oblique camera angles eccentric characters and even some comic book framingcaptions. It creates a fun style but it tends to detract from any horror element in the film. If it weren't for the occasional walking dead or bloodthirsty creature I would almost consider this more of a dark comedy. Regardless of the genre the film is entertaining for a two hour viewing though nothing special. Despite it's horror roots there isn't too much objectionable content which makes it relatively safe for the younger crowd to enjoy too. I wouldn't consider this film a classic but it's worth the time to watch it if you haven't seen it yet.My favorite segment if I were to chose one would definitely be Something to Tide You Over. Leslie Nielsen FTW.".

	schema:reviewBody "Italian horror films are generally well known for preferring visual style and atmosphere over logical plotting and realistic dialogue but in the 1970's these films became increasingly overthetop stylistically and often downright nonsensical. Of course they also tended to paper over all the gaping plot holes with copious and often even ridiculous amounts of sex and nudity. But I didn't mind as much here as the latter was all provided by the very lovely Leonora Fani.A young university student Lillian Fani returns to her family's country villa near a lake where years earlier had mother drowned. She is supposedly researching a local legend a witch called Kira and strange symbol associated with her. But she seems to spend a lot less time at the library researching than she does flat on her back giving it up to all local guys. Whenever she reaches orgasm however she falls into a weird death trance and some horrible fate befalls her sex partner a car accident a drowning etc. Naturally there's a lot of talk in the town about this strange slutty girl but she still never seems to lack for willing sex partners. Lillian also seems to have some kind of weird relationship with a local mentally retarded girl name Lilith who is always spying on Lilian and masturbating whenever she has sex which makes for quite a rigorous masturbation schedule. Meanwhile the witch Kira who looks kind of like the Italian fumetti comicstrip villainess Baba Yagi also seems to be hanging around. And Lillian'sown mother though generally unseen except in the prologue is referred to by the locals as the lady in the lake. And if four weird women isn't enough there's also a little local blind girl who tears the heads off her dolls and says a lot of cryptic things.This is not Enzo Castellari's best film by a longshot and he claims he didn't actually direct most of it. But any strengths it does have are owing to his visual style. He makes this nonsense as spooky as possible and despite the numerous sex scenes he maintains an atmosphere more of Gothic horror than of softcore pornography. With the possible exception of Pension Paura this is probably Leanora Fani's classiest film. But this might not be saying much for an actress who starred in a movie with the selfexplanatory title Naked Massacre in the uberscummy Giallo in Venice a flick for those who enjoy some very graphic softcore pornography with their bloody dismemberment in the deranged Beastialita where her love interest is a big dog and even in some hardcore porn films although she was not actually a hardcore actress. Fani is actually pretty good here but ItalianAmerican character actor Vincent Gardenia is completely wasted as a local yokel. This kind of reminded me of the movie version of Babi Yaga with Carroll Baker but it isn't as good as that one. It's not terrible though.".

On second viewing I knew why the story didn't stay with me it's not that memorable. A young woman returns to the country chteau where her mother drowned years ago. There is something haunting about the place a supernatural ambiance. A wild young woman with a similar name holds the key. Meanwhile every villager our heroine sleeps with meets a strange accident. Also why does the heroine have a psychicsexual link with the wild woman? All is explained by the end if not satisfyingly. In fact the entire ending feels rushed and haphazard as if the production ran out of money. However what The House by the Edge of the Lake misses in narrative coherence it more than makes up for with an atmospheric location a handful of offkilter scenes and a fair amount of sex. The storyline seems like something Jess Franco would have written. Since Enzo Castellari is directing the film House is fun to watch in ways that Franco films usually are not.".

In fact the entire ending feels rushed and haphazard as if the production ran out of money. However what The House by the Edge of the Lake misses in narrative coherence it more than makes up for with an atmospheric location a handful of offkilter scenes and a fair amount of sex. The storyline seems like something Jess Franco would have written. Since Enzo Castellari is directing the film House is fun to watch in ways that Franco films usually are not.";

Flash forward to her adult life as she lives in a haunted ? house and has sex with men that mysteriously die soon after through scary twisted events one of which includes a telekinetic link with her sister who masturbates frequently I counted at least five times. The plot makes absolutely NO sense and no explanations are given for anything not even the  hand which demands an explanation if ever there was one. Lots o' titties bouncin' around but the gratuitous nudie romps in the hay are wasted in an amateur hour production that rivals the poorest of Italian lakehouse ripoffs. Most of the first act is outright incompetent with basic direction that wouldn't pass a USC intro class let alone grab international distribution. One masturbatory sequence shows the same car explosion in triple! split screen and Castellari gives himself a glorified actor's cameo. Given most great directors' inability to show any signs of screen presence in front of a camera Castellari looks to have bulked up with steroids and growth hormones for his meaty role.

I generally try to get French DVDs with subtitles in French for the hard of hearing as that helps if they speak too fast for me or have difficult accents. Nonetheless I enjoyed this very much and although I missed some of the dialogue it was always clear what was happening. I saw this when it came out in the 60s and it has stayed with me ever since. I have been looking for it on DVD for a long time and bought it as soon as I saw it on a French website. I now find it a very thoughtful antiwar film which acknowledges the widespread collaboration with the Nazis which together with the ending must have been shocking to French opinion at the time. Charles Aznavour is excellent as the believable everyman and the rest of the cast are fine. Georges Riviere plays a character that I remembered as quite unsympathetic but interestingly I now see as much more complex and in his own way principled. Recommended.".

	schema:headline " A fairly decent Crichton flick!";
	schema:reviewBody "After reading many users' mixed comments on the movie..i can't help but feel that a majority have underrated the film. True it could have been better especially in the latter half but having read the book first i did not feel it actually falling off midway like the way other viewers have described it. People who have read the novel will acknowledge that the movie does follow the novel fairly closely. Thus comments about Hoffman's role and the ending are unfair since i feel they are the closest bigscreen reproductions of one of Crichton's best works. I feel Stone's character was the role followed the weakest.Definitely the giant squid thrills are insufficient note that Crichton devoted a good part of his novel describing encounters with 'the monster'. I guess animation artists were short budgeted...though the film as a whole still is a visual treat...and the atmosphere is rightly captured with nice music.Overall I think the movie is worth watching and is definitely of a much higher caliber than 'The Lost World'. It follows a psychologicalcumscifi thriller theme and i feel is better than the similar flick 'Abyss'. As from the novel's pointofview...it could have been done better though. 810 stars!".

True it could have been better especially in the latter half but having read the book first i did not feel it actually falling off midway like the way other viewers have described it. People who have read the novel will acknowledge that the movie does follow the novel fairly closely. Thus comments about Hoffman's role and the ending are unfair since i feel they are the closest bigscreen reproductions of one of Crichton's best works.

	schema:headline " A strangely disappointing adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel that comes off to a smashing good start but very quickly approaches a precipitous downhill.";
	schema:reviewBody "Sphere is a science fiction film that starts off with a tremendously fascinating story and ignores all of the possibilities that it entails. Four people you know the drill  a psychologist Dustin Hoffman a mathematician Samuel L. Jackson a biochemist Sharon Stone and an astrophysicist Liev Schreiber are flown out to the middle of the ocean on a topsecret missions even they don't know where they're going. We would be just as confused as they were about the details of their mission if we had never seen the previews but even though we already know what they're going to find out there it's just as interesting to learn about the details of this ship that has been found on the bottom of the ocean and that appears to have been sitting there for 300 years well okay 288. The story keeps getting better and better as we learn that there is a hum coming from the ship indicating that there is still something running inside it and then even more fascinating revelations once we are taken inside the ship. There can be no doubt that Sphere contains some truly interesting and entertaining elements and that things like the acting are just as superb as we would expect from such a spectacular cast but as the movie progresses we begin to realize how little the film is going to reveal. I can't say that I wasn't completely enraptured for at the least the first hour of the film but there were just as many bitterly disappointing things about it as there were good things. Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L. Jackson in particular delivered absolutely brilliant performances in this film delivering some of the best entertainment in the entire film by themselves. There is a mildly interesting but completely unconvincing exromantic tension between Sharon Stone's character Dr. Beth Halperin and Dustin Hoffman's character Dr. Norman Goodman that is there for little other reason than to complicate the lives of the characters as they try to solve the mystery of this undersea ship. spoilers It's really too bad that the movie completely falls on its face in the second half because the first half of the film is excellent and undeniably entertaining. There's nothing like a bit of time travel and the suggestion of extraterrestrial life to keep you entertained and it is definitely a great scene when we find out that the ship is a human ship. This is one of the many things in the film that really makes you think. The thing that makes a great film is that it inspires thought. This is probably the one thing that all of the great films have in common with each other. There are surely a lot of things about Sphere that really make you think which is another reason that the first half of the film is so good. We see that it's a human ship which opens a whole new area of possibilities for the film. Harry Samuel L. Jackson speculates on the fact that the last entry in the ship's log is an entry into an Unknown entry event' indicating that they will never reach the surface to reveal what they've found. There is also a possibly overextensive excursion into the realm of the psychological element in the film as the characters are all made to face their fears some of which are not just your average fears such as Harry's strange fear of finishing 20000 Leagues Under The Sea. The special effects are definitely nothing to brag about but there are some interesting scenes that take place in the deep ocean such as the death of Teeny Fletcher hey she's black she had it coming right? in the midst of a mass of strange sea creatures as well as the scene with the thousands of squid eggs. Weird looking things I've wondered since I saw the film what kind of props they used for that scene. The conversation with Jerry' is unfittingly childish but there is definitely a significant element of tension introduced when Jerry gets mad as well as the scene where Norman contemplated the implications of Jerry's expression of emotions indicating his ability to get mad.  There are undeniably a lot of interesting things about Sphere and it surely has the power to entertain but it goes off the track later in the film maybe because it tried to answer too many of its questions. There are some unanswerable things in the film and the movie deals with them by having the characters have a weaklywritten discussion about their fears and questions and their ultimate decision to forget' what they know using the power that they seem to have gained from the sphere. While this answers the question of how it could have been an unknown entry event when they all made it to the surface it's probably the weakest ending that the film could possibly have had. As a strange twist on the science fiction genre Sphere succeeds although only in the first half. Like Hollow Man Sphere could have and should have been a much better film. The unfortunate fact about the film is that it contains a lot of very interesting and very entertaining things that are surely worth watching but the disappointing ending almost makes them not even worth seeing.".

As a psychologist he is impatiently waiting to speak to the survivors and after having been on the sub for over 3 hours is upset with the Capatain. However the Captain informs him there was no plane crash but rather an arrival of some sort not quite 300 years ago under the Ocean.Sharon Stone Leive Shreiber and Samuael L. Jackson join Hoffman as apart of his team to go beneath the surface to discover and determine what it is exactly that they have found under the Pacific.With complete intensity and excitement nonstop throughout the entire film it will leave you feeling a little disturbed at times and perhaps a bit paranoid also.I would advice anyone who does not have a liking to intense scifi type films...this is not going to be your cup of tea but for those enjoy good horror intensity and a great story line you will definitely enjoy this flick!".

	schema:reviewBody "When the military discover what they believe to be a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean they bring in Dr Norman Goodman who had once written a report on the protocol for an alien encounter.  His report had named a team of experts  this team is also assembled.  The team descend to the craft and begin to find some astonishing things about the craft.  However when they find a huge golden sphere they begin to experience problems.  Problems that become worse when a storm traps them at the bottom of the ocean.With a cast like this  you gotta have high hopes.  With a director and a writer to match you deserve something fantastic!  And for the most part this delivers.  The build up is dark mysterious and exciting.  However once the sphere is found it goes downhill.  It still has some really good moments  the jellyfish bit is scary and other actions bits are cool.  But it gets all muddled up in what the sphere is and who is doing what on the base.  It almost manages to hold together until the final half hour then it all just collapses like a flan in a cupboard!  It's a shame because for the most part it felt like it was building to something much better but no.The cast promised much but didn't deliver.  Jackson was great but I don't think he can be bad  even in a bad movie.  Hoffman stutters around like he doesn't know what he's doing.  I know he's meant to be playing a character that isn't used to heroics but he doesn't bring anything.  Stone is OK but at times looks like she reading her lines off a board.  Coyote is OK and Schreiber is understated by his own hammy standards.  It's also cool to see Queen Latifah in a role.Overall this is worth watching as for the majority it's real good.  However you notice that the film has got 30 minutes left to go  make your excuses and leave by then you've seen the best it has to offer.".

His report had named a team of experts  this team is also assembled.  The team descend to the craft and begin to find some astonishing things about the craft.  However when they find a huge golden sphere they begin to experience problems.  Problems that become worse when a storm traps them at the bottom of the ocean.With a cast like this  you gotta have high hopes.  With a director and a writer to match you deserve something fantastic!  And for the most part this delivers.  The build up is dark mysterious and exciting.  However once the sphere is found it goes downhill.  It still has some really good moments  the jellyfish bit is scary and other actions bits are cool.  But it gets all muddled up in what the sphere is and who is doing what on the base.  It almost manages to hold together until the final half hour then it all just collapses like a flan in a cupboard!  It's a shame because for the most part it felt like it was building to something much better but no.The cast promised much but didn't deliver.  Jackson was great but I don't think he can be bad  even in a bad movie.  Hoffman stutters around like he doesn't know what he's doing.  I know he's meant to be playing a character that isn't used to heroics but he doesn't bring anything.  Stone is OK but at times looks like she reading her lines off a board.  Coyote is OK and Schreiber is understated by his own hammy standards.  It's also cool to see Queen Latifah in a role.Overall this is worth watching as for the majority it's real good.  However you notice that the film has got 30 minutes left to go  make your excuses and leave by then you've seen the best it has to offer.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have written about this film in the past under another moniker and decided to give it another go under my current name. Sphere which tanked at the box office is an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about a mysterious object found in a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean. Dustin Hoffman plays a shrink who is enlisted by the government in the form of Peter Coyote to lead a team to examine the spaceship. Once inside they find the stranger artifact a simple sphere. What they find in time is that the thing allows those who come into contact with it to manifest their thoughts into reality. Nuff said about the plot. The first half of the movie is pretty entertaining as we only know what the shrink and his team know. The second half is an utter dog. Looks like they rushed production scrimped on the special effects and generally made a mess of what might been another 2001. Hoffman is all wrong for his role and Sharon Stone as his exwife and fellow explorer is also miscast. A better movie on a similar theme is Anderson's Event Horizon which unfortunately also suffers from a weak second half. I'd even recommend Cameron's The Abyss over this as long as you don't mind sitting through a movie that is longer than necessary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Crichton a sciencefiction novelist and screenplay writer for several of his own adaptations has had many of his ideas become successful and iconic pieces in cinema. The best of Mr. Crichton's work is by far everyone's favorite prehistoric predator film Jurassic Park 1993. That and Westworld 1973 twenty years before. There's something about Crichton's work that has many of the same motifs that show up in a lot of his other written works. One of the most notable elements is the discovery of a new science by humans and it ends up becoming more than humanity can handle. Reemphasizing this again is in this Crichton adaptation that went largely unnoticed. Was it because it was bad? No but as a final product there's a lot left to be desired with this sci fi thriller.The story to this movie is about a group of doctors in different fields that travel to the bottom of the ocean to analyze a UFO that has something mysterious inside. The mysterious plot device that's inside the ship is a giant perfectly shaped golden sphere. After visiting it strange things begin occurring on the ship and it's up to the small crew to figure it out. Directed by Barry Levinson who has produced other Crichton adaptations shows that he has competent direction in how he wanted the story to play out. Yet his pair of writers didn't seem to know how to make it work to the fullest extent. The writers on board for this production were Stephen Hauser which was his only credit and Paul Attanasio. Both of which flesh out the characters and do create some highstrung tension scenes with minor psychological elements but when it comes to explaining the orb they miss it almost entirely.The underwater crew is made up of Dustin Hoffman a psychiatrist Sharon Stone a biochemist Samuel L. Jackson a mathematician and Liev Schreiber a doctor in physics and two operators Peter Coyote and Queen Latifah. Of these characters only Latifah who has a minor role seemed slightly out of place all the rest act fine in their roles. That means distinctive personalities and charms. The actor who viewers would probably find the most likable is Hoffman who has a knack for being mostly nonchalant through each situation he's put into. I guess shrinks are supposed to be this calm? Not sure but it gives him the right amount of charm. The connection these characters have is that they were all associated with Hoffman's role. Funny how popular 80s singer Huey Lewis even had a small scene stealing moment at the beginning of the movie. Random but a treat.The sphere plot device is also a treat when things start rolling pardon the pun. However this is exactly when the problems begin to arise. In order for strange events to happen there's got to be reasons to back up and justify these moments. For this case there is only one explanation given amongst a slew of other questions that go unanswered. One thing that really threw me off was when Hoffman's character discovers a cabinet worth of a specific item. Who stocked that thing? I could see if it was a mind game or hallucination but it was for real. Tell me who had the time to do that? I have to admit moments like those will keep its audience guessing and with Hoffman's character being a shrink the psychological aspect to the film does help make the tenseness quite intellectual. The only problem is that parts of it only theorized possible reasons but never gave definitive solutions. These of which were all based on observation.The only other negative part to the presentation of this movie is how it deliberately splits up its acts into chapters. There is no need for two reasons. One being that the audience will figure out when the next act is because each chapter if you want to call it that fades out to black. The other reason is that giving a title for the next sequence can somewhat spoil the upcoming surprising scene that audiences may not see coming. Instead audiences are presented with giant bold print stating exactly what's headed their way. Why go through the trouble of shooting yourself in the foot like that? But enough on that the last bits of the film still work in its favor. This belongs to the cinematography shot by Adam Greenberg The Terminator 1984 and Rush Hour 1998 and the music composed by Elliot Goldenthal. Since Greenberg has been the director of photography before for bigger projects he shows that can effectively conceal the illusion during the underwater scenes. As for music Goldenthal who isn't always the most memorable actually surprises this time. That means creating themes for certain aspects of the film which includes creepy piano keys and quite wondrous sounding strings. It really stuck.The film has competent acting cinematography music interesting psychological elements thrown in and some tense thrills. However the writing sorely lacks in clearing up much of the plot device that is directly involved in the story other than giving a small assumption only based on observation. That and the chapter segments are a bit unnecessary.".

It soon transpires that the ship has been there for more than 300 years. As they explore it they discover a mysterious sphere and as they study it strange things start to happen.I won't spoil the story too much but there is a really interesting concept here involving time travel and first contact with alien technology and they completely ruined it. Soon after they discover the sphere the plot descends into complete nonsense and remains that way until the end.The acting on the other hand is superb not that you could expect any less from an all star cast with Dustin Hoffman Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone. The characters are well developed and the drama is believable.Sphere is a tense film and despite the dissatisfying plot it keeps you watching and there are some good jump moments. The editing is done well and the underwater cinematography is great.All in all sphere is a film that in my opinion has a plot with a lot of potential that gets lost halfway through but remains enjoyable though good direction and solid acting.

	schema:reviewBody "The fourth Michael Crichton adaptation in line is quite a good one. After the blockbuster success of Jurassic Park' and minor hits Congo' and The Lost World' Sphere' matches up to theses levels. And with so much talent in store it certainly is appealing. Academy Award winners Barry Levinson and Dustin Hoffman who coincidentally won Oscars for the same film and Oscar Nominees Sharon Stone and Samuel L. Jackson all headline the movie.The end result is relatively good but with so much talent on board it could have been a bit better. However the film succeeds in what attempts to do. There are ample scarifying chills along with a high enjoyability factor. The haunting suspense is soon followed by an equally chilling action. This is good because other chillers such as The Sixth Sense' built up the suspense but no action followed. For that film the scares lost all their quality the second time round. But in Sphere's' case the suspense keeps its intensity every time.The film starts out very well whilst on the surface but gradually it gets worse only to amount to a satisfying conclusion. The middle scenes aren't bad but they're a bit too gloomy and eerie.  Another quibble is the obvious lack of originality. The main plot of Event Horizon' which was made the year before that is quite similar to the plot of this. There are also bits and pieces of other science fictions such as Alien' taken here and there. Luckily it takes the bests bits and leaves you on the edge of your seat. But the finished product isn't as nourishing as it should be. The plot can get complicated at times but for the most part it's actually quite clever.And the glamorous cast of familiar faces insures that the movie never drags on. Dustin Hoffman is well cast as the calm stable psychiatrist and makes a suitable lead. It's not her most challenging role but Sharon Stone s believable as the kooky biochemist. She still hasn't received any tough roles after Casino' though. The most complex character in the film Samuel L. Jackson drops the usual machismo for some convincing scepticism and abnormal goofiness. The supporting cast including Leiv Shreiber Queen Latifah and Peter Coyote do their parts adequately not that they can do much with them.The directing is good as expected by a great director. Levinson beautifully creates the required intensity and the visuals are very impressive aswell. The glistering shimmer of the huge golden sphere of the title is a delight to gaze at.The stars flash and the plot sizzles. There are a few plotholes that it falls into along with a bit of a sag in the middle. Nevertheless Sphere' is an impressive scifi horror that succeeds on almost every other level. My IMDb Rating 6.810.".

The supporting cast including Leiv Shreiber Queen Latifah and Peter Coyote do their parts adequately not that they can do much with them.The directing is good as expected by a great director. Levinson beautifully creates the required intensity and the visuals are very impressive aswell. The glistering shimmer of the huge golden sphere of the title is a delight to gaze at.The stars flash and the plot sizzles. There are a few plotholes that it falls into along with a bit of a sag in the middle. Nevertheless Sphere' is an impressive scifi horror that succeeds on almost every other level. My IMDb Rating 6.810.";

Soon he learns that he was actually summoned by Captain Harold C. Barnes Peter Coyote to teamup with the biochemistry Dr. Elizabeth 'Beth' Halperin Sharon Stone the mathematician Dr. Harry Adams Samuel L. Jackson and the astrophysical Dr. Ted Fielding Liev Schreiber to investigate an unknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eightyeight years ago. The team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the UFO 1000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military Alice 'Teeny' Fletcher Queen Latifah and Jane Edmunds Marga Gmez. Barnes Norman Beth Harry and Ted go to the spaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future. Further the computer indicates an Unknown Entry Event probably a Black Hole that brought the spaceship to the past. Harry uses logic and concludes that if the crew had never heard anything about their discovery in the present days they will probably dies. But they all are intrigued with a mysterious sphere inside the spacecraft. There is a storm in the surface and the fleet must leave the area leaving Barnes and his team without communication. Harry sneaks out and enters in the sphere and then his manifestations come to life threatening the group. Will they survive to the power of the mysterious sphere?I saw Sphere on the late 90's but I did not like it. Yesterday I saw it again now on DVD and this time I found it a scifi with an intelligent story but with a terrible direction. The greatest problem are the characters that are unpleasant unlikable and emotionally detached and without feelings. The situation of the fleet leaving the area due to a storm but without leaving a submarine in the area to give support to the group is also a great flaw in the story. This screenplay in the hands of Spielberg or James Cameron could have been a great film. My vote is six.Title Brazil Esfera Sphere".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sphere 1998Barry Levinson is one of those directors who has no interest in art or in invention or in pretension either. And so his films sometimes hit a popular strain that makes them take off. He has some terrible misfires for sure but his best films Rain Man Sleepers have people who you relate to and who have to confront something extraordinary.That was the idea here based on a Michael Crichton novel that should have been a heads up. The cast is headliner stuff. Dustin Hoffman is particularly convincing Samuel Jackson plays a great type and Liev Schreiber is sharp. Sharon Stone is a dull fourth. They bond and realize they have things in common in the first minutes of the film as they converge and go under water to check out an alien spaceship. Even after they are deep below the surface and beginning their unlikely exploration they make a viewer connect. As much as it borrows from Alien and Aliens this could have been a good film on its own terms. Even the talking computeralien has its own edge compared to HAL.What goes wrong is the plot itself and not acting or even directing can overcome that. As it gets hairier we need it to be more plausible not less. Events get increasingly chaotic so that action and loud noise drive some of the scenes. Subplots are continued but seem increasingly meaningless at one point Hoffman and Stone are rushing into the water in an absolute emergency and they start to chitchat about their distant failed love affair. And finally as people die off and the menace becomes more ambiguous the movie becomes completely ambiguous and as a kind of escape valve announces that any number of crazy thing we have been watching may or may not have been imagined by one character or another.But what does that mean about the camera? Isn't there still a differentiation between cinema reality and one character's delusion? Or if these are global delusions including the viewer shouldn't they do more than simply disorient us? Well don't hang on for answers. Just hang on. An explosion of course caps it all off why they didn't hit the disarm button isn't explained and a final logical wrap up that avoids the time travel paradox is warm and fuzzy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sphere 1998 is about the discovery of a huge spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean and the humming maybe living sphere found inside. A team of scientists are sent down to investigate  a psychologist Dustin Hoffman a mathematician Samuel L. Jackson a biochemist Sharon Stone and an astrophysicist Liev Schreiber. Two notable characters at the station on the ocean floor are played by Peter Coyote and Queen Latifah. Mystery and some horror ensue.Based on Michael Crichton's novel Sphere intermixes elements of other sciffi flicks like Forbidden Planet 1956 Solaris 1972 Alien 1979 and The Abyss 1989. Like those movies the plot involves a small group of people who are isolated from society and encounter the unknown. The theme is the actualization of one's thoughts and fears and the potential for good or more likely bad that comes with it. Are we mature enough as a species to handle such power? Of course we already have this power just not to the degree depicted in the story seemingly. Anything important that we do whether productive or destructive is formulated within first and then manifests without like a song or a book or a loving relationship. If we truly knew the power at our disposal we'd hardly be able to sleep at night we'd be so excited! The first hour or so is quite good because the film definitely makes you feel like you're at the bottom of the ocean. The mystery is engaging and the actors formidable. Unfortunately some parts of the second half don't work so well. The sea snake scene for instance is really weak particularly the way Stone's character responds to the situation. It seemed more like a dream than reality and maybe that's what the director Barry Levinson was shooting for a cross between reality and nightmare but it comes across wrong. Lame parts like this destroy the illusion of the movie. As far as the ending goes it features tricky material that's not easy to pull off and the movie's only halfsuccessful with it. The fact that it's somewhat successful is largely due to having great actors. They pulled it off.Despite the rushed vibe of parts of the second half the theme is great. This isn't a slasherfilminspace like Alien but is more thoughtprovoking which isn't to say it's as good. However there are some harrowing and creative aspects like the jelly fish sequence.While many lambaste Sphere it wasn't the box office dog you might think in light of the bad press. It made 37 million in 1999 dollars in the USA alone which is hardly a clunker. The problem was that it cost twice that to make.The film runs 132 minutes.GRADE B QUESTIONS ON THE THEME Don't read further unless you've seen the film Why is it that the dark side of the human subconscious is empowered by the alien technologyentity? Why not the positive side? The four scientists and the others strike me as quality souls who pretty much have it together. While not perfect human specimens they're strong people who have their phobias and destructive emotions under control. So why aren't their GOOD PRODUCTIVE thoughts  desires manifested rather than the bad? I could see if the story took place in a prison and the characters were pieces of sheet but that's not the case.Also who or what does the sphere represent? The Fountain of Life Psalm 369?".

The movie starts out okay i thought it could almost be a good movie but it went way down hill the last 30 minutes of the movie. Anyway this movie was just a complete bust and i don't recommend it. The only reason it got a 4 is because i like the story.";

	schema:reviewBody "Commando is one of the best Schwarzenegger's action films from the 80's a real badass he ever did Let's Party! It is my third favorite Schwarzenegger film. I grew up with Commando. It was my first real action movie I saw as a kid when I was 8 years old in 1990 somewhere there. Arnold Schwarzenegger become my favorite action star of all time. I love his movies I love this movie to death it is my favorite action film of all time. It is one men army against 200 soldiers and a terrorist who kidnapped retired special forces commando soldier's daughter and he has to go back in to action to rescue his daughter before she get's killed.One of the best action scenes in the film ever  explosions real effects real guns are used automatic and explosives weapons. No CGI or shaky cam in here it is a hard  R real blood squibs simply one of the best action films from the 80's. The music score the actors puppetry and so on.I used to be the biggest fan of Schwarzenegger of all time because his movie were damn good. What Schwarzenegger is doing with his career is a damn disgrace. I love Arnold's old films from the 80's when his career started I still can't believe that Schwarzenegger praise Terminator 2 Judgment Day that it is his best film but Commando doesn't. I would definitely say Commando is his best film. I know in the 80's Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone were competitive because the same year Rambo First Blood Part II come out and it was worldwide success it made more money than Commando and Rambo won an Oscar. Commando come out the same year and when Schwarzenegger learn about Rambo First Blood Part II he was extremely mad that time on Stallone and because Commando wasn't such a box office hit like Rambo First Blood Part II was.If I would had to chose an action film with one men army Commando or Rambo First Blood Part II you already know which one would I chose and that would be Rambo First Blood Part II cause I am a huge Rambo fan.Arnold blasts bad guys to pieces he beats all the bad security guys in the mall slides with the rope like Tarzan throws phone booth like for joke. Dresses with guns and he arms himself like an army and sneaks into Arias' fortress. That scene was a badass as a commando he shoots with machine guns M60 army of soldiers blows up barracks with Claymore and detonator fights with Bennett Vernon Wells and rescue his daughter Jenny Alyssa Milano. Matrix uses 4barreled rocket launcher and blows up the wall badass. Matrix kills all the soldiers the film is also a little slasher in which Matrix uses knives working tool axe and machete like Jason Voorhees in which he cut's a soldiers arm off really brutal.John Matrix was also my favorite action hero in my childhood and he was a comic book hero too me and guess what? He still is his right there between John Rambo and Marion Cobra Cobretti.Chelsea Field is also in the movie as one of the flight attendants she was in action movies like The Last Boy Scout Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man and Masters of the Universe she was in the action movies like this. I would definitely replace Rae Dawn Chong with Chelsea Field and put her as Matrix side kick.Great music score form James Horner who is no longer with us anymore R.I.P. Brilliant story with action and great cast simply badass one men army action film from the 80's. Every year I am watching this movie on Bluray with my dad I also do have a DVD home about this movie. Why can't Hollywood make action movies like this one today? The score is 10.".

	schema:headline " One of the best Action movies made in the 80's";
	schema:reviewBody "Commando 1985 It is one of the best a American action thriller film out there made in the world. The film is Directed by Mark L. Lester and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rae Dawn Chong.Released in 1985 'Commando' starred action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger as a retired Delta Force operative who must rescue his daughter from the mercenaries who killed his entire team. Also starring a young Alyssa Milano and Rae Dawn Chong 'Commando' was yet another hit for Schwarzenegger. It is been 30 years and it is still consider it as the one of most best Action war flicks in the world out there. I eat green berets for breakfast and right now I am very hungry. Arnold Schwarzenegger played Colonel John Matrix a previous Delta Force operative who must rescue his daughter from the mercenaries who killed the other members of his unit. Schwarzenegger previously rose to fame with roles in the 'Conan' films and 'The Terminator.'John Matrix ultimate soldier and oneman army. Matrix the former leader of a special commando strike force that always got the toughest jobs done is forced back into action when his young daughter Alyssa Milano is kidnapped. To find her Matrix has to fight his way through an array of punks killers one of his former commandos and a fully equipped private army. With the help of a feisty stewardess Rae Dawn Chong and an old friend Matrix has only a few hours to overcome his greatest challenge finding his daughter before she's killed.In the beginning there was the masterpiece known as Commando. And the God of '80s Action Excess did look upon it and see that it was good. And all did Arnold Schwarzenegger massacre hundreds of mercenaries in displays of awesome ultraviolence and Alyssa Milano did rejoice.After the triple play of The Terminator and both Conan films Arnold Schwarzenegger graduated to top billing with Commando a classic '80s action movie which delivers tons of explosions violence and guns in addition to containing an assortment of evil villains cheesy oneliners big guns bigger guns and enough dead bodies to keep a mortician's convention busy for days. It was produced by illustrious action superproducer Joel Silver and written by distinguished action writer Steven E. de Souza not to mention that the primary star is none other than the iconic Arnie. On any level above that of redfaced guilty pleasure there's simply no way to defend Commando. It's a gloriously primitive and action vehicle which makes absolutely no bones about its absurdity. It never pretends to be anything other than a simpleminded exercise in vicarious violence. Its heart and soul is best by a line of dialogue  a female character while witnessing two macho behemoths engaged in manoamano fisticuffs exclaims These guys eat too much red meat!Arnold Schwarzenegger is a delicate talent to work with. If a director tries to make the personality of a character he portrays too complex the result will be confusion or at best unintended hilarity. Mr. Schwarzenegger first appears in ''Commando'' in parts  one huge bicep and then another when the camera pulls back he is seen to be carrying an ax and the trunk of a large tree down a mountainside to his house. And the early scenes in which Mr. Schwarzenegger as Col. John Matrix a retired commando is at home with his daughter Alyssa Milano have an underlying current of humor  it is clear the child would be as comfortable cuddling up to a polar bear.Great and very intelligent reviewretrospective of one of the most badass action movie classics of all times! I love this movie to death and i will always defend it from people who make fun of movies such as this one. I would personally prefer dozens of movies like Commando and Cobra rather than 90 of action movies today. Badassssssss Action flick it fast Entertained  it has gore of action tons of violenceThe film is violent and somewhat bloody. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons and you'll see them used well. I grew up with this film and this film introduced me in to A Schwarzenegger films and a fan today. 1010 Grade A Studio 20TH Century Fox Silver Pictures Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger Rae Dawn Chong Alyssa Milano Bill Paxton Director Mark L.

Also starring a young Alyssa Milano and Rae Dawn Chong 'Commando' was yet another hit for Schwarzenegger. It is been 30 years and it is still consider it as the one of most best Action war flicks in the world out there. I eat green berets for breakfast and right now I am very hungry. Arnold Schwarzenegger played Colonel John Matrix a previous Delta Force operative who must rescue his daughter from the mercenaries who killed the other members of his unit. Schwarzenegger previously rose to fame with roles in the 'Conan' films and 'The Terminator.'John Matrix ultimate soldier and oneman army. Matrix the former leader of a special commando strike force that always got the toughest jobs done is forced back into action when his young daughter Alyssa Milano is kidnapped. To find her Matrix has to fight his way through an array of punks killers one of his former commandos and a fully equipped private army. With the help of a feisty stewardess Rae Dawn Chong and an old friend Matrix has only a few hours to overcome his greatest challenge finding his daughter before she's killed.In the beginning there was the masterpiece known as Commando. And the God of '80s Action Excess did look upon it and see that it was good. And all did Arnold Schwarzenegger massacre hundreds of mercenaries in displays of awesome ultraviolence and Alyssa Milano did rejoice.After the triple play of The Terminator and both Conan films Arnold Schwarzenegger graduated to top billing with Commando a classic '80s action movie which delivers tons of explosions violence and guns in addition to containing an assortment of evil villains cheesy oneliners big guns bigger guns and enough dead bodies to keep a mortician's convention busy for days. It was produced by illustrious action superproducer Joel Silver and written by distinguished action writer Steven E. de Souza not to mention that the primary star is none other than the iconic Arnie. On any level above that of redfaced guilty pleasure there's simply no way to defend Commando. It's a gloriously primitive and action vehicle which makes absolutely no bones about its absurdity. It never pretends to be anything other than a simpleminded exercise in vicarious violence. Its heart and soul is best by a line of dialogue  a female character while witnessing two macho behemoths engaged in manoamano fisticuffs exclaims These guys eat too much red meat!Arnold Schwarzenegger is a delicate talent to work with. If a director tries to make the personality of a character he portrays too complex the result will be confusion or at best unintended hilarity. Mr. Schwarzenegger first appears in ''Commando'' in parts  one huge bicep and then another when the camera pulls back he is seen to be carrying an ax and the trunk of a large tree down a mountainside to his house. And the early scenes in which Mr. Schwarzenegger as Col. John Matrix a retired commando is at home with his daughter Alyssa Milano have an underlying current of humor  it is clear the child would be as comfortable cuddling up to a polar bear.Great and very intelligent reviewretrospective of one of the most badass action movie classics of all times! I love this movie to death and i will always defend it from people who make fun of movies such as this one. I would personally prefer dozens of movies like Commando and Cobra rather than 90 of action movies today. Badassssssss Action flick it fast Entertained  it has gore of action tons of violenceThe film is violent and somewhat bloody. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons and you'll see them used well. I grew up with this film and this film introduced me in to A Schwarzenegger films and a fan today. 1010 Grade A Studio 20TH Century Fox Silver Pictures Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger Rae Dawn Chong Alyssa Milano Bill Paxton Director Mark L.

	schema:reviewBody "Rating  12 out of Every time I'm accused by friends of being too tough or too picky on action movies made for pure entertainment i.e. the works of Jerry Bruckheimer I point back and tell them to look no further than Mark L. Lester's Commando as the prime example of a pure macho classic and the standard by which all mindless action cinema should be judged.In its own simplistic ways Commando is actually the epitome of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Whenever we think of the Austrian musclebound star's films gun battles fist fights deadpan oneliners a total lack of plot and a ridiculously high body count come to mind. Commando represents all this directed with high energy flair and a great sense of fun.Schwarzenegger stars as John Matrix a former commando who lives in the mountains with his young daughter Alyssa Milano. Matrix's former teammates are being knocked off onebyone at the orders of a Latino dictator Dan Hedaya who wants Matrix to assassinate a popular South American leader so that he can be instilled back in power. As incentive Matrix's daughter is kidnapped by renegade military led by Bennett Vernon Wells who was once part of Matrix's team. As soon as Matrix boards his flight he kills his escort leaps off the plane and begins his elevenhour search for his daughter. Inexplicably joining his search is a flight attendant Rae Dawn Chong who gets mixed up in this whole mess.Commando is one of those critically berated movies that only concerns itself with giving its target audience a good time. Running at a lightning fast ninety minutes the film is packed to the gunnels with explosive action sequences and quotable oneliners. In fact the lines are so fun I have a hard time choosing my favorites. Here are a few examples I eat green berets for breakfast and I'm very hungryRemember when I said I'd kill you last? I lied and Let off some steam Bennett!The script is mindless and idiotic but serves its purpose by providing just enough plot and enormously entertaining oneliners to keep the momentum from ebbing. There are also plenty of noticeable continuity errors ask yourself how a guy standing behind a railing atop a balcony could be hit with shotgun pellets without the railing taking the slightest bit of damage! but that just adds to the movie's list of unique charms.But you don't watch Commando for plot or technical brilliance you watch it to see Arnold acting as a oneman army mowing down scores of enemy thugs and soldiers. Whether it's through the movie's various shootouts fistfights or chases the movie delivers thrilling action one scene after another. The climactic battle sequence in which he singlehandedly takes on at least a hundred men will either make or break the film for you. Me I had a blast watching Arnold inflict his brand of justice upon these nasty villains. Unless you don't like Arnold or overthetop action films it's unlikely you'll find Commando boring.Schwarzenegger's charismatic and hugely likable screen presence is undeniable and his delivery of those classic oneliners is perfect. Luckily the movie has an equally strong villain in Vernon Wells who delights in chewing the scenery and generally acting as insane as possible in any given situation. From his manic facial expressions to his questionable tastes in clothing Wells makes Bennett one of the few villains that really stand out in an Arnold flick. You know the movie's going to boil down to a oneonone fight between the two and it's one of those fight scenes where each one takes his turn beating the crud out of the other without one ever truly having the upper hand until the very end when obviously one of them's got to be dead.For pure mindless mayhem Commando is a perfect choice for Saturday night entertainment. I first saw the film on its network broadcast premiere and distinctly remember that in the scene where Arnold hides in the garden house which is the film's goriest part the movie is edited in such a way that it appears only one man approaches the house instead of six!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was growing up I had two heroes on the big screen.  One was Rambo and the other was Indiana Jones.  They were two relentless characters that would never stop never give up and their tenacity was stuff that kids or teens would swear by.  When we were playing adventure games those were the two characters that always got chosen to play first.  But the same year that Rambo II came out a new hero was born.  We all knew who Arnold was he was the Terminator.  But when Commando was released one of my best friends said to me  Hey Dan I think this guy could take Rambo.  After all Matrix says to Cook  I eat green berets for breakfast and right now I'm very hungry! I would maybe have to concur.  Matrix was the toughest man alive  until MacGyver came out .  And Commando is one of the best memories that I have as a young man growing up in the 80's.  Besides it being a damn fine fun movie it also has two other elements that began to teach me about film. First a young Bill Paxton was in it and secondly I began to notice the name Joel Silver.  He is the producer extraordinaire that is the man behind hits like Die Hard Predator Weird Science and more recently The Matrix.  Now I look for his name in the producers chair and when he is on that poster as producer I'll run to that movie.Commando doesn't pretend to be something that it's not.  The Rambo character was more into politics and it took itself a little more seriously than Commando did and that's fine.  But this film is nothing but entertainment. It starts fast and violent and it ends hard and violent.  You think Rambo kills a lot in Rambo then count the bodies in this one.  But it is so much fun because not only does Arnold have fun with it but the script as cheesy as it may seem is actually brilliant.  Arnold's one liners are now a staple of his film persona and I think you can look at this film as the root of that persona.  For example  Any carry on luggage?  the stewardess asks Arnold  Just him he replies pointing at the thug that is escorting him onto the plane.  After he beats the hell out of Bill Duke he says  We'll take Cooks car he won't be needing it.  And of course to Bennett when they are about to fight mano a mano Come on Bennett let's party! Commando is littered with small moments like that you won't soon forget.  It has stayed with me for 15 years and me and my friends rent it every now and again to laugh and cheer.  If this a film that you haven't seen yet then do so.  If you haven't seen this film in quite a while you should treat yourself to it.  It is fun fun and more fun.  And this is the first film that Arnold reprises his famous line  I'll be back!  So what's not to like about it?".

D But this film meant a lot to me because it was mine and my dad's film of course he covered my eyes during some certain unnecessary sex scenes but we always got a kick out of the great screen play. The lines and action in Commando makes it a great and fun film to watch.It's about a man Matrix played by Arnold his daughter played by a very young Alyssa Malono is kidnapped by terrorists in particular a dictator who Matrix managed to keep from destroying a country. They give Matrix a chance to save his daughter by killing the leader of the country the dictator was trying to destroy since Matrix was so trusted by their leader it'll make it more controversial. But Matrix has other plans and escapes the airplane he has 17 hours to save his daughter and kidnaps a sassy flight attendant. But she ends up wanting to help Matrix once she finds out that his daughter is kidnapped together they work to get back to the dictator's house and save his daughter.The great thing about this film is that Arnold goes though at least 60 extras who are all shooting at him they miss him and he kills them all. But it's just fun to watch as unrealistic as it is. My favorite line in Commando is when Matrix is about to throw Sully over a cliff and says Remember Sully when I said I'd kill you last? That's right Matrix! You did! I lied! LOL! That was such a great scene. Commando is a great action film that anyone could at least get a good kick out of.1010".

I'm a little bit tired of everyone saying Arnie can't act  he's such a bad actor and so on.

	schema:reviewBody "Ridiculous but fun film with Arnold Schwarzenegger as a retired special agent being pulled back into action when his daughter well played by Alyssa Milano is kidnapped. To get her back he has to kill someone else.An 80s action film all the way. It's full of noisy battles tons of gun play loads of fistfights and a grand total of EIGHTYONE bloody onscreen deaths! The film works so well because it has a good strong sense of humor and never takes itself seriously. It makes all the blood and gore seem cartoonish. The plot barrels also full speed and it's very short 88 min. Also Rae Dawn Chong whatever happened to...? is very good in a supporting role. My only complaint is that the final battle between Arnie and psycho Vernon Wells badly overacting is way too violenteven for this film. Otherwise well worth seeinglots of fun if you don't mind mindless violent films like me. Gotta love any film where Chong learns to use a rocket launcher in a few seconds by reading the directions!".

	schema:reviewBody "Commando is the greatest movie ever made. This movie aspires to be nothing more than a great action movie and succeeds in every way. The director and screenwriter have no delusions about making a think piece or movie that will move you to a religious experience. They simply wanted to make a movie about a man his hot daughter and love of violence. As in all great action movies we have a man of violence who has left all of that behind him. He simply wants to live in the mountains watch his daughter grow up and eat ice cream. Of course this couldn't happen. It wouldn't be Commando. Anyways the bad guys force him out of hiding and instead of enlisting help or trying to find a peaceful solution to the problem he kills and makes jokes. John Matrix Arnold embarks on a mission of creative killing and funny oneliners. Enough people have already written on how this movie plays to Arnold's strengths and describe his various deeds. I think the scene that really sets this movie apart is the attention to detail. No not the part where the porsche gets wrecked and fixed before Arnold pushes it over. Next time you watch the film turn the TV up very loud when Arnold is fighting Cook. When Arnold picks Cook up by his testicles you can hear the crunch and the air escaping Cook's mouth. Only the greatest movie of all time would take the time to properly document that tremendous event. This movie is as close to perfect as it gets. In the 150 times i have watched Commando the only way I think it could be improved is if Matrix kills Rae Dawn Chong at the end. That would go along better with the theme of the movie.".

One day his mentor Major General Franklin Kirby James Olson visits him and tells that the men he had trained for his unit are being killed and he leaves two soldiers to protect Matrix. However the helicopter of General Kirby has been followed by hit men that abduct Jenny and Matrix. Soon Matrix learns that Bennett Vernon Wells that belonged to his unit and was presumed dead is the responsible for attack to his house. Further Bennett was hired by Arius Dan Hedaya a former president of a South American country that Matrix had overthrown. Now Arius wants Matrix to assassinate the president of his country in order to assume the position again otherwise he will kill Jenny. Matrix is forced to embark in a flight to the country with one of Bennett's thug while another one Sully David Patrick Kelly will confirm that Matrix is in the flight. However Matrix manages to kill the thug and leave the plane and has eleven hours to save Jenny. He convinces the flight attendant Cindy Rae Dawn Chong to help him to save his daughter.Commando is another great action movie from the 80's maybe the best decade in the cinema history for this genre. The screenplay has nonstop action and funny and unforgettable moments. My favorite is when John Matrix tells to Sully that he likes him and he will be the last one to die. Soon he corrects saying I lied. I did not recognized Alyssa Milano from Charmed in her second role as Jenny. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Comando Para Matar Commando to Kill".

This film however does something that Rambo didn't and that is Commando refused to take itself seriously. It knowingly went way over the top and gave discerning audiences some great fun this film is absolutely hilarious.To begin with the whole premise just makes me laugh. A former US Commando's Arnie old team decide to use him to assisinate some higher up in South America they determine the best way to get him to do it is to kidnap his daughteralyssa Milano and hold her until completion of the assisnation. Well they manage to get her and put Arnie on a plane headed for South America with explicite instructions to kill the guy in order to get his daughter back safely. Well in any other dumb action film the hero would probably try and think of a way to get his daughter back without tipping off the Bad guys it would all lead to a last minute convoluted plan. Not this film Arnie's character decides without any hesitation that the best thing to do is kill everyone.This is what makes Commando so much fun there are no illusions or messages mixed with great dry humour and pretty violent killings Commando is one joyride of an era gone by oure 80's fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good fun action movie. It has everything an Arnie 1980's action flick should have. Weapons explosions lots of bad guys and of course memorable oneliners.The story is of course a very simple one Arnie's daughter gets kidnapped in order to blackmail Arnie into killing the president. Arnie takes it upon himself to disobey those orders and starts a one man war to kill everyone  anyone who gets in his way. There is no character development no emotion no sub plot nothing realistic but it sure is entertaining. Now Arnie is in no way shape or form a good actor but he does his job fantastically in this film. He is not cast to show off his acting skills he is cast because he is a manmachine with presence and successfully brings a comical aspect to his movies with perfectly timed oneline quotes.This movie is downright ridiculous. Arnie jumps from a movie plane during takeoff and lands in a knee deep swamp  unhurt. He crashes a car at high speed into a post without a seatbelt  unhurt. He rips a phone booth out of a wall. He avoids every gunshot even at close range the list goes on. Does any of this matter? No! If you are looking for a realistic film then this certainly isn't for you.The character 'Cindy' is by far the biggest negative in this film. She isn't needed what so ever Arnie could quite easily have managed on his own. Her attempt at oneliners also go down like a led balloon. The kid is also irritating but thankfully she doesn't get too much screen time.Braindead action movies are certainly not my favourite movie genre. I can however appreciate that this is a good one! I thoroughly enjoyed watching it but I wouldn't give it a top end rating because of this.Start the movie sit back and enjoy this movie for what it is.710".

Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Juan Carlos Gomez . Emotive and adequate musical score by Eduardo Arbide  Achero Maas' usual musician .The motion picture was compellingly directed by Achero Maas  a prestigious actor and filmmaker . Achero first followed in the steps of his mother actress Paloma Lorena who played in two of his films and his father  a notorious producer named Alfredo Maas  but he soon turned from thespian to filmmaker. He made three shorts before meeting a big hit as El Bola that is dedicated to Laura Maas . His second feature Noviembre 2003 also garnered least five awards but he was less successful with Blackwhite 2004. After five years in the wilderness Maas is making a come back with Anything You Want 2010. Rating  Better than average  well worth watching .".

His second feature Noviembre 2003 also garnered least five awards but he was less successful with Blackwhite 2004. After five years in the wilderness Maas is making a come back with Anything You Want 2010. Rating  Better than average  well worth watching .";

	schema:reviewBody "Child abuse is not one of the things that film makers love to tackle. This practice seems to be universal yet little about is seen. Acero Manas the director of this movie that deals with this subject is about one of the few that has come forward to make a case for the young children that are physically abused by a brutish parent.El Bola is a teen ager we meet playing a dangerous game at the railroad tracks near Madrid. It's a game where two opponents jump to pick up something from the track as a suburban train is about to pass by. Young Pablo is nicknamed The Pellet because of the ball he keeps with him as a token for good luck.Pablo's home life is marked by unhappiness and grief caused by the tragic death of a sibling. The sullen parents have to struggle tending the sick and elderly mother of Mariano the father. Pablo is made to help with the old lady's bath something a small boy should not be called to do. Into Pablo's life comes Alfredo who joins the class evidently at the middle of the school term. Pablo sees a kind of normal pal in the new arrival and seeks the boy to be with. That meets with the father's wrath as he considers the new friend as trash because Alfredo's father Jose is a tattoo artist. In reality Alfredo comes from a good home with caring parents. Pablo sees a normal way of life in his friend's house. The friendship brings the worst in Mariano who beats the young man harder to the point that he needs medical attention.El Bola is a film that depicts the abuse openly and it hits the viewer as a low punch to the stomach. Nothing justifies the way Pablo is beaten senselessly by a father that should be made accountable for what he is doing to his son the images one sees are revolting. Director Manas makes his point in showing what an animal the old man is by taking all his frustrations on Pablo.The acting is good in general. Juan Jose Balleste plays Pablo with ease for a young actor who seems to be a natural. Pablo Galan is Alfredo the true friend. Alberto Jimenez portrays Jose and Manuel Moron makes a brutish Mariano believable.Achero Manas asks a lot from his audience. Although child abuse is a disgusting practice it goes on probably much more than one realizes. This is a crude film that doesn't offer any happy solution to the problem or how to avoid it and it's an eye opener as to how the action of a man that shouldn't have had children and will scar the young son for life.".

Let's check how El Bola's life has been changed...I've also seen movies like boys of st Vincent and song for a raggy boy but this movie about child abuse is just different. The movies i mentioned have great youngactors too but this movie make you realize that this might be your neighbour boy's story. If you start watching the movie you feel that something's wrong with El Bola Pellet but you just don't know what. And i guess that's one of the strengths of this movie it's not only told in a natural way but it's rather suggestive. And a lot of people are disappointed that the movie's just cut after 88 minutes without a proper ending but i think that's the way it goes in real life too  a lifestory is like a roller coaster it has it ups and downs but the only thing that matters is where it endsBut this movie wouldn't be the same without the strong soundtrack highly recommended and it's young cast. El Bola is played by Juan Jos Ballesta my favorite young actor who also appears in the interesting and touching planta 4a. He has also a very small role in a movie a mentioned before  song for a raggy boy as the young friend of the teacher in the flash backs".

Phenomenal cast and director who deserved the Best Director and 5 Goya Spanish Oscars the film received. El Bola's abusive father was played to a perfect pitch by Manuel Moron as a cold abusive father turned sheepish when the outside world learns of his transgressions against his own son. You want to strangle him! Turns out it was a Spanish indie underdog that upset a lot of larger bigger Spanish films.  Like the other reviews say be prepared to laugh cry and become infuriated.

However in brief we could say that the film is basically concerned with the physical punishment Pablo El Bola receives from his father a small business owner frustrated and bored with life. Pablo receives refuge from a sympathetic family but the problems do not stop there.Well directed above all keeping the violence within strict proportions to the import of the story and in general good interpretations which do not tend to unnecessarily exaggerate the crude and difficult situations being enacted. Special mention of course is well deserved for the main actor  Juan Jos Ballesta about 11 years old. He had a very secondary rle in El Embrujo de Shanghai' qv and thus surprised me at being able to deliver such a performance in this film obviously the director's careful handling of the young lad as well as some excellent rapport with the other actors especially Nieve de Medina holds the film on course. I hope that this younger generation of Spanish directors such as Achero Maas and of course Fernando Len de Aranoa Los Lunes al Sol qv also with Nieve de Medina can keep up the good work in the sociological sphere with real human stories to tell.WARNING this film necessarily includes a scene of extreme child violence carried out by his overwrought father and thus care should be taken by parents. The Spanish rating of only for over 13s should not be taken seriously over 18 would be more appropriate. The scene is short the film is not only about violence as it has many other ingredients. However this brief scene is very hard on the senses.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER ALERT This film is well acted particularly by its child actors with a heartwrenching story of child abuse and the loyalty of children to each other. It also portrays an alternative to the abusive dysfunctional family of the abused boy by delving into the dynamics of the family of the abused boy's friend. One very original touch is the way a child who is essentially wise and responsible and mature beyond his years the welladjusted best friend is misunderstood by his 'hip' parent who assumes that the child is deceiving him and behaving in the irresponsible and foolish way that the father did as a child. Unfortunately the film completely collapses when the adults behave in a way that is absolutely unbelievable. Is there something about Spanish society that I'm not aware of? A child is brutally beaten by his father runs for help to the family of his best friend where he shows up bloody and bruised is taken to the hospital by this caring family AND THERE IS NO INTERVENTION BY THE POLICE???? Are not hospitals required to report child abuse when it is so blatant and when the child is forthcoming about the perpetrator? How could a caring adult not report the boy's father to the police? And how could he insist that the child return to his own home where he is certainly in danger of being further injured or even killed? It was at this point that I left the theatre. Whatever the outcome the film had become a pointless narrative with no relationship to reality.".

However as the film continued the plot took an unexpected twist as you learn that the title character a kid who looks to be about 11 yearsold is being seriously abused by his godawful father. The violence he inflicts is amazingly realistic in one scene and so this film is provisionally recommended. While it was very well made children and people who were victims of child abuse probably should not watch itand I could see the film instigating flashbacks of abuse. However aside from this warning the film is well constructed extremely well acted and engaging. You really can't stop watching after a while because it really hooks you.

	schema:reviewBody "El Bola is a dramatic film directed by Acero Maas that tells the story of a twelve year old boy named El Bola who is raised in a violent and unforgiving environment. This movie was released in New York City on December 13 2002 and is considered one of Acero Maas' best films to date. As a result of Maas' success his movie won four Goya Awards that includes best film best emerging director best original screenplay and best emerging actor. After watching this amazing film there is no question as to why this film received so many awards and has become a favorite for many viewers. Pablo a.k.a. El Bola is a twelveyearold boy who suffers abuse from his father. The reason he is called El Bola is because he carries a gold ballbearing in his pocket for luck. However due to his unfortunate circumstances it is possible that his ballbearing actually represents stability and some protection given that he lives in a very vicious household. His violent family situation prevents him from having friends at school until the a new kid Alfredo arrives at his school. The warm caring atmosphere in Alfredo's family juxtaposes Pablo's oppressive situation under his father. With the help of Alfredo Pablo finds a different reality in his new friend's family who teaches him to confront with courage his worst fears.One of the key themes that this movie expresses is the breaking of the traditional family stereotypes. Many people believe that maintaining a traditional family is the correct way to live. However I think that this movie opposes this idea. For example in the movie there are two different families that live two completely different lifestyles. Pablo's family although on the outside appears very traditional and normal is actually filled with violence and hostility. Technically Pablo's family does fit within the typical roles of a traditional family that atmosphere and the relationships are very dysfunctional but mostly violent. This family contrasts Alfredo's family who most people would believe is more of the problematic family due to their carefree lifestyle and more rebellious appearance. Alfredo's father Jos is a tattoo artist and has many tattoos himself along with his wife and Alfredo. The family is not religious and is very accepting with homosexuality considering many of their friends are gay. However as the film continues many family scenes show that they are more healthy educational and possess a better family relationship than Pablo's family.".

	schema:reviewBody "Domestic violence has never been an easy topic to get into when telling a story due to the fact it's just too sensitive an issue to see depicted on screen and there's the danger of exploitation. Achero Maas 2000 film EL BOLA one of the big winners of the 2001 Goya Awards explores the issue of child abuse through the culture's very machismo  one that perpetuates that it's okay if the father imposes his will over his family because he's the breadwinner and he's always right. It's a system that has the essence of repetition and even today continues to live on. A similar issue would be explored on a very veiled level in 2002's VALENTIN and more explicitly in 2003's TE DOY MIS OJOS. In this story Pedro a.k.a. El Bola due to a small malleable pellet he constantly holds is a lonely boy going to school who has few to no friends. At home his father Mariano is everything but loving he's a tyrant who forces his will and his anger almost constantly at Pedro who lives in total fear of him. However a new boy in school Alberto prompts Pedro to come out of his shell and both become friends. Pedro becomes accepted in Alberto's family particularly Jose Alberto's father who treats his son as a friend more than a son. On the other hand Mariano doesn't see this friendship as something his son needs and progressively tries to keep him away from them until Alberto becomes aware of some telling marks on Pedro's body and takes matter into his own hands having Jose alert the help of a social worker. However things aren't that easy and her very intervention could backfire. That is until one night the violence in Pedro's home escalates to a point where actions must be taken.Achero Maas has created a movie that should be seen no matter how difficult some of the scenes between Pedro and Mariano may be. The only way to understand the horror of family abuse in the name of obedience and respect  Mariano sees Jose as a pervert because he makes his living as a tattoo artist. Indeed many of our parents would have reacted the same way if our friend's parents lived a different lifestyle. In many ways Mariano and Jose represent Spain's past and future  Mariano being the extreme conservative Jose being the man of the future. Both actors are well cast in their roles. Manuel Moron has the physicality that suggests a brutal man while Alberto Gimenez despite his skinhead appearance which suggests counterculture is a gentle man who unless pushed does not show aggression.It's because of these two vastly different fathers that their son's personalities come through the way they do Alberto is quietly confident. He has no issues other than the ones appropriate for his age  typical growing pains. Pedro however has been raised in a house full of violence. His mother can't do much though she would like to. It's not hard to see that in his closing confession Pedro pours his feelings out for the very first time and it's a barrage of emotion the problem is it's all negative sheer hatred all directed towards this man who has beat him for no other reason that he was an easy target.

	onyx:emotionText "Domestic violence has never been an easy topic to get into when telling a story due to the fact it's just too sensitive an issue to see depicted on screen and there's the danger of exploitation. Achero Maas 2000 film EL BOLA one of the big winners of the 2001 Goya Awards explores the issue of child abuse through the culture's very machismo  one that perpetuates that it's okay if the father imposes his will over his family because he's the breadwinner and he's always right. It's a system that has the essence of repetition and even today continues to live on. A similar issue would be explored on a very veiled level in 2002's VALENTIN and more explicitly in 2003's TE DOY MIS OJOS. In this story Pedro a.k.a. El Bola due to a small malleable pellet he constantly holds is a lonely boy going to school who has few to no friends. At home his father Mariano is everything but loving he's a tyrant who forces his will and his anger almost constantly at Pedro who lives in total fear of him. However a new boy in school Alberto prompts Pedro to come out of his shell and both become friends. Pedro becomes accepted in Alberto's family particularly Jose Alberto's father who treats his son as a friend more than a son. On the other hand Mariano doesn't see this friendship as something his son needs and progressively tries to keep him away from them until Alberto becomes aware of some telling marks on Pedro's body and takes matter into his own hands having Jose alert the help of a social worker. However things aren't that easy and her very intervention could backfire. That is until one night the violence in Pedro's home escalates to a point where actions must be taken.Achero Maas has created a movie that should be seen no matter how difficult some of the scenes between Pedro and Mariano may be. The only way to understand the horror of family abuse in the name of obedience and respect  Mariano sees Jose as a pervert because he makes his living as a tattoo artist. Indeed many of our parents would have reacted the same way if our friend's parents lived a different lifestyle. In many ways Mariano and Jose represent Spain's past and future  Mariano being the extreme conservative Jose being the man of the future. Both actors are well cast in their roles. Manuel Moron has the physicality that suggests a brutal man while Alberto Gimenez despite his skinhead appearance which suggests counterculture is a gentle man who unless pushed does not show aggression.It's because of these two vastly different fathers that their son's personalities come through the way they do Alberto is quietly confident. He has no issues other than the ones appropriate for his age  typical growing pains. Pedro however has been raised in a house full of violence. His mother can't do much though she would like to. It's not hard to see that in his closing confession Pedro pours his feelings out for the very first time and it's a barrage of emotion the problem is it's all negative sheer hatred all directed towards this man who has beat him for no other reason that he was an easy target. EL BOLA offers even at this most extreme moment a semblance of hope  it does seem Pedro is under some form of therapy  so in this way Pedro's final outburst is not just his but goes for every boy and girl who suffered under the hurtful hand of a parent. In this way EL BOLA has a powerful message and conveys it beautifully.";

He certainly deserved the Goya that he got and I thought he was excellently cast as El Bola. As a response to other reviewers I must tell you that it's unfortunately true that there is not much one can do to stop child abuse so that part of the plot is absolutely correct. If a child called the police and said I'm being abused and beaten. the police would likely laugh. Although it's been a long time since I've seen El Bola if I had the DVD here I would watch it again at once. That's how much I liked it. I can't remember it very well I just remember thinking that it was really well done and I think I nearly cried or perhaps I did?. One of the things that I consider strange was Alfredo's parents homosexuality is not as common as you might think and I didn't believe that was a good value to add to the film I thought for the parents of Alfredo there should have been more conventional people. Whatever people think this movie is an accurate portrayal of something that unfortunately happens. It could easily be the story of your nextdoor neighbor without you having any idea. Overall I think that the movie is really good and although not outstanding definitely worthy of your 2 hours. I give it my two thumbs up.".

All I can say is that this is an incredibly intriguing but sadly forgotten film.There are many other aspects that make this film special. First of all it's James Wood's debut second it's allegedly the first fictional film to deal with Vietnam in a serious manner and third because of how intense the film manages to get. The very setup sends flashbacks to Funny Games. Two old army buddies of Wood's shows up at his house. This might seem nice enough but even without the knowledge I had you get the feeling that something is wrong. These are the men Wood's turned in for raping and killing a Vietnamese girl.The atmosphere screams of dread and you sit back horrified wondering when it's all going to explode. Unlike Kazan's other features it's not visually beautiful in the traditional sense though it does have many haunting images. This film seeks a more personal touch again one that might appear somewhat similar to Haneke's minimalism. One thing I found fascinating is that it often cuts the heads of it's characters which creates an unnatural and weird albeit very effective atmosphere.It's also wonderfully contained  there's basically just one setting  their house and the area near by. This only intensifies the whole situation. Of course it does have some small problems. For example the character doesn't seem to realize how serious the situation actually is. But this is one scary flick and I would definitely recommend it!".

They get on well with dad but when it is revealed they were part of a gang rape of a 16 year old girl in Vietnam needless to say Martha isn't very comfortable.  The tensions build.

	schema:headline " Very underrated film about the bankruptcy of masculinity";
	schema:reviewBody "There are some mild spoilers here. I really liked this film. It has a lot in common with Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs which came out a year before. I have no idea if it is accidental or not. No one seams to talk about the similarities. Both films are about the moral bankruptcy of masculinity. Both film feature a sexually confused woman and a battle between a soft man and super masculine men.The idea for the film supposedly came from the same story that Brian De Palma's Casualties of War was based on. This is a fictional version of what could have happened after everything in the story Casualties of War is based on. Two of the men who raped the girl in Vietnam come home to the person Bill Schmidt who reported them to have their revenge.I loved the character battle in this film. Bill's father in law is a writer of western books. This is important because he stands for the old west the old time the culture of violence where you took what you wanted no matter if it was yours or not. He hates Bill because he thinks he is too soft not enough of a man and definitely not worthy of his daughter. He even wonders if his grandchild is his grandchild since it has a blood of a sissy in its veins. He however falls in love with the guys who come for a visit to take revenge the Vietnam war criminals! And when he hears about what Bill Schmidt had done to them reporting how they raped and killed an innocent girl he replies Why did you not kill him? So no sympathy there.Bill Schmidt's wife Martha Wayne is rather confused. She is daddy's little girl but still not blindly so. She is kind of torn between two worldviews and can't make up her mind.And now let the battle begin... And jumping forward in time. I wonder if this film influenced Funny Games 1997. Two visitors with bad intentions come for a visit and a power play between them all. Sounds like Funny Games to me I have no idea why this film is so underrated. I was on the edge of my seat while watching it. Maybe my expectations were just so low that it caught me off guard?".

	schema:headline " Slow dull and unrewarding film";
	schema:reviewBody "Obscure films are often obscure for a good reason even if they're part of the repertoire of highly acclaimed and Awardwinning directors or in case it meant the debut of famous and respected actors. The Visitors is such an example of a peculiarly obscure film in spite of the great names involved. It was directed by Elia Kazan who won 2 Oscars and even an Honorary Award and it was the first major film role for both James Woods and Steve Railsbeck. These names alone should have provided the film with a tremendous classic status and cult reputation but instead it's a totally unknown effort that never ever gets mentioned when people are discussing the highlights of either Kazan or Woods. Is it because it's such a bitter and emotionless drama that deals with the darker side of war veteran heroes? Perhaps Is it because it's such a slow dull and eventually unrewarding movie experience? More likely The Visitors probably ranks in the top 5 slowestpaced films I've ever seen and the story keeps building up towards a devastating climax that actually never comes. There's nothing more frustrating than watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happens while at the same time it offers so much potential for exciting and suspenseful things to happen! If it weren't the names that convinced me to watch The Visitors already then the brief plot description certainly would have Vietnam veteran Bill Schmidt lives a quite life in the countryside along with his wife and their baby. One morning two of Bill's army buddies show up at their doorstep and invite themselves in. This isn't friendly visit however as Tony and Mike were just recently released from prison where they served a sentence for raping and murdering an innocent girl during their Tour of Duty. Bill testified against them in court but now in his own house he will have to protect his family and himself. How brilliant does that description sound? The film could have been a forerunner of the popular trend of homeinvasion movies like Last House on the Left or House at the Edge of the Park or it could have been a raw and powerful postVietnam revenge thriller like The Exterminator The Farmer or Rolling Thunder. Especially the latter examples successfully managed to combine dazzling character studies and genuine human drama with harsh and relentless action footage but sadly enough Elia Kazan and his scriptwriter son Chris solely opted for character study. And then it still isn't very successful I must add. The only sequence in the entire movie that more or less qualifies as eventful is a downright disgusting one and depicts  in detail  the massacre of a dog. That whole sequence looked disturbingly realistic if you ask me. The rest of the story is simply people sitting at tables and staring at each other without saying much. The scenario also takes a few bizarre and illogical twists like Bill's fatherinlaw socializing with two suspicious figures he never met and that obviously for a menace to his daughter and grandson. The filming locations and snowy landscapes are astounding and the soundtrack features a couple of nice classical music moments but that's hardly worth a recommendation.".

How far had the career of Kazan fallen that he ended up doing a film like this?! And in my summary I mentioned eracehead's reviewand I think they summed it up nicely when they mentioned the amateurish look and the fact that it took so darned long for the film to get moving. All in all most of the emotional impact was lost by the time the big rape scene which was VERY telegraphedsuch as showing the woman topless while dressing early in the film and the fact that the men had been involved in the prior rape occurred.

Cited as an early effort to tell a serious Vietnam War related story it's a fictional followup to the tale filmed 17 years later as Casualties of War the latter was based on a true story. That said when you know what the visitors of the title are capable of you can feel that tension in the air. The deliberate pacing is likely to have less patient viewers fidgeting in their seats. While this viewer wouldn't consider this deplorable like Leonard Maltin does he admits that there's a very grim quality to this material that hangs over everything. Characters' resentments towards each other emerge but things never get completely ugly until the final act.Basically a former soldier in Vietnam Bill Schmidt Woods lives in a remote location with Martha Patricia Joyce the mother of his child and Harry Patrick McVey Marthas' father who toils away as an author. One wintry Sunday two old comrades of Bills' show up Mike Nickerson Railsback and Tony Rodrigues Chico Martinez. Bill is uneasy to see them rather than happy and we find out that the two of them had raped and murdered a Vietnamese girl  whom they had chosen to believe was a Viet Cong  and Bill had pointed the finger at them leading to their courtmartial. Tony tells Bill that he wants to forgive and forget but we're not sure of this. Mike and Tony endear themselves to Harry a gruff  macho WWII veteran who feels nothing but contempt for Bill whom he sees as a weakling.It may be that The Visitors is one of those films that engenders personal reactions viewers may either appreciate what Kazan tries to do or be appalled at the darkness on display. Certainly Kazan doesn't promise his audience a conclusive resolution you wonder what will come next for the characters after the credits end or a happy one. The mostly rough grainy look does work for the material and use of music is sparing. With only five main characters there is an intimate feel to everything. The performances are solid across the board with the young Railsback already showing that incredible intensity that became his trademark and served him well a few years later in the 'Helter Skelter' miniseries.Film buffs might want to give this a chance if just for curiosity's sake.Six out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Nice Try But It Just Doesn't Work";
	schema:reviewBody "The Visitors 1972  out of 4Bill James Woods and his wife Martha Patricia Joyce are spending time with their son when two of Bill's former Vietnam buddies Steve Railsback Chico Martinez show up. The wife isn't sure what the two are doing there but the secret is that both of them just got done doing time for rape which Bill turned them in on. THE VISITORS isn't really the type of film you'd expect from someone like Elia Kazan but after viewing the film and seeing that he was going for a psychological type thriller I can see why he was hired but in the end I don't think the film works. What we basically got is a thriller that doesn't want action but instead it wants to make the viewer think and it wants to turn these thoughts into a nightmare. I don't think there's any doubt that Kazan working with a screenplay written by his son wanted the viewer to sit in the dark fearing what these two dangerous men were going to do to the man who turned them in. Kazan directs the film in an extremely slow way as all of the scenes just drag on and it really does seem that the thing runs much longer than its 88minutes. Kazan's slow style wouldn't have been a problem had the dialogue been better. The majority of the film is just slow drawn out dialogue sequences but the problem is that they're boring. Not once did I get caught up in anything going on and in fact the highlight of the movie is a sequence where the wife's father Patrick McVey has a neighbors dog killed. The film is trying to say something about Vietnam friendship loyalty and several other things but everything just gets so muddled that you can't help but start yawning. The performances from the five people are all good and it's this that keeps the film working. THE VISITORS isn't quite as graphic as its reputation would have you believe but it does have the feel of something like THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. In fact the visual look of this film compares highly to the Wes Craven shocker that was released the previous year.".

He plays Bill a young man just back from the Vietnam War and living in a rural menage with his girl her older husband and his child. The older guy is a Hemingwayesque writer with a penchant for booze and Patrick McVey plays the role with aplomb. At their door appear a couple of Bill's old army buddies and one of them has a grudge to work out since Bill ratted him out something back in the war zone. The young woman gets into it too and the tension grows to an inevitable confrontation. There are no revelations here but it is worth a look.".

	schema:headline " Intense twisting nerve. Kazan's last great";
	schema:reviewBody "Elia Kazan's last great work comes from an original script by his son Chris his only screenplay which is inspired by a 1969 article from The New Yorker Magazine. The article's real story was filmed by Brian De Palma's underrated work Casualties of War Kazan's film is an 'what if...' kind of situation where viewers could see it as a real sequel to De Palma's film. Both are outstanding films with high caliber performances and plenty of drama and tension uncomfortable moments and filled with thoughtprovoking themes. The very first serious fictional film about the Vietnam conflict step aside The Deer Hunter the film isn't necessarily about the war but mostly about the players at a war and the ever changing rules of the game whose outcome isn't necessarily good. Here war seems a distant fog that somehow always finds its way to get deeper in the memories of all the five major characters from the film. Martha and Bill Patricia Joyce and James Woods are a nice couple they have a baby and they're quietly living in this small farm estate owned by her father Patrick McVey a war veteran from another era who now writes novels. A simple day in their lives Bill goes out for something and when he returns his wife tells him that two of his army buddies were there for a visit. They're played by Steve Railsback and Chico Martnez. By this part of this story if you're not into reading plots you can only imagine that something was really wrong between those friends during their time in Vietnam the tension cuts the air like a sharp sword and those two caustic visitors aren't there for a friendly visit. They will disturb the family's apparent peace and quiet. Brilliantly The Visitors avoids taking the usual route of turning into a horrific thriller instead focusing on minor disturbances that permeates very quietly. Before that we have the opportunity to see Sgt. Nickerson and Rodrigues trying to establish contacts with the couple later on going to lady's father house  and the man adores them practically since they can exchange war experiences then we gradually understand that Woods character is deeply concerned about their visit. Most I can tell so you can enjoy the film is exactly the view Martha gets from Bill about what happened in Vietnam and revolved around a court martial  but if you're familiar with Casualties of War you know the real deal.With a pulsating twisting nerve The Visitors is an intense film that deepens the wounds a nation weren't yet ready to get exposed except in news media when it comes to not only the already exhausted Vietnam conflict but also the reality of the veterans coming back home to not find much prospect of a new life. It's not like both Kazan's movie is a highly political film but the themes are there. Anguish revenge shock of different values and the effects of a war it's all present in great dialogues strong unforgettable moments. Woods and Railsback deliver knockout performances with the latter carrying an intense gaze lack of words but menacing effect  which he used to play many other intense characters later in his career and the former playing a vulnerable type whose expressions are getting more and more worried unlike anything he has ever done. With the exception of McVey all the four main actors are making their film debut in this picture and they were all great.My problems with the film is some settings that look implausible or fail to convince much the guitar song that seems to announce the most awaited third act it just doesn't work. This was a serious candidate in becoming a perfect classic of the 1970's an era with many realistic inputs and conventions almost similar to the Dogma movement of the 1990's with some films making use of music from original sources in the background no new composition  in fact it's classic songs that Kazan used as a background without no indication of let's say music playing on a stereo  which also happens later on with great pieces and to a spectacular tense effect. But when he introduces the guitar theme it just puts you off from the effect of seeing a more realistic piece of filmmaking almost like an exciting play  and I wonder how come there's no play version of this? But Kazan succeeds in making a more intimate film very independently modest and somber.And through everything presented we wonder what the future will bring to those characters?".

	schema:reviewBody "When homicide cop Jack Dobson starts getting threatening letters and has his car trashed he and his partner assume that it is the work of a mobster who Jack is testifying against.  However when the writer of the letters starts killing friends and lovers of his Jack starts to investigate with the killer's lipstick and a defective typewriter as his only clues.Opening with a shot of his own dead body we are taken through this film by the narration of Jack himself seemingly in an attempt to make it more gritty and typical of the genre.  The plot spins wildly out of control  but not due to an abundance of ideas so much as just poor writing and poor delivery of the finished product.  The connections between the various dots is not very important as the vast majority of the strands exist solely to act as red herrings  although how you could ever hope to guess the ridiculous twists that come at the end of this film is beyond me  the makers needed have bothered trying to trick us!The plot never manages to thrill at any point which could be considered a problem in a thriller.  The lack of clarity in any of the threads never mind their composite means that you never really get involved enough to be gripping or indeed even care who the killer is or what their motivation might be.  Having established that this erotic thriller has no thrills then we are left with only the promise of the erotic!  Of course as you might imagine this film doesn't deliver that either. Oh it has nudity and some quick scenes of sexual material but it is just lazily stuck in there to widen the market appeal of this film  certainly if you came here looking for ahem whacking material then you will be very disappointed.The cast is OK in regards names but don't really do anything in regards helping the film be better.  Belushi is as average as ever I suppose he does try to bring intense emotions out of his character here but generally he is doing his usual stuff.  Goldwynn is OK but his main contribution here is another recognisable face.  Bracco tries hard but she is no Sharon Stone! She doesn't suit her hairstyle never mind her character.  She tries but she comes off silly  and her body double does her no favours during the nude scenes  lying there as flaccid as a deflated balloon!Overall this film is just poor.  In terms of thrills it is dull and so incoherent and badly structured as to render any excitement dead.  If you're looking for erotic thrills then this film will disappoint you as well. The only moment of interest for me was the fact that the makers clearly took bets to see how absurd a twist they could get away with.".

Trying to be cute and twist and fool the audience with an offthewall ending made it look both foolish and unconvincing and it even showed on the faces of the actors in the filmas they tried to keep a straight face and not crack up from laughing.The movie had all the ingredients for a good police whodunit a good cast beautiful women and locations and even a part in the story that dates back some thirty years. This dark secret has something to do with the murders and is linked to the detective investigating the killings but that really ridicules ending sunk the film. Det. Jack Dobson James Belushiis investigating a number of murders of beautiful young and rich widows aren't they all in rich and socially prominent Palm Beach Florida. The killer purposely leaves clues that somehow tie all the killings to Det. Dobson. The killer sends him letters after each murder with a kiss mark on them that has the same kind of lipstick that the murdered women had smeared on their lips after they were killed. The letters are typed with an imperfection of the letters D  L and it's obvious that the killer wants the police or Det. Dobson to know this. As the Palm Beach Police Department try to find out who the killer is something comes up out of the blue about the detective on the case Det. Dobson which has him taken off the case. It turns out that this person Ross Worth knew one of the murdered women in Key West when she worked at a nightclub there. The woman Morgan Cassidy Michelle Joyner just happened to be Det. Dobson girlfriend!Now get this! Ross Worth's mother Gloria Worth was arrested and put away for some twenty years for molesting Det. Dobson when he was six years old when she was his first grade teacherit was Dobson's testimony that put her away. Mrs. Worth died a week before the killing in Palm Beach started and the police there think that it's her son Ross who's doing them to get revenge for his mother. It's also found out that all the women killed were involved with Det. Dobson. Taken off the case because of his possible connection to the murders Det. Dobson is replaced by his partner Det. Frayn Tony Goldwyn who flies to Key West to check out Ross Worth only to find out that he died of AIDS the year before. Det. Frayn does find one of Det. Dobson's lady friends another beautiful rich and widowed Palm Beach socialite Ellen Schofield Lorrain Bracco. Lorrain has a onenightstand with Det. Frayn who's married and later blackmails him by calling his wife Beth Faye Grant and leaving a massage on the phone recorder. Det. Dobson get very upset with his partner Det. Frayn for having an affair with his girlfriend Ellen and Frayn's wife leaves him with her young daughter. When Det. Frayn goes to see Ellen at her home on the beach he finds her murdered.The film was really starting to pick up and really become interesting even up to the final minute but then the Surprise Ending came in and just deep sixth the entire movie. I don't know why the moviemakers had to put in that moronic ending. It may have been a way to make the star of the movie James Belushi not look so bad. You already saw at the very beginning of the film that he was killed and we were getting all this the story from him from the grave in flashback. But that ending was just too much and it took everything out of what was up until then a fairly good crimesuspense film.".

Sol is a struggling actor who continuously gets refused audition after audition yet Happy lands a gig on his first try.

Although it had some romantic themes it was hilarious from start to finish. The jokes were coming thick and fast and fortunately they were not all primitive American below the belt stuff.

The characters are all general so we can laugh at similar situations we have had either through friends or ourselves... assuming we have all experienced life and not been shut ins. NOT A GOOD FILM but not a bad FLICK for something to play when you need a laugh with friends... or need to play something in the background during a party of 3040 people so you can look aside and catch something funny throughout the night. For people who are like the lead character and have friends women and male they chill with. For loners that film will have no impact whatsoever... for those with friends and who like to have a good time aren't shutins this movie simply reminds you of antics here and there.

The characters are all general so we can laugh at similar situations we have had either through friends or ourselves... assuming we have all experienced life and not been shut ins. NOT A GOOD FILM but not a bad FLICK for something to play when you need a laugh with friends... or need to play something in the background during a party of 3040 people so you can look aside and catch something funny throughout the night. For people who are like the lead character and have friends women and male they chill with. For loners that film will have no impact whatsoever... for those with friends and who like to have a good time aren't shutins this movie simply reminds you of antics here and there. Frankly i thought it was fine... i certainly don't need to pretend that it insulted my intelligence because having intelligence i knew it was going to be void of earth shattering meaning.";

This movie poses as one of those movie where you are expecting lots of tits and ass beer drinking and a bunch of juvenile act but in the end you will get some moral about life isn't all about parties and scoring chicks. The formula has been used a lot yes but usually it gives one cool party movie and i like them. One name get into mind... Van Wilder... one of the best movie of that kind which was very funny.But the problem with Sol Goode is that it actually feel like a rip off of the core of Van Wilder without really the fun side too much. This movie try to score a few joke here and there and some characters are a bit funny but at no point i really felt for any of themexcept maybe Chloe a bit or what would happen to them. Jamie Kennedy's character sure bring a few comic relief but not enough to get me interest much into his story.Its kinda trying to be serious yet putting a few jokes but the jokes never get the effect they where looking for and the serious side kinda miss emotions and really getting to feel those characters. The best friend Cooper was just forgivable and made almost no point in the story and the only dramatic performance i actually like was the one of the actress playing Chloe who actually was cute enough both in look and acting to get me interest in her.But its one of those movie where you seem to just go trough the motion and nothing really happen for a long part of the movie and the synopsis actually is not that much accurate.Even in the cute romance movie category i felt this movie took like an hour before having you really get interest into anyone too much. So well what can i say... it was not awful or anything... it was just not memorable a really forgivable romantic comedy that i think even your girlfriend would not really get into.I feel this movie either needed to get more raunchy or more emotional but it stayed in the middle and missed bot lines... sadly.".

Despite being listed second on the box Carmen Electra has only two small parts in the movie and leaves you wishing she was a more used character. Also more of Robert Wagner's character would have been nice as well. Overall a better than average flick with good laughs and characters you care about. More skin and more of certain characters are my only complaints.".

I mean there's bad then there's REALLY bad. This film falls into the latter category.What's amazing is not that they got a budget for this film but that they actually got some name actors for it. I can't imagine any working actor looking at this puerile script and thinking to themselves yes this is one I must do.The script itself is dreadful. Overwhelmingly bad. If one didn't read the credits you'd think it was written by an undersexed or possibly oversexed 8thgrader. It's the kind of script that drunken frat boys might come up with if they were really bored and had a half hour to spare. If you took out the fart jokes the penis jokes and the irritable bowel jokes there would really only be about 10 minutes of film and those 10 minutes would be stuffed with every comic clich you could imagine.The film offers no real laughs predictability to the extreme and surprisingly no nudity. Which is odd since it's like watching a slasher film with no blood. The only reason I can imagine a film like Showgirls which is Gone With the Wind compared to Sol Goode got financed was because they promised the backers that Elizabeth Hurley would be naked and gyrating throughout half the film. This film doesn't even have the common decency to try and titillate the audience after forcing us through the 100 minutes of torture.The performances are mostly quite good. The actors do a great job at elevating the material especially Katharine Towne in a thankless and underwritten role. Cheri Oteri Natasha Wagner and Jamie Kennedy all put their best foot forward trying to turn very little into something. Cheri Oteri plays a sadistic highpowered agent which is actually the best writing in the film. Unfortunately it's a subplot that really has no connection to the main storyline. It may have been a better film had they simply stayed in the agency and made it all about Jamie Kennedy's character since the least interesting character in the whole film is the title character. You can't quite imagine how so many people seem to know and admire a guy who has never had a job isn't getting work as an actor dates homely women and doesn't even seem particularly funny or charming.The film goes nowhere and takes forever to get there. But I will give this writerdirector his due. It takes quite of bit of pluck and determination to get a film this bad made. He surely deserves hustler of the year award. If he could sell this film to execs he could sell ice to Eskimos.".

It may have been a better film had they simply stayed in the agency and made it all about Jamie Kennedy's character since the least interesting character in the whole film is the title character. You can't quite imagine how so many people seem to know and admire a guy who has never had a job isn't getting work as an actor dates homely women and doesn't even seem particularly funny or charming.The film goes nowhere and takes forever to get there. But I will give this writerdirector his due. It takes quite of bit of pluck and determination to get a film this bad made. He surely deserves hustler of the year award. If he could sell this film to execs he could sell ice to Eskimos.";

	schema:headline " Fear Dot Com with an IQ";
	schema:reviewBody "Alan Jones of Shivers magazine once called Fear Dot Com a ring for retards. If that is true then Three Blind Mice is like Fear Dot Com with an IQ. Three Blind Mice is a patient film and a thinking film. So in that right it seems more Asian than European. While European films are generally less plot with more visuals this film sort of goes in the other direction. It was released by First Look Films the same people who brought us Dahmer probably the best serial killer biography film made since Henry. The director in this film opts for a lot of My Little Eye type visuals toward the beginning and the end but they do not overpower the film the way they did in that movie. The plot is something you'll have to think about which is refreshing for a contemporary European thriller and especially refreshing for the sort of trash that usually goes direct to video. This movie was the one that was supposed to jump start Edward Furlong's career again but since it has been released direct to video his film career will really hinge on the next Crow movie he's starring in with David Boreanaz The Crow Wicked Prayer. All together this is one of the few thinking European movies that won't be remade unlike Insomnia The Vanishing and Nightwatch because it bears too large a resemblance to Fear Dot Com and 8MM. But if you're renting it its a nice watch. It isn't the greatest watch but for a direct to video release it's pleasant surprise to see that this much thought was put into it. It's a much better film that Fear Dot Com which steals from Kill Baby Kill Ringu and its American counterpart The Ring the whole nosebleed thing didn't happen in the original Japanese movie and while the cast and ending aren't quite up to par the same way as 8MM it's very unpredictable. With how early the first murder occurred caught me quite off guard. This may be what weighs the movie down for a lot of people something that really grabs you happens early on and nothing quite as visually or mentally engaging happens for quite a while after. But I was patient and at least in a intellectual sense it paid off. I do have a number of problems with the script though. Since we are only really hinted at a relationship between Furlong's character and the Cathy character the murder isn't quite as powerful as it could've been and in for this reason the trailer which accompanies the feature on the DVD leaves you with a different impression of the story being than the film itself does. Even though the two main characters do touch upon the idea of a relationship between two people existing only physically though means of the internet during a conversation and therefore not really physically at all its never really touched upon again in the script. Though by the end of film we get to see the contrast of feeling between the type of people who do the watching we see what other kinds of people watch these sites though way of their emails to the Cathy character and the sort of people being watched though means of the story having the female lead set up her own voyeur site in order to catch the killer and the more importantly the difference between the sorts of people who only watch and the sorts of people who actually know the people they're watching. Since neither Fear Dot Com or 8MM really bother to touch upon these sort of relationships this film actually represents a screenwriter touching upon an original idea in the middle of writing his film another reason this isn't bankable Hollywood material. I'm glad that for once a story about people's relationship with the internet actually has something to say.  Fortunately the director's power over the camera doesn't slow down or stop the story from being told. When the time comes he takes a passive role here and just you watch the story develop though his talent for knowing how to tell the story creatively come in handy toward the end of the story. Another problem American audiences might have with this movie is the ending. But you must realize that the screenwriter deciding to end the story the way he did allowed him to insert another one of these themes into the story and therein allowing you to understand more about these characters and the screenwriter's point of view of the world.".

Though by the end of film we get to see the contrast of feeling between the type of people who do the watching we see what other kinds of people watch these sites though way of their emails to the Cathy character and the sort of people being watched though means of the story having the female lead set up her own voyeur site in order to catch the killer and the more importantly the difference between the sorts of people who only watch and the sorts of people who actually know the people they're watching. Since neither Fear Dot Com or 8MM really bother to touch upon these sort of relationships this film actually represents a screenwriter touching upon an original idea in the middle of writing his film another reason this isn't bankable Hollywood material. I'm glad that for once a story about people's relationship with the internet actually has something to say.  Fortunately the director's power over the camera doesn't slow down or stop the story from being told. When the time comes he takes a passive role here and just you watch the story develop though his talent for knowing how to tell the story creatively come in handy toward the end of the story. Another problem American audiences might have with this movie is the ending. But you must realize that the screenwriter deciding to end the story the way he did allowed him to insert another one of these themes into the story and therein allowing you to understand more about these characters and the screenwriter's point of view of the world.";

The real star of the film is Susan Lynch whose earthy sexuality convinces us that she could develop into the Molly Bloom of Ulysses. There's also good support from the actor playing Joyce's more levelheaded brother and soidisant keeper Stanislaus.The movie is often affected by the exaggerated Irishness that seems to blight every movie set in the island but it doesn't get in the way of the film's verisimilitude too much with one exception. When Joyce's brother takes his book to an Irish publisher he is told that there's something dirty going on in The Dead and this is presented as a uniquely Irish reaction though in reality Joyce had the same reaction everywhere.The film is also punctuated by subtle allusions to Joyces work that literati will enjoy picking up but won't alienate those poor hordes of nonJoyceans too much. At the risk of sounding like a swotty pedant there's a lot of profane language in the movie which Joyce maintained he never used in speech though it serves if anything to increase the characters' believability.".

I thought it very fine indeed but agree that some prior knowledge of James Joyce his life and work is helpful. Joyce's writing is not a bore as some of the comments suggest. The story The Dead from Joyce's collection Dubliners is one of the great short stories in English literature. It is referrd to several times in this film. Incidentally The Dead has been made into a film also. The time of the film Nora when Joyce was trying to find a publisher for Dubliners was well before the writing of his great work Ulysses. It was a time when Joyce and Nora Barnacle had a stormy relationship but nevertheless were deeply in love and had a lusty relationship with each other. This is well depicted in the movie beginning with their first date when Nora surprises and delights Joyce with her bold advances. Ewan McGregor and Susan Lynch play these scenes with high professional skill helping us to really understand the delight these two people had in a physical relationship. Their love is an up and down affair but endures. McGregor is a fine actor who always give 100 in whatever his role may be and in Nora he does not disappoint. I was struck by the way he squinted occasionally just as Joyce must have done with his terrible eyesight which even in these early years had begun to deteriorate badly. Susan Lynch is new to me and very convincing as the servant girl from the Irish countryside who kept up to the challenges of life with a great intellectual. One objection I viewed this film on DVD and was unhappy that there are no captions for the hard of hearingor for those who have trouble with Irish brogues!! There were a couple of the Trieste scenes where Italian conversation did have English language captions. A great relief! But is it really too great an expense for DVD producers to routinely include the caption option?".

Beautiful in the way it was directed played and photographed.Some of the photography by cinematographer JeanFrancois Robin could remind the viewer of the most famous of impressionist paintings of the time with couples strolling in the late afternoon fading sun in that magic hour of light when day is slowly but surely turning into night.The story is essentially about Nora and we are introduced early on to the inspiration of the Michael Furey character from The Dead. This is shown in flashback just as it is in the original story as the physically bruised Nora Barnacle leaves Galway for Dublin after a beating from her father.We are not sure just how far Nora's sexual experiences with the young man went but when she eventually meets James Joyce on that famous original Bloomsday of June 16th 1904 when the Ascot Gold Cup was being won by Throwaway when Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus were wandering elsewhere around Dublin she does something so memorable and orgasmic to the genius Jim that it plants the seeds of jealousy in his mind that will haunt and taunt their relationship even to the point of James questioning whether their eldest child Giorgio is in fact his. If she did that to me she would do it to anybody is his reasoning.There are some fine multi layered performances by the two leading characters Ewan McGregor and Susan Lynch who are ably supported by Peter McDonald as Jim's long suffering but supportive brother Stanny Stanislaus. With one turn of the head and a slight look in the eye McGregor shows the character's insecurity with the relationship and the return look from Lynch lets him know and the audience that he is being unreasonable. Nora believes that James invents the situations to give him fuel for his stories but there is a growing torment of the young artist there with his displays of paranoia about Dublin his fear of 'things with horns' and his child like panic when he is caught in a thunder storm. These three things and maybe his writing with its stream of consciousness tell us that this indeed is not a reasonable man.There was hardly any mention however of the eye problems that James Joyce suffered from throughout his life. His fear of blindness that he eventually almost reached might have shown his urgency to get things down on paper. But this is such a small complaint in a wonderful movie so lovingly written and directed by Pat Murphy without one word of James Joyce being used in the script. There are a few little hints which copyright cannot affect when we see the few lines 'Europe The World The Universe' which comes from 'A Portrait Of The Artist as a Young Man' and we see Nora save a manuscript from the fire. A manuscript that would be the first draft of 'Portrait' and which eventually saw the light of day as 'Stephen Hero.'".

	schema:reviewBody "How one views this film will depend in part on how much of a Joyce devotee the viewer is.  As is the case with any film based on the life of a largerthanlife figure the film will be largely viewed by those who have an avid interest in James Joyce.  These viewers will judge the film with a much more discerning eye.  The fact that Joyce's work does not have mass appeal and is devoured by a small but fervent group of literary intellectuals makes the scrutiny that much more intense.  For this audience the film will have numerous unbearable flaws and inaccuracies.However for the audience of non aficionados this film has a great deal to recommend itself providing that the viewer loves good drama and has the patience to endure its methodical pacing.  The story is a powerful love story with shearing forces that bring emotional torrent to the relationship. In it we find the high minded writer James Joyce obsessed with Nora the coarse and illiterate chamber maid whose practical wisdom and unfettered sexuality provide the ideal compliment and the perfect wedge.  These two are helpless moths being consumed by a bonfire of ardor built on differences that are as irreconcilable as they are essential to each of their souls. Given this premise we have the underpinnings of great theater.Despite the disappointment of many Joyce fans regarding this treatment the film is really not about James Joyce it is about the relationship. Thankfully director Pat Murphy didn't lose sight of that fact and succumb to the temptation to mollify Joyce fans by making this a Joycecentric film. Murphy patiently peels away the layers of each character and casts each revelation on the relationship like kerosene on a house fire.  The deeper we get into the characters the more complex and hopeless the relationship becomes and paradoxically the more inextricably entwined its participants. Murphy's direction is excellent on all fronts.  The cinematography is incredible with awe inspiring locations and a wonderfully rich sepia quality that enhances the period renderings.  The look and feel the period is well done.  The early 20th century costumes furniture sets and props are precise and breathe life and realism into each scene.The acting is superb.  Ewan McGregor practically rips himself to shreds playing the mercurial Joyce jovial and charming one minute paranoid brooding and insanely jealous the next.  However poor Ewan once again has a terrific performance upstaged by his costar Susan Lynch See Nicole Kidman and Moulin Rouge!.Despite lacking the classic features of a leading lady Lynch's physiognomy is a perfect match for the earthy Nora.  Lynch can flat out act.  This lady has a five octave emotional range with the force of Caribbean hurricane.  If there weren't a single other reason to see this film her performance would be enough.I am glad that I happened on to this film buried in the stacks at the video store.  I rated it a 910.  It isn't for everyone but for those who can appreciate a fatalistic love story with steamy sexual content constant emotional tension great acting and insightful directing this will be a disturbing but worthwhile experience.".

The movie depicts only the first 57 years of their tumultuous tempestuous sexually charged possessive and jealousy filled relationship. It is the time when Joyce was struggling to get his novel 'Dubliners' printed which eventually did happen in 1914. It is the story of the young couple's selfimposed exile to the continent to Trieste today in Italy. The dramatisation is influenced by Joyce's short story 'The Dead' which is a novelette about a married couple. A passionate costume drama but at times quite melancholic which is underlined by the dimsepia cinematography. Not many literary references of his published work however insight into the lovers erotic correspondence the epistolary 'lovemaking' they had when ever they were separated. I thought that was extremely stimulating! Therefore I decided to read Joyce's lovelettersto Nora rather than retrying for the Xth time 'Ulysses' which I somehow never manage to finish.Ewan McGregor is sincerely a brilliant actor and as a Scotsman he pretty much fooled me with his strong Irish accent but then again there were moments I would have loved to have English subtitles for my own untrained ears.

I've read a lot of Joyce's work which I've always liked so I was disappointed at first that the film didn't focus more on the creative process but the story of Joyce and Nora Barnacle was pretty intriguing in and of itself.I went surfing for info about this nice little film when I got back home Susan Lynch is every bit as wonderful as the meager number of net reviews I could find say she is.   She gives a striking and memorable performance as the woman who inspired Molly Bloom.   Nora's tenacity in the face of Joyce's neuroses and abusive behavior was both awe inspiring and frustrating to behold Lynch's brilliant performance alone made the film worth seeing. Not to say that McGregor wasn't good in the role of Joyce but if I were forced to choose one performance over the other in this film to honor it would be hers. Give McGregor credit for having enough savvy to play his role understated enough to allow his costar to shine.  His ability to imbue the neurotic and manipulative Joyce with some humanity without going over the top and stealing Lynch's thunder is noteworthy.    Not many actors could have pulled this off.  He's one of the few that could.Nora has some problems.  It meanders in places and tends to overanalyze the problems in their relationship but it is a gorgeous looking film featuring a volatile partnership that is vibrant and alive if nothing elseoverwrought without being boring  disarmingly sexy without being too crass I did blush in a few places!   Not a perfect screenplay but a good one.   The performances make the film.  I was pleasantly surprised.".

I had the opportunity to view Nora overseas a couple of weeks ago and I must say I found it compelling even though its focus confused me a little.The storyline kind of went into full gear before we got to know the characters but the performances of Ewan McGregor and Susan Lynch were both top notch.   The relationship of James and Nora riveted me to my seat. They fought like dogs but they were vibrant and passionate souls whose relationship endured all sorts of demons.  Nora's soul was bared for the viewer and Susan Lynch made her one of the strongest female characters I can remember by giving Nora vulnerability as well as uncommon emotional strength.  McGregor did a great job of helping me sympathize with Joyce even when he was neurotic and treated his long time love terribly.   I wish the beginning of their relationship had been presented more concretely but McGregor and Lynch hooked me anyway.  As it presented the events of their lives Nora was top notch.  Not for anyone who is an afficionado of actions films that's for sure.".

I had the opportunity to view Nora overseas a couple of weeks ago and I must say I found it compelling even though its focus confused me a little.The storyline kind of went into full gear before we got to know the characters but the performances of Ewan McGregor and Susan Lynch were both top notch.   The relationship of James and Nora riveted me to my seat. They fought like dogs but they were vibrant and passionate souls whose relationship endured all sorts of demons.  Nora's soul was bared for the viewer and Susan Lynch made her one of the strongest female characters I can remember by giving Nora vulnerability as well as uncommon emotional strength.  McGregor did a great job of helping me sympathize with Joyce even when he was neurotic and treated his long time love terribly.   I wish the beginning of their relationship had been presented more concretely but McGregor and Lynch hooked me anyway.  As it presented the events of their lives Nora was top notch.  Not for anyone who is an afficionado of actions films that's for sure.";

This is a fascinating theme and in the hands of a director brave enough to tackle it head on it might have made a fascinating film. Unfortunately Nora pulls all the important punches. It ends for one thing with the completion of Dubliners long before the completion of Joyce's masterpiece Ulysses. It is in Ulysses more than any other of his works that Joyce portrays Nora's frank and unashamed sexuality through the soliloquy of Molly Bloom that provides its unforgettably affirmative codaI was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish Wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.Much of the film is repetitious there would have been ample space to deal with the composition of Ulysses. Leaving it out points up the film's essential timidity in the face of the historical and literary record.The film's most daring scene  and biggest copout  involves the exchange of sexually explicit letters when the pair are in different counties an exchange deliberately initiated by Joyce for the purpose of sexual relief. Joyce's side of the correspondence can be found in the Collected Letters. Joyce yearned to be accepted sexually for himself with all his kinks and erotic hangups. Nora permitted him to confront those sides of his sexuality both in his life and in his work and that more than any thing else is the reason they stayed together. The film too needed to confront those issues. Instead his words spoken in voiceover against an image of Nora discreetly masturbating consist of a few tame references to 'licking'. All the fourletter words the masochism and the anal fantasies have been left out. A viewer unfamiliar with Joyce's work would be left with the impression that his sexual preferences were by modern standards pretty ordinary.Other issues not dealt with are the psychological problems of Lucia Joyce their daughter who began to show signs of mental illness in 1930 and was treated for a time by Carl Jung. The image of Lucia in the film makes an oblique reference to Lucia's problems showing her standing forlornly in the doorway or looking out on the world through iron railings but a reader unacquainted with her story is unlikely to understand the significance of these images. Here as everywhere else the film turns its eye away from the darkest corner. It closes with Joyce and Nora soon after the completion of Dubliners walking arm in arm towards the end of a jetty as the sun sets. This anodyne image is presented to us as the final truth about Joyce and Nora. A film which consistently avoids its subject an opportunity missed.".

McGregor may not be perfectly cast  he's heavier and not much of a tenor  Joyce on the other hand was so renowned for his singing that he briefly contemplated making a career out of it. Ewan's very earnest in his attempt though he gets an A for effort. Susan Lynch makes a great Nora no complaints there.Some of the chronology is played around with  the Prezioso episode happened after James and Nora's last mutual visit to Galway not before. Two of Joyce's sisters are conflated into one and the family's stint in Rome is omitted. Some episodes are invented for the sake of exposition such as the runin with the cattle in Dublin. Those are minor quibbles. The film got many details right  not the least of which was how elegantly the couple always tried to dress despite their relative lack of funds. Trieste hasn't changed much since early 20th century so we also get to see some nice location shots  and a few in Dublin.I was a bit disappointed that the film ended at an early cutoff point after James and Nora's first decade together. Ideally it should have been a miniseries a la John Adams and covered their fame in Paris Nora and the kids caught in a Civil War crossfire during their last trip to Ireland Joyce's eye troubles Lucia's illness etc. As is it shows only the beginning of an almost 40year relationship.".

Ewan McGregor in his first adult leading man role proves he has matured as an actor of solid talent and sensitivity in his role as the jealous insecure yet brilliant writer.Shot on location in Ireland and Italy Nora is a small independent film produced by McGregor's company Natural Nylon and likely to be overlooked by most audiences. However if solid acting adult story lines. and turnofthecentury costume biopics are your cup of tea this video is worth the price of purchase.".

Then he went on to write some work that most of us think is great.  His relationship with his commonlaw wife Nora is the focus of this film and their tempestuous relationship provides most of the action.  There can be some critique about Joyce about filmmaking about writing direction etc. but basically this is a story about two essentially neurotic people.  Ewan McGregor brings a brooding doubting jealous and unsecure Joyce to the screen while Susan Lynch provides the fiery sexy female component this relationship.  And that's that.  As it has been observed and commented by other reviewers here there's damn little about the writer found in this film.  Too bad I suppose.  It's always nice to hear about how writers write what they do but you have to be damn familiar with Joyce to make that leap to see Molly Bloom come out of Nora.".

I have only a cursory knowledge of the author and frankly have never really examined his work in any detail. Is that a necessary prerequisite for appreciating this film?  It shouldn't be.However as a movie and theater goer I can tell you that this film is an interminable disaster.  The screenplay is too vague on so many important points about the lives of the two main characters that it leaves the casual audience confused bewildered and bored.  The emotions of Mr. Joyce and wife seem to switch back and forth with lightning schizophrenic speed from one cliche to the next. Neither of the two talented leads can surmount the dull direction plodding scenario and absence of a genuinely interesting story. Based on this movie I would never want to read a word Joyce wrote. He seems so dull and pedestrian. Some commentators have stressed the film is not about Mr. Joyce but about Nora.  But there wouldn't be anything special about her or her life if she hadn't been Joyce's amour. All we understand about Joyce from this movie is that he writes swears has a variable amount of sexual deviancy drinks and of course is Irish! With all that he is still a complete stranger to us by the film's end a character we cared about in the first fifteen minutes of the movie and one we couldn't give a hoot about by the conclusion.With all frankness this movie is more about subtle audience torture than an interesting relationship. In fact after 45 minutes of viewing the DVD I was just wishing that someone would come along shoot Mr. Joyce and his wife and put them and us out their and our collective misery.".

My biggest problem is that I could not get a sense of what Nora saw in James how much of a genius James was and the complete picture of themselves as a couple in their times.The pacing was also a little off  I wouldn't call it slow but it seemed slow because it focused so much on this one aspect of this couple but never really expanded beyond that.I disagree with several of the critics who originally trashed this film.  I don't think it was a bad film  it had lots of interesting things in it. While I enjoyed both of the characters it was hard for me to feel much empathy for them.  Joyce was portrayed as kind of a jealous small minded petty and selfish bastard while Nora could be really awful herself and you never could figure out what they saw in each other beyond sex.I'm glad I saw it but I think the story could have been a lot better if it was more tightly told better paced and the viewer had a chance to see what the story was really trying to convey.".

Joyce's writing is given only slight mention. We see he is writing we see a publisher rejecting his work which one? who knows?

Nora retrieves it badly burnt but partially reconstructible. And what work was this? You won't know from the movie. And I'm not telling either! Look it up. It's like this throughout. It isn't made clear exactly when Nora and James were married but there is a cutesy moment in the film where Nora slips on a wedding ring. From that we are supposed to realize that they are finally married. An unsuspecting viewer might think they were married earlier. Maybe not. Why knows? As my wife says I don't care.

They chose Bucharest Romania as a main location so I found familiar places in it. The campus featured in the film is the one from Politehnica University.The movie itself is well written and has a coherent plot. Of course there are times when you can predict the next turn of events. But this does not happen very often.The special effects are OK not dated or something. They integrate very well in the unfolding of the plot.

They chose Bucharest Romania as a main location so I found familiar places in it. The campus featured in the film is the one from Politehnica University.The movie itself is well written and has a coherent plot. Of course there are times when you can predict the next turn of events. But this does not happen very often.The special effects are OK not dated or something. They integrate very well in the unfolding of the plot.

I also have lived in Japan for many years and as much as westerners can I claim an understanding of their filmmaking. I thought that this movie was well done but I cannot in good faith recommend any other remakes. Unfortunately there is generally an element lost in translation. Luckilly IMO Pulse does not lose that and manages to keep its Japanese nature very well intact in its U.S. translation. Kudos to the producers.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen the original Japanese film Kairo upon which Pulse is based. There was enough here to make me want to see the original though because the central ideas in this film are very interesting. I suspect that much of the core of the original was lost in translating the story into a summer film for an American audience.The essential element of the story here is the idea that the technology that was created to connect us and make our lives more interesting is equally capable of sapping our individuality and will to live a real life as opposed to giving ourselves up to thing like the Internet and cell phones. These things are meant to augment an already full existence but when they become the most important things in our lives we soon lose ourselves entirely. The ghosts in this movie are what is left of a person who has abandoned themselves to technology. They can only exist where there's a signal as the movie puts it because when there is no signal there is no life for such people. They rely on the real lives of others to give substance to their own artificial inhuman existence in other words. This is a powerful idea and I wish that Pulse had taken more care in developing it.Instead Pulse touches on this theme from time to time but sacrifices much of its importance to become a summer horror flick targeted to an 1824 year old demographic without giving its audience much credit for its intelligence... and that's too bad because the film winds up doing the very thing that the story should be a warning against doing. It sells its soul in the end.That's not to say there aren't some good scares here. There are certainly some very effective scenes in the film that will raise the hairs on a few necks. Considering that there is absolutely no gore anywhere to be seen in Pulse it does manage to frighten viewers with some potent ghostly images. Horrorsavvy audiences will recognize elements from both The Ring and Night of the Living Dead at work here. Unlike the latter horror classic however Pulse tries too hard to shift between the plight of its central group of characters and the demise of civilization at large diluting both and leaving me wishing that it had focused on one or the other.The acting in Pulse is nothing special. None of the characters ever fully develops. Other than the special effects nightmare that happens to them one never has the chance to feel any connection to them before they evaporate in a puff of black ash. Considering how much the main theme of the movie rests upon the idea of someone's losing their will to live that's a big problem. It would have been much more effective to show the transformation of people who actually have lives into depressed shells than what happens in Pulse where we see people who live vicariously through computers stop living altogether. There isn't much contrast between the two states it's all a matter of which side of the computer screen a character is sitting on at any given moment.Still if you're up for a couple of quick and effective scares there's something to be said for Pulse. It could have been so much more though with just a bit more work. Ah well. I'll have to see if Kairo did any better.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had just went to see a prescreening of pulse last night and I must say that it was not all that bad compared to recent horror films. The main problem with pulse is that in trying to be original it borrows from other films. I understand that this is an American version of a film from Japan. The film just reminded me of too many other films for me really to appreciate it. Once again this was a prescreening and I am 100 sure that parts of the version I have seen will be changed. The other problem with pulse is that it is very hard to follow at times and you are left to interpret the movie in your own way. The deaths are also very cheesy and not really that creative. I am a huge horror fan and I was really interested to see this film because of the trailer that I very much enjoyed. The movie gets a boost in points for breaking away from the normal horror films we have been seeing as of late. Another thing that I had to pick at was the mediocre acting of the main star Kristen Bell. She just did not give a great performance...the rest of the cast with the exception of Ziagler give somewhat good performances. To continue on the scares were another part that bothered me..once again we see a pg13 movie relying on loud noises and crashes to make the audience jump...but on a brighter side there are a few scenes the laundry room scene and the car attack scene towards the end that were actually pretty scary. One last thing the ending is not all that great it is one of those things that you either love or hate...the audience at our screening mainly hated it I will assume it will be changed come the release date. Overall Pulse is a decent horror film which is a step above the horror movies that I have seen as of late just do not be surprised if you are left scratching your head after this film is over.".

We soon find out that the virus is really the dead who have found a way to return to the living world. What they want is the life force of every living being. So it is up to our heroes to try and find a way to stop them before they can consume the entire world.That's the plot which in my opinion was a rather clever idea. Too bad that the story makes very little sense and is filled with implausibilities that go against the very story that the writer and director were trying to get across. I won't explained these because of the spoilers that would be involved. Of course there aren't many spoilers anyway since the commercials give much of it away.The acting was decent and some of the visuals were nice but there is very little suspense. This is more of a simple shock film like so many other horror movies that have been filling our theaters for about three years. There is one horror movie that is the exception and that is The Descent which was released last week. If you want to see one of the best horror movies in the past couple years go see that one instead and forget about Pulse.".

Pulse has the laziest of horror film ambitions an endless series of characters making slow deliberate walks to some sort of random objective in this movie it is usually a computer screen with the steadily rising score beneath their paces.

Either way Pulse is a dreary movie with nothing to say and little thrills to share. Mostly it's a takeoff of The Ring...we get the alwaysovercast urban setting. A Naomi Watts lookalike as our lead. A lonely piano hits nearly the same keys as the abovementioned film. And we get the quick cuts of single scenes. Instead of the mysterious video used in The Ring we get equally mysterious images in computer screens. At times it has the disorienting sensation of watching a film student's class project titled How To Make Creepy Images Like What Was Used In That Video In The Ring.Throughout the movie characters go through the motions as if they've just been locked in a room watching a marathon of awful teen horror films. They laugh they grieve they act confused they act scared they act concerned blah blah blah.A plot summary for those interested an internet virus is rapidly spreading across a college campus. Basically ghostly images appear on your computer screen and then at some point in the near future a ghostly image will sneak up on you and take what appears to be your soul. Thus you are left very sad to the point of being despondent. After that you off yourself. Or you just spontaneously combust into ash. Either way.The better looking of our leads manage to doge the virus unlike literally the rest of civilization despite the fact that they are more immersed in the virus than anyone else. Funny how that works. Whether or not they succeed in stopping this ghost virus if you're the screenwriter there's no need to explain anything beyond ghost virus when all you're writing are setups for characters to peek slowly into things is for you to find out.

The storyline for the new 'Pulse' is something a child could have come up with and is highly reminiscent of a movie released a few years back  'Dot com'. The whole direction and point of the American version is so far distant from that of the original Japanese that I have no idea why they didn't just separate themselves from it in the first place. Basically whoever wrote the script had just seen 'Kairo' and thought to himself Hey some of those scenes were awesome! And the way they did this and that? Wow. Twenty minutes later the script for an 'original' Pulse was created where certain events were directly copied but liberated from all that 'plot' baggage.Honestly I cannot find an ounce of merit for this film. Not suspenseful not scary in the least and even the effects failed to impress. The action felt rushed the logic behind everything abandoned for the sake of a 'just go with it' and the message dumbed down so far that even the densest of moviegoers can get smacked across the face with it.I am not preaching that you should watch the original just please for the sake of America's general intelligence level do not consider this movie good or clever or inventive. Or good. Thanks.".

The action felt rushed the logic behind everything abandoned for the sake of a 'just go with it' and the message dumbed down so far that even the densest of moviegoers can get smacked across the face with it.I am not preaching that you should watch the original just please for the sake of America's general intelligence level do not consider this movie good or clever or inventive. Or good. Thanks.";

	schema:reviewBody "I happened to go to Universal Citywalk Universal Studios Hollywood to watch this film. That means I actually paid an additional dollar 11.00 ticket plus the ten dollars parking. This isn't even factoring in the fact that I was on a date Yet another occasion in which Tom Leykis is dead on. Essentially I wasted nearly triple what it would have cost me had I had the sense to watch this at the local theater let alone avoiding it altogether.This movie is utter garbage. The actor Samm Levine was in the theater watching the movie perhaps curious to see the audience's reaction He played the character Tim in the film. The girl I was with spotted him having watched Freaks and Geeks a program I haven't seen but a large number of people were whispering about the fact that he was there.Isn't that guy in the movie? Hey it's that Freaks and Geeks guy. The guy walked out of the movie after people were booing as the credits scrolled and said to his friends Seriously what kind of idiot would agree to be in a film like that? The sarcasm was clear. His entourage found it quite amusing. Apparently he realized that the script sucked and agreed to be in the film for the paycheck. Good thing he isn't a better known actor or he might have actually been attacked by people wanting their money back for this waste of time.Having virtually no character development this film depicts the story of a internet virus that apparently has the ability to manifest itself in the physical world. Whether this is simply a virus or supernatural phenomenon is never clearly explained. It is quite possible the virus simply happens to appear in a form which typically causes teenage girls to fling popcorn in fright.At a certain point we learn that the virus or 'PULSE' is only able to cause manifestations of these creatures through electronic devices or hotspots. So for example a creature could attack you if you were simply walking anywhere within cellphone coverage. This is never clearly explained it is stated in the film that cellphones act as conduits through which the creatures can manifest yet apparently they are able to appear in any area covered by a cell satellite yet leaving cellphones behind has some sort of beneficial effect... Aside from the fact that half the theater left halfway through the movie I continued to watch it why... I cannot tell you clearly. Perhaps it was the same reason people slow down on the freeway to view car accidents.I cannot think of a simple redeeming quality about this film. Sorry to spoil it for the slightly perverted or any fans of celeb porn sites who might perhaps be hoping to see Veronica Mars show some skin but she barely exposes her neck during the film.One of my favorite moments in the film was the scene in which Dexter Ian Somerhalder addresses Mattie Kristen Bell by her first name regardless of the fact that she never introduced herself.Oh by the way these rules regarding the presence of the creatures or whatever you want to call them is not clearly explained until the end of the film. The only thing revealed at the beginning is that Red Duct Tape repels the creatures. I guess you aren't supposed to think about this because following this course of logic established in the movie 1 The creatures exist within the virtual world and in the real world in areas under the reach of wireless internet access and cellular transmission.2 The creatures are repelled by Red Duct Tape which blocks the frequency at which they exist.THEREFORE Conclusion Red Duct Tape blocks cellphone signals.Someone alert medical institutions nationwide because this movie has just revealed the solution to those annoying people using their cellphones in hospitals which disrupt medical equipment.All we need to do is coat the buildings in Red Duct Tape.".

The film aimed at the teen demographic does away with logic suspense and a decent plot instead we get an easyontheeye cast some cool CGI effects and a story that makes no sense whatsoever.In this confusing tale a hacker accidentally allows strange creatures from another dimension to come into our world using communication devices as conduits.

Director Jim Sonzero manages one or two visually impressive moments involving the bizarre otherworldly freaks which look like they're straight out of a Chris Cunningham video but for the most part he seems content to translate the illogical badly written and plothole ridden screenplay into uninspired visual tripe without giving a moment's thought to the fact that nothing makes much sense.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are no words in the English language that can adequately describe just how terrible this film really is but let's see if I can try to describe it.First a question to Wes Craven Did you even THINK about research before writing this script? Was it too much effort to actually research the topic of modern technology before attempting to write this pseudotrendy wannabe horror film? Perhaps it's time for that nursing home now Wes. Perhaps you could scare your roommates there because you surely didn't scare anybody with this film.The only thing that frightened me about this movie is the knowledge that there are people out there who will actually like it. That's far scarier than anything you will see in this pathetic mix of 'Scream' and 'The Ring'. Imagine 'The Ring' with annoying spoiled college kids forced into suicide after a computer virus decodes demons out of thin air. Somehow the only way these kids can defend themselves is with red duct tape  something that is neither explained nor remotely conceivable. If you can imagine that then don't see this film as whatever you've pictured HAS TO BE BETTER THAN THIS.First in the long long list of problems with this film is the fact that it was made at all. Second to that the absolute lack of anything close to logic regarding technology is astounding. It's as if the person that wrote this simply skimmed an issue of PC Weekly and wrote the entire script by randomly inserting technological terms they thought sounded modern or impressive. Third problem in the list is how desperate the film feels  desperate to be hip or in. This film is not unlike the woman you see hanging around in the mall wearing clothes that she is WAY too old to be wearing. That's how this movie feels. It tries so hard to pander to a young audience that it literally becomes a joke. Wes should have called this script Hey kids I'm still cool right?. Yawn.Another one of the many flaws is the heroine of the story. So stupid is she that she hears a military message on the radio stating that cell phones computers and PDA's are dangerous and IMMEDIATELY opens up her cell phone  only to get attacked. I found myself ENCOURAGING the internet demon things  I actually cheered the thing on  Eat her yeah suck out her soul or whatever it is you're supposed to be doing! Already I've spent more time discussing this terrible excuse for a waste of time so I'll summarise  From inane opening to ridiculous end this film is a larger waste of time than harvesting maggots for fun and profit.".

The others were all so blah its hard to care about them. Ron Rifkin played his part quite well even though we're never really sure what his character's purpose is. From what I gathered he is some kind of psychologist or something that is around to tell Mattie shes imaginging things. Then when his computer asks him if he wants to see a ghost it shows some woman who he has framed on his desk. Who the hell is this woman? And who the hell is he?! I know I shouldn't nitpick but damn they could give us a little back story! The ending was the best part of this film. I was completely fooled. I thought Dex would install the virus that would kill the server the ghosts are coming through on just in time and it would actually work and the world will be saved. I think its pretty neat that they took it in a different direction than most horror movies. However I left the thing feeling a little disappointed. This movie had some great potential but I think they ruined it on focusing too much on world destruction rather than the characters.".

Anyway the movie was actually well done. The atmosphere was really dark the lighting really good makeup and visuals were awesome. If you like the Ring or the Grudge you should definitely watch this. If you like gore maybe this isn't your thing. I'm into the more atmospheric visual and sound of a movie so this thing freaked me out. Don't pass it up though. I can't wait for a directors cut when it comes out on DVD. To summarize it up I enjoyed it give it a chance. Oh and props to Kristen Bell and Christina Millian. They did a pretty damn good job in this movie.".

But the preview left a lot of stuff out that the movie didn't have. It's hard to explain but once you see the movie you'll know what I mean.'Pulse' is a very chilling film that is about the dead finding a portal in computers cell phones etc. into our world. And because of this plot line people might get scared of their own computers and cell phones. I think that's a really good way to scare people because instead of 'Pulse' having lots of jumpoutatyou surprises which by the way it does it has a way of scaring people in real life.I'm just surprised they didn't think of televisions as portals for the dead to get through. The only things mentioned and seen in the movie for the dead to get through from were computers and cell phones.'Pulse' is full of jumpoutatyou scares and other kinds of surprises that make your mouth fly open in shock. Each scare kept eclipsing the last and each thrill kept eclipsing the last too.All in all 'Pulse' is a very chilling movie that is well...chilling.Oh and when you read the back of the DVD at the end of the summary it says 'astonishing surprise ending' or something like that but I know it said surprise ending.

Pulse was another one of the movies I like to call Electronic Horror which involves T.V's Cpu's And anything else like that. In this film you will see some things that are putting this lightly by the way Freeky! You'll see crap that maybe haunt you for awhile but still keeps a great cinematic atmosphere and also keeps it fun at the same time. You'll watch People losing there will to live and also watch them... well Go see the movie and you'll find out Anyway lets talk about some of the positives and negatives 1. Great Directing through out the entire film you'll see interesting angles and motions that you usually never see!2. Interesting script The screenplay was cowritten by Wes Craven. Yea I know he's delivered some bad crap before coughRedeyecough but this may have redeemed him! OF course though he can't take all the credit because this was originally a Jap. film but I Know he added some thrills of his own!At any rate the story was awesome and it may leave you wanting to turn off your cellular Phone for awhile.3. Decent acting acting was a little better than normal but some people still sucked. It was believable though! 1. Some cheesiness In true Wes Craven Fashion some cheesiness will be detected. But it's not Full Blown like Freddy though.2. Some Problems with details One thing that is commonly rampant through horror films is the absence of details. Sure some use this as a way to really make you fear the unknown but this film should have had some more details to it. They should not give you some details and then leave figuring out the rest. 3. some annoying sound effects Some scenes make you cringe not because of the script but because of the rampant annoying screeching from the background. this is a turn off.Overall score 7.5 Out of 10 rounded up to 8 for the IMDb pollFinal thoughts Great movie considering Hollywood lately has been shoveling out crap coughZoom material girls barnyard ATV anything Micheal bay etc.cough.

The lead actress Kristen Bell is gorgeous and maybe a good actress for romantic comedies but her face has no expression in the dramatic scenes when her friends die or in the creepy and scary scenes when she is attacked by the forces.

	schema:reviewBody "Pulse is a strong candidate for worst film of the year. It's completely devoid of any interesting characters any interesting camera work or visuals and anything the least bit horrifying.Set in what i assume to be a futuristic time where everything looks the same as it does now only there's no sunlight or working indoor lighting Pulse tries to makes us afraid of our digital machinery as if it were a new storing place for hell's angels. Instead it makes us afraid of more Japan horror being remade as cheap onenote American crap.i don't know where to begin to describe the banality of this film. Another reviewer really nailed it when they said the film would be more tense if we actually cared whether the lead actors lived or died. Even the normally plucky and watchable Milian is relegated to interchangeable terrified and puzzled looks. The soul stealing imagery and black plague like marks that are supposed to be so terrifying get lost in the film's direction and would be scarier as a series of still photographs.The lack of sunlight makes the characters seem pale and boring or maybe they were just that way to begin with. Inexplicable coincidences and convenient meetings attempt to stitch the film together but it's a total lost cause. Who what or where it all happened are completely lost by the end of the film and the sense of bewilderment i felt at the end was perhaps the most horrifying part of the experience.i have seen the future of reality horror and it is sitting through a screening of Pulse.Grade F".

It's completely devoid of any interesting characters any interesting camera work or visuals and anything the least bit horrifying.Set in what i assume to be a futuristic time where everything looks the same as it does now only there's no sunlight or working indoor lighting Pulse tries to makes us afraid of our digital machinery as if it were a new storing place for hell's angels. Instead it makes us afraid of more Japan horror being remade as cheap onenote American crap.i don't know where to begin to describe the banality of this film. Another reviewer really nailed it when they said the film would be more tense if we actually cared whether the lead actors lived or died. Even the normally plucky and watchable Milian is relegated to interchangeable terrified and puzzled looks. The soul stealing imagery and black plague like marks that are supposed to be so terrifying get lost in the film's direction and would be scarier as a series of still photographs.The lack of sunlight makes the characters seem pale and boring or maybe they were just that way to begin with. Inexplicable coincidences and convenient meetings attempt to stitch the film together but it's a total lost cause. Who what or where it all happened are completely lost by the end of the film and the sense of bewilderment i felt at the end was perhaps the most horrifying part of the experience.i have seen the future of reality horror and it is sitting through a screening of Pulse.Grade F";

Irrespective of differences in individual circumstance victims are shown to have been selected for a shared defining feature. The stark realism of the film has an almost documentary feel to it and should stimulate debate on feminist resources of hope in diminished circumstances one recalls how in A Hand Maid's Tale female sociologists and other thinkers preferred to work as exotic entertainers for an elite who liked savouring the decadent pleasures forbidden to the masses.

Also to show some contrast  there is a scene in which the jubilation of the youth of 1983 when India won the Cricket World Cup is put. This shows the stark realities of our society which indeed is effective even today in some parts of the nation. This is a great lesson on film making in itself to today's youth. There is no flamboyance style nor any graphics or even fantasy. There are characters who are from a village who seek employment and who are afraid of life in itself and would go to any length to respectfully earn their bread. A scene in which Naurangi Naseeruddin Shah is offered a few rupees and when he denies it saying Aap kuch bhi kaam de do mujhe jhaadu pocha ya kuch bhi shows that even poor has their self respect and it was put well. Gautam Ghose made this film when he was 3334 and man he has the gut to show us in face what India meant in 1984. Damn kudos to his gut and the script work he had done. The shot of crossing the river is a testimony of what a director should actually be capable of without any technology cameras or hype simply capturing the emotions of characters. He seems to be a spectator in a grand scale to such heinous acts that were depicted in the film and has placed them supremely well in this film. Acting by each and everyone was exemplary. Naseeruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi gave one of their finest performances. Shabana Azmi as Rama is memorable. The other cast which includes a host of actors from Utpal Dutt to Om Puri and many more did their parts well. This is a film that shows the dark realities of the Indian society in 1980's and kudos to Gautam Ghose and the makers of the film to conceive this and giving it to us. I hope so that many from my generation and from the future generations watch this. The screenplay was at time nonlinear per say and with flashes of back story. It was commendable and interesting. The editing also was good all through it just kept the story moving forward. The cinematography from the titles to the end credits was supreme.I loved the whole of the film but to see it again I must have the dare to let my heart rend and wrench by the trauma I will emotionally subject myself to.

	schema:reviewBody "Goutam Ghose's 'Paar' tells the story of a young couple Naurangia Naseeruddin Shah and his wife Rama Shabana Azmi who are forced to flee the village because of atrocities committed by the zameendar landlord played by Utpal Dutt. It's a little difficult to follow in the beginning as the storytelling isn't linear and it moves back and forth in time.

	schema:reviewBody "To think now that there is 9 Hellraiser films is just incredible but even sad to think how downhill it went with the series. For some odd reason the Hellraiser series was never as popular as other horror franchises like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. Maybe because most of the sequels were direct to video who knows? However despite the downfall of the more recent sequels we wanted more Pinhead. The later sequels took a different turn where the scripts were written and Pinhead was added in later sometimes not making it feel like a Hellraiser film at all. Then comes along Gary J. Tunnicliffe who has a vision of bringing Hellraiser back to the basics open the box and Pinhead is coming to get you and make your life Hell. Not a bad idea however excluding Clive Barker and Doug Bradley is where the film just went totally wrong. With a very lousy budget and short time to make the film Hellraiser makes Ed Wood look like Steven Spielberg. After all look at the cover of the DVD it looks like Pinhead is constipated.Best friends Steven and Nico travel to Mexico. They film themselves engaging in several days worth of drunken partying until one night they are attacked in their room by a man with pins driven into his skull. The boys disappear and the Mexican authorities ultimately turn over their belongings to their parents including a videotape made by Steven that apparently documents their final moments. A year later Steven's parents Ross and Sarah and sister Emma gather for dinner with Nico's parents Peter and Kate. Emma finds a gold and black puzzle box visible in the final moments of the video. Playing with it causes Steven to materialize out of thin air covered in blood that does not appear to be his own. The families prepare to rush him to the hospital only to discover that all of the vehicles have disappeared from the driveway. Attempting to dial 911 they discover that the land lines and cell phones are receiving interference and no outgoing calls can be made. Steven tells the families that he has escaped The Cenobites and what he and Nico went through.The problems with the film are major the actors are either too over the top or had too much botox as the under acting was out of control. I found it hilarious that Niko's mom is so distraught over Niko's disappearance that she clearly found the time to get a good plastic surgeon and looks like a super model when she's asked to come to the house to discuss her son's possible death. Why was the sister dressed so sexy too? Not to mention I think her role was just to sit and look pouty and sexy pout sex pout sexnice stretch there. None of the characters were likable at all. Poor Pinhead once upon a time one of the most feared villains of the horror genre. A man who took the ultimate pleasure in torturing others and making your life Hell now stands there making constipated looks with jacked up make up and a duck face while talking in a voice that sounds like he should be reading A Tale of Two Cities to me. His voice was so dull and lifeless how could you ever take this guy seriously? From what I heard Doug Bradley turned down the role as he would've been paid enough money to have a new fridge well good to know what little dignity he had after the last few dumb sequels. But much kudos to Clive Barker as he said this is no child of mine along with some words I wish I could say on IMDb but can't but trust me it's good. The story wasn't that bad it was the rushed pace and bad characters that really did this movie in. Please leave the Hellraiser series alone let it rest in peace.210".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1987 Clive Barker unleashed the first film in the Hellraiser saga onto the masses from his literary work The Hellbound Heart. The first film was and still is in many ways an iconic classic entry in the horror genre. The rest is history. At the time I am writing this review the series has spanned nine films with rumors of a TVshow possibly in the works and countless spinoff media including a popular line of graphic novels and comics.Hellraiser is a staple in horror which is what makes this latest film so infuriating and heartwrenching.Hellraiser Revelations is the latest in the series beginning with the fifth film all releases have skipped theaters and been plagued with lower budgets and even lowergrade actors and crews. Directed by Victor Garcia from a script he also cowrote this mess of a film is DOA with lamebrained acting pennypinching special effects and a horrid plot that is essentially a lazy reimagining of the original film. This is a slapintheface to fans of the series who have stuck by it even as the later sequels got worse and worse following the surprisingly strong second film. Which is one of the rare horror sequels that had any thought to it and is arguably almost as good as the original despite obvious differences in tone and scope. Beginning with the third film the series took a nosedive although one or two entries notably the fifth film were watchable and enjoyable. This one however is the worst of the bunch.Two spoiled young men Nico and Steven vanished sometime ago during a wretched trip to Mexico where they partook in prostitutes and copious partying. After murdering a prostitute and after being given the mysterious puzzle box by a vagrant Nico solved it summoning Pinhead played by a new actor... more on that later whom dragged him to hell. Steven brings Nico back from hell via sacrifices and later shows up to a house where he and Nico's family are having dinner.At the house Emma Steven's sister finds the box and eventually the families begin to experiences strange and bizarre things over the film's anemic 75minute running time before a series of lamebrained twists that I won't spoil ends the film in an abrupt and very anticlimactic climax.First the acting. I haven't really seen any of the actors in this film before which I'm guessing is due to the almost nonexistent budget preventing us from getting any nameactors so I don't have anything to compare them to. But the acting was uniformly foul. All emotions by all parties seem forced and our two leads Jay Gillespie and Nick Eversman are about as believable in their performances as a sheep wearing a dollarstore werewolf mask trying to blend into a pack of wolves. They simply cannot act.Technically the film is a mess. Garcia's shotchoices are bland boring and scream inexperienced filmschool student and the lighting is atrocious. I was shocked to learn the cinematographer was David Armstrong whom proved himself to be a capable DP on numerous other films including six of the seven Saw films. Here all of the lighting and shots seem hastily thrown together and you could tell Mr. Armstrong didn't have enough time or motivation to work with. I study film and video production at college and I've seen studentfilms shot on standarddef camcorders that look better than this from a technical standpoint.The effects are also lousy. The cenobites looks soullessly designed and their costumes looks like cheap rentalstore robes. Pinhead's new design doesn't work and has too much shadowwork around his needles and creasescuts making him look a bit goofier than the eerie paperwhite look of past films. Gore effects are phonedin with cheap obvious prosthetics. The few CGtype effects are hilariously cheap looking. The setdesign is bland and uninspired as well. Especially in the Hell scenes which haven't been updated since the original film. Hell's still just a mass of swinging chains and pillars which worked in the original film due to some excellent shots by Barker and the fact we hadn't seen anything like it before but looks silly and cheap nowadays.And onto the biggest complaint most people have... and a very justifiable complaint it is. Doug Bradley whom portrayed Pinhead in all eight previous films skipped out on this one. He wasn't pleased by the script or the nexttonothing paycheck so he bailed. Our new Pinhead is portrayed by Stephen Smith Collins with voiceover work by Fred Tatasciore. And goodlord is the performances bad!I already mentioned the new makeup for the character's head didn't work as well as in previous films. But I could forgive that if the performances for the role were good. They aren't. First of all Collins who does the onscreen acting just doesn't look the part. He looks more like a lightweight professional wrestler with his headshape. And his body language doesn't have any of the poetry or art of Bradley. He performs the role as though he had no rehearsals or preptime and is timidly being told what to do by the director offscreen. He seems in over his head. And Tatasciore's voiceover work is laughable. Gone is the booming voice of past films which was dripping with darkness and emotion. Now Pinhead sounds kinda like Don LaFontaine the man known for providing voiceover work as the narrator of just about every movie trailer before his untimely death trying to whisper with a bad Eurpoeon accent while suffering a sorethroat. It's just... awful.This film is undoubtedly a careerkiller for most involved and it may just kill the franchise. It's beyond awful and I give it a 1 out of 10 not just for being a bad film but for being a tarnish on the classic original's legacy. Avoid this I saw it for free on Netflix and I still feel like the studio owes me a refund!".

My only comment would be that the actors on screen know they are making a fail movie and it shows on screen. And when the fake Pinhead arrives on screen it's game over. After watching this I looked up the interviews with Doug Bradley to find out why he didn't get onboard with the project after all he's been involved with every Hellraiser film so far.

	schema:reviewBody "Having grown up with horror movies and been exposed to the numerous big horror franchises I am no stranger to the Hellraiser movies and must admit that I have been watching them ever since the first one came out. However I am sad to say that since the third movie or so the franchise has been on a steady declining spiral and the stories have progressively strayed from the original idea.This ninth movie was a bit of a surprise to me as I came upon it by sheer luck. I hadn't even heard about it and honestly I thought they had finally put the franchise to rest after a number of disappointing movies. But I was wrong.So I sat down to watch this movie and I must admit that I was appalled to see that Doug Bradley wasn't in the role as Pinhead. That was an insult to us fans of the movies or fans of the first handful of proper Hellraiser movies at least. But still I gave it a go.That being said I have got to be blunt honest. Doug Bradley was and always will be Pinhead. Stephan Smith Collins is a really bad substitute. I am not saying that he is a bad actor as I am not familiar with his work outside this one movie but he didn't have that diabolic charm and wit that Bradley brought to the Pinhead character. Nor did he have that iconic voice that we all have come to love or fear whichever you prefer. So the Pinhead portrayed in Hellraiser Revelations was a mere cheap imitation of the original Pinhead.As for the story in Hellraiser Revelations one thing only has to be said are you kidding? The story in this ninth installment was a rude insult and a downright copy of the storyline from the first movie. Sure the setting was changed and small adjustments made but the overall storyline and plot was the exact same thing. Which leads me to ponder on whether or not this movie was necessary? Wouldn't it had been better to just let the franchise lie dormant? Surely this wasn't the best they could come up with. And also just why did Doug Bradley pass on this? Leaves you with something to think about doesn't it? And leaves you with a somewhat vile aftertaste in your mouth.Hellraiser Revelations dragged on forever just retelling the story that we were introduced to in the first Hellraiser movie so it was basically just pointless repetition. A way to introduce the franchise to new viewers? I don't know but for us who have followed the growth and decline of the franchise it was a rude slap on the face.The movie leaves little room for the characters to develop and grow despite the actorsactresses doing their best with their given parts. You just never really buy into the characters and they are lacking depth and credibility.Having seen every single Hellraiser movie since the very first this one is without a doubt the most boring pointless and farstrayed from the original plot. It is worth a watch if you want to see it just to have watched all of the movies but that is about it. There is nothing new here everything is just a rewrite of old material. It is like brewing coffee on an old and already used coffee filter. It was horrible.One of the things Hellraiser Revelations had working for it was the effects. There weren't a lot of special effects though whatever little they did use worked out well enough. Personally I could have used a lot more of the traditional wicked torture and torment that is associated with the Cenobytes and the Hellraiser series.I have seen Hellraiser Revelations now and I can honestly say despite being a Hellraiser fan that I will not be making a second return to this movie ever!".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of the Hellraiser franchise I refuse to accept this as a part of the series. As bad as the last few installments were none sunk this far below the bottom of the barrel. Instead of actually reviewing this terrible piece of crap here are some random thoughts and musings that crossed my mind while watching it It is quite odd how many white people populate these Mexican bars.Pinhead now lives inside the walls of this family's house? Despite her brother and boyfriend disappearing the girl is extremely disturbed that her obvious dbag boyfriend was banging a whore while in Mexico.Did Pinhead become a car thief since his last movie? I love how the wife was momentarily shocked at the prospect of there being a gun in the house.Did the film makers believe two lame Pinhead imitators would distract from how bad this movie is? Is it impossible for modern horror movies to have any remotely likable characters? I would cheer the Cenobites if they weren't pale shadows of the original characters.Pinhead didn't kill the wimpy boy down in Mexico because? Just out of curiosity how common are Asian hookers in Mexico?

Written at the 45 minute mark.Oh a subplot about cheating amongst the parents. That's exactly what I thought the other Hellraiser movies were lacking.Considering the roots of this franchise and how grisly it could be this one is easily outdone by any of the Saw movies.Uh is that supposed to be a cliffhanger ending? Why this film ever saw the light of day is a mystery. I understand it was only made to retain the franchise rights but that doesn't mean it needed to be released to the general public.

Instead of actually reviewing this terrible piece of crap here are some random thoughts and musings that crossed my mind while watching it It is quite odd how many white people populate these Mexican bars.Pinhead now lives inside the walls of this family's house? Despite her brother and boyfriend disappearing the girl is extremely disturbed that her obvious dbag boyfriend was banging a whore while in Mexico.Did Pinhead become a car thief since his last movie? I love how the wife was momentarily shocked at the prospect of there being a gun in the house.Did the film makers believe two lame Pinhead imitators would distract from how bad this movie is? Is it impossible for modern horror movies to have any remotely likable characters? I would cheer the Cenobites if they weren't pale shadows of the original characters.Pinhead didn't kill the wimpy boy down in Mexico because? Just out of curiosity how common are Asian hookers in Mexico? That red headed kid is so brutally not intimidating even with a shotgun in his hand.This movie can somehow warp time and space as its 75 minute run time feels like two long hours.

There is absolutely no point in discussing the plot as it's quite obvious that the scriptwriter has done a william burroughs cut up technique with the first 3 movies and rehashed the same lines in different order. The casting exec has chosen a lead actor that has a distinct inability to read a line without looking like he's standing on the stage like a six year old at a nativity play. The rest of the cast do lots of head scratching and quite literally look like they don't know what the hell kind of movie they have signed up for. Pinhead looks like a constipated Grandad who is trying so hard at sounding like Doug Bradley that the concentration is making his pins fall out. It's like a group of 15 year old fanboys have got together and thought if you repeat the words 'Flesh' 'Pain' 'Pleasure' over and over again you've got yourself a hellraiser film. Are their any redeeming qualities? Actually their isn't.

I used to say that constantly when I was younger and full of pep and had just taken a walk into the DVDVideo format that refuses to go away in spite of looking like a dirty dish with a crack in it compared to actual that is not upsampled HD.I started writing this review as a kind of response to a very surfacescratching and short attempt to defend this film. Because after they once again told us to forgive the film based on how little they had to work with that is what comes to mind. The film is utterly boring.It is also well worth noting that this film exists for one reason and only one reason to prevent the rights to this moribund franchise from reverting back into the hands of Clive Barker. It is one thing if one makes a bad film with honest intentions. For example Ed Wood's intentions ranged from pleading for acceptance of transvestites in the 1950s I might add to stopping the nuclear arms race before we ended up without a planet to live on. That his delivery of such messages through cinema was comically inept is beside the point because although the message gets lost in the unintentional comedy simply knowing that that was partly what he intended is enough to see he had more in mind than just money. Not the makers of Hellraiser Revelations. All they cared about was money and it shows.Stories generally go through a lot of rewriting before they are presented to an audience. Generally when an author looks at his first draft he sees mistake after mistake leaping out at him crying for correction. Characters he was in love with during the first draft might seem like complete nonces whilst rereading and are thus modified during the subsequent drafts. Actions undertaken by characters that got the basic plot from A to B in the first draft might make zero sense on rereading and thus the author will rewrite the sequence of events to make more sense. Why am I describing these parts of the writing process? Because it is plainly evident that precisely none of that happened with this script.The story as it unfolds in this film goes something like two spoiled brats go on a road trip to Mexico looking for booze sex and good times. The things that go wrong eventually lead them to sit in a bar where a bum who looks strangely like the bum in the original film offers them the box. Astute readers will note that this is quite a difference from the original where one brother actively seeks out the box in a SouthEast Asian market because he is bored and jaded with all the thrills and spills the world can offer him. Dialogue is given in which one brat explains for the audience that he does not want to spend the rest of his life in what I inferred from this speech was a hicksville village the film itself is not too clear about where they actually live. Although it was not great at doing this the original gave the audience plenty to imply that one brother was a boring tepid personality and the other a wild outgoing man. In Revelations almost everything is told to the audience rather than demonstrated. That can work with good actors but the actors here mostly look like they would find it difficult to read out a battle scene from The Phantom Blooper in a way that stimulates interest.Hellraiser Revelations is only useful for two things. One to demonstrate there is no low to which the Weinsteins will not sink in order to keep a property no matter how far they have run that property's value into the ground. Two as a teaching tool at film schools. One film school teacher quoted in the Plan 9 Companion says one useful teaching tool is to show a student an example when film is not being done well and make them take notes of what is not being done well. Hellraiser Revelations offers a goldmine of material for a class like that.".

My idea of hell would be to have to sit through this movie for eternity. Watch the original and stay as far away as possible from this lame piece of sh't.";

But soon they discover that it is not Steven's soul that is inside his body.Hellraiser Revelations is a very bad sequel actually the ninth movie of this franchise. It shows the terrible fate of the classic Clive Baker's horror story Hellraiser 1987 and its great sequel Hellbound Hellraiser II 1988.Hellraiser Revelations has a messy screenplay that does not show anything new. Indeed Doug Bradley has probably given up of performing Pinhead and Stephan Smith Collins is very weak in this role. The worst thing is that the conclusion gives the sensation that the author intends to make another sequel that should be released straight to garbage instead of to video. My vote is three.

If you were a fan of Doug Bradley...or even thought he did an OK job you will be sooooooo disappointed.

Many times I've wanted to hop onto the site after having seen a movie to share my likes or dislikes about it but for the most part this desire quickly fades and instead I just end up writing about a select few movies Those for which I felt an extreme passion or extreme hatred. Usually the latter in the case of Hellraiser Revelations the former.Without saying too much on the plot the word count won't permit me this is the first Hellraiser since the fourth to be intended as a Hellraiser film and not a hasty rewrite of an unrelated horror script and the first since Hellbound to treat the Cenobites and their backstory the way Barker wrote them. Gone are the globaldomination seeking demonic Hellspawn that made a twisted mockery of the series back are the sexually amorphous amoral hedonists that made the characters interesting and frightening to begin with. Make no mistake the Pinhead here is a far inferior version of the previous entries' and Doug Bradley's presence is sorely missed he brought a certain charisma to the character this is difficult to articulate let alone replicate and his absence from the movie is in fact its most glaring flaw. The return to true Hellraiser form though should please fans of Barker's originals The characters who fall into the path of the box are not intrepid reporters but shallow narcissistic perverts. Missing from many of the sequels was the idea that the box and by extension the Cenobites sought prey for a reason and that the fates that befell them were simply amplifications of what would have become of them in everyday life.This all said the movie is not completely devoid of flaws beyond Bradley's absence. The production had a notoriously short shooting schedule and it shows in the super abbreviated runningtime and its resultant pacing. The further the movie goes on the more rapid and sloppy the pacing becomes to the point that the climax of the movie rapidly falls apart as characters start displaying traits that were only hinted at before and which needed more development for their actions to be taken seriously. It's a disappointment that such a strong feature fell apart so quickly and in so glaring a way. Yet even this butchered pacing isn't the movie's biggest flaw.Normally I shy away from addressing other reviews however because of the directtovideo nature of most of the Hellraiser franchise and the closeknit community created as a result it's difficult to separate a review of one of the entries in the franchise from the fan reaction. In this case the absence of Doug Bradley and his relative silence on the script coupled with Clive Barker's vehement distancing of himself from the project has led to near universal disdain for the film. Note that I haven't included anything about the movie itself and here is where the biggest flaw of Revelations lies. Before the DVDs were even pressed Revelations was doomed not because of its inherent value but because fans had decided already that this was going to be the worst Hellraiser ever a difficult undertaking considering that the last four entries were unrelated horror stories hastily doctored to include Pinhead and three of which Hellseeker Deader and Hellworld were abysmal. And thus the prophecy was fulfilled I've yet to read a review of the film that takes it seriously as anything other than a Hellraiser movie without Doug Bradley. The acting is criticized when it was on par with the amateur theater quality of the previous entries the cinematography is called cheap though it's the first entry since Bloodline that doesn't look like a madeforTV movie and... well that's about all I've seen anyone have to say about this so far beyond Where's Doug Bradley? That's the biggest reason I came here to write this review. An honest attempt at a decent Hellraiser deserves an honest decent review and hopefully that's what I've done here. So if you're just looking for a Barkerapproved entry featuring Doug Bradley yes this will disappoint you. If you're willing to look past that and return to the world of The Hellbound Heart this very well may become one of your favorite Hellraisers.".

A woman fencer who wishes to learn the secret deadly thrust from the master who is writing a treaty on the fencing art is something out of ordinary as is the beauty of the actress who plays the character Assumpta Serna. She gives us a great performance amidst two different men  one in his 50s the other in his 30s  so most spectators will identify with her partners or should we say victims.

The costume and set designers did a wonderful job creating the atmosphere of aristocratic Spain shortly before the 1868 revolution.  The director does an excellent job in capturing the dance of the fencing master and his lovely student fully conveying the romantic meaning to the audience.  The writers do an admirable job of luring the audience into a poignant tale of infatuation by an aging master of a dying art and the youthful mistress who invigorates him.  Once they have the audience's attention the film pulls them in even further by unravelling the web of deceit that has held the story together building to a suspenseful finale that will leave the viewer astonished and fulfilled.  I highly recommend this to everybody. 910".

On his return to Spain general Prim joined the opposition heading revolts in Catalonia against generals Narvaez and O'Donnell. All his attempts failed until the death of Narvaez in April 1868 after which Queen Isabella fell more and more under the influence of the Jesuits and became increasingly tyrannical until at last even Serrano was exiled. In September 1868 General Serrano and General Prim returned and Brigadier Topete commanding the fleet raised the standard of revolt at Cdiz . This is the historical scenario in which takes place a especial love story between a fence master named Jaime Astarloa Omero Antonutti who is hired to teach a coupdegrace to a beautiful young woman named Adela De Otero Assumpta Serna . Although Jaime has never taught a woman before he agrees to teach the stab . When a local nobleman named Luis Ayala Joaquim Almeida becomes involved with her the action begins . Furthermore  the suspenseful intrigue involves a revolutionary journalist Miguel Rellan  a police inspector Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez and a banker Albeerto Closas .This is a historical thriller that blends loving elements  politics  sober melodrama  but being carried out in coldness  academicism and slowness . This is a thrillercold drama that keeps you interested and expecting  including a tragic love story . Hightlights of the movie are the excellent sets and magnificent dueling between Italian Omero Antonutti and Spanish Assumpta Serna . Good acting by Assumpta Serna who wishes to learn a particular thrust which a master is famous for and Omero Antonutti as a fencing master who is fascinated by her . Furthermore  it packs a good support cast full of notorious Spanish actors such as Alberto Closas  Miguel Rellan  Elisa Matilla and special mention to Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by excellent and veteran cameraman Alfredo Mayo  glamorously filmed in Madrid . Emotive as well as thrilling musical score by Jose Nieto .

And as his story develops so do the characters there is depth and feeling such that it seems that real personalities spring up out of his pages.It was with some scepticism that I sat down to watch El Maestro de Esgrima' as previous viewings of film versions of PrezReverte's novels left me with a very bad taste Territorio Comanche'qv and La Tabla de Flandes'mysteriously called Uncovered' qv by those responsible for making the horrendous disaster were very poor efforts for the cinema. However from the very first moments it was obvious that a lot more care had been taken in making El Maestro de Esgrima'.Pedro Olea Ms All del Jardn' qv based on a book by Antonio Gala had something decent in mind when he embarked on this film. He was fortunate in choosing Omero Antonutti as the fencing master. From the book one would have expected someone somewhat thinner and perhaps even a little older however Antonutti who I can remember in one of the best two or three Spanish films of all time  El Sur' 1982qv  made an excellent contribution together with Assumpta Serna as Adela de Otero. At times I suspect that the chemistry could have been a little better but on the whole these two principal actors keep everything on course. Serna was certainly quite a good choice but again from having read the book I might have thought of someone just a few years younger. She is always good to watch and hardly anywhere better than precisely in El Maestro de Esgrima'. Another interesting point is that no doubles were used in the tepe dual at the end of the film it only lasts a few minutes but it is very well done. Antonutti and Serna both had to take fencing classes and the result is well worth the effort.Jos Nieto  one of the best filmmusic composers in Spain for many years  tones in well with the proceedings and the Madrid of the 1830s.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off let me point out that this movie is by no means a french halfassed version of super bad which I do loveor American Pie not that this movie is better well actually it is way better than American pie! it's just different it's almost documentary style but not as much as The class by the end of the movie which is quite wonderful because it miraculously mixes the bleakness of men's condition and the natural optimism and resilience of a young man who knows he has his life in front of him you care for the characters you hurt with them way more than in American movie I've seen recently about similar subjects. I think the reason why is the sincerity of the director who tackles every subjects such as every day racism misogyny masturbation the relationship between a adolescent and their parents with a candour that would be deemed unacceptable by American audiences anyway I guess. So this movie is extremely funny the hero even has a Micheal Cera quality to him but with less mannerisms and it's impossible not to identify with the two main characters. So in conclusionit is both a funny beautiful and deeply nostalgic film about the transformation of a child into a man if you will. Try not to miss it but unless you live in France...well wait for the DVD then !".

	schema:headline " A comedy that is both hilarious and insightful destined for cult status";
	schema:reviewBody "This comedy is easily comparable to the recent American teenage sexromps especially the American Pie series however at the same time it is a totally different movie. American Pie as funny as it was was not witty or intelligent. The French Kissers directed by firsttimer Riad Sattouf is very funny but also an accurate representation of what teenage boys experience in high school. Although not all just think of sex all are curious. This movie follows Herve Vincent Lacoste and his best mate Camel Anthony Sonigo as they deal with bullies homework family hormones and the girls they so long desire. There is no solid plot rather it is a disjointed series of events that happen during a year that summarise a hectic time for teenagers. Relationships are lost and started tests and asssignments are forgotten about till the last minute parents pry into their child's sex life and friends hang out and talk about their latest fling or sexcapades.What I find makes this movie so good is the performances of the actors who instill such life into their characters. Lacoste is incredibly funny as the nerdy guy with low selfesteem but whose hormones are constantly raging. Sonigo is just as funny as the heavy metal loving mullet wearing best friend who longs for the most beautiful girl in the school. Alice Trmolire and Julie Scheibling are fantastic as Aurore and Laura the two girls who Herve and Camel lust after with varying degrees of luck. One last mention should go to Nomie Lvovsky as Herve's mother who never stops prying and loving her son. Honestly her character was so believable not just because Lvovsky was so good but I can relate as my mother was a lot like her. Which brings me the screenplay which is great as it brings a sense of realism to all the proceedings. Nothing is too farfetched in this movie which brings it above most American comedies of this nature.The soundtrack is excellent and of course Sattouf's direction is excellent. Yes this is a very crude movie with the majority of it being about sex and the various other activities a couple may get up to. Not everyone will enjoy it the constant talk of masturbation sex french kissing hence the title and porn will put off people who do not feel comfortable with those subjects. But at the film's heart is a touching story of slowly discovering one's self and thankfully Sattouf does not resort to sappiness and sentimentality with this theme. Unlike the many American comedies which end neatly with everything returning to normal this ends in a way which mirrors how high school can really be but I'm not going to spoil that here.45".

	schema:reviewBody "The French title of this comingofage comedy is Les beaux gosses The GoodLooking Boys and that's the first joke these boys aren't all that goodlooking. But firsttime director and comic book artist Sattouf and his cowriter Marc Syrigas take the warmhearted stand that adolescence is a goofy time for pretty much everybody. Herv Vincent Lacoste is tall and scrawny and his Arab sidekick Camel Anthony Sonigo is short and has ridiculous longinback Seventies hair that signals his rockstar aspirations. The hair styles are iffy the physiques are far from ideal the clothes are mismatched and they have acne. And the pimples aren't just painted on. But it doesn't matter. Herv and Camel do okay and the actors who play them are quite appealing.Herv goes up to Aurore Alice Trmolire one of the prettiest girls in his school and asks her for a date and she laughs. Aurore usually has a little entourage of blond wellgroomed boys around her. Before long however she sneaks off with Herv and they kiss. Herv may not be a relationship Aurore wants to acknowledge but he's fine to practice on. And they go further.American viewers may take Les beaux gosses for a knockoff of a Hollywood youth pic and it has nothing radically new to offer in its plot line of a kid who scores and then gets his heart broken. The American market is saturated with this kind of stuff. But for francophone viewers there are nuances in the storyline and the dialogue that get lost in translation. Imagine Heathers done into French. Like Heathers French Kissers adopts and teases teenage slang. Herv absorbs French rap lingo which pops out with hilarious inappropriateness. He thinks rap is good seduction music and at one point trying to be casual he addresses his school's black program supervisor as nigga. In fact the humor is not so much in what the boys are doing as in the way they talk about it.Overall Les beaux gosses is more a mockery than a knockoff of Hollywood testosterone and feels somewhat remote from the excesses of Judd Apatowsponsored features though it has something in common with Freaks and Geeks  but with more much more xrated stuff. The antics of Herv Camel and their pals are blithely vulgar. There is so much grossout and crude stuff here it ceases to gross out or seem crude. The specifics of masturbation and the overuse of socks and other aspects of teeanage sex are never avoided and the American PieSuperbadstyle dirty talking and acting is as vivid as it is fresh.Les beaux gosses also goes into lots of detail about who people are and what they do the movie's great virtue is its specificity despite its focus on generic and amorphous ado problems. A gay lit teacher isn't just suspected of being gay he's in a magazine as a gay role model and a student asks him to autograph a copy. Emmanuelle Devos has an unusual turn as a haughty school administrator. Herv's very French single mom played by director Noemie Lvovsky takes a humorous interest in his jackoff activities and also follows him to his girlfriend's party. She's a millstone but always a benign one.There is of course at least one threateningly perfect boy Loc Baptiste Huet but he turns out to be far from perfect when a weird accident happens at a gym class whose tumbling sessions also give Herv a bloody nose. Herv Aurore Camel and friends Benjamin Robin NizanDuverger and various others are messy confused hormonecrazed and even sexually vague. Herv's relationship with his mother is borderline incestuous and with Camel as they act out and try out has its homoerotic phases.It's this cornucopia of absurd overthetopness and richness of detail that explains Les beaux gosses' successful inclusion in Director's Fortnight at Cannes and its rave views after its summer 2009 French release. It was shown as part of the FSLCuniFrancesponsored RendezVous with French Cinema at the Walter Reade Theater and the IFC Center in New York in March 2010.".

It has pubescent boys obsessed with sex local girls who said lads have no chance with or do they? and uncomfortable situations aplenty. It doesn't do anything overly original and the story arc is predictable but that doesn't matter. It is bloody hilarious. Sure it has patches of unfunny areas but when it hits the mark you'll be cackling until tears roll down your cheeks.The awkward moments  like the boys getting caught perving on a neighbour  draw out a chuckle here and there though the real hearty laughs are primarily induced from the smaller subtler parts of the film benefitting from the nuanced comic performances delivered by its young pimply cast. Vincent Lacoste makes Herve a naturalistic and relatable adolescent whilst Anthony Sonigo is more overthetop as his ultralibidinous mate Camel. There is also a sidesplitting turn from Noemie Lvovsky as Herve's unabashed mother who has an unseemly yet surprisingly never disturbing interest in her son's sex life. The bit where she witnesses Herve snogging for the first time is one of many highlights  her reaction is completely and utterly priceless.Writers Riad Sattouf who also directed and Marc Syrigas deserve plenty of credit too their script has some undoubtedly memorable dialogue and interactions. A canteen scene where an inexplicablycool blind boy chats up a naive girl offers one of the finest pickup lines put to celluloid. Not to mention the deadpan reactions from Herve's group when they hear the school bully has died. It are these moments where the film shines and makes you forget about its numerous faults  the cultural differences to Australia make for some oddities  elsewhere in the movie.A guilty 90 minutes indeed.3.5 out of 5 1  Rubbish 2  Ordinary 3  Good 4  Excellent 5  Classic".

I left France 40 years ago and my teenage day was quite different on the ethnicity mix and the freedom of sexual expression that exists today. Yet I could associate so well with my own teenagers' experiences. Although the movie does deal a lot with sexual issues and why not if it's about teenagers growing up. The film also deals with other relevant issues. I'm a little taking aback by the tittle chosen for English language French Kissers. In my view it reduces the expectation of the potential viewer to something a little more trivial than what this movie is about. I even read a comment that explained why it was so named! My learning and understanding of the expression french kiss is somehow fairly specific and I could not relate to it appropriately further than a play on word. I wish I had the skill to translate meaningfully what Les Beaux Gosses conveys. I'm not happy with the beaut kids or  the great kids but it's around this idea. And the idea in beau gosse is someone who think he or she's ready to put one over you but smoothly with a smile weather or not it will happen. If I had to put a title in English for it I probably would have called it LOL yes because this film is not threatening anyone and does touch people in a way they most likely will relate with it on way or the other but whatever you will laugh out loudly.

If I had to put a title in English for it I probably would have called it LOL yes because this film is not threatening anyone and does touch people in a way they most likely will relate with it on way or the other but whatever you will laugh out loudly. If you don't I don't envy you!";

	schema:headline " For the debut of Sattouf it is not a terrible film just one that shows his immaturity most specifically as a screenwriter";
	schema:reviewBody "In Brittany France Herve Vincent Lacoste and his best friend Camel Anthony Sonigo are two horny adolescent teens who are flunking their high school classes. Rather than studying they are too busy thinking about women and wanting to get laid. Yet they are both so inept and socially awkward that they have little luck with any of the girls they pursue. They are also picked on regularly by the more popular bullies. Herve whose father is away supposedly in the army struggles with his meddling mother who is not shy to ask him personal questions. Despite his poor social skills Herve is eventually greeted by a girl named Aurore Alice Trmolire who sees something in him and they start a relationship.Riad Sattouf's first film as a writer and director is like the French version of American Pie. As with that movie this is yet another comedy and coming of age film that explores an adolescent's fixation with sex. Herve and Camel regularly spy on their neighbours having sex imagine themselves with the most beautiful girls in their classes and pleasure themselves with magazines. Some will suggest that this film is truthful to the years of an adolescent. To an extent it might be but this is a film that begs the question as to when truth becomes a clich as countless other films have explored the same behaviour in more subtle meaningful and original ways. This is a crude and juvenile film that takes these issues for laughs and only in the most superficial manner. Seeing The French Kissers recalls the indie comedydrama Thumbsucker 2005 a superior film that also focused on adolescent behaviour. It rarely overstated the teenage interest in sex and its dopey adolescent protagonist was characterised with moments of frustration highs and low strengths and weaknesses. It felt like a finely realised visualisation of some of the most difficult times in growing up.The two characters in this film though are so devoid of any redeeming qualities and substantial development that by the end some will be begging Sattouf to give them some dignity. They are hopeless in every aspect of their lives. They are idiotic lazy selfish socially awkward and interested in little beyond sex and music. Both of the boys though through no fault of their performances are less credible than they should be because their roles have been written more like caricatures coming straight from the handbook of bad adolescent behaviour. They channel every clich imaginable for the nerdy teens right down to playing games of Dungeons and Dragons. The credibility of the main relationship between Herve and Aurore is also strained because one has to question what exactly she sees in him. For his apparent obsession with sex he initially does not seem the least bit interested in talking to her. Most disappointingly the repetition of masturbation jokes grows very tiresome after a while and minimizes the number of laughs in the film. Some might enjoy this brand of gross out humour but others will surely find it particularly unfunny and unintelligent.Domestically The French Kissers has been a huge hit. Yet for Western audiences the issues explored in this film are likely to be overly familiar given that so many funnier and more intelligent films have dealt with the same concepts. If the characters had more qualities to evoke our sympathy for them this could have been a more engaging and personal story but at best it's rather hollow and two dimensional. For the debut of Sattouf it is not a terrible film just one that shows his immaturity most specifically as a screenwriter.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this film on the big screen the only surviving 35mm print in the world.  I had never seen it on video so seeing it in a crowded theater was my first experience with the film.  As a bonus the director Richard Fleischer the star Perry King and Brenda Sykes who plays King's slave wench in the film spoke before the screening.The audience alternated between gasping and roaring with immediately regretted laughter throughout the screening.  Nobody laughed for a moment at Susan George's supposedly overthetop performance.  And at the climax  there were astounded gasps all over the theater. Afterwards once the applause had died down the audience filed out stunned.  Everyone looked shellshocked.  I wandered around for a while listening to people murmuring I told you guys...  Best I've seen... Totally uncompromising... That's how it was... Didn't pull any punches... Amazing... Where did you hear about it?...We had one big advantage over most people who see the film.  Most viewers go rent the tape because they read about it in say Edward Margulies' and Stephen Rebello's BAD MOVIES WE LOVE which is how I knew about it. MANDINGO has a huge reputation as a camp classic so people seek out the video where it can be found.  Then they take it home and watch it alone or with a friend or two preprimed to laugh.The audience I was sitting with at the American Cinematheque theater had first of all read the sober favorable description in the Cinematheque schedule.  Then we'd listened to Fleischer himself talk about how he had refused ten times when Dino de Laurentiis had asked him to film the novel only to finally accept when he realized how he could do it By being totally honest and straight with it.  And he was if you view it without a laugh ready.  King and Sykes also spoke calmly and soberly about how hard the shoot was and how the cast considered it an important film but still had trouble handling the emotions it stirred up.Fleischer is hardly a symbolic director although there's a lot of found symbolism in 10 RILLINGTON PLACE for example.  But MANDINGO was an obvious statement of the inhumanity of slaveOWNing and it constantly used the setting and characters to emphasize the moral and physical disintegration of the Deep South under the selfimposed yoke of the slave culture.  That sounds pretentious but in MANDINGO it's totally straightforward.  Moral disintegration leads to moral disintegration.  The crime is its own punishment.  MANDINGO is an antimatter GONE WITH THE WIND.MANDINGO as Fleischer pointed out was a huge hit on its initial release. It was also viciously attacked by all but two critics in the United States. Fleischer admitted that he saved all his reviews and pointed out mildly that those two reviewers  who were the only critics to go into the film in depth  pronounced the film a masterpiece.  I don't know if it's that he said but those two were certainly a breath of fresh air.Because of all the controversy the film was never rereleased.  Nobody at the screening could think  of a single time it had been screened between 1975 and August 28 1999.  Perhaps it was screened once or twice but my point is that essentially no one since 1975 has seen this film with an audience to feel the reactions of those around the room to see it on the big screen.I think it's really unfortunate that MANDINGO has gotten locked into this camp label.  The film contains so much depravity that I can certainly see why it was selected as a camp classic.  But that wasn't the intent at all. I've heard this film compared to SHOWGIRLS.  But SHOWGIRLS was directed by the bizarre Paul Verhoeven ROBOCOP TOTAL RECALL BASIC INSTINCT.  Of course he was going for camp he always does camp.  But Richard Fleischer? He did 20000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA MR. MAJESTYK 10 RILLINGTON PLACE a real gem THE BOSTON STRANGLER FANTASTIC VOYAGE SOYLENT GREEN.  He is one of the most mildmannered directors alive. He's done bad stuff  CONAN THE DESTROYER and RED SONJA come to mind  but in the seventies he was doing his best work.  And that would have to include MANDINGO  to my complete amazement.I can't believe how different my experience with this film was from its usual cult interpretation.  Now I wonder if Otto Preminger's HURRY SUNDOWN is as bad as the Medveds said it was in 50 WORST FILMS OF ALL TIME.  I'll have to try to see it for myself.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an underrated truly great film on the subject of slavery sexual hypocrisy and the haunted hothouse atmosphere of generations of white bad karma in the 19th century deep south. There are some who've commented here who get it others who don't want to get it because it's just too truthful and disturbing. These folks undoubtedly would prefer a TV sanitized version of slavery as in ROOTS. It's a testament to Richard Fleischer's integrity that he was able to pull this off. All performances are excellent well that's not strictly true as Ken Norton stumbles his way through but Fleischer through his direction and editing gets an adequate job from him including superb James Mason one of his most brutally fearless roles as opposed to the nadir of his career as one IMDB commentator puts it. One of the things that's most disturbing about the film is the depiction of the consequences of slavery racism and hypocrisy on the white race how it warps son Perry King's natural tenderness towards Brenda Sykes into a horrifying insecure paranoia that evolves into aberrantly exaggerated jealousy and sexually motivated violence by the climax. And poor Susan George's character is driven totally mad by her husband King's neglect and jealousy and the semingly contradictory tender erotic ministrations of slave Norton. Mason reaps what he sows at the end and King's upbringing and inferiority complex is ultimately too much for him in the end taking him down the same road to hellish oblivion.If one wants to see a truly lurid exploitive treatment of the same subject although very entertaining also with a great cast  Warren Oates Isela Vega Yaphet Kotto et.al. one should look no further than MANDINGO's sequel DRUM. However MANDINGO is different. It does contain some lurid super charged sexual images and shocking cruelty and violence  but Fleischer's treatment is matteroffact inyourface and ultimately totally unpretentious.  It walks a tightrope but courageous director Fleischer never stumbles. The gritty extremely realistic location and production design add to the disturbing ambience. Unflinching beautifully shot I saw this in the theater when it was released and at a rare revival screening in 2000 and undeserving of it's pariah reputation.".

When one population completely dehumanizes another population every excess and taboo becomes acceptable in their eyes. If this kind of stuff specificly the use of female slaves as sex objects is not well documented in the history books that shouldn't surprise anyone. You can bet your bottom dollar that in those male dominated times such practices were commonplace and probably considered relatively normal.Despite the fact that I think this is a great film I can see why many people would want to bury it or dismiss it. It's just too difficult to accept and it doesn't even have a happy ending. There is no sense that the situation will change in any way.I almost wish i had never seen it so i can't really recommend it despite the fact that it's great. Very few people will watch this movie and take it the right way. Many will laugh at it and assume it's a big exaggeration others will find it mean spirited or racist and despicable.If it has any flaw it's that it's too honest. People don't like to watch a movie and be bludgeoned by it. There is no attempt to appease an audience. There is a bit of melodrama but it's surrounded by so much evil that you can't care about it and I don't think you're meant to. This movie is a slap in the face... Take that into account before you watch it if you choose to.On another note... Based on other descriptions it's possible that I saw a slightly edited copy of this film... Differing versions of the film apparently exist and some have edited scenes. That may account for some of the different opinions expressed in regards to the movie. If there is a more graphic version out there I doubt my opinion would change. Making it more graphic would not necessarily reduce it's greatness but on the same note the version i saw was plenty graphic enough to get it's point across. This may be a case unprecedented?? were the edited version of a movie is actually the better version. I can say for certain that the movie i saw was a great film and I'll leave it at that.".

	schema:headline " Extremely powerful 70's movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "To be a nasty meanspirited exploitation flick or not to be a nasty meanspirited exploitation flick that is the question! Mandingo is pretty much a mystery of cinema on its own. Did the prominent Hollywood crew with names like Richard Fleischer Norman Wexler and Maurice Jarre intend to produce a trashy  sleazy picture  or was it really their intention to bring a harsh yet realistic portrait of the slavery business in Southern America around the year 1840? Either way it was meant Mandingo is a truly impressive and unforgettable film that totally represents the 70's decade! Wexler's screenplay  adapted from a novel by Kyle Onstott  is definitely not meant for squeamish or easily offended people as it is an honest depiction of how awful and disrespectful the wealthy white masters treated their black servants AND considered their behavior to the most normal and common thing in the world. The movie revolves on the plantationowning Maxwell family Warren and his son Hammond and their main occupation is the breeding of slaves. Hammond hits the jackpot when he buys a pure Mandingo on the market. This is a physically strong black male he uses for reproducing and trains to become a bareknuckle fighting champion. Meanwhile father Warren insists on having a son of his own with the distantly related Blanche but Hammond is far more sexually aroused by his collection of black wenches. Mandingo is a very powerful film despite the large amount of exploitative sex and violence and Richard Fleischer's likeitornot narrative style is ultimately confronting! Particularly the harrowing yet accurate little details will have a severe impact on you. For example the sight of rich white bastards resting their legs on black children or the endless images of obedient slaves being exhibited on markets and getting inspected like ordinary farm animals. Much rather than a sick exploitation film I think this is a truly insightful and fundamental portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages. Naturally this film got boycotted due to its explicit content and I can easily understand why most filmcommittees chose to ignore a production that deals with topics like racism  sadistic rape but it's a great film that needs to be seen by wider audiences. Just to prove that it's more intelligent than the majority of 70's exploitation films there's the compelling sub plot of a courageous slave Cicero who tries to mobilize his companions in misfortune to revolt against their masters. Richard Fleischer one of the most underrated filmmakers ever assures a tight directing and most of the players deliver excellent performances which isn't so obvious seeing the insane lines they sometimes had to say. The nword dominates pretty much every dialog and everyone talks with a heavy Southern accent. Ken Norton as the Mandingo isn't much of an acting talent but physically speaking he's definitely the right man for the job. What a handsome fella he is! The music cinematography and use of rural filming locations are all splendid as well. In conclusion Mandingo is a fabulously curious 70's highlight and recommend to openminded lovers of cinema. Note this comment got deleted once after a complaint raised by another user. Can somebody please tell me what's so offensive about this writeup??".

	schema:reviewBody "In this film the masterful James Mason plays the plantation patriarch a Big Daddy you wouldn't want to be owned by. This is undoubtedly THE BEST Film made about the era of slavery in the USA. It puts the sanitised romantic Gone With the Wind to shame. Mandingo will make you uncomfortable even in your most comfortable seat. Mandingo is a mirror. See your reflection it will scare the living bejeezub out of you.This is a film about power. Racism is about power. When some people have absolute power over other people they become sadistic and sometimes the objects of their sadism become masochistic. Absolute power is always justified with ideological rationalisations become dogma in this case the the dogma that black skin makes a person less than human. Power corrupts the individual's sense of morality. With power over others one becomes more or less immoral hardened to a subordinate's suffering. Selfesteem is generated by putting down the one perceived to be inferior and slaves were considered less than human a notch or two down on the food chain. Slaves were treated as objects of power like the organic results of animal husbandry like the commodities you purchase and eat cattle pigs or sheep. Thus having sex with a slave for a 'white' male owner was like breeding new animals for sale with a view to profit. 'White' females of course were not allowed to engage in this sort of animal husbandry with slaves. The patriarchal whisper one hears in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof becomes a murderous roar in Mandingo.In Mandingo we see realities of absolute power's affect on the social psychology of a society. Even after more than a century of time American society especially the South is still scarred by the psychological damage which simmers under the surface of smiles whiskey fueled tears and freshly mown lawns.Mandingo is a must see. It's better than Glory although Glory would be an appropriate second on a double feature bill with Mandingo. Mandingo is even better than Burn and much better than Roots. The acting is superb. The screenplay is magnificent. The cinematography is choice. Yes this movie is violent but slavery was a daily violence on the lives of those who suffered it. Face it. Yes there is sex in this movie squirm in your seat as you feel a touch of titillation. Yes there is abuse on all levels from pedophilia to outright murder. But the abusers aren't comic book level bad guys they aren't Jokers on the set of Batman. They are the ruling class of the Old South. Sometimes their humanity shows through. Sometimes bad guys are ever so well ensconced in the the rituals of polite society that they come across as the upholders of civilised behaviour. That they are also enmeshed in a daily life organised around the exploitation of those who produce their wealth speaks volumes about the quality of their humanity and our own social relations of power today.Get Mandingo however you can. Show it to your friends. Discuss it after you see it. Get ready for the movie experience of a lifetime. Forget about Basterds forget the demented ultraviolent comic fantasies of Quentin Tarintino. Forget about the sanitized films of the Antebellum Age. See Mandingo. See the hard truth about chattel slavery and then do some reflection about how power over others functions to generate a generalised state of dominance and submission in the social relations of the here and now wherever you live on this planet.".

	schema:headline " Disturbing and unsatisfying";
	schema:reviewBody "Mandingo is one of those films like Birth Of A Nation or Triumph Of The Will in which one is forced contemplate objectionable content all the while reluctantly allowing mitigating qualities. That's not to say that Fleischer's exploitative film hardly an artistic landmark is at anything like the same level as those masterpieces although he had an interesting and varied career. He was responsible for low budget noirs Armoured Car Robbery 1950 Disney classics 20000 Leagues Under The Sea 1954 intelligent biblical drama Barabbas 1962 war epics Tora! Tora! Tora! 1970 as well as science fiction Soylent Green 1973 each made with equal professionalism. These are films that are still a pleasure to reencounter and continue to hold up as solid entertainment. Mandingo stands out as his most controversial work and in these politically correct times is seen infrequently even more so the sequel Drum 1976  not by Fleischer.For those used to the cosy image presented of the old American South Mandingo will come as a slap in the face. Falconhurst where most of the action takes place is far removed from the comforting romantic world of say Gone With The Wind 1939. So inflammatory is the subject matter of this film that Fleischer apparently refused several times when Dino de Laurentiis asked him to direct. It is reported that Fleischer finally decided to accept the job only on the basis of his film 'telling the truth'.With or without the salve of supposed historical accuracy Mandingo was a huge hit when it came out although few critics liked it and tellingly it was never reissued. It still retains a strong camp reputation dividing audiences between those who value its revisionism and those who smell exploitation. None of the director's initial hesitation is apparent on the screen as his work plunges into the excesses of slavery with gusto. On one level Mandingo is a racist sexist violent melodrama. But it is also one of the first films supposedly to show the slavesouth as it was as a casually cruel society harbouring an odious institution one that debased human relationships at every level. Interestingly there's an echo of such a slavebased society in Soylent Green where women are commonly sold as part of a rich apartment's contents and termed 'furniture'.Starring as the grouchy patriarch Warren Maxwell James Mason appears uncomfortable both in and out of character. Playing Maxwell as afflicted with a rheumatic foot the actor also suffers professionally being handicapped with a dubious southern accent. More familiar in suave dapper and civilised roles Mason here plays a shabby bigot who meets an abrupt end. Although he makes the best of it there is a distinct feeling that he is playing beneath himself a star at the dog end of an illustrious career as the opening 'haemorrhoid scene' only serves to illustrate.Less can be said for Susan George called upon to play a frustrated and vengeful wife. For those with a nose for such things her eventual dalliance with Mede pronounced 'meat' is an all toopredictable event their climactic miscegenation amongst the most exploitative elements in the film. George pouts and plots appropriately but her sensuality is overwhelmed by the brutality that surrounds her and her nudity is mild.Perry King who plays Mason's son Hammond had a brief career in films before he disappeared into anonymity and television in the 1970s. Interestingly in the same year he also appeared in another cult flick The Wild Party. In the present film as the consciencestricken offspring he manages competently enough without making much of an impact. Impaired by a limp his physical handicap suggests something of his inner doubts  although in terms of sexual morality at least he is as hypocritical as everyone else. As Mede the 'mandingo' in question exboxing champion Norton is at the centre of the film brooding darkly at the injustices around him. Is he secretly hatching plots against his white masters we wonder? For a long time his motives and potential are in doubt. At first the humiliation he experiences at the slave market the old lady scrabbling in his loin cloth a defining moment and later his involvement with the secretly literate blacks suggests that Mede is a dynamic character even a black Spartacus. He takes obvious pride in the fighting skills which allow him a limited sense of independence although his selfcontained rage and violence is continually understated. Even when upbraided by Cicero for killin' another black man he seems more sheepish towards his accusers than angry at the system. His continually postponed revolt is what gives the film much of its tension. It is unfortunate then that Mede's ultimate No Masser. at the end although expected is less a longawaited declaration of rebellion than a resigned withdrawal from service into selfdefence. The older Cicero a supporting character is noticeably angrier and more radical. One need only recall a film like Schepsi's The Chant Of Jimmy Blacksmith where the revolt of the repressed is made explicit to see how restrained the lead in Mandingo is. Mede's final violent acts done almost in sorrow at his master's failings are ultimately much less cathartic than natural justice and the audience demands. In short Mandingo posits a society worthy of overthrow and then denies the audience the satisfaction of seeing it effectively opposed. While this allows scope for exploitative images of lust humiliation and punishment the final result is curiously inconclusive and gives the film a disturbing nature. One is left with a rush of dead and dying bodies resolving nothing outside of plot strands. The big boiling cauldron into which Mede topples pierced with a pitchfork epitomises his constant agony. It also stands as representative of the hell the film has represented so excruciatingly for its participants while offering no immediate prospect of salvation. Mandingo's audience are left contemplating the need for real justice or face having blithely enjoyed the degradation on its own account. No wonder this uncomfortable film is rarely seen today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mandingo seems to divide it's audience strongly between love and hate and that's not really surprising the film features some real nasty elements and the way that it's all done with a highly quality 'period drama' sort of style means that it will likely miss it's supposed intended audience  although it seems to have found a good fan base among exploitation fans. The film is liable to shock modern audience for its racial themes and strong racial tone it didn't bother me all that much to be honest as it suits the film within it's context and helps to enforce its exploitative nature which in turn makes Mandingo more powerful. The film takes place in the south of America during the 1840's and the main focus of the plot is on slavery. White farm owner Hammond Maxwell one day discovers the fighting talent of one of his black slaves and soon decides to toughen him up for battle with other slaves. He's sympathetic with his slaves and soon becomes affectionate with one of the women which doesn't sit well with his wife Blanche who for revenge forces the top fighter to sleep with her.Anyone going into this film expecting a serious look at slavery will be either disappointed or annoyed maybe both but if you go into it expecting some nasty exploitation you might find a lot to like. The film gives an unflinching look at a more primitive society and it actually more shocking for its tone and implications than the events that take place in it although the film does include plenty of racism torture and rape scenes. The way that the film depicts the black slaves as animals makes for uncomfortable viewing and the way that society was segregated into 'white masters' and 'black slaves' is always enforced on the viewer. The performances sit better with the exploitation side of the film rather than the serious drama side as none of them are particularly brilliant although the three leads do fit into their roles well. Overall this is clearly not a film for everyone and I'm not in any way saying that the film's bad reputation is in any way undeserved but Mandingo is certainly an interesting film and I would say it is at least worth seeing.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mandingo seems to divide it's audience strongly between love and hate and that's not really surprising the film features some real nasty elements and the way that it's all done with a highly quality 'period drama' sort of style means that it will likely miss it's supposed intended audience  although it seems to have found a good fan base among exploitation fans. The film is liable to shock modern audience for its racial themes and strong racial tone it didn't bother me all that much to be honest as it suits the film within it's context and helps to enforce its exploitative nature which in turn makes Mandingo more powerful.

The dialogue is a bit difficult and DVD has no English subtitles but you'll be rewarded if you stick with it. No need to understand every word. I agree that Tarantino was influenced by it but his approach to the subject matter is very different. Mandingo stands on its own as a major work of the 1970s and it's certainly a film that deserves to be better known. Striking photography and music throughout. This film panders to no one nor does it simplistically tell the viewer what to think about anything. We have the feeling we're on our own with this. Maybe it's no accident that that feels liberating.

James Mason and his lame son Perry King live on a plantation and own slaves body and soul.

Son King takes a more tender approach as he sleeps with the female slaves especially Brenda Sykes whom he takes as his mistress. However he marries Susan George to provide an heir and presents her with a ruby choker. He also gives Sykes the matching earrings.

George drowns her sorrows in lots of sherry and lots of Ken Norton a slave Perry has purchased specifically for fighting other slaves for betting. George becomes pregnant and when the baby comes it hits the fan! It's hard to believe that anyone in 1975 could see this film as anything but exploitation of a very dark period in American history. Didn't anyone cringe at the sight of King going in to take pleasure from a female slave in a bed and the woman groans I too black for you or Ken Norton standing stoically on the auction block of a slave sale while an old woman gropes around inside his loincloth? The video edition of this film I saw was from the early eighties when movie studios did their transfers from the first wornout prints the could grab and may have had a muddy faded look because of this but it's hard to believe this thing came from a major studio. You'd certainly wouldn't know it from the production values because the film looks as if the filmmakers didn't spend a penny more than they had towe're treated to interior scenes inside a plantation house curiously devoid of furniture. With all these setbacks it's hard to understand why this movie hasn't garnered even a semicult following.

	schema:reviewBody "In Richard Fleischer's richly imagined and deliciously baroque slave melodrama the Old South is presented as a prison of the body and soul for both slaves and masters in which both black and white inmates transgress the bars of their mutual cage with catastrophic consequences. Set on a decaying plantation presided over by a rheumatic patriarch a devastating portrait of human corruption by James Mason the story has the heir apparent son rejecting his new white bride who he is shocked to find is not a virgin and finding refuge in the arms of his black wench mistress with whom he shares moments of intimacy unavailable to him elsewhere. In turn the wife chooses to manipulate her husband's prize Mandingo slave into bed setting all of them on the road to a devastating tragedy.Mandingo is a film about bodies bodies as commodities bodies as skin colour bodies as objects and subjects of desire bodies as instruments and recipients of violence. The old South is a patriarchal propertyowning and white supremacist hell but the inhabitants are possessed with sexual and emotional desires which chafe against the ideologies of their time and place. The scenes in which the white heir shares tender moments with his wench or the white wife seduces the Mandingo are complex and intense scenarios. In sophisticated ways they push their characters into attempting to create transgressive selves whilst at the same time temping the viewer to desire transgressively. All of the bodies of the four leads  Perry King Brenda Sykes Susan George and especially Ken Norton are eroticised by the camera and served up before the viewer as icons of sexuality in this way it is all the more ironic that the centre of power is the decaying body of James Mason's patriarch.The film shows consciousness love and hatred being created and deformed in a corrupt society. Black is set against black but a nascent awareness that this is unjust is beginning to blossom in some of the black characters and even dimly in the white heir sometimes the old ideologies reassert themselves nowhere more than in the tragic denouement when the white master kills his wife and prize slave insults his beloved wench and ends up shot himself all because of his double standards are revealed when the wife gives birth to a mixed race child murdered in its cradle by the whites white women were expected to be exemplars of race purity even whilst their men copulated with female slaves. Susan George's Blanch comes across as a neurotic sadistic nymphomaniac but it is clear that she is a victim of patriarchy  abused by her brother sold by her father shunned and eventually murdered by her husband. She in turn metes out physical abuse to her husband's wench and compromises the Mandingo man. But this latter is a compromise which compromises us all as the image of the huge and beautiful black man on top of the slim and pale white woman is indelibly erotic and even though this is not a pornographic film the implication of a huge black penis sliding into this woman is built intrinsically into the scenario for the shock delectation and seduction of the audience.Mandingo is complex violent and sometimes luridly melodramatic. The characters speak in a rich and textured language full of demeaning imagery and Gothic cadences. It's a huge film made with all of the resources of a major Hollywood studio  yet its a down and nasty film about an ugly era of history an era of history which is part of what made America what it is today.".

One would think that this is as close you can get to actually seeing the slaveowning south on film.Mandingo is probably lumped into the cultcamp classic category because this is a film no one would dare make today unless the slaves got a major comeuppance at the end. They do not here. This film is a brutal look at slave owners and their slaves which will leave the audience gasping. Some of the lines are so daring by today's politicallycorrect standards there's no doubt they'd get a lot of laughs. Kind of how 1977's Fight For Your Life gets laughs with all it's overthetop racism only not in such abundance. Sure to get some laughs is hearing the English actor who played Bently on The Jeffersons talk all nasty.Perry King is Hammond the slave owner's son and he actually has a bit of a heart where the slaves are concerned. He and Mandingo actually his name is Mede evidently a Mandingo is a name for a breed of strongfighting slave become friendly. Hammond also has a favorite female slave wench who he falls for. And he marries cousin Susan George who is very bitchy and shows the slaves no respect. Mede is played by Ken Norton who is obviously not an actor but who looks the part.The film has a sleazy realism to it. Even the plantation looks like a mess  the outside is all ragged and the inside isn't much better and this is a rich man's plantation. This is definitely not Tara.Not to repeat the plot but many amazing things happen and there are plenty of incredible scenes. The big fight scene between Mede and another slave is especially bloody and brutal. The ending certainly won't anyone feel all nice and cozy. There are many familiar 70's movie faces all over the place.This is a film that has kind of disappeared in the realm of today's political correctness. But seeking it out isn't tough as it has to be seen by anyone with an interest in nonPC cinema or any kind of forbidden movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Loved by some hated by many this searing antebellum Southern Gothic melodrama about the inherent barbarism and inhumanity of slavery in the deep South circa 1840 reigns supreme as one of the single most startling and unflinching sleazoid epics to ever ooze its way onto celluloid. The fact that established director Richard Fleischer and respectable actor James Mason joined forces with major studio Paramount to produce such a raw harsh and gritty expose on the slave trade is amazing in and of itself. Granted this picture certainly isn't pretty or pleasant by any stretch of the imagination but it certainly lives up to its notorious reputation and delivers a potent lingering sucker punch right to the gut.Cruel Warren Maxwell marvelously essayed with deliciously nasty brio by Mason runs his plantation with a proverbial iron fist. His handsome and more compassionate son Hammond a fine Perry King gets married to spoiled belle Blanche a gloriously histrionic Susan George mangling a Southern accent but falls for tender slave girl Ellen an affecting performance by Brenda Sykes. Moreover Hammond buys beefy stud Mede brawny heavyweight boxer Ken Norton and trains him to become an unbeatable champion fighter. Meanwhile the neglected Blanche has a extramarital fling with Mede. Director Fleischer and screenwriter Norman Wexler take the stereotypical romanticized vision of the Old South and completely turn it on its ear by relating the sordid narrative in an unsparingly lurid and sensational manner Incest torture sex degradation beatings miscegenation nudity even King goes full frontal! infidelity and murder are all served up hot and graphic in this fascinatingly warped and depraved cinematic brew. Even the most hardened aficionado of inyourface base and trashy exploitation fare should be pleased by such savage highlights as a little boy being used as a foot stool a pregnant woman having a miscarriage after she's sent flying down a steep flight of stairs a ferocious noholdsbarred fighting match and Mede being boiled alive in a huge pot of hot water by an enraged Hammond. The cast really sink their teeth their juicy roles with standout supporting work from Richard Ward as cowed house servant Agamemnon Lillian Hayman as cheery maid Lucretia Borgia JiTu Cumbuka as angry defiant slave Cicero Ben Masters as Blanche's evil heel brother Charles Roy Poole as the cold Doc Redfield and Paul Benedict as slimy slave trader Brownlee. Cinematographer Richard H. Kline gives the movie a properly rough and grainy look while Maurice Jarre's neatly varied and melodic score likewise does the trick. Muddy Waters sings the excellent bluesy theme song Born in This Time. A true landmark of big budget grindhouse cinema at its most unapologetically seamy and twisted.".

Director Fleischer and screenwriter Norman Wexler take the stereotypical romanticized vision of the Old South and completely turn it on its ear by relating the sordid narrative in an unsparingly lurid and sensational manner Incest torture sex degradation beatings miscegenation nudity even King goes full frontal! infidelity and murder are all served up hot and graphic in this fascinatingly warped and depraved cinematic brew. Even the most hardened aficionado of inyourface base and trashy exploitation fare should be pleased by such savage highlights as a little boy being used as a foot stool a pregnant woman having a miscarriage after she's sent flying down a steep flight of stairs a ferocious noholdsbarred fighting match and Mede being boiled alive in a huge pot of hot water by an enraged Hammond. The cast really sink their teeth their juicy roles with standout supporting work from Richard Ward as cowed house servant Agamemnon Lillian Hayman as cheery maid Lucretia Borgia JiTu Cumbuka as angry defiant slave Cicero Ben Masters as Blanche's evil heel brother Charles Roy Poole as the cold Doc Redfield and Paul Benedict as slimy slave trader Brownlee. Cinematographer Richard H. Kline gives the movie a properly rough and grainy look while Maurice Jarre's neatly varied and melodic score likewise does the trick. Muddy Waters sings the excellent bluesy theme song Born in This Time. A true landmark of big budget grindhouse cinema at its most unapologetically seamy and twisted.";

Each of these movies were made with great professionalism since these films are still a pleasure to encounter and still holds up and some of the best entertainment value anywhere. HoweverRichard Fleischer's most controversial workMandingo still holds the title some 30 years later and still is as shocking as ever.Mandingo is very much a pulpylurid antebellum potboiler that really turns the fantasy world of a classic romanticized film like Gone With The Wind inside outand to put in bluntly a slap in the face. For those used to the cozy image presented of the American Souththis wasn't a Garden of Eden before the fallbut this was a nightmarish version of slavery that at the time audiences never seenand the horrors of cruelty and in treatment of human beings became one of the most graphic and tarnished chapters in American History. Here this is a version of the Old Southwhich is nothing more than a turn onwhere everybody seems to be sexstarvedslightly mad or depravedor sometimes just plain knuckle headed. James Masonin the nasir of his careeris a campily eccentric white massaa slave breeder determined that his handsome randy young sonPerry Kingsettle down and provide the family with a new heir. King's got other things on his mind thoughmainly a pretty slave wenchBrenda Sykeshis one true love.

During the seduction scenedirector Fleischer works hard at heating up the audience which the infamous sex scene was the center of the entire movie in which the scene almost became too close to an X rating at the time this film was release. This was in the year 1975were the envelope was pushed into even deeper depths hereespecially in a movie where the majority of the subject matter was presented. Later on in the storythe bride bears Norton's childwho is promptly done away with. Then Nortonyoung master King's favoriteon the plantationNorton's a fighter of uncommon strengtha winner of all of the matches the master sets him upreceives yet another reward for his handiwork once his paternity is revealedand this is towards the end of the moviehe's thrown into a huge caulderon of boiling waterthen has a pitchfork shoved into him!

Let's not forget lots of interracial sexand the film had as many nude black women as the envelope was pushed even further into detail.

I'm not sure I'd go as far as calling this an exploitation film but it's certainly startling at times and deals with the subject of slavery without backtalk or ambiguity.The movie takes place in Deep South prior to the American Civil War. Slavery is at its highest bloom and it's just as bad as you've probably heard. First night rights are freely exercised slaves are just one step above animals sold like cattle and while they're not beaten daily  they still need to work and it's not like you beat your cows daily either  it doesn't take much for them to incur the wrath of their masters.The movie is also notable in that it uses the term 'mandingo' somewhat correctly. The term referred to any slave of the highest quality and not just to those who fought against one another. Though even that fighting might be a myth. The movie tells the tale of one particular manor its owners and the pair of mandingo slave that were brought there one of them to be trained as a fighter.It's a tough movie to sit through if you're squeamish and while it's not overly gluttonous in its depictions of violence like Django Unchained is it doesn't shy away from them either or pull its punches. A very good movie to check out if you liked Django andor are looking for a darker historical piece.".

This is but one example of how MANDINGO takes racism to a completely new level  since owning slaves was legal it's shown in a workaday fashion.But after the first fifteen minutes of blunt dialog there's a pretty decent story involving Warren's son Hammond played by Perry King who reluctantly marries his cousin Blanche brought to life with vicious melancholy by STRAW DOGS ingnue Susan George. Blanche is jealous of her husband's slave wench and basking in rueful isolation within the dilapidated mansion she throws a violent tantrum that's quite chilling.The real stuff occurs when Hammond purchases a Mandingo Fighting slave Mede. Real life boxer Ken Norton proves his worth as an actor and is especially good in the intense fighttothedeath scenes that make you forget about all the other stuff unfairly categorized by film historians as camp cinema Perhaps they were just too stunned to take this seriously and too ashamed to really enjoy it.Either way this is a film that could have only come out of the 1970's.

	schema:reviewBody "It's very easy to see why this film wouldn't sit well with some people black and white alike. Its vision of an ugly vile racist South is pretty hard hitting and memorable. It seems there is no depth to which it won't sink. The critics were plenty vocal about their dislike while in actuality the film became an unlikely box office success. Nowadays it's seen by some as a camp classic which is understandable given how theatrical it gets. It's essentially a period soap opera that happens to wallow in a lot of trash  there's violence sex and nudity both male and female. It's based on a novel by Kyle Onstott and a subsequent play by Jack Kirkland. The hilariously cast James Mason drawls his way through the role of a bigoted plantation patriarch in 1840s Louisiana with Perry King playing his son. Among the story threads are the hideous envy that Kings' lowly wife an over the top Susan George shows towards the wench Brenda Sykes whom King is rather sweet on and Kings' acquisition of a slave the appropriately cast Ken Norton whom he hopes will achieve tremendous success as a fighter. It's simply a hoot to see this cast  also including Richard Ward Lillian Hayman Roy Poole JiTu Cumbuka Paul Benedict and Ben Masters  sink their teeth into this melodramatic material given unflinching and straightforward filming by Richard Fleischer and shot by Richard H. Kline with an accent on the unglamourous. Maurice Jarres' score is extremely flavourful and adding to the appeal of the soundtrack is the presence of the great Muddy Waters singing Born in This Time. The pacing is very unhurried allowing us to really feel the discomfort of such scenes as slaves being stripped naked and whipped on the behind or the sight of Mason resting his legs on a young slave boy hoping that the kid will absorb the rheumatism out of his body. One thing is for sure and that's that Mandingo is the kind of experience you don't soon forget. One way or another it affects you and if anything it deserves some respect for not whitewashing the attitude of the times revealing every sordid aspect of slavery and also giving its victimized characters a measure of dignity and hope in the face of total domination. The actors certainly play this for all that it's worth Norton in the central role may not possess much in the way of acting chops but he still has a quietly powerful physical presence. All in all audiences should find it...interesting to say the least. Followed a year later by another Onstott adaptation Drum. Eight out of 10.".

The pacing is very unhurried allowing us to really feel the discomfort of such scenes as slaves being stripped naked and whipped on the behind or the sight of Mason resting his legs on a young slave boy hoping that the kid will absorb the rheumatism out of his body. One thing is for sure and that's that Mandingo is the kind of experience you don't soon forget. One way or another it affects you and if anything it deserves some respect for not whitewashing the attitude of the times revealing every sordid aspect of slavery and also giving its victimized characters a measure of dignity and hope in the face of total domination. The actors certainly play this for all that it's worth Norton in the central role may not possess much in the way of acting chops but he still has a quietly powerful physical presence. All in all audiences should find it...interesting to say the least. Followed a year later by another Onstott adaptation Drum. Eight out of 10.";

Slavery is a deep wound on the American psyche one that people are still struggling with now. Keeping that perspective in mind it isn't hard to see that the director felt he was giving an accurate hardhitting portrayal of the brutality and dehumanization that accompanied the practice of human beings owning other human beings. He was in a way but what so many people have taken as camp is the SHEER DEGREE of brutality and sex in the film so much so that it is overkill. Maybe it's the culture of irony that prompts people to view things in such a manner but it does seem that the excesses of sex violence child abuse and rape reduce a serious attempt to portray the horror of slavery to tawdry exploitation. While there were in all probability similar situations happening on slaveowning estates it seem highly unlikely that such extreme happenings were the norm. Other efforts have provided a more effective portrayal of slavery without pandering be it intentional or notROOTS comes to mind. Let it be said then that MANDINGO may well be the worst movie with the best intentions of revealing truths about human depravity ever made.".

I for example never owned and never abused a slave. Did you? But what about black moviegoers? In 1975 I worked in an office in the Treasury Department where 75 of the employees were black females. I remember how anxious they were to see Mandingo and 4 of them on my branch arranged in advance for annual leave so they could see it at the 1100 AM show at Loew's Palace on opening day. With Mandingo and with the sequel Drum in 1976 they loved these two movies. I think they's have told the PC Police to stuff it if there were any PC Police in 1975.".

It's the kind of movie they never make anymore with an unappealing protagonist an entirely corrupt universe where justice and virtue won't triumph and a heartbreaking ending which basically guaranteed it would never be a commercial hit. Obviously some were put off by these things accounting for the low rating this minor masterpiece sleeper has. Bur that's part of why I love it!While there is significant man's man violence and the obvious titillation from Lena Olin this movie is at its heart a pure noir cautionary tale carefully structured to get us to the amazingly powerful payoff which tops all. The writer Hilary Henkin is obviously knowledgeable about her 40s and 50s hard boiled repertoire and fills ROMEO with references and touches which students of the genre will enjoy.But the center of this movie is Gary Oldman. His blisteringly desperate performance as a corrupt cop at the end of the long slide to oblivion defines the movie and is both hypnotic and disturbing. His voiceovers are a worthy throwback to the old Raymond Chandler raps voiced by Bogart or Dick Powell or Robert Montgomery. This isn't a nice or likable character but Oldman is believably relatable as he inexorably tries to feed the hole with his greed and inevitably circles the existential drain.Lena Olin is at her menacing best this is surely the role which landed her the gig as Sidney's subtly venomous mother in ALIAS and she takes full advantage of the overthetop femme fatale characterization with deadly verve. Oldman and Olin share a bizarre chemistry which is fortunate for the script because Olin's repeated seductions of Oldman where he basically knows she is luring him to his doom would never have worked if the actors didn't bring it to life on the screen. There aren't a lot of actresses who can outmenace Gary Oldman but Lena Olin absolutely pulls it off.ROMEO IS BLEEDING is not perfect. Roy Scheider's mafioso character is strangely caricatured and sticks out in a world otherwise occupied by three dimensional players. Scheider tries hard too which is a shame because it's just not there in the role. Lena Olin's brazen escape from police custody defies plausibility in the extreme. Gary Oldman is seemingly not quite properly motivated at all times. Nevertheless the searing denouement to this movie burns all of these concerns away because it is one of the most unexpectedly poignant and heartrending in the last quarter century of noir. If you have a pulse you will well up at the end and probably think about a longing that you left behind at some point in your life against your wishes. 9  10".

I just love this film.It is only one out of over 5000 movies have either rented or purchased that I watched backtoback nights after seeing it for the first time. A dozen viewings later It's still just as good if not better. It is starttofinish the most entertaining crime movie I have ever watched.Being of fan of film noir those wonderfullynarrated crime films of the '40s and '50s Romeo Is Bleeding is right up my alley. I may be wrong but believe this whole film is simply a parody of the film noirs an outrageous take on those movies with an overthetop villain Lena Olin the most fascinating female I have ever come across on film along with overthetop characters action scenes dialog and narration. It's a wild fun  albeit sick  ride not to be taken seriously which a lot of people did and then thought it was too goofy. Evidence of this filmnoir spoof is in the dialog with a number of fantastic darkhumor lines many delivered by Olin. One has to see this a number of times to catch all the humor in here. Kudos to screenplay writer Hilary Henkin for her work.Oldman is superb and its the glue that holds this unique story in tact. His narration including the exaggerated inflection in his voice is fantastic. I appreciate the American accent this British actor used too. Olin as Russian hit woman Mona Demarkoff she is one character I guarantee you will not ever forget. Roy Scheider Annabella Sciorra Juliette Lewis Michael Wincott and others  cameos by Dennis Farina and Ron Perlman  all deliver great performances with lines that well....as I said are outrageous. If you love the old film noirs please check this movie out and remember it's tongueandcheek.".

As Jack Grimaldi his New York accent is spoton. He creates a character which most people will recognize somewhere in hisher life and delivers it with such ease that you live Jack's life through this outstanding actor's performance. Juliette Lewis has never been better. Her performance is funny touching and ultimately tragic. Annabella Sciorra is glorious as Jack's earthmother wife. Everything about her performance rings true. But it's impossible to even find words to describe Lena Olin's Mona Demarkoff. Wow! Beautiful sexy tough coldhearted vicious and unrelenting. I'm impossible to ever forget her performance once you've seen it. I haven't seen this film in years and I'm still upset that she didn't win the Academy Award and wasn't even nominated!

Music is by Mark Isham and Gary Alper and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski.Oldman plays corrupt cop Jack Grimaldi who does favours for The Mob in exchange for considerable payments. He has a loving wife and a mistress but even that can't satiate his lust leanings. So when he is assigned to babysit Russian hitwoman Mona Demarkov Olin he is soon up to his neck in sexual yearnings. Something which spells trouble for everyone...A box office flop and savaged by some pro critics Romeo Is Bleeding is clearly not a film for everyone! Yet for those who like their neonoir sprinkled with satire and Grindhouse flavours it's definitely the film for you. It's possible that some folk just didn't get it that it has its tongue firmly in its bloody cheek? While some of the charges of misogyny and it being a macho fantasy are kind of moot given it's written by a woman! Undeniably it is guilty of going too far over the top where as it cheekily laughs at itself it forgets to rein itself in a problem since the finale is surprisingly touching but difficult to accept given the carnage previously.The trajectory of story is classic noir. Hapless corrupt copper Jack Grimaldi loves his wife but finds it easy to cheat with other women. Once the incredibly sexy Mona Demarkov slinks into his view he's in big trouble. Add in The Mob after him due to not carrying out a hit and you get a noir protagonist spinning towards misery. Grimaldi narrates in snatches to keep the mood simmering on desperation while visual smarts like a triplicate mirror image  or a scene at a amusement park  further enhance the noir atmosphere. While Olin's Demarko has to rank as one of the most potent femme fatales to steam up the screen.Superbly performed by the principal actors and backed up with solid support film doesn't lack for quality in that department. And with Wolski's photography and Isham's music also leaving indelible marks on the sleaze and greed mood tech credits are impressive. If only Medak had not tried to take too bigger a slice of cake then this would be talked about as a neonoir classic. As it is as appendages are lost and the pulses raised this still plays out as a disgustingly sexy weirdly offkilter and bloody fun piece of film. 7.510".

Things start to go downhill when he falls in love with a cruel and merciless assassin Mona Demarkov who's being targeted by the Mob. Romeo is Bleeding is the ultimate filmnoir of the 20th century everything about this film is so weird and evokes a sense of despair and hopeless that watching it till the last minute puts you gasping for more air. It's hard to put it into words since Romeo is Bleeding is more like an experience itself but a simplistic way to define the atmosphere the picture creates is describing it as a cross between the violence and style of a Batman movie only without Batman and your typical Humphrey Bogart flick like The Maltese Falcon. Outstanding performances by Gary Oldman as Grimaldi and Lena Olin as Mona Demarkov. This character was a true present for Olin and she chews the scenery every moment she's on screen. The part was perfect for her no one could pull this one of so perfectly except perhaps for Jennifer Connelly it would be interesting to see her in a role like that since it seems that Jennifer herself jumped right of a 30's40's noir movie I was impressed by her in Dark City. Burt Reynolds or Tom Selleck would have suited perfectly into the role of Grimaldi but Oldman was great. I also found very interesting that Jack Grimaldi wasn't a bad guy Oldman constructed the character as a man who just wouldn't fit in the life that was given for him and his thirst for more and more was responsible for sending his life into a spiral of violence decadence and death.".

It has a great performance by Gary Oldman from Sid and Nancy and Track 29. I became a big fan of Oldman and watched everything I could get my hands on by this guy! The direction is first rate by British master Peter Medak Let Him Have It and Ponatiac Moon and a very moody jazz score by the talented Mark Isham! I also own the soundtrack. Dariusz Wolski did amazing cinematography on this one. He would later go on to do Dark City and The Mexican. So yeah a good crew and a great cast what can I say? Other kudos must go out to the beautiful women in this Lena Olen and Juliette Lewis are breathtaking in this. And the sex scenes are pretty steamy.....for me anyway. Some light BD in this. Scrited by Hillary Henken Roadhouse and Wag the Dog and a nice character by Michael Wincott.....he says HEY YOU GOTTA GIVE ME SOMETHING....to a stranger WHAT THE ! ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?! Best line hands down Do you know what is so scary about love? It's that you don't own it. IT OWNS YOU!! That line has a lot of truth for me. So rent it if you wanna see something dark edgy and independent! Thank ya!".

The acting in my humble opinion i never attended film school and didn't take a degree in media studies is absolutely fantastic Gary Oldman can do no wrong and the storyline is both engrossing and compelling. The film has every element which I crave both a story to die for and the most powerful characters to ever bring homicidal mania to the screen. The end result is a rollercoaster of a movie portraying the inevitable emotional and spiritual demise of those who sell their soul for temporary material and physical gratification. The most important message I inferred from this movie is if you are lucky enough to find true love in this life then treasure it and protect it with your entire being. Once you have it and lose it the worthlessness of your existence will only be compounded by its loss and your life will be a metaphorical tumbleweed cast adrift in a desolate desert of despair.Fckin great movie tho  1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Blood bullets and black comedy feature strongly in this actionpacked slice of Nineties noir that entertains by taking a whole series of typical film noir ingredients and hyping them up to the max. Its story about the downfall of a New York City cop is told in flashback with the man himself providing the hardboiled narration. Despite this he never becomes a sympathetic character because he's entirely selfcentred driven by greed and lust and habitually betrays everyone who puts any trust in him. Through his own actions he charts the course of his own journey to hell which suddenly goes into overdrive from the moment that he meets one of the most monstrous femmes fatales imaginable.NYPD Detective Jack Grimaldi Gary Oldman is a guy with big dreams who envies the lifestyles of the mobsters that he keeps under surveillance in his daytoday work and supplements his meagre earnings by acting as an informant for local Mob boss Don Falcone Roy Scheider. After tipping Falcone off about the whereabouts of Nick Gazzara Dennis Farina a gangster who under the witness protection program had volunteered to give evidence Gazzara is assassinated by Russian hitwoman Mona Demarkov Lena Olin who also kills the Feds who were responsible for guarding the witness.Mona is soon arrested and Jack is instructed to take her to a safehouse from where she'll be collected by FBI agents. At the safehouse  she uses seduction as a weapon to quickly assert her dominance over the weakwilled cop and he's subsequently found in a very compromising position when the FBI men arrive.Jack a serial womaniser who'd been nicknamed Romeo by his colleagues is unfaithful to his supportive wife Natalie Annabella Sciorra and takes his goodnatured mistress Sheri Juliette Lewis for granted despite the fact that she'd do absolutely anything for him. He's also addicted to feeding the hole in his back yard where he keeps the considerable amount of cash that he'd been paid by Falcone and thinks that he's doing really well until Falcone suddenly wants him to kill Mona and isn't prepared to take no for an answer. The mayhem that follows then becomes very violent not always credible and full of surprises.One of the best things about this movie is its tremendous cast which features people of the calibre of Dennis Farina Juliette Lewis and Annabella Sciorra in supporting roles and Roy Scheider who's exceptionally good as the intimidating Falcone. Gary Oldman is perfect in a part that could almost have been written for him and Lena Olin seems to thoroughly enjoy portraying all the antics of her ruthless sadistic and completely unhinged femme fatale.Romeo Is Bleeding with its stylish direction topclass cinematography and atmospheric score is often lurid sensational and overthetop but its comicbook style is perfectly suited to the nature of its characters and its fastmoving plot.".

	schema:headline " Deliciously good neo noir";
	schema:reviewBody "Peter Medak's Romeo Is Bleeding is one of the most overlooked crime films of the 90's. It's a downbeat pitch black simmering sociopathic neo noir filled to the brim with excellent character actors and actresses inhabiting various delicious cop gangster and femme fatale roles. It has a lyrical moody poetry to it it evoking the noir flicks of the 40's albeit with a decidedly modern violent and demoralizing bite to it. Gary Oldman in a monumentally underrated performance plays Jack Grimaldi a sleaze bag cop attempting to play the Police force the Feds and the mob against each other in order to make obscene amounts of dirty money for himself. He's a two timing amoral asshole of a protagonist but Oldman plays him in a stray dog sheepish way that you just can't help root for him and feel like an outlaw doing so. Of course his scheme falls apart as all schemes like this do in movie land spectacularly so at the hands of Mona Demarkov Lena Olin a tyrannical deranged Russian contract killer with a penchant for gleeful brutality and unhinged violence. Olin is a wonder in the role a grinning black velvet spider and a source of constant nightmares for Jack as well as the audience. The film has a darkly comic almost fairy tale like quality to it a sense of inevitable karmic catastrophe at the hands of the mob and the law. Oldman mournfully narrates the proceedings from a hazy desert enclave that may or may not just be a dream and yearns for a second chance. Medal directs with steely melodramatic precision. Juliette Lewis does her early 90's ditzy thing to perfection Annabella Sciorra is sweet as Jack's poor wife the only sympathetic character in the whole deal Roy Scheider feels a bit miscast as the vengeful mob boss but Ron Perlman Michael Wincott Will Patton James Chromwell David Proval and Dennis Farina are top notch in welcome cameos. I feel like this script alone should have gotten a lot more attention let alone the simply stunning beautiful film that it has turned into. Anyone who's a fan of crime films noir good story lines and this troupe of actors and really how can you not be just look at this cast!! will love this.".

	schema:headline " A lot of bleeding can be found in this Peter Medak film sans Romeo !!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The main character in the film 'Romeo is bleeding' is not at all an ideal person to deal with as he has too many bad qualities. He is a corrupt cop who is turning out to be a bad influence on his wife. No woman has been able to get emotional satisfaction from him as he has deceived all of them including his mistress as well as wife. As a film noir with plenty of comic touches Romeo is bleeding begins with the protagonist explaining his downfall. It might sound to be a very ordinary description of a film noir but director Peter Medak has made his film interesting especially in the manner the story has been told. He brings the protagonist closer to his contacts in order to understand his motives. Although actresses Juliette Lewis and Annabella Sciorra have got limited lines for their secondary roles they have managed to do their best to change their man. Finally it is actress Lena Olin who get maximum amount of praise in her role as a femme fatale who is responsible for ruining everybody who oppose her. For his philandering ways Gary Oldman was a perfect choice as a policeman cum romeo whose irresponsible actions bring about his downfall.".

He is a corrupt cop who is turning out to be a bad influence on his wife. No woman has been able to get emotional satisfaction from him as he has deceived all of them including his mistress as well as wife. As a film noir with plenty of comic touches Romeo is bleeding begins with the protagonist explaining his downfall.

When a movie sticks in your mind even if its just one quote for so long after you have seen it and the last time I saw it was 3 or 4 years ago it means it can't be bad. So thats one thing. Another thing is that it has absolutely top notch cast. Gary Oldman Lena Olin Michael Wincott Juliette Lewis Annabella Sciorra Will Patton and James Cromwellall serious and talented actors. And the story is very interesting too. I mean you have this soflawed main character who is at the same time very human and even sympathetic in a way that he's lost he can't really help all the mess he's got himself in. It is a very human character no? And in the end he does the right thing but is it too late? Seems so. This movie is just about thathow we sometimes don't wake up and see the light until we have lost everything that was dear to us.What is the flaw with the movie? Maybe its that it didn't perhaps get everything it could from such an interesting storyline. I mean corrupt cop who's in the mafia's pocket and cheats on his wife yet loves her then gets caught in the dangerous game with a deadly Russian criminal who is a man eater at the same time...well maybe not after all. Its a movie that succeeds in pulling it all together rather well and at the same time making us stay on the edge of our seat to see whats gonna happen next. Not many American modern movies have done that. I can mention one that came out the same year as this one Carlito's Way. But that is a different story and genre really. That was a gangster film noir with a love story thrown in this is both a film noir and a love story. Thats why the title is ROMEO is Bleeding.Gary Oldman makes one of his strongest performances and the same can perhaps be said for Olin who is very convincing and menacing in her part as the deadly seductress whose only aim is to devour everything in her path. The ending leaves us in doubt to what really happened there is no typical Hollywood ending and thats good. It again mirrors how things really go in life as Jack is left on his own waiting anxiously for his wife but nobody not even he knows if he will ever see her again. And thats art imitating life.".

Generally these are crap films which nobody buys. It was 5.99 TL Turkish liras. I looked at the back cover and saw that Gary Oldman whom I think is one of the most underrated actors ever starred in the film. I consider him to be very talented. I bought the film thinking it might be good and it was not only good it was actually amazing. The cinematography was beautiful Oldman and Olin were very good in their roles the rest of the cast was also good though I think James Cromwell could have a bigger part. The storyline was good and I was not bored for a second I was interested in what was going to happen next throughout the movie so the pacing was well adjusted.The film is a film noir set in the 90s with a sort of New York we have not seen before. Some people might claim the psycho woman character was unrealistic but I do not think so many criminals are not like normal people and she's a prime example.In short this is one of the most unknown great films that can be bought for a low price. It is underrated and not known by many people but it is still a classic crime thriller.".

This movie fulfills 2 out of the 3 criteria. It was entertaining and I was able to suspend my disbelief for the duration of the movie. I loved the gym teacher I loved her commanding officer and I loved Kim Seona.I loved how this movie subtly teaches what goes around comes around. She beats up the high school bullies then the PE teacher disciplines her. I love the relationships in the movie. I won't go into much details of the movie but it wasn't a waste of money nor was it a more than my money's worth. But if you want to watch a movie that allows you to escape for a coupla hours and be entertained this is the movie for a nice Friday or Saturday night snuggle with the significant other.".

The story is not that complicated and the telling of it offers no surprises. The actors generally do a good job but the only one who stands out is Kong Yu as Kang NoYoung who was thankfully given a more understated roll than the leading actress Kim Seona as Chun Jaein. Perhaps it is simply the contrast of his character against the rest of the film but something about him caught attention and I'm not talking about his good looks although there certainly is no lack of that either and held it in every scene. Given the chance I would definitely watch him in another movie. This is a movie to watch when you are in the mood for something light and easily chewed and you really really don't feel too analytical or criticizing... It does have some darker sides to it but nothing that will spoil the general cheerfulness. If this came on TV fat chance... SIGH I'd watch it again but I wouldn't spend money on it  nor would I recommend anyone else to do so.".

Her assignment is to get close to the daughter of the second in command of the Whacker the biggest crime syndicate in Seoul. Actress Seona Kim is wonderful as Detective Chun Jaein. She has the kind of plastic face and flexible body that can perfectly convey comedy in a physical way a useful asset in a foreign language film where words and phrases often don't translate well. It's interesting to note that she is roughly ten years older than Sangmi Nam the actress who plays Seunghee the daughter of the crime boss. Sangmi Nam was about 21 years old when the film was made yet Seona Kim is totally believable as her peer. The film is a bit weak in the occasional action set pieces and a lovely female gang member is woefully underutilized. Still the movie whose English title is She's On Duty is charming delightful and quite amusing. The DVD which I picked up in New York City's Chinatown looks great and has some decent extras a still photo gallery a music video and an enjoyable video of the photo shoot for the film's posters and box art.".

However she is eventually able to find a comfortable position at the school but when she finally accomplishes this Detective Cho goes undercover at the same school.She's on Duty is a decent film. It takes an old and tired theme and adds new life to it. This is mainly accomplished through the acting of Kim Seona who is probably best known for her work on the drama series My Name is Kimsun. Kim is a spunky and very cute woman who looks twenty instead of thirty and her high energy and exaggerated movements make for an enjoyable film watching experience. However outside of Kim's performance this film leaves a lot to be desired. There are revelations that can be seen a mile away and some scenes are quite mawkish but overall She's on Duty is not too bad and it is at least good enough to tickle your funny bone once or twice.".

	onyx:emotionText "An expedition team led by Choe Dohyung marches on toward the Antarctic Point of Inaccessibilityone of the most difficult places to reach on the planet Earth and trodden upon only once by a Soviet team in 1958.Minjaeformally trained in mountain climbing at Switzerland and in awe of the charismatic Dohyungis joined by the bookish navigator Youngminthe rather thuggish but sharp communications expert Seonghoonthe genial cook Geunchan and the electronics specialist Jaekyung.When Minjae discovers an old journal left by a British expedition 80 years agohe begins to notice odd parallels between the journal entries and his team's experience.Antarctic Journal is an impressive horror film that slightly resembles RPoint and The Thing.There are some genuinely unnerving moments and Kenji Kawai's score evokes the utterly cold and relentless atmosphere of Antarctica.Unfortunately the film leaves a lot of questions unanswered.Still it gets a solid 8 out of 10 from this viewer.";

Coincidence?.......Well this film has gotten very negative reviews and I don't think that's all righteous. The story is rather thin that's right but it does not force itself with twists and turns like a lot of other films are doing. It's all about the psychology of the human mind or maybe it is not.... I think the movie was effectively mysterious and darkly atmospheric and even creepy at times! If you like the Korean film RPOINT than I'm sure you will enjoy this one as well! I think ANTARCTIC JOURNAL was even better than RPOINT in fact! The cast delivers good performances especially Kang HoSong MEMORIES OF MURDER SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE gives an impressing performance. This film is not brilliant but it is worth checking out if you enjoy psychological creepy films!!".

Another girl with long black hair covering her face but she has no place to hang over from no ceilings to walk on except their small tents of course. Anyway if you are open for something maybe not new but a plot not worn out Antactic Journal is quite the pleasant surprise. It's more of a mystery movie will let you guessing hard to predict the end which is NOT a twist this time but easy to realize where its heading. So just sit back grab some popcorn a beer or two and enjoy it cause it has around 2 hours if I remember correctly.The view is beautiful all white all silent you can almost feel the cold. Shivers shivers and an ocean of snow. I rated it 6 indeed not perfect but nice to see something a tad bit different from time to time.".

But even then how well do we know anybody until certain circumstances bring out their true character? Headliner Song KangHo provides a truly memorable performance showing again why he is without doubt my favourite Korean actor  the kind of person who can save even the lamest of films like 'YMCA Baseball Team' and help the viewer overlook flawed films like 'Joint Security Area'.'Antarctic Journal' is the latter for although it delivers well in scares and dread not to mention breathtaking scenery and good acting it stands before the two paths of psychological thriller and horror not knowing which one to take. Thus you are presented with situations that either really happen or are products of mental stress andor decay. I chose the second option most of the time and the way characters transform as the oppressive and increasingly bleak nature of their plight overwhelms them grips you more than any paranormal device the film tries to suggest.Nonetheless you can't set things up for no adequately explored reason and that forces the plot to wade through murky waters at times. The ending could have been clearer too but since the writers didn't quite know what story they were telling it's probably inevitable.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is about a young man driven by hero worship who follows his leader into an adventure that far outstrips his ability to cope. The twist is we experience the story as it would feel like if he were actually telling it to us if he were trying to communicate with his traumatized and fractured mind. Normally in a first person movie with narration we will see what the metaphorical fly on the wall sees with clarification from other people's point of view and back story when needed. But there are no flies in Antarctica not even viruses we learn. No third party witnessed what happened to this group of men we will get no clarification. It gets weird right away  for example he tells us there was something in the snow and that his teammates hated him and talked behind his back. There are times we're confused by what he says we want to say something like Did you just say he fell into the ice and was stuck under it!?. Or perhaps we want to ask Did you just say that the ghost of his son was in the room looking down or was that metaphorical? The movie does little to clarify just giving us the feeling of that first jolt when believing the story believing the misunderstanding. There is no time for questions as this crazy man pushes on and on. Eventually he loses track of the fact he is telling a story and falls into delusions thinking he is there and taking us with him the movie portrays this by switching from first to third person. It's difficult to say what actually happened what has been warped by his personal perspective and what is complete delusion. I'd recommend questioning everything he wasn't there to see  this is only conjecture on his part and we know he is not in his right mind. I think he actually fell into the hole in the snow. The radio actually stopped working. And there was an actual British journal. He spends a lot of time conjecturing about what happened to the radio  it was sabotaged while I slept they heard us but couldn't help us they were looking for us but couldn't find us. This question is eventually answered for us but not for him. What happened to the guys in the journal he wrestles with. He tells probably ruefully about noticing the British trek seemed to have lost a member and the reality that someone could die out there was so far from their minds they couldn't even say it out loud. I think what he tells us about the fate of the British Expedition is true. I don't think there is anything supernatural about the journal. Eventually he is way past the point of breaking and his focus narrows to simply reacting to the people around him especially his leader. I don't think we learn what the leader actually said or meant  only what we are told from this biased witness. Eventually we get back to where we started. We leave him shivering on the ice. At this point he is beyond the ability to talk so the story must end.".

Antarctic Journal is a very slow paced and atmosphere driven movie spending more time on introducing the characters than going for cheap ghost thrills. After all I think the drawer horror movie is plain wrong for the movie its rather a psychological drama to me. Anyway the ending to me was just a let down as in last winter although more consequent. Maybe I didn't quite get the idea behind the movie because the ending is pretty confusing so you don't know whats truth or hallucination. But like another comment here said the movie doesn't leave you with the feeling of wasted time... its calm far from chilling rather strangely interesting and keeps your attention till the end. Maybe my rating might be too bad considering this and the nice cinematography but still I was expecting far more from the set up. Judge for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here we have Namgeukilgi or Artic journal as it may be better known over here. A movie about an exploration team of 6 Koreans to the depths of the Antarctic who come across the journals of a British expedition team some 80 years earlier. Fate has it that the mysterious misfortunes of the British are to be befall the Korean team in this forsaken barren wasteland as they struggle to reach their destination the pole of inaccessibility the farthest point from the Arctic coastline.The movie does sound like it could be worth a look it has a decent cast we got Jitae Yu whose always a solid actor the movie also starts off promising enough lending familiar elements from other horrorthriller of similar genres such as The Thing. Unfortunately the potential shortly outlives the expectations one would get from this kind of movie. Firstly one cannot help but feel frustrated by the many creepy build ups which lead to nowhere ie. a tense build up to what the audience perceives should obviously be a scary moment but then that final scare part doesn't happen only the build up. Secondly the characters are spineless. Personally I find it very irritating in horror movies unless they are of the humorous kind when the characters act overly stupid. This movie certainly pushes the boundaries having seemingly brainless idiots in the narrative who cannot think for themselves and simply follow the orders of the so called team captain who has quite obviously gone nuts. Even more irritating is that the others agree not to use the emergency distress signal even after 2 members have died because according to the captain it should only be kept for real emergencies. There are also some discrepancies in regards to realism of this Antarctic trek though the scenery is shot in a beautiful location my guess is that real Antarctic is less forgiving and piloting helicopters in Arctic blizzards to my knowledge among several other things do not work.In summary this is a very long and extremely frustrating movie which in the end strays into many confusing paths none of which lead to a satisfactory ending. If the brainless characters the narrative suffering from an identity crisis or the slow pace do not put you off then the 2 hour buildup to a very disappointing ending is sure to finish you off .".

This movie certainly pushes the boundaries having seemingly brainless idiots in the narrative who cannot think for themselves and simply follow the orders of the so called team captain who has quite obviously gone nuts. Even more irritating is that the others agree not to use the emergency distress signal even after 2 members have died because according to the captain it should only be kept for real emergencies. There are also some discrepancies in regards to realism of this Antarctic trek though the scenery is shot in a beautiful location my guess is that real Antarctic is less forgiving and piloting helicopters in Arctic blizzards to my knowledge among several other things do not work.In summary this is a very long and extremely frustrating movie which in the end strays into many confusing paths none of which lead to a satisfactory ending. If the brainless characters the narrative suffering from an identity crisis or the slow pace do not put you off then the 2 hour buildup to a very disappointing ending is sure to finish you off .";

This could have been yet another drama about a man's descent into madness had they taken out those two scenes and perhaps one or two others that carry supernatural implications. For some strange reason AJ no relation to the putz from that boy band almost completely neglects the supernatural in the second half focusing instead solely on the Captain and the very obvious fact that he'd lost all of his marbles at some point. Well at least it should have been obvious  though not to the remaining three teammembers. For whatever reasons they kept following his suicidemission orders with a minimum of fuss or skepticism until it was predictably too late. The act of cutting off the rope holding one of their teammembers hanging in the crevice that alone should have sounded alarm bells in their polarexploringsnowloving heads not to mention his subsequent behaviour half of which would have been enough to land him in a loony bin for a lengthy period of time. The way that actor plays the Captain  it should have been plain as day that he'd gone insane and yet these other guys only reach agreement on this piece of bleedin'obvious trivia once they arrive at the British hut. Perhaps this is a Korean thing dunno to be loyal to your superiors until the bitter end. That would certainly help explain the almost unique phenomenon of North Koreans not putting up much resistance against one of the harshest tyrannies in human history whereas that same government would have been brought down a long time ago in any European country  and I mean ANY. Not even the Russians would have tolerated it. The way they all follow Captain into what is evidently a pointless suicide mission might be therefore more logical or at least more familiar to Korean viewers. I am not having a go at Koreans but merely speculating.It is a pity that the source of Captain's insanity wasn't explored more. Merely suggesting that Antarctica drove him mad or that his kid fell from the 14th floor many years ago is not good enough. The parallels to the fate of the 1922 British expedition the journal the hallucinations and of course the two bizarre eyes all of these are just muchtoosmall parts in a much larger puzzle which the movie simply won't allow us to put together or to at least know where to begin. I don't think that a movie of this kind should either serve us ALL of the answers on a plate as if treating the viewers like a bunch of avatards nor do I believe that the vagueness should go too far in the other direction. The brilliance of movies that strike a balance  a fine line  between these two extremes cannot be overstated. Clearly AJ has failed in this. Perhaps it was lazy writing perhaps it was a lack of ideas how to resolve the movie's grand enigma or perhaps the writer thought that utter confusion would eventually lead the viewer into some kind of a deep Buddhist trance that would help make all of this comprehensible on some deeper religious or and I absolutely detest using this word spiritual yuck level.Ultimately AJ's strengths lie in the beautiful landscapes the mood the solid soundtrack the several fairly memorable scenes and the sense of mystery. The slow pace will definitely put off avatards and other jamesocameronian riffraff but I didn't feel as if there was any tedium. The letdown as is so often the case is that the mystery was just a papertiger a parlor trick a gimmick to keep you interested for the duration. The movie has no real conclusion it's far too open for interpretation as open as the pooka of a 59 yearold prostitute i.e. too vague to make any sense  apart from any subjective drivel that any ambitioushopeful viewer might very pretentiouslyoptimisticallydeludedly offer as an explanation. Looking forward to reading the other comments here for the usual silly theories!A solid try but next time more work should go into the script and the basic premise. Perhaps injecting a POINT to everything might help. AJ does not have an open ending  it has NO ending. You can't go off into too many directions within the framework of one single story. Take one direction and run with it. Or walk slowly with it through snow that works too.".

As polar films go this is one of the best looking ones I've ever seen. The performances are all first rate and you sympathize with the men and their plight.The trouble is that the film's plot doesn't quite work. The mystery of why things go wrong is never fully explained satisfactorily. The film seems to want to blame both the the psychological break down of the men on what happens and at the same time wants to subscribe some form of supernatural explanation. Its possible to to have it both ways with a hint of the supernatural affecting the men but thats not the case here. SPOILERS Here we have the journal which seems to kick off some events that only we see coupling with some things the men experience which are then sort of discounted by the denouncement at the end. Why are we shown hints of monsters that never materialize? I don't have a clue. It reminded me very much of the supernatural war film RPoint which has an ending that seems to come out of left field. In both cases one is left at the end with a film that never delivers on the promise made when the films started.

	schema:reviewBody "After my slight disappointment with Woman is the Future of Man partly due to its surprising usage of lightly elating music to sooth and deflate the dramatic moments and its overall inconclusiveness I was hoping for Hong to get back to his older form where he didn't use such methods and directly depicted his characters as helpless ominous and full of frailness. Even though the music here is similar to the above mentioned title the story is much less confined and more progressive and straightforward.Almost immediately we meet a young man and a woman who haven't seen each other in some years which by now must be Hong's favorite set up. Almost half of the film we spend with them as they discuss various issues and ultimately come to an agreement that there is nothing else they would rather do than to commit suicide together. Similar tendency was brought up by the male character in Turning Gate which never came to fruition. Although such premises sound harsh it isn't completely played out that way due to the light music and the dreamy feeling that the characters exhume. After a turn of events this story comes to an end and we soon find out that we've been watching a film within a film. In Hong's fashion it didn't feel like a film or an overly staged cunning device but more as a transitional story which is what it ultimately becomes.The actress playing the role in this film becomes somewhat famous but the director who we barely see suffers financial and health problems. All of this is talked about rather than shown mainly because the primary story fills the second half of the film with an encounter between the actress and the eccentric friend of the director.Without giving away too much detail their relationship plays close resemblance to the story shown before. Hong continues his depiction of men as unstable and needy by making the female character seem more financially and mentally stable as well as more sexually confident.Although the film is only 89 minutes long compared to Hong's previous films it feels much more complete than Woman is the Future of Man. This marks Hong's third installment dating from Turning Gate where conflicts between three parties two men and a woman were the reoccurring themes of the film both direct and indirect ways.He also used a lot of zooming shots in this film which I can't say if they did much good or bad but maybe added a little documentary feeling that his films contain regardless. The acting as usual is sufficient within its bounds but I must say that his last two films just aren't as poignant and memorable as his older work. The thing with Hong is that his films are shot in such harmony and patent style that in the end it's just comes down to which of his rich stories affect and connect with you the most.This film is still informative with similarly simple yet pleasant scenery. The details are still here the candid sex scenes are still here the realistic dialogs are still here but I wasn't quite moved here as I was with The Day a Pig Fell Into the Well Power of Kangwon Province or Turning Gate. Hong still made me think with this film but I felt that this film lacked the prolific and conclusive symbolisms that he is so magnificently gifted for. Still it earns a recommendation to the fans of the director and those who'd like to experience something new.".

Shown at the New York Film Festival Lincoln Center October 1 and 2 2005.Hong was back for the third time at the New York Film Festival with this appealing selfreflexive look at ineffectual young men who happen to be filmmakers. The first segment is a film about such a man Lee Kiwoo who is tall and handsome but directionless. He meets an old girlfriend Uhm Jiwon and eventually talks her into committing suicide with him though the attempt ends comically.Ten years later the star who was also the director is now famous and ill. His costar the girl is a successful actress. She encounters a classmate of the filmmaker also handsome now down on his luck who claims his story was appropriated in the film and it seems like it is going to repeat itself as he gloms onto her and they spend a drunken night together.What's interesting is the way Hong slides from glamorous ennui to comical mediocrity in his meandering New Waveish sequences in a brightly lit but tacky urban Korea. Is Seoul really anything like Paris? Perhaps not. But Hong's sweetly melancholy film with its gentle convolutions lingers pleasantly in the mind  despite the slightly tooeasy irony of its finale with the once suicidal director now whimpering that he doesn't want to die.Hong was born in Korea but got a BFA at California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland and an MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago.".

There is so much smoking and drinking in this film that my chest and head hurt by the endI felt like I could smell the smoke and the beer.

El Infierno shows not only a harsh present but also a hopeless future. The main topic of this movie is of course drugtrafficking but in this case is only a pretext to show that drugtrafficking is not the problem itself because it is only the consequence of a very long tradition of arrangements between mafia and government. The most characters in this movie were very well performed. I said the most characters because Maria Rojo's performance was not so good as the other actors. This movie is easy to see and although it contains brutal violence it will be never so brutal as the headlines at the daily news.".

It pretty much portraits the dark side of the human soul violence corruption greed murder revenge etc. everything under the sad reality of the narcos and drug trafficking in Mexico. It's interesting that you see this from the point of view of the narcos. And it even has the virtue of using some dark humor that doesn't make the viewing more comfortable. Script production cinematography and acting are wonderful especially Joaquin Cosio absolutely brilliant no wonder why he was picked as one of Bond's villains in Quantum of solace. I found valuable the fact that it is a hard criticism to the government the authorities the police the justice system and not just the actual ones but the ones we've had in the past 80 years and that in a way it's a slap in the face to the celebration of the 200 years of independence. That said it has to be understood that it reflects only a part of Mexico's reality though it's a brutal one. Just like after watching City of God you can't assume that Brazil's whole reality are the favelas the same way it'd be wrong to assume that Mexico is just narcos killing each other. Powerful and brutal not an easy watch but in my opinion a must see for any movie fan.".

The satire portrayed in El Infierno shows how we are really at the gates of hell in a civil war that nobody wants to see or acknowledge. The movie has spectacular shots of the San Luis Potosi Desert that serve as a framework to develop all the memorable characters in the film like Damian Alczar Benny that transforms itself from a naive character to a ruthless hit man or Joaqun Coso Cochiloco both salvage and family man.

It seems that many of us live in a different country so far from this hell and this movie is a great remainder of the problems we have as a country. I think that many of us are indifferent to these problems we do not even imagine that this war affects all of us. I have read some reviews in which the way of telling the story is questioned and criticised. Many people think that the comedy is unnecessary that it is a safe and easy way to say this kind of things but I wonder if people are ready to pay to watch a film that does not involve comedy or any kind of humorous situation... sad but true our TV and cinema culture is pathetic. Good for Luis Estrada not everything is tequila mariachi loco spring break and telenovelas in Mxico.".

We Mexicans have the curious ability of laughing of ourselves and our misfortunes but Estrada show us the limit. We know that this happens for real in practically all the northern states and even though we can laugh and enjoy the sarcastic commentaries the jokes at the expense of corrupt politics and even the depiction of a controlling wife and mother that is a given in Mexico matriarchy This is not to say that I didn't like the movie it is flawless entertaining and very very real.

It tells you everything about it.

El Benny portrayed brilliantly by Damian Alcazar just wanted to work in a decent manner but trouble and necessity made him turn into crime.The Director does a great job. The movie looks grainy like in Traffic or La Ley de Herodes thanks to a great cinematography. The soundtrack is made up of the infamous narcocorridos. Decent editing and art direction. Perfect display of the northern zones of the country that limit with the USA borderline.Incisive and witty dialogs plenty of humor good violence in the likes of Robert Rodriguez and endearing characters. There's a lot to dig from this movie.Each character in the movie displays a specific situation about Mexican society. For instance the Reyes brothers dispute the zone in order to distribute the most drugs and dirty business. El Cochiloco brilliantly played by Cosio and by far the most likable character is a man who knows what poverty is. Suddenly he becomes rich and wealthy but at a high cost...The rest of the characters are mostly ignorant and their desire is to be a drug lord. Sadly that's how things are in actuality.Watch this black comedy in order to understand the repercussion of the war against drugs.".

I like the director is like the 2 part of Herodes Law that was excellent and it was with Damian Alcazar one of my favorite actors Elizabeth Cervantes I haven't see her before  is a surprise she is very good actress and very sexy about the rest of the cast there just great!!!!".

I like the director is like the 2 part of Herodes Law that was excellent and it was with Damian Alcazar one of my favorite actors Elizabeth Cervantes I haven't see her before  is a surprise she is very good actress and very sexy about the rest of the cast there just great!!!!";

What happened with Benny during his stay in US nobody told us maybe it was good maybe it was not so good suffice it to say that after twenty years they deported the guy back to Mexico. To be again home after so many years had its charm there were the guitars and sombreros and all the good stuff plus Benny had the gringo experience which meant he was able to ride on both worlds. Not exactly as the gringo experience proved kind of confusing in what he found home. His younger brother had been killed and he had to find the authors and take revenge actually killings looked very common the brother's girlfriend Guadelupe by name was making ends meet as a prostitute at Caf Mxico her son was rising up as a loose cannon plus Benny was irresistibly attracted by Guadelupe who was terribly hot no question about. Was that the hell or what? A childhood friend helped him adjust. The hell was rather a paradise provided you were in the gang of Don Reyes. El Infierno was El Paradiso more exactly El Narco that was the definition of paradise being in the narcotic business. All you had to do was to execute the orders of Don Reyes including to kill now and then and you had plenty of money plenty of drinks a big car any women you wanted the order you had them was your choice. Wasn't that splendid? Everybody the mayor the police the priest all the others were under the authority of Don Reyes. Well it was also the rival gang of Don Pancho the two bosses were actually brothers and the war between them had ups and downs sometimes it was hot with mutual killings and disfigurement of victims some other times the war was put on hold. All this was keeping the men in that village very busy. The kids dreamed to enter one of the two gangs as for the women and old men it was another story they weren't living in the paradise rather in limbo and sometimes they were unexpectedly shot for unknown reasons because also the limbo had its rules.And pretty soon Benny found out that the paradise was just a stage to hell nobody could remain in the cards for too long for each one the bell was ringing and the turn was coming to be tortured disfigured then killed. Hell and paradise mocking each other playing a common black farce for what was life other than a black farce? The movie stirred extremely controversial reactions in Mexico for obvious reasons. As the whole movie had not been enough by the end Benny was shown coming to the Mexican Bicentennial celebration and killing everybody from the official tribune Don Reyes surrounded by all authorities of the village. Thus many protested against El Infierno saying it was profoundly unjust and unfair to depict their country as a grotesque caricature. Luis Estrada director writer and producer defended his movie saying that firstly a caricature was just a caricature secondly a caricature was a very legitimate artistic approach like all other legitimate artistic approaches thirdly he agreed that obviously not all Mexican society was made of drug dealers and corrupt politicians while this Mexican society had to be aware about the serious problem of having so much criminality and corruption in their country all these leading to the conclusion that a grotesque caricature was sometimes necessary for its cathartic effect.I'm just wondering how would I react against a movie depicting in this way my own country. Honestly I wouldn't take it easy at all but my reaction against it would prove the power of the message. An artist has the duty to say the truth he believes in with all risks even with the risk of stirring ardent passions against him. Luis Estrada is politically intense and his movies cannot be but politically intense. His extreme sarcasm calls in mind the movies of Berlanga and generally the Spanish and HispanicAmerican movies are often very tough.I would add to all this that the value of a movie cannot stand only in what it speaks to its country it should go beyond and transmit something universal. I think this is the case with El Infierno. It's the drama of returning to your home after many years and realizing that for everybody there you look like an ostrich joke because that's what you are. It's the tragedy of having illusions till you realize that your life is just a black farce. It's a parable saying that our whole world became a hell in all respects.".

There are certainly many realities sampled in this film but it paints with a broad brush over the vastness of a country that for all its defects has provided for millions. I'm truly disappointed with El Infierno's view that in Mexico there is nothing more than drugs violence corruption etc. But there is no view of the fact that there are people with jobs there are people that have a head for business there are so many examples that are clearly cast off. My opinion that this is reminiscent of films from the 30's is in regard to photographic aspects of the film it seems that in Mexico we don't ever plaster any walls and that we can either only live in hovels or haciendas. There is always a fat corrupt politico and only brown skinned children suffer. As a Mexican I am truly offended that for all my efforts of getting up early to go to work and not falling into the category this film assumes is my reality it is truly sad that this type of garbage is out there representing my country.".

Casting is spoton and performances are good especially Ernesto Gmez Cruz as a ridiculously unbelievable Drug Lord with good supporting performances throughout. Estrada has obviously studied contemporary masters and it shows If you look closely you'll see the legacy of Leone Tarantino or Scorsese here.

Setting himself the task of shooting an action movie in one room itself a possible contradiction in terms the constraints ultimately make for a much more satisfying and engrossing experience than his previous overrated breakthrough film  which was too carelessly off the wall and derivative to impress this viewer. As a project Aragami also contrasts strongly with the much more opened out Azumi another personal favourite which replaced the gloomy interiors and philosophising of Aragami with something much more kinetic and light hearted.At heart Aragami is a film about knowing who you are and both Osawa who has since appeared in the less concentrated Sky High and Masaya Kato are excellent in roles which like chamber music leave every flaw in performance likely to be exposed. Obviously written at speed the film's pay off could have been more enlightening but perhaps a touch of obscurity in this sort of thing is a benefit especially at a time when Hollywood genre efforts typically feel obliged to spell everything out but fans won't argue too much and interpretations are easy to make. The wonder of the film is that the director was able to stage and direct two action scenes  one short one more extended  with such gusto and convincing moves given the tight shooting schedule and limitation of the set while still allowing himself time for empathetic set ups during slower moments. It requires the ingenuity and confidence of a Roger Corman to bring this thing off raising such stuff above straighttovideo fodder and Kitamura succeeds magnificently.Ignore those who claim the film is 'too talky' for none of the chat is wasted there's none of the narrative indulgence seen in the recent Sky High for instance the actors have enough presence to carry it off and time spent with them never palls. Over 79 minutes nothing drags and the changing relationship between the samurai and the goblin provide constant interest. The developing duel between the two principals neatly reflects back to the friendly rivalry between Kitamura and his fellow director Tsutsumi which originally initiated the film. If you are tired of bloated Hollywood megabuck productions and want to get back to the basics of purposeful dialogue imaginative stageing and thoughtthrough editing  in short lean popcorn pumping cinema  then this is a film you need to see.".

	schema:headline " A wild ride without ever leaving the room";
	schema:reviewBody "When both Ryuhei Kitamura and Yukihiko Tsutsumi finished their short films for the Jam anthology early their producer gave them something new to try. In the space of one week they were each to produce a film using only two man characters one location and it had to be focused around a fight. This was called the Duel project.Kitamuras film was Aragami. The title meaning fierce deity and the story revolving around a demon who seeks an opponent who can beat him in combat taking a wounded samurai in and healing him so that they can face of in a climatic battle. The story essentially being a simple good versus evil affair was very well done. At times it's hard to tell if one of them is evil or if they both are in fact evil. And there are enough plot twists to keep your attention throughout this whole suspense filled feature.Try as I might I find it almost impossible to find anything to complain about with this film it really is something amazing. It's a very atmospheric film. Kitamura makes excellent use of light to make the temple look suitably dark and mysterious. From flickering candle light to eerie purple light flooding in from the night outside to breath taking lighting that gleams from swords classing in the dark. Aragami is a very beautifully shot film with excellent use of camera angles and not just during the fight scenes. But he made superb use of it to highlight both characters persona throughout.The use of music was also really well done in this film. At times it heats up the action speeding your heartbeat at other times it helps establish a more calm mood. During the final battle the use of sound makes it seem like we are almost on a roller coaster. The protagonists feelings of suspicion at the beginning is not only conveyed through acting but through the music that accompanies his realisations. The use of music is possibly most notable when it helps reinforce the almost friendship that the two of them forge over their drinks and conversation.Both of the main characters were very well acted which for some reason I was surprised at. Perhaps it was the depth of the acting that did it for me. Or how quickly they were able to change the mood and focus of the conversation. At one point the Aragami seems very evil and dark but in a matter of a few words the focus is shifted onto the protagonist making him appear as a cold and heartless monster. This was very well done and very believable. You really get the feeling that the Aragami is bored ancient and somewhat noble.The only problems I can find with this film is that it does have an incredibly slow pace up until the much anticipated climatic battle. Perhaps this was intentional as to make us more desperate to see them tear into each other but I felt it wasn't very well done. For most of the film the two of them are just sitting there talking over drinks and while this is well acted there isn't enough action to excite us until the finale.Kitamura teases us with a little bit of a fight early one but it's not until the end that we finally see one of his trademark epic battles. Which in itself could have been better it wasn't as fast as his other films. Perhaps due to the Anime posing the characters did while the talked to each other during the fight. If they had just tore into each other in a brutal show of skill the film would have been so much better.Some slight issues with the pace of the movie but in all a very well made and entertaining film. And for anyone who has seen Versus you're bound to chuckle a little when you see the ending.8.510".

He tricks a warrior into becoming immortal as well and they fight it out. 1 room two actors many fights. A very cool movie maybe not quite up to par with this director's other work but still fun to watch. The plot is surprisingly well developed but some ideas in the fights are recycled from other films. While the movie starts out slow it actually has a plot that you can understand unlike many Japanese movies that deal with any type of mythology. I guess you could call the movie serious but it has a sense of humor and is just made to be entertaining. If I had to compare it to an American movie I would say... Mortal Kombat without any stupid catch phrases or comic relief. I mean its a barebones story as an excuse to have two sweet characters fight each other. And honestly it was made in a week.".

	schema:headline " Great filmmaking experiment!";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Ryuhei Kitamura now famous thanks to the big success of Versus and Azumi was challenged to make this experimental film in an odd bet with producer Shinya Kawai and fellow filmmaker Yukihiko Tsutsumi. Named the Duel project Kawai challenged the two filmmakers to each create a feature length movie with only two actors battling in one setting and filmed entirely in one week. With those restrictions limiting the development of a film a challenge like that sounds insane but Kitamura succeeds and delivers a film of almost the same caliber as Versus.In Kitamura's film two wounded samurais arrive to a lost temple in the mountains looking for a place to rest. Later one of them awakes fully healed and is welcomed by the only priest in the temple. He introduces himself as Aragami Masaya Kato the God of Battle and informs the samurai Takao Osawa that he healed his wounds but had to kill his companion to do it. His purpose to have a duel to death with the samurai.The movie moves around the showdown not only physical but also philosophical between these two warriors with fluid camerawork that mimics the style of Manga comic books Kitamura keeps the film moving despite being set entirely in the main room of the temple. This stylish use of the camera really is one of the film's strongest points as it makes the set look different even when they never change of room.The characters are very well defined and thanks to a very good developed script they never let the movie fall. Just like the visuals the writing is very similar to those of Manga and one could say that this is exactly how a Manga would look if it were translated frame by frame to screen. While at times the movie drags it is understandable that a lot of effort was put to make it entertaining even when it's only about two people talking and fighting.Masaya Kato gives a powerful performance as Aragami a being beyond man's understanding and with fighting skills perfected through centuries of practice. He really becomes his character and truly makes one belief that he has seen a lot in his life. At the same time Osawa is very good as the samurai confused by all what is happening and whose only desire is to get out of the temple alive. Both actors excel in their performances specially considering the limited freedom they had to work with. In fact it is thanks to their performances that the script makes the the movie work.The visual beauty of the duel between the warriors is another one of the movie's strong points. Kitamura knows very well how to put action on films as fans of Versus will acknowledge. In Aragami he mixes the old with the modern in a stylish surrealist duel that mimics the fight between the two samurais. However if a flaw is to be found is that the use of modern music at times contrasts with the intentions of the film nevertheless it never becomes a real problem.While Aragami is nowhere near what Kitamura accomplished with the outstanding Azumi it still is a very good and different movie that shows the creativity of this director that he is not afraid of taking risks and that in fact like the raging God of Battle he enjoys a good challenge. 710".

I wanted to see the two men fight. But Kitamura kept me waiting for as long as possible until it was almost to much to take.

The movie must take place within one room with 2 competitors fighting to the death.Originally I found out about this movie after watching 2LDK and found out about this challenge. I thought it was an interesting concept and would like to see how some of today's American directors could tackle such a project. Although I liked 2LDK Aragami was simply the better movie. At times the style and dialog or lack of reminded me of something from Quentin Tarantino.The very basic plot is that Aragami Masaya Kato who incidentally is the God of Battle challenges a samurai Takao Osawa to a fight to the death. Aragami is tired of living and can not commit suicide nor die of old age or other natural causes. He must be killed in battle as he is the God of Battle. He immortalizes the samurai by feeding him his deceased friend's liver and the fight was on.Surprisingly this basic plot did not seem to drag on for too long and was just about the right length.

	schema:headline " Interesting but flawed.";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie at the SF Indie Film fest which presented this  Yukihiko Tsutsumi's  2LDK backtoback and the audience got to vote on which was the better of the 2. As  has been noted the directors of both of these films stayed up late one night drinking   Berlin Film fest  dared each other to a duel. The terms of the duel make a film about a  duel involving 2 characters that takes place in one setting and shoot it in 7 days. Unfortunately TsuTsumi had back problems and was unable to attend but Kitamura  was present  introduced the film. He said Tsutsumi had called him a few months after  the pact  asked him how his project was going  took him entirely offguard as he was  working on Ozumi  hadn't done anything. So he wrote Aragami very quickly  used it  as a way to help prepare for Ozumi. The theme is very interesting A samurai runs into  an old temple in the mountains w his buddy  both are near death. One of the  samurai's survives by the help of the temple's resident who is somewhat of a mystery is  he a samurai? priest? doctor?. Without revealing too much of the plot the surviving samurai is led into a duel with him   it becomes clear that defeating the temple's mysterious resident is beyond his  abilitites as a samurai. The plot with the exception of the ending was extremely good   there were some really good moments of rapport between the 2. The film's main theme  of war  a warrior's dutycalling is not new though the way it evolves in this film is quite interesting. Most notable is the way the film shows how homoerotic desireaffection underlies much handtohand combat  i.e. sublimating a desire that is  unspoken by attempting to kill the desired.  However this theme is not as well  developed as the overall theme. As a result the ending feels a bit like a cheap shot a  rather hurried attempt at a clever ending than something that evolves well from the  characters' sparring both verbal  in actual action. Despite this the ending does  present an interesting take on the subject of war  those who are willing to fuel the fire.  Those who really come to these films for the action sequences might be a bit  disappointed as the action sequences in this film are short  comprised of extremely  quick takes though there is an interesting sequence that uses flash images of the  fighting giving it a strobe effect. Other problems I had with the film were the setting lighting  sound. The movie took  place in a rather odd temple w cheesey buddha artifacts. It looked more like more like  Disney Park room if it were created in the 1980s version of a Japanese Temple  complete with dark colored lighting heavy on red  blue. The light  sound affects in  the film rain lightning etc. also gave the film an artificial feel making it look almost  like some of Fassbinder's films i.e. Berlin Alexanderplatz however the distancing affect  it creates on the viewer didn't really seem to add to the film's theme any. The director  did state that he was more influenced by the Hollywood films of the 70s  80s that he  watched while growing up than by martial arts films. Most distracting though was the film's electronica background music which became  very repetitious  annoying at times as it really detracted from the dialogue between  the 2 characters. The heavy metal music at the end perhaps wasn't as out of place as  the electronica given the ending but was also pretty annoying  felt like overkill.  Overall I'd give it a 710....with more time attention  money this one could have been  quite exceptional. But unfortunately the director has quite a lot going on a reissue of  Versus with new scenes Versus 2  Godzilla  so the rushed job that it was really did  seem to affect its quality. I did not get to stay to see who won the duel but judging by how many people were  going to the 2LDK ballot box I think the votes mirror the imdb rating....2LDK is the  winner and that is my feeling too.".

He said Tsutsumi had called him a few months after  the pact  asked him how his project was going  took him entirely offguard as he was  working on Ozumi  hadn't done anything. So he wrote Aragami very quickly  used it  as a way to help prepare for Ozumi. The theme is very interesting A samurai runs into  an old temple in the mountains w his buddy  both are near death. One of the  samurai's survives by the help of the temple's resident who is somewhat of a mystery is  he a samurai? priest? doctor?. Without revealing too much of the plot the surviving samurai is led into a duel with him   it becomes clear that defeating the temple's mysterious resident is beyond his  abilitites as a samurai. The plot with the exception of the ending was extremely good   there were some really good moments of rapport between the 2. The film's main theme  of war  a warrior's dutycalling is not new though the way it evolves in this film is quite interesting. Most notable is the way the film shows how homoerotic desireaffection underlies much handtohand combat  i.e. sublimating a desire that is  unspoken by attempting to kill the desired.  However this theme is not as well  developed as the overall theme. As a result the ending feels a bit like a cheap shot a  rather hurried attempt at a clever ending than something that evolves well from the  characters' sparring both verbal  in actual action. Despite this the ending does  present an interesting take on the subject of war  those who are willing to fuel the fire.  Those who really come to these films for the action sequences might be a bit  disappointed as the action sequences in this film are short  comprised of extremely  quick takes though there is an interesting sequence that uses flash images of the  fighting giving it a strobe effect. Other problems I had with the film were the setting lighting  sound. The movie took  place in a rather odd temple w cheesey buddha artifacts. It looked more like more like  Disney Park room if it were created in the 1980s version of a Japanese Temple  complete with dark colored lighting heavy on red  blue. The light  sound affects in  the film rain lightning etc. also gave the film an artificial feel making it look almost  like some of Fassbinder's films i.e. Berlin Alexanderplatz however the distancing affect  it creates on the viewer didn't really seem to add to the film's theme any. The director  did state that he was more influenced by the Hollywood films of the 70s  80s that he  watched while growing up than by martial arts films. Most distracting though was the film's electronica background music which became  very repetitious  annoying at times as it really detracted from the dialogue between  the 2 characters. The heavy metal music at the end perhaps wasn't as out of place as  the electronica given the ending but was also pretty annoying  felt like overkill.  Overall I'd give it a 710....with more time attention  money this one could have been  quite exceptional. But unfortunately the director has quite a lot going on a reissue of  Versus with new scenes Versus 2  Godzilla  so the rushed job that it was really did  seem to affect its quality. I did not get to stay to see who won the duel but judging by how many people were  going to the 2LDK ballot box I think the votes mirror the imdb rating....2LDK is the  winner and that is my feeling too.";

The dialogue between Takao Osawa the Samurai and Masaya Kato Musashi Miyamoto carried this film as did the brilliantly choreographed sword play. In comparison to Kitamura's previous films Versus and Alive the female role played by Kanae Uotani speaks volumes in her lack of dialogue. Her mystery only adds to the plot leaving much to the imagination. For only one set the temple is quite possibly the most unique characteristic of the entire film. Its almost Gothic flair helps touch on the western andor European influences that play a huge role in this film. I highly recommend Aragami it's unlike any samurai film I've ever seen! 1010!".

I can just see it now these directors and producers discussing this film in a meeting. Subtlety doesn't work for foreigners let's have Oosawa Takao overreact to everything. They like CG let's add an unnecessary space scene to it. They liked VERSUS let's get Tak to appear in the end...Katou Masaya's performance as Aragami was pretty impressive. He seemed to be really into the character and portrayed the mysterious character and its motive very well. Oosawa Takao though I know is a much better actor from other films.This film's action wasn't bad but nothing out of ordinary. It was clearly produced in a rush and little attention to details. The Aragami's speech for example ended sentences with ...Ja in beginning of the movie which is what barbaric men say in Japanese but he practically stopped it altogether in the second half of the movie for no reason. Such abrupt change in speech pattern is a proof of poor production. A nice stab at the Dual Project Challenge but ultimately a good script wasted.".

Two men one a wounded samurai the other a mysterious monk living in a forgotten temple spend their time in conversation waiting for the storm outside to end . Their backgrounds and motives become apparent establishing who are these two men and setting up the scene of confrontation between them. Unlike most other movies this one lacks a clear antagonist the two leads are described as men of honor each with his own different point of view. So when their duel begins it becomes even more effective as it is not just choreography and camera works that makes the battle good but also because both these men are likable. Kitamura's decision to keep the battle for the final part of the film proves to be a correct one as tension builds up between the two leads with each and every revelation setting their motivation for whats coming.Considering that the whole movie took place in just one room the fight scene was pretty impressive with Kitamura demonstrating some very nice camerawork following the swordplay in an almost perfect rhythm. The choreography is also top notch once again proving that Kitamura is able to create memorable and stylish fight scenes without the necessarily needed high budget. Considering that the whole battle took place in just one room. The ending while a bit too similar to that of Versus fits the story's direction nicely with a ironic the hunted becomes the hunter type finale. Aragami is not an over the top highpaced nonstop as Versus instead it relies more on character to set it's tone for the finale. And with just about the right length so that it doesn't begin to drag on too much Ryuhei Kitamura's Aragami is a very enjoyable samurai film.".

I came in with no expectations and I never watched Versus but the concept of this film was very intriguing to me looked it up on IMDb.A severely wounded samurai seeks shelter at a temple which unbeknownst to him is the temple of the demon Aragami who wishes to die in combat via our unwary samurai.The conversation is exactly what you would imagine it to be between a man and a being proclaiming to be supernatural. Skepticism and disbelief is played well in here and the scene is great. This is all shot in one room in a dark slightly tainted sort of Buddhist temple. The fact that this movie was shot in only one week is amazing although if they had spent more time on it it could easily have been better as it is not without its flaws.The slightly creepy serving woman is the only other real character we have on screen and she only has a few words to say at the end. What I really wonder is who she is as perhaps she is Aragami after all and she just enthrallsseduces warriors so she can watch battle after battle? I wish they played that possibility up just a tiny bit more adding perhaps some covetous looks throughout on the samurais side and more coyness seductive possibilities on her part.My only real issues with this film was that it seemed to get a little rushed at the end. The major fight could should have been done better and had slight elements of cheesy stances which were unrelated to the fighting. Also the last warrior the future attacker could have been cooler looking. I did like the fact that our protagonist seemed to be crazy at that point which still stands to reason that the woman is really Aragami after all. Also the electric guitar music at the end seemed out of place. I would have liked a more philosophical ending versus one that makes you think you just finished watching your average action movie.Summary Very entertaining story built upon Chinese really any ethnic background mythology with only 2.5 actors the woman gets a 12 a count since shes more just a visual portion. I just wish 2 weeks was spent on this as it could have been on a whole new level. Either way I'd definitely recommend this.".

It is well done in nearly every aspect including the set acting camera work sound music and of course the swordfight choreography. Even the idea of the whole movie taking place in a temple gives Aragami a certain style.What this movie lacks is substance. Although Aragami is very short nothing really is going on. Mostly there are talks vaguely revealing us what is happening with some philosophy in them and partly fighting. Clearly there are a lot of questions rising throughout the movie about the identity of the characters  who they really are and how they became like this?  or their motives  I still don't understand why did Aragami wanted to die . Maybe there is some substance that I didn't grasp though I doubt it. I just think that the director wanted to make a cool movie.Overall I wasn't much excited about Aragami but I wasn't disappointed too much either.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two wounded samurai fleeing from their enemy end up at a remote temple in the mountains. Two days later one of the samurai Takao Osawa awakes to find out his friend is dead but he's healed. The owner Masaya Kato of the temple invites the warrior to stay the night to have some drinks before leaving. During their discussions it comes clear that the host is not a mere mortal but a powerful demon named Aragami the god of battle and he has been fighting all who enter the temple for centuries. So now begins the challenge for the young samurai.Well the film doesn't have a whole lot to offer really. It felt rather disjointed at times and that's probably because it was made in seven days. It's incredibly slow and fairly padded with a lot of ponderous dialogue and quiet stretches. The plot is really nothing much with it basically about two warriors stashing it out from sharp conversations about themselves or on morals on war and the sizzling sword fights between them eat up the scenery. When it comes to the superbly choreographed battle sequences which are exciting and slickly done you know why you stuck through the thick amount talk and slow beginning to begin with. The climax that it slowly builds up to is well done and in creditably effective. Sound performances are given by Kato and Osawa. The dominating temple is what hits you straight away with a fairly Gothic take with a lot of dark tones and dim lighting within. Also the stylish photography totally stood out but not everything worked out or fitted in perfectly. Some touches involving the script the plot retreading old ground pacing for this type of film especially since it's only 70mins long and soundtrack felt odd but hey that's probably just me? Oh by the way I did enjoy the moments of humour especially the black humour that was evident. It's a fair effort by director Ryuhei Kitamura.Just don't be expecting a fully blown action film but also don't expect anything too meaningful as you will be fully disappointed if so. Although if your looking for something completely different you can't go wrong here. It's a very simple plodded film and nothing more.".

	schema:reviewBody "If truth be told ooh I sound Welsh! I didn't really want Aragami. Now I don't want to offend the film it's just that I'd never heard of it and it came with the film that I was interested in called 2LDK which was knockout by the way! It turns out that Aragami was part of something called the Duel Project where two Japanese directors decided to have a battle making a film using only two main characters in one set shot over one week. It's an extremely interesting premise and one that us Westerner's are used to seeing that Hollywood often shoves exotic locations and several bigbilled names into a film! After reading some hype for Aragami I was genuinely interested in seeing it and seeing which one would win the duel for me.Well as you can gather from my score Aragami was not a patch on 2LDK however that isn't to say that it's a bad film. Aragami is an interesting one but one that I feel is bloated. Aragami's characters weren't as great as 2LDK's. What made 2LDK so compelling was that the characters were interested and you care about the fight despite that fact that neither of them are particularly likable. Even with a character to root for in Aragami I still didn't feel as interested in the characters or the fight. Perhaps this was due to the lengthy and slow dialogue scenes which held the film down especially as we're expecting a fight to the death like the DVD promises. Now 2LDK did also have a lot of dialogue for the first half hour but it was brewing with tension and suspense building up anticipation for the ultimate cat fight.Aragami's dialogue scenes seemed long for the sake of trying to fill up a feature length film. The characters were also pretty stereotypical and aside for a few good moments notably the reveal of Aragami and the picking of the weapons you ultimately just want to jump straight into the duel! Now the duel itself is very enjoyable. The action is shot incredibly fast and is almost Tarantinoesque in Kill Bill. It also felt even more thrilling as it juxtaposed the placid camera movement and few shots that were in the dialogue scenes. However I did feel that the fight in 2LDK was even better being that the weapons were innovative and the characters more interesting.Aragami is basically a sword fight. Although the fantasy element does make the battle more interesting offering us something a little more unique. I also thought that the pitchblack sword fight with only the lightening outside and the clashes of the sword creating light was very creative and visually exciting. The ending was also quite interesting but I did have the feeling of too little too late when the duel did finally commence and I think that it should've made more creative use of its environment like 2LDK did. Additionally I really did not like the music which sounded like the incidental music on TV's 'Gay Rabbit' which I have never looked at shifty eyes.2LDK wins for me but I suppose it's just a matter of taste. If you're into your martial arts then Aragami will be a masterpiece for you. However I think that the film would've made a much pacier short film rather than being stretched to feature length and feeling belated. There simply isn't enough narrative drive or interesting characters to fill 1hr 15mins. However I can think of worse ways to spend your evenings and it really is a masterclass in directing and editing. It doesn't have the replay value of 2LDK but that's not to say that I won't be watching again over the course of my life.".

It's a title that resonates deeply for South Koreans On the night of October 26 1979 shortly before he was assassinated President Park Chunghee was being entertained at dinner by a young singer named Shim Soobong who had made a splash in a college singing contest with a song called Geuddae geusaram  literally That Person Then. Shim reportedly sang that song to Park that fateful night as a result both she and the song became inextricably linked to the Park killing. Hence the movie title Those People Then.One of those people then was of course President Park along with the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency Kim Jaekyu who led the assassins and who personally shot the president and ended up being executed for it. As portrayed in this film KCIA Director Kim is pent up with rage and frustration his liver is shot to hell he feels his country is shot to hell and he's convinced that the president and his chief bodyguard both deserve to be shot to hell as well. The President's Last Bang has been billed as a black comedy some American reviewers have even likened it to Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove which kind of threw me. I would say it's a very wry take on a deadly serious episode of recent Korean history. I suspect much of it comes across as absurd because the reallife events it was based on were so horrifyingly absurd.Deliberately deliciously absurd moments abound like the schoolchildren who refuse to stand still for the playing of the national anthem but maybe some critics saw signs of comedy where none really exist oh those crazy Koreans!. For example one reviewer was highly amused by what he saw as Kim's bungling when he supposedly runs out of bullets at the start of the assassination and must run outside to fetch another gun. Actually Kim has plenty of bullets it's just that his gun jammed. That's not ineptitude just bad luck on his part.Although the main focus of the film is the president and the KCIA director it's also worth noting characters like gumchewing KCIA Chief Agent Ju whose primary job consists of procuring young women for the president's personal entertainment his disgust with the task with the women who agree to be a party to it and with himself is palpable. There's also Mr. Shim the guesthouse caretaker who's as silent as a butler and seemingly privy to everything that's going on. There's the older woman who's seen at the beginning of the film lodging a complaint about the way her daughter was treated by the president during a bedroom date we hear her again at the end of the film offering a sardonic postassassination wrapup shades of CostaGavras' Z. And then there are the two young women brought together for the first time who are destined to witness the assassination closeup afterward they end up lounging around in a side room chatting like college roommates.From my peculiar American point of view one wickedly fun moment is when Park and his top aides chatting over dinner start badmouthing not only the American ambassador to Seoul but also thenU.S. President Jimmy Carter such scenes crackle with a youarethere authenticity. It's also morbidly fascinating to listen to the movie's Park Chunghee rationalize his authoritarian rule by noting that he tolerates a certain degree of political opposition there's a direct reference to Kim Youngsam who was fated to become president himself years later.As for the president's last bang fans of the late President Park may actually admire the way he goes out in this film. He shows no fear he meets his fate as the tough old bird he was reputed to be.A passing note Whenever Korean subtitles appear it's because the characters are speaking in Japanese one of the fringe benefits of Japanese colonial rule being coerced bilingualism.Final thought Could the fracturedEnglish title The President's Last Bang be a deliberate Boratlike joke on the part of a Korean who speaks English all too well?".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who enjoy political conspiracies especially when laced with matteroffact coolness blood pooling on the floors and enough confusion to make things believable The President's Last Bang Geuddae Geusaramdeul is a fine odd movie. Nearly all of the film is the story moreorless factual of the last hours of the repressively authoritarian and corrupt Korean President Park Chunhee and then the maneuvering that followed. President Park who seized power in a military coup in 1961 decides to have another of his increasingly frequent private dining evenings with one or two young girls attended usually by his brutal and sycophantic chief bodyguard his toadying chief secretary and his watchful head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency Kim JaeKyu. Fine food is prepared liquor is poured generously and the girls entertain and prepare themselves for private entertainment later with the president. We realize the KCIA Director Kim is slowly losing favor. The president makes suggestions to him with a smile or a frown. Kim's compatriots take their cue from the president and make slighting references to the work of the KCIA. Repression is the order of the day and the KCIA no pussycat organization as it is is seen by President Park and his sycophants as not being repressive enough. At the same time Director Kim is losing patience with the president's preoccupation with pleasure. Never make a big deal about what goes on below the belly button one highranking official advises. The date is October 26 1979. In the middle of this tipsy unpleasant party Director Kim excuses himself for a moment. He tells two trusted subordinates that tonight is the night. This is something they've thought about. Then he takes a revolver in his hand returns to the party and puts a bullet into the chief bodyguard then into the President. The lights go out and as Kim's men hear the gunfire they shoot down most of the remaining bodyguards. Since his gun jammed Kim takes another gun returns to the party room pulls up the president who is still alive and puts a second bullet into the man's head. Then he casually finishes off the groaning chief bodyguard. As his men restore order Kim tries to gain the Army's support. It doesn't work. The last part of the movie tells us all about how disorderly the highest reaches of government were during the dark early morning hours after the assassination. Then we learn about the fates of Director Kim and his men. All this is presented with such I am a camera directness that the mundane selfinterest the careful protocols of power the casual corruption and pervasive cynicism of government at these high levels almost turns the movie into a black comedy. For those who believe their sausages are made under the most hygienic conditions and who trustingly never read the list of animal parts that make up the meat this movie might seem just as foreign as the country it comes from. Unfortunately no government has captured the market on incompetence venality selfinterest and rearend kissing. At first we begin to sympathize with Kim and then we have to keep remembering the KCIA was just as full of thugs as every other group. Humiliation and beatings were and may still be the common currency to maintain discipline and authority. Kim gradually seems motivated more by resentment and irritation than any particular feelings about democracy. How on earth did some of these people achieve power...and then we realize the same question can be asked about all governments. The movie may be something of an oddity but it's an engrossing one.".

Filmwise the movie is well done idiosyncratic and morbidly humorous. When was the last time regicide made you laugh caused compassion and intrigued? It doesn't matter go and see The President's Last Bang.";

	schema:reviewBody "Wow what a movie I liked all of the conflict between each of the presidents generals and the all of the different aspects of the coup. The two crazy shots where it pans forever throughout the whole household were amazing. I liked how the coup was arbitrarily started by one mans own emotion it seemed to discount the quality of the revolution. All the different rolls needed and played out in the movie were all very interesting. To the planners and to the puppets that are just acting on orders. I also like how the coup isn't pulled off perfectly by anyone's standards from the small problems like the gun failing to the larger problems like the whole coup is an utter failure. The characters are strangely well developed and I was rather sympathetic with the general who they characterized as being crazy.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original translated name of Geuddae geusaramdeul aka The President's Last Bang is apparently 'those people then.' The change made for the English language market unfortunately replaces a title significant to locals as the name of a particular song played that fateful night by a singer invited to entertain the doomed presidential dinner party. The flippancy of the substitution is perhaps one reason why western critics have pointed up the black humour of Im Sangsoo's film so consistently. Formerly best known for light sex dramas such as Chunyudleui jeonyuksiksah aka Girl's Night Out 1998 and Nunmul aka Tears 2000 The President's Last Bang is the second in a trilogy of films dealing with the situation of South Korea from the 1970s to today and has proved to be at least at home the most controversial of Sangsoo's work. Apparently descendants and supporters of the dead president's party took exception to some documentary elements contained within the movie which were duly cut from the initial Korean release as well as for some exports. The UK version is complete. Ironically the director was also attacked by left wingers for creating a toofavourable portrait of a despised dictator. To such an extent as the director attests in the interview which accompanies Last Bang on disc that he was given a personal bodyguard after the premiere.Assuming much of the political background to Im Sangsoo's drama will be relatively new to them UK viewers will find much less to get worked up about and the film contains none of the censorable material which has occupied the BBFC in the films of Korean directors such as say Kim KiDuk. Having said that whether its the presidential bodyguards coming without bullets the KCIA chief dozing with a hole in his sock or the two noodle eaters overhearing the President's autopsy with open mouths there's no denying the elements of black humour in Last Bang even if such moments should not be made too much of. Ultimately it's a political drama we have here the staging of which the director sees as influenced by such mafiagrounded Hollywood titles as Goodfellas and The Godfather. At the same time as the director says it attempts to analyse the psychological burden of the dark years of tyranny as well as provide a funeral for the president and all he left behind. Chauvinistic and fascist the memories of ChinLee's regime still pervade South Korea today. The director was able to base a good deal of his film on the notes of the detailed official enquiry following the incident at the Blue House. For other elements he used his imagination. He and his art director for instance did not hesitate to jettison the idea of an accurate representation of the Blue House as it was in favour of something more aesthetically appealing. From this point of view Last Bang differs in its documentary feel from such related films as Downfall a film where the claustrophobic last days of a regime are also examined. But while President ChinLee is the centre of attention of the Korean film his character and psychology is not explored in depth apart from a revealing discussion over the weaknesses of western notions of democracy. Instead SangSoo focuses a good deal on the KCIA chief and his main agent and one is never quite sure between them where fact ends and director's fancy begins.Therein lies the film's weakness. Its in the lack of a convincing documentary feel allied to characters at the drama's centre who may have been historically present and participant in unfolding events but at best struggle to rise about the whimsical elements of their portraits Ju's compulsive gum chewing for instance. At worst the writing suggests little of the angst such a plot surely engendered  something which the recent Valkyrie managed for instance with all its faults. Last Bang ends with a dispassionate voiceover wrapping up the fate of those involved and some shots of the state funeral. At the end of Downfall although we know or can guess the fate of many we are critically involved learning what became of those present. Last Bang's closing narrative curiously uninformative leaves us mildly disinterested even given our lack of local political knowledge.Having said that Im SangSoo's film is reasonably absorbing throughout and it pulls off some noteworthy moments  such as the Da Palmaesquire ceilinghigh tracking shot which travels slowly above rooms and various corpses. There's another long tracking shot this time a horizontal flow through the Blue House which arguably shows one influence of Goodfellas.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always enjoyed films which are based on historicalpolitical events even though they have a fictional element thrown in to spice things up. Films like Oliver Stone's controversial JFK or Roger Donaldson's Thirteen Days hmm.. both starred Kevin Costner are always in my list as definite must watch. Not that they are accurate but at least they provide some kind of ground work from which you can build your research upon and therefore being able to verify its accuracy somewhat.The first shot of this movie suggested a bang of a different kind. For a short while anyway with its topless scenes. Anyway it was used to suggest the philandering womanizing ways of exSouth Korean President Park Chunhee where agents of South Korea's CIA equivalent KCIA get the unglamorous job of seeking out starlets for the President's company.The movie paints the dictator Park in an unfavorable light. with his corrupt ways and highlights the last day of his life leading to his assassination by KCIA director Kim during a routine dinner. I liked the dinner scene where the table of top government officials  President Park his fat slob of an arrogant chief bodyguard Cha who refuses to carry a weapon scheming Chief Secretary Yang all having opposing views with Kim. They drink and make merry insulting foreign politicians like the Philippines' and the US' heh surely I'd like to listen in on what their opinions of other countries' political leaders are really like.You can read Kim's frustrations with the regime and takes it upon himself to do something before the night is up. Roping in a few good man like Chief Agent Ju and Agent Colonel Min they plot to take severe action that will change the course of their history whether or not they succeed. And that's where the tension and pace starts to pick up with men making splitsecond decisions to make choices and follow their loyalties and where the movie unfolds as a stylish violent and extremely bloody actioner set to cool beats of music.There are a number of scenes which put a smile on my face especially when you realize the similarities amongst various issues. Like when the top brass of the military comes driving into Army HQ in civvies and in a civilian car the lowly guard at the guard house fail to recognize him and start to make things really difficult during identity verification respecting the rank and not the person and for all the wayang in camps there is absolutely insufficient ammo or none at all to load weapons to stage a military arrest. And there are the clueless chao keng small fry agents who are caught up in the entire situation without knowing the big picture as well  isn't this quite typical? Red tape and bureaucracy and the incompetence of most MPs in deciding the next course of action also goes to show how ill prepared the cabinet is when faced with emergencies of such nature. The reliance on one man and the overconfidence that no matter of this nature could happen helped to provide Kim and his men with buying of some time to decide on their own next steps. The sad part being while they know who they must kill they too are illprepared as they have not crystallized plans for the aftermath.The ending's pretty abrupt with narration giving you the lowdowns on what happened to the men involved in the assassination. However the execution pardon the pun and delivery of the movie makes this one heck of a suspenseful tightly paced movie with some comedy sprinkled in to lighten up the gloom. Recommended stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the United States we claim to have a long tradition of free expression which we hold dear or at least insist we do. I say the words we claim because the ability to print Communist propaganda in Minnesota sell gangsta rap in Arkansas and dunk a crucifixes in urine and call it art aren't exactly things that have been blithely accepted by America's moral majority. But while these things have been met with controversy protest and even litigation for the most part we as Americans enjoy a pretty wide birth when it comes to things we're willing to accept in the public square. This is not the case in other more draconian nations. They hate us for our freedom I hear some of you cry. Indeed they're the countries we think about least the Eastern Bloc kleptocracies the South American socialists the ultraconservative caliphates and of course the bulwark remnants of Communism.You wouldn't expect South Korea to be high on that list of freedom hating dystopias. Sure our understanding of the Korean peninsula is largely centered on the 19501953 era but we all know South Korea is the free Korea right? Well in 19611979 South Korea was actually under the leadership of Park ChungLee a former military general turned President for life after a coup d'etat left the country in his power. Within a controversial 18 year reign Park's expansion of emergency powers curbing of constitutional rights and overall gestapoism led to largescale student protests resulting in chaos and bloodshed.It is under those conditions we first meet Korean Central Intelligence Service KCIA Agent Ju Han. Ju is the head of President Park's Song security detail and along with Director Kim Baek doesn't seem to like the libertine political figure too much. They along with Colonel Min Kim plan to assassinate the President at one of his luxurious villas. The entirety of the film takes place within the golden hours before the assassination attempt and twilight hours after the deed. It is at this point the history of the event gets a little hazy. If you're watching The President's Last Bang in the United States you're used to true stories being fudged. But in South Korea the events in the film comes with baggage.The movie itself is menacing and uneasy in it's voyeurism. The feeling evoked by the cinematography is somewhere between bemusement and revulsion it's otherworldly and murky all at once. The camera has a habit of peering out behind fences and tilting and buzzing into the four corners of the room like a spying gadfly. Other times the camera seems to stand at attention squinting up at grimacing generals and bookish bureaucrats. The only person we tend to view at eye level is Agent Ju probably the only person in the group who's heart is in the right place.Of course it's not that clear at first. Agent Ju calmly converses with fellow agents knowing full well he's likely going to kill them. We're thrown right into the action with Ju Colonel Min and Director Kim never really explaining their actions. To those with familiarity on the subject the feeling must have been similar to the gentle wisp of wind that preimpacts a mousetrap. I knowing nothing still tasted the bitter taste of adrenaline pumping through my veins.The cynicism bitterness and inspired bits of gallows humor all work in the film's favor serving a surprisingly literal film that like the event itself leaves you with more questions than answers. With judging eyes primed by President Park's bacchanalian vices we're chained to characters left either dead or disappointed and no one including the audience is wiser for it.It is arguably for that reason the reaction following the film is so polarizing. The Colonel and Director Kim state their reasons for the coup with identical democratic log lines. They along with their targets the President Bodyguard Jung and Chief Secretary Kwun act unilaterally callous and equally despicable. Meanwhile President Park's legacy which includes being Korea's greatest president according to actual Koreans is thrown in the air like a flank steak being fed to pitbulls. The Park family successfully sued the production company for 105000 over the President's portrayal. And before you go saying 105000 is a tiny amount to a studio also consider the Park family includes current president Park GeunHye.The President's Last Bang is quietly and assuredly one of the murkiest political statements ever committed to the screen. While speaking a story that offers little resolution the images on the screen clearly pierces a wound into the psyche of contemporary Korea. Seeing the American DVD release I was not aware until later that the Korean release purposely left blank screen for images deemed offensive. While that technical detail was left out of the American release what's left out of both are 4 minutes of documentary footage of the student demonstrations that revealed Park for a despot.".

I also thought that it was interesting all the different locations they used and the actors and wardrobe. Wow you can see how much work it took to make this film almost every scene was so illustrated it was amazing. One thing I noticed a lot of was the movie jumped a lot from one location to another causing some confusion for myself at times. However I truly enjoyed this film mainly because of the actors. There were so many different actors with different personalities and a little horseplay that went along with the film. The lighting of this film was well done as well I wasn't so much impressed by that but just by the art of each scene that the director showed. If I had to rate this film I would give it a 7. Because of all the work that went into making the film the storyline was good and the actors were great. The camera work was also neat. He used so many different angles and movements. It gave you a lot better quality. This also played into the production quality which was also great. This was a well done film. Props to the Director and his crew.".

It gave you a lot better quality. This also played into the production quality which was also great. This was a well done film. Props to the Director and his crew.";

Not so in The President's Last Bang And on top of all that I watched this story move forward and out of the blue the KICA director is suddenly talking to his subordinates about shooting the president. Did I miss something? He didn't have to twist their arm to get compliance. There was no patriotic sentiment and no premeditation. The script was short and required more development. It was not engaging at all. The other elements in the movie were lost to a weakly constructed story. The dolly shots the billiard closeup the president's palatial rooms all were wasted on me for lack of interest. Given the nature of the politics surrounding these events the director may have had limited access to facts. Nevertheless in the USA these types of stories are embellished enough to keep the viewer interested and at least give the tone of a given event if not the whole truth which is why I don't watch that much of this type of stuff.

The plot is basically that a convict Dotsent escapes from prison and the militia Russian police find the criminal's lookalike a kindergarten teacher. He goes undercover and pretends to be a criminal to help the militia find the where the real convict has hidden a stolen mask. He makes a phony escape from the prison with two others who think he is the real Dotsent. He eventually befriends with them and they become attached but I won't reveal the rest. From my plot review it might seem as a violent movie or something like that but actually it is good for the entire family. The movie is entertaining throughout and if you want to see a comparison with an American equivalent it's like a lot like Seinfeld because it's a situational comedy. If you are a fan of Russian cinematography and haven't seen this one watch it right away because this is a true classic with some of the greatest Russian actors see cast.".

The authorities' plan  only just past the boundary of realism  is to give him a wig and some false tattoos and enlist him to help find the helmet. And this of course leads to all sorts of awkward situations which are played for a deadpan absurdity that sets a great tone. It's also interesting for its view through a comedy lens of the Soviet prison system and criminal life at this time as well as its central Asian setting. Apparently a good amount of actual contemporary underworld slang from the time was included which our hero has to learn like a second language. Through the humor criminals are nonetheless treated as human characters who are wistful at having been divorced from a normal life and family rather than completely villainous reprobates. A very entertaining picture in all with both likable cops and largely likable robbers as its characters. Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having never watched a Hong Sang Su film I did not know what to expect as I tore the cellophane off of this DVD. After having watched this film I am still not sure what to think of it. I was intrigued at first because I like novels and movies about writers and the character Hyo Seob sums up what it is to be a struggling writer who at one point in his career was not only a successful writer but also a university lecturer. However it seems that although he is poor in monetary means he is rich in love. He in fact has two women who love him A 24 year old former coworker and a very attractive married woman. However even with these strings of affection Hyo Seob still loses control and repeatedly gets drunk which leads to not only physical harm but also damages his already stagnate career. The only thing that seems to give Hyo Seob even moderately happy is that the married woman Bo Kyeong has ceased having sexual relations with her husband which gives him sole possession of at least that.Bo Kyeong comes off to be a very unhappy woman. There is no affection between her and her husband and the only glimmers of light in her life centers around Hyo Seob who is quotcheatingquot on her with a young woman 11 years his junior.Dong Wu Bo Kyeong's husband spends most of his time working. He tries to keep a cool facade but a few times in the film his crafted mask breaks. Because he is no longer having sex with his wife Dong Wu looks to prostitutes to fill his desires. While on one trip he has sex with a prostitute and does not use a condom which causes much tension throughout the remainder of the film.The young woman who is dating Hyo Seob in my opinion is the saddest character in the film. She gives all of her love to a man who although a tad affectionate seems to think of her as little more than a vessel for his sexual desires and a proof reader. She works a number of small jobs just to make ends meet. Even doing voices for pornographic cartoons. One of the bleakest moments in the film is when she goes to see Hyo Seob on his birthday and Bo Kyeong is there. This scene ends with Hyo Seob slapping her viciously several times while she continues to state how much she loves him.This is definitely not a light hearted film. It is quite heavy and slow but quite poignant.".

Once again he proves that the simple the approach the better the outcome. I consider myself a Korean film buff to the point where I traveled to Seoul to get a first hand feel of the people and the environment I have seen in so many films. This film though relatively old captures more of what I saw while in Seoul than all the recent hollywoodesque films which companies like CJ entertainment have been churning out. Maybe that's because in part plastic surgery wasn't the inthing in Seoul in 1996. I would love to ask the director how he goes about casting his extras because I just can't figure out how he gets them to behave so naturally in front of the camera. No spoilers here....Go watch the film and enjoy!!".

When I look at the Korean cinema it's sometimes impossible to compare Hong to other directors because his films are like one big diary of an experienced intellectual full of infinite stories to share with the viewers. What makes his films even more special is that Hong likes to stick to a similar flow of storytelling and the overall style each time even if the stories themselves are different from one another.This particular film deals with a reunion of two male friends who haven't seen each other in quite some time. First twenty minutes seem to be unaware of the film's direction but that's not a problem at all with Hong's films. After some time of reminiscing eating and drinking excessively they decide to meet up with their old female acquaintance who one of the guys has not been in contact with since he moved to the States. He soon discovers that she took his abandonment very badly for the reasons he was very well aware of. Through those years apart the woman obviously underwent significant changes in her behavior which become apparent when they both spend the night over at her place.Even though the story often touched on some dramatic moments it was Hong's surprise choice of lightly uplifting classical music that often deflated the sentiment and heaviness of each character and tried to give room to some unintentional humor. The scenery is still all too familiar and pleasantly accommodative to the characters. The delivery from the actors is just as insightful and efficient as the story allows it to be.The length of the film stands at 88 minutes making it Hong's shortest film to date and unfortunately the ending feels abrupt. Now the reason for that might be because the story and the actions chosen by some of the characters lack overall climax and feel somewhat nonlinear but that's just how life is sometimes. The director still has an exceptional eye for capturing such situations even if the finished product has to suffer consequences from an audience that isn't used to his style of storytelling or is expecting a certain closure. I got stranded right in the middle greatly admiring Hong's roaming through hidden emotions and candid sex scenes as well as his love for signifying details but at the same time I felt slightly unmoved and in anticipation for a greater impact with his trademark symbolisms that made his previous films so memorable.".

	schema:reviewBody "I admit I was expecting more after Scorsese's introduction. Still the film captivates the viewers emotions. At times it seems a character study of Hyeongon the paintercollege professor or a neutral view of the object of attraction Seonhwa holds on both male leads. Initially Munho and Hyeongon old friends meet for a drink. Munho has just returned from film school in the United States. Both decide to visit their shared love interest Seonhwa. The movie is intercut with flashbacks and Hyeongon's interactions with his students. Munho and Seonhwa were together until he left for film school. Later she has an affair with Hyeongon. Seonhwa is the unconditional everloving person Munho is the man with deep love but not very sure of himself while Hyeongon is the man who's love is cheap but somehow appreciated. This view of the film might remind some men of the dictum nice guys finish last. Munho and Seonhwa are together. She is raped under odd circumstances by an earlier flame. The film doesn't explain why she decided to go to a motel with him even when he seemed violent and overassertive. I'm not sure if this is common in Korean culture or if female obedience is encouraged or if Seonhwa is simply weakwilled. Later Munho bathes and cleanses her of impurity followed by sexual intercourse and the professing of his true love for her. After he leaves she starts an affair with Hyeongon. While he seems attracted to her he comes off as a selfish character who only thinks of his own needs. In the present while he is married he claims to have no love for his wife. He also engages in an affair with one of his students. Oddly enough Seonhwa holds no ill will towards him reserving her anger for Munho. At their reunion Munho reveals his guilt over abandoning Seonhwa while she berates him for the pain he caused her. All characters feel a sense of loss for what they once had. This is comparable to having coffee with a woman whom you deeply loved several years back but for whom you don't feel anything anymore.".

It is not a sign that this is a bad film or that it's a profoundly brilliant film because really it's neither. What it means to me is that it's from the mind of a filmmaker who is either ahead of the pack or has gone on an entirely different path than the pack from the very beginning.Perhaps it's the feeling of maudlin defeat that filters through this curious experiment in which reminiscence longing and crude egotism clank versus each other with tenderness. Sangsoo has an unobtrusive fragile technique and averts from theatrical accompaniments or dignified monologues. In fact the characters are quite ineloquent. There is a number of scenes of ungainly sex perhaps because of a forlorn lack of communication. Really whether Sangsoo intended the outcome to be this way every viewer will have a different reaction. To me though I was not blown away by the movie I still had a lot of reaction to it ultimately that Sangsoo's elegantly broken storytelling reflects that our reminiscences can bring not much solace.".

I expected it to be full of fantasy driven fight scenes similar to Kung Fu Hustle however what they are is bunch of glorified tales of incidents involving the school's number one tough guy. With that in mind there are about 2 or 3 of actual fights in the whole film but somehow that didn't seem like a bad thing. The acting of two main female characters is surprisingly consistent and not all over the place. Seungbeom Ryu is once again very likable and convincing with his performance. The changes in his character's personality are done rather smoothly for such a film that didn't take itself too seriously.Although set in the 1980's in the end this film succeeded in making me reminisce my high school days the bullies the whimpers and the girls who took your mind off things you thought were very problematic at the time.It was a nice diversion from the sad high school dramas involving rape suicide and betrayal.

This movie isn't set in 21st century. It takes place in 1983 when Korean students were free to where ordinary clothes to school as opposed to uniforms. Therefore the characters will be more oldminded and more conservative than present day Koreans. 2. Korea is an extremely hierarchical society. This was much worse during the 80s than it is now. 3. Back then students weren't respected much as individualsthey still aren't but it's getting a bit better. There were two extremes the model students and the faulty studentsdirect translations and everyone else was just somewhere in between.The hierarchy of high school students goes Kids with rich parentsbecause the parents can give money under the table to teachers or can pay for gangsters to protect their childrenthe good fighterseveryone else including the model studentsThe main fight in the movie is about the place of the King of the high school. The King is basically the school prom kingthe bully of the school. The power of the King stronger was stronger back then because most of the schools were divided in boys and girls schools and the hierarchies were more intense.A few comic factors in the movie have to do with the fact that Koreans like to ignore the truth and make themselvesand the stories they tell seem bigger than the truth. That's why the stories the boys tell each other about the fights are so comically exaggerated. In real life the exaggerations wouldn't be near as great so it's pretty sarcastic for the director to express it that way.The movie's also funny in the fact that the Kings are usually very overly serious about the power they hold. Basically actual kings in real lifeJoongpil equals beerbellied middleaged men who still think they're hot and hold a lot of authority over other peopleHomer Simpson of The Simpsons.I don't know how the Eng subs are because I watched it without any but I can assure you that the subs can't capture what the Korean in this movie feels like. It's hard to translate this movie because most of the language that gives this movie it's spunk is slang used by high schoolers.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly entertaining Corean high school period comedy.";
	schema:reviewBody "Conduct Zero is a Corean high school period comedy. When you stick high school with Corean and focus on boys you're very likely going to see a lot of violence due to the rather violent masculine culture prevalent in Corean boys' high schools in the past. It's important to understand this as the social hierarchy in Corean boys' high schools in the past was largely built around fighting prowess with the best fighter being a sort of king at the high school. In Conduct Zero Joong Pil is the king of his high school. He's also vain slovenly and perhaps a bit stupid played to excellence by Ryu Seung Wan. Fortunately rather than being all fighting and drama like the 70's set Once Upon a Time in High School Conduct Zero is a comedy and a surprisingly entertaining one.As king of his school Joong Pil spends much of his time bullying the other students more annoyingly then maliciously and extorting money out of them via his and his buddy's porn drawings business. The plot begins as Joong Pil encounters the nerdy but confident good girl Choi Min Hee and finds himself instantly smitten. Of course the local tough guy falling for a nice girl only leads to trouble amongst the wolf pack that is high school.One thing that Conduct Zero does surprisingly well is balance its comedy and drama elements. The comedy veers from totally wacky especially in the hyperbolic storytelling of the badassery of Joong Pil and later his rival to amusing characterbased comedy primarily centered on Joong Pil's shenanigans and awkward attempts of courtship. The more dramatic elements appear more towards the climax and while the tone is different the transition is quite smooth. The rest of the well paced running time is filled with enjoyable side characters. In addition to Joong Pil's scheming buddy the cast includes rather goodnatured by guileless nerd as well as the infatuated queen of the girl's school and her posse.The story moves well from one point to the next thanks to a good script. The period elements setting in 1980's Corea aren't obtrusive but they add a certain charm to the film and the art sets and costumes are solid. The acting is very good and the direction manages to keep its focus well appropriately and almost invisibly shifting mood and tone to fit the comic or dramatic aspects of the plot. Not every joke works well though and there is some culturally specific comedy involved including a very amusing music reference to the popular animation Robot Taekwon V. Speaking of which the soundtrack is a blend of period music and a surprisingly catchy sampling of 90's era Corean hippop. It was largely successful although the score wasn't as memorable.All in all Conduct Zero is actually an excellent teenhigh school comedy and while it's rougher and dirtier than the average American entry into the genre its charms are notable and flaws are limited enough to make watching it a surprising treat. Conduct Zero is by no means an end all and be all to the high school comedy but it's a rather solid entry that deserves to be seen. 810.DVD Note I watched the US release distributed by ADV Films which primarily does anime releases as you can tell by the long advertisement when you pop in the DVD. The video transfer is fine but the dubbing like much of the dubbing by companies in this business is not exactly inspiring. Unfortunately the Corean language soundtrack only gets a Dolby 2.0 mix instead of the 5.1 and DTS mixes that are available in its native DVD release. I recommend steering away from the wooden and poorly mixed dubbed track and watching it in its original Corean with subtitles.".

	onyx:emotionText "Conduct Zero is a Corean high school period comedy. When you stick high school with Corean and focus on boys you're very likely going to see a lot of violence due to the rather violent masculine culture prevalent in Corean boys' high schools in the past. It's important to understand this as the social hierarchy in Corean boys' high schools in the past was largely built around fighting prowess with the best fighter being a sort of king at the high school. In Conduct Zero Joong Pil is the king of his high school. He's also vain slovenly and perhaps a bit stupid played to excellence by Ryu Seung Wan. Fortunately rather than being all fighting and drama like the 70's set Once Upon a Time in High School Conduct Zero is a comedy and a surprisingly entertaining one.As king of his school Joong Pil spends much of his time bullying the other students more annoyingly then maliciously and extorting money out of them via his and his buddy's porn drawings business. The plot begins as Joong Pil encounters the nerdy but confident good girl Choi Min Hee and finds himself instantly smitten. Of course the local tough guy falling for a nice girl only leads to trouble amongst the wolf pack that is high school.One thing that Conduct Zero does surprisingly well is balance its comedy and drama elements. The comedy veers from totally wacky especially in the hyperbolic storytelling of the badassery of Joong Pil and later his rival to amusing characterbased comedy primarily centered on Joong Pil's shenanigans and awkward attempts of courtship. The more dramatic elements appear more towards the climax and while the tone is different the transition is quite smooth. The rest of the well paced running time is filled with enjoyable side characters. In addition to Joong Pil's scheming buddy the cast includes rather goodnatured by guileless nerd as well as the infatuated queen of the girl's school and her posse.The story moves well from one point to the next thanks to a good script.

	schema:headline " An enjoyable sports movie about a few women who played this lowprofile sport of handball";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched Forever the Moment on the plane en route to Corea and I have to say it was a good way to pass the long hours. This is a Corean sports movie. Not only a sports movie but a handball movie. And not only a handball movie but a women's handball movie. That's right. A women's team goes for the Olympic glory in handball at the Athens 2004 Olympicsthe story is their rise to their moment in the spotlight.Based on the story of the actual team that went to Athens in 2004 the story focuses specifically on the lives of four older at least as far as athletes go women who by virtue of their prowess and past experience in Olympics settings are recruited into this year's team and their struggles. Each has a different story and the film takes a few minor twists as it goes forward which wouldn't be a surprise to those who know the story of the team.The overall story itself is very much like many sports movies although Forever the Moment seems to take a lot more interest in the personal lives of the four protagonists than their struggles with their various games. Nonetheless the expected losing followed by successive wins sequence still makes an appearance here. I think the strength of the film lies in that it takes time to tell the stories of the four older women in the squad while not entirely neglecting secondary characters and tells the stories with sympathy. When the story came to a close I felt myself caught up in the emotions of the characters not because of the win or the loss but what the win or loss meant to the characters and their personal stories.The direction decidedly goes for the straightforward story and does a great job highlighting the various actors. Peppered into the script are moments of comedy as well as some expected melodrama even as this is based on a true story. One of the support characters however undergoes a change that happens too quickly and without enough merit I think but overall I think the story is well constructed and believable.I was surprised that I enjoyed a movie about a sport that I didn't know existed. Forever the Moment isn't a mindblowing experience but as sports movies go this is a solid contender. Enjoyable. 810.".

Until near the end I never knew where this very interesting plot would unfold. The writing on this show is A.

Kate Burton as her attorney was superb as was Sam Robards who played her lover Dr. Stillman. This movie was a real surprise treat. Guess I'm a new Lifetime fan and I may even start tuning into Glee.

What is most interesting that the movie actually seems unbiased. Often enough the movie chooses side for the audience we are clearly shown who is the good guy to root for and who is the bad guy to loathe and fight against. For once this movie lets both parties literally in a court present their cases. And both stories make sense. At least initially there is precious little that indicates whom to believe. Which is interesting because in real life in real court this must be a common situation. There are two versions both mutually exclusive and you must decide which one is the truth. And in this movie you get to see which one but it is not presented right away so it is an interesting tale to see.It is a good cast even if few of them is famous. But Jenna Elfman do deserve an extra mention because her role could not be easy to do and she pulls it off spectacularly.This movie is much better than expected well worth to rent if you wish to see something else than a fast paced action.

	schema:reviewBody "A film director with writer's block leaves the city of Seoul to finish his script at a Korean seaside resort. An entanglement with two women however reveals his inner confusion and forces him to confront his selfdefeating behavior. Hong Sangsoo's latest Woman on the Beach is a comedy drama about love and the complications that develop in relationships when one partner is less than candid with the other. Like the films of Eric Rohmer Woman on the Beach is simple on the surface yet explores a deeper layer of complexity in human relationships that is insightful and revealing.As the film opens director Joongrae Kim Seungwoo travels to Shinduri Beach on Korea's West Coast hoping to renew his inspiration.

	onyx:emotionText "A film director with writer's block leaves the city of Seoul to finish his script at a Korean seaside resort. An entanglement with two women however reveals his inner confusion and forces him to confront his selfdefeating behavior. Hong Sangsoo's latest Woman on the Beach is a comedy drama about love and the complications that develop in relationships when one partner is less than candid with the other. Like the films of Eric Rohmer Woman on the Beach is simple on the surface yet explores a deeper layer of complexity in human relationships that is insightful and revealing.As the film opens director Joongrae Kim Seungwoo travels to Shinduri Beach on Korea's West Coast hoping to renew his inspiration. He brings along his production designer Changwook Kim Taewoo and Changwook's girl friend Moonsook Ko Hyeongeong a composer of popular songs. It becomes clear almost immediately that Moonsook is enamored with the director and the two soon sneak away from Changwook and find an empty hotel room where they exchange vows of love.

	schema:reviewBody "Where Hong Sangsoo's dramas differ from Eric Rohmer's other than all the ways that come with being Korean not French is notably in the egotism mitigated by irony of having one the main characters in his movies often happen to be a handsome hunky famous director. In this one it's a Director Kim as he's respectfully addressed Kim Joongrae played by Kim Seungwoo who goes to the somewhat sterile environment of the semideserted Shinduri beach resort on Korea's west coast with his production designer Won Changwook Kim Taewoo in hopes of ending a creative block and penning the treatment for his next film. Won brings along a girlfriend composer Kim Moonsook Ko Hyunjoung a former TV star and competition gets blatantly going when Director Kim takes Moonsook aside and frankly says he's interested in her and asks her whether she'd prefer him over the designer given a free choice.The blatancy of Joongrae's authority is underlined by his being older betterlooking physically bigger and strongerlooking and possessed of a deeper voice. In comparison Won's a mild slightly nerdy fellow. But despite that Joongrae's not an outandout winner. He's comically chauvinistic in the way he damns the lady's music with faint praise. And in the time that follows he proves to be neurotic and indecisive stuffing his hands in his jeans and wiggling around on his legs with comic unease. Moonsook's dating men when living in Germany he admits is a turnon for temporary dating but the opposite for a longterm relationship. He has a serious hangup about mating with a woman who's experienced. Like a good Eric Rohmer character he hesitates and they discuss. Moonsook winds up saying that he's wonderful to her as a director but in other ways just a typical Korean man. Hong's stories often refer to sex and show couples in bed but they aren't erotic and characters rarely go all the way. Kim and Moonsook do however begin with some long kisses on the beach that evening.At another point Director Kim has a violent outburst of anger at a restaurant the trio enters because the owners are half asleep when they come in and Changwook gets equally overthetop in anger over the injustice of this and insists Kim must apologize. This seems random except to show that both men have little control over their male egos and tend to flail about while the lady remains cool and composed.In spite of all this Moonsook becomes fascinated with Kim and they spent a night in an empty hotel room but the next day Kim says it's too quiet for him to work and they all leave Shinduri. Two days later Kim's back on his own though and leaves a phone message with Moonsook regretting his indecisiveness. He interviews a woman he runs into who reminds him of Moonsook and takes her up to the same room he was in two nights earlier. Things get complicated when Moonsook herself reappears and has a drunken emotional outburst outside the room. The new woman eventually feels hurt and abandoned too. In the midst of all this there's a cute dog that gets abandoned by a mysterious couple and Director Kim pulls an unused muscle and is temporarily disabled. Lots of snacking and drinking to a drunken state accompanies all these developments. By himself and with his leg semiparalyzed Kim somehow turns out the film treatment. The relationships seem unresolved but Moonsook is by herself at the end leaving Shinduri again in her little car which symbolically gets stuck in the sand and then gets out again so she can drive off on her own free.Woman on the Beach differs from previous Hong films in presenting its few main characters in the relative isolation of this new somewhat drab resort during a cold spring season. The atmosphere is well used and the scenes are vivid. This film of Hong's is perhaps even more inconclusive than most and a bit long but the rhythms of the conversations and the clarity of the blocking and editing arouse one's admiration and this like all Hong's films is original and watchable and will not disappoint his fans  which include the selection committee of the Film Society of Lincoln Center they've been choosing his latest film as one of the NYFF's primary offerings every year for three years in a row. It's also true that Hong's improvisational way of working always results in fluid convincing performances by his actors.".

Hong hits some painful bullseyes. More than most countries Korea is a huge moviedate place and why would a fellow take his sweetheart to a movie that paints such a winceinducing picture of the local men? The filmmaker punches holes in the male ego and though his little stabs apply to all men across the board they're also very specifically aimed at Korean men. If only every country had such a razorsharp dissector of the inadequacies of the male half  I shudder to think. His genius is that his male failures are usually artists of some kind in the new one for the third time in a row a film director  a selfdepreciating touch whereas say Bruno Dumont's male losers are inbred country thug types who don't surprise much when they choose to act uncivil. Hong completely demolishes the notion of the sensitive intelligent elevated artist type. In the end like everyone else they're out to get laid. Hong's women rarely emerge unscathed either but they're usually smarter and more grounded than the men. Their fatal flaw is their passivity. Hong gets criticism for this by feminists but in Korea the kind of scenarios he presents on film  brutish fella weakwilled gal  is a common occurrence. The women in the director's films know the men they shack up with are clowns but for some reason  is it that they don't expect anything more? or that they're attached to the idea of the sensitive intelligent elevated artist type so strongly that they succumb to it despite being confronted with the brutal truth?  they almost always end up folding. Beach is Hong's finest illustration of the second possibility  that the idea holds power though the truth inevitably disappoints. The woman of the title Moonsook mentions a few times in the film how much she admires Joongrae as a film director with the unspoken indicator that he doesn't measure up as a man. Unlike most of Hong's women though Moonsook has the strength to disentangle herself from a relationship that's bound to go nowhere Hong's women generally prefer to wallow in their martyr complex. Joongrae the film director is stunned when during a latenight soju session Moonsuk says she seriously dated two or three men while living for a few years in Germany. He continues to be fixated on this idea throughout the film bursting out in front of Moonsook once or twice I can't believe you slept with foreigners! Hong's men are stuck in an adolescent state and though they may be able to pull a fair approximation of adult behavior while sober soju brings it all crashing down. Woman on the Beach has been called Hong's most accessible film and that's probably true. Though it contains a couple of his priceless sojudrunk scenes it's his first without at least one painfully awkward sexual encounter. A concession to mainstream tastes? Or did Hong unlike Tsai Mingliang and Bruno Dumont this year feel that it had just been overdone that he simply had nothing to add to his gallery of such scenes? The lead actress Go Hyeongeong supposedly voiced some trepidation when signing for the film at the thought of taking her clothes off  it's almost a requirement in a Hong film. Did he simply decide to respect her wishes? Hong's painful bedroom scenes are always memorable but this film loses nothing from their exclusion. More accessible it may be but it's not a sellout. The invention the accumulation of brilliant little details and the cutting portraits of people in their folly is still there  and I haven't even mentioned the second woman yet or I'd go on all day  and Hong Sangsoo is still one of the sharpest and very best filmmakers working today.".

The director is kind of a jerk and the girl is immediately attracted to him  either that or she is so bothered by the meek guy that she just wants to spurn him. Later on she discovers that the director's jerkiness is a pretty clear character trait. Well duh. Much as I remember from Woman Is the Future of Man Hong's major insight seems to be that men particularly film directors are jerks and that women like jerks but also think they can change them. It's a pretty trite observation really and in the end kind of hateful toward both sexes. It doesn't help that the woman becomes a completely jealous shrew.

	schema:reviewBody "I confess to not having seen any of this director's films but on the basis of this I probably won't bother. This is the story of a writerdirector with writers block who basically treats women like garbage so he can find his muse and regain his creativity. Actually he treats just about everyone in this film like garbage.I guess it is hero worship because I couldn't understand why these seemingly intelligent women would fall for this fairly obnoxious boorish individual. Set on a resort beach in Korea seemingly out of season there is very little to do so the lead character becomes mean to everyone around him. Perhaps the maker of this film felt the point was that there are two kinds of people those who give and those who take. The two women the lead character spends time with are pathetic. I had high hopes for the character Moonsook who in the beginning showed promise. She should have been a stronger character. The director keeps calling her very prettybeautiful see is pretty but not beautiful but then he treats her like dirt calling her stupid twice. He gives writers a bad name. If the filmmaker's idea was to assuage some guilt he himself has fine. He should have made a better film. This film is full of forced vacuous dialog. I know I'll probably be in the minority on the opinion on this film but I am a big Asian film fan and this one left me cold. Many times I pondered leaving the theater. In the audience of about 20 people there were maybe three chuckles from the dialog. I'd like to see the actress who plays Moonsook in another role. She probably is a good actress but her character is useless. I shook my head a little at the people who were waiting in line for the next showing. If you're a fan of this filmmaker maybe you're used to his kind of storytelling. I wanted to like it and the reviews were mostly favorable. Mine isn't regrettably.".

	onyx:emotionText "I confess to not having seen any of this director's films but on the basis of this I probably won't bother. This is the story of a writerdirector with writers block who basically treats women like garbage so he can find his muse and regain his creativity. Actually he treats just about everyone in this film like garbage.I guess it is hero worship because I couldn't understand why these seemingly intelligent women would fall for this fairly obnoxious boorish individual. Set on a resort beach in Korea seemingly out of season there is very little to do so the lead character becomes mean to everyone around him. Perhaps the maker of this film felt the point was that there are two kinds of people those who give and those who take. The two women the lead character spends time with are pathetic. I had high hopes for the character Moonsook who in the beginning showed promise. She should have been a stronger character.

	schema:reviewBody "It has been said that in America sex is an obsession while in Europe it is a fact. If the characters in SangSoo Hong's Woman on the Beach are representative it is also an obsession in Korea.In the film the male lead film director JungRae Kim has affairs with two women MoonSook and SunHee during a spring weekend at a seafront resort. Late in the film when the two women meet for lunch they ask each other about their deepest fears. One says it is obsession for the other it is betrayal. These two themes embedded within the overriding question of whether life is truly better in the new affluent Korea dominate the 2 hours and 7 minute version of the movie that was shown at the Philadelphia Film Festival.According to IMDb the American version is only 1 hour and 40 minutes and indeed for American tastes much could have been shortened. For example the scene in which one of MoonSook sees Director Kim with the other woman SunHee through the resort's picture window that overlooks the sea. She gets into her car parked beneath the window starts the engine and for an interminable minute we watch the car sitting there with the engine running. Finally she turns off the engine and walks away. Powerful stuff? Well not for this American moviegoer.Indeed Director Hong beats the viewer over the head with symbolism to make sure no one misses his points. A white dog abandoned by the side of the road represents the betrayal that all the key players show toward one another. A bicyclist left choking on the dust of a passing car is just one reminder that the new Korea is not always better than the old. But when it comes to showing obsessions Hong outdoes himself. In one scene Director Kim draws a triangle on a napkin to graphically display the three images of his former wife's affair with a friend that obsess him. Only now he has something new to obsess over for MoonSook admits she had two or three sexual encounters with foreigners when she lived in Germany. Were their dicks bigger than mine he wonders. New dots on the napkin to obsess over! Ah he must have new affairs to create new images in his mind so that he can replace the old triangles of obsession with new dots that create a more hopeful shape. Why doesn't he just see a therapist we ask.Hong is a talented director and the film gives Western audiences a feel for Korean obsessions and angsts. For that it's worth seeing but after sitting through 127 minutes of beachfront betrayal and recriminations by people who are not really that likablekind of the Korean equivalent of the selfobsessed New Yorkers in Squid and the Whale I'm not quite ready to see Hong's earlier works such as The Day a Pig Fell into the Well.".

He asks his friend and coworker to drive him down to the coastal city of Shinduri. Unfortunately his friend ChangWook already has plans for the eveningwhich includes a special date with a girl. The director JungRae insists anyways and finally ChangWook agrees if he can bring his girlfriend MoonSook. JungRae says that is fine and they agree to go all together. Later that day when the director is picked up by Chang Wook he is introduced to his girlfriend who happens to be a big fan of his work. Once they arrive in Shinduri the director and MoonSook become better acquainted and quickly become more attracted to each other. Moon Sook tries to clarify to the director that she is only friends with ChangWook.MoonSook and the director soon find themselves sneaking out together at night and end up sleeping together at another hotel. The next day the director seems more uptight and makes it known that he is going back to Seoul because the beach town is too empty. He tells MoonSook that he needs some time to clear things out in his mind. The director soon returns back to Shinduri and calls MoonSook repeatedly on her cellphone. Even though she doesn't answer the phone JungRae leaves a message asking her to come back to Shinduri to see him. Soon after the phone call the director comes across another lady near the beach that he believes resembles MoonSook. While they become more involved Moon Sook has now returned to Shinduri and the conflict of the main characters begin.Woman On The Beach presents a theme about the manipulation of women to suits one purpose.In this moviethe writerdirector Joongrae does it by getting involved with Moonsook and Sunhee through a onenight stand so as to regain his creativity and productivity in his work.It was sad that the film presents the viewer that women can be treated like garbage to regain one's vitality.That is what makes it look bad.Aside from thatthe women involved are somewhat presented having their own writer's block as well as they themselves are amidst in their own confusion Joongrae took advantage to make them his tools for his new screenplay.In the case of Moonsookshe has yet to define clearly what her feelings are for the guy that she is currently involved with and the director that she is sleeping with.As for Sunheeshe too is also in a state of confusion in terms of her relationship with soontobe ex husband and the director that she is also sleeping with.Overallit just sad that this characterdriven plot has full of inconsistencies in terms of character with all the three  Joongrae Moonsook and Sunhee involved as all them are sort of in a state of confusion that the viewer will ultimately realize that one may tend not to fully appreciate this film.And worse of allthe movie ends without a closure among all three except for the fact that Joongrae did succeed in his objective in writing a good script and he is truly proud what he has accomplished as well as what he has accomplished with his involvement with the two women in the beach.This is found in the end when he gave a call to Moon sook telling her about his new script and suggesting to look for somebody he resembles to sleep with just like he did.

	schema:reviewBody "I've never done anything violent to anybody just the minimum that was necessary. No fear no pain they just go to sleep.  But after it's done there's no going back no second chance if I made a mistake I'll pay for it.The Minus Man is a very special film.  It doesn't rely on sleuthing and big chases to find the truth. It doesn't have big car chases and women being chased through hallways or down dark streets.  What it DOES do is show how subtlety can be more deeply disturbing and effective in telling a story about a serial killer that enters a small town and changes the lives of those who are drawn to him.You don't always choose WHAT you do sometimes what you do chooses YOU. That's where discipline comes in.  Vann Owen Wilson speaks lines such as that one throughout the story and in many ways they help you understand him yet not completely and what may hinder his actions.  He's likeable quiet and seems to be what people want or perceive him to be their friend tenant and coworker. Vann just happens to start breaking his personal rules and poisoning people nearby and things start getting complicated.  But we like Vann we have affections for him we know what he's doing is wrong but we want him to be alright.His landlords Doug Brian Cox cinema's original Hannibal Lecter and Jane Mercedes Ruehl have their own skeletons in the closet and it seems that everyone ELSE'S problems are what could mess up Vann's quiet killing spree.Owen Wilson handles his role with such ease eating his Clark bars and having discussions with imaginary detectives played by Dwight Yoakam and Dennis Haysbert.  These scenes show an extension of Vann's psyche and actually keeps him in check maintaining his sanity really. Janeane Garofalo is surprisingly affecting and quite serious as the coworker with a crush on Vann. A major surprise is the wonderful performance of Laurie played by singer Sheryl Crow.  It's nice to see such a beautifully crafted psychological thriller where we as the audience are part of the atmosphere around Vann seeing more than anyone else yet not completely let in on his reasoning.  I didn't find this method elusive rather it was giving us the chance to witness a portion of time in a town what happened there and then Vann moves on leaving us to wonder what his next chapter will be.  The great thing is that you will never be bored by thisall the conversations the thoughts in his head the killings we get to absorb them into our minds and figure it all out for ourselves.The Minus Man is a subtle and brilliant film from Hampton Fancher.  A very human story that doesn't need buckets of blood and people chasing everyone around.  It leaves many things throughout to help you gather your own clues and interpretations and is guaranteed to have you discussing it long after it's over. I am very happy to have this DVD in my collection and most stores don't stock a title like this because it's not top hits fare...do yourself a favor and seek this one out it makes a nice companion piece to Egoyan's film Felicia's Journey.If one thing left an impression on me to this day it's the headline on a newspaper Vann was reading in a diner Boy Trapped Inside Travelling Exhibit...a rather nice metaphore on Vann's situation I think....no? Well we could talk about it for HOURS..........".

	onyx:emotionText "I've never done anything violent to anybody just the minimum that was necessary. No fear no pain they just go to sleep.  But after it's done there's no going back no second chance if I made a mistake I'll pay for it.The Minus Man is a very special film.  It doesn't rely on sleuthing and big chases to find the truth. It doesn't have big car chases and women being chased through hallways or down dark streets.  What it DOES do is show how subtlety can be more deeply disturbing and effective in telling a story about a serial killer that enters a small town and changes the lives of those who are drawn to him.You don't always choose WHAT you do sometimes what you do chooses YOU. That's where discipline comes in.  Vann Owen Wilson speaks lines such as that one throughout the story and in many ways they help you understand him yet not completely and what may hinder his actions.  He's likeable quiet and seems to be what people want or perceive him to be their friend tenant and coworker.

	schema:reviewBody "An unassuming charismatic personality and a bottle of poison prove to be a lethal combination in The Minus Man' directed by Hampton Fancher and starring Owen Wilson.  When a personable young man drifts in from the Pacific Northwest and settles in a small coastal town a number of people's lives are soon changed forever and not for the better.  Vann Siegert Wilson is a likable fellow with a winning smile and always a credible story regarding who he is where he's been and where he's going he's also a psychotic killer who chooses his victims seemingly at random yet is so ingratiating that he never falls under suspicion.  And such is the case when he rents a room from an unsuspecting couple Jane and Doug Durwin Mercedes Ruehl and Brian Cox.  Without realizing of course that he's enabling a murderer Doug helps Vann find gainful employment allowing him to establish himself within the community and the rest as they say is history.  In one of the more telling scenes in the film Vann reflects to himself If it weren't for me these people would all be doing something else today...' What they are doing in fact is searching for one of their own who has gone missing courtesy of Vann. What is so distressing about this movie is the lack of menace outwardly presented by someone so intrinsically evil like Norman Bates in Psycho' Vann is simply too unprepossessing and benign to be considered a threat to anyone.  The contrast between his countenance and his crimes is chilling and the fact that he perpetrates his deeds in such a matteroffact unemotional manner gives new meaning to the phrase cold blooded killer.' One of the interesting aspects of the film is that Vann acts as narrator as well which effectively puts the audience inside the mind behind the madness even more so than in Silence of the Lambs' because in this case the viewer is privy to the actual thought process that precipitates the crimes.  And it becomes a bit unnerving after some reflection upon what is actually transpiring under the guise of normalcy.' Owen Wilson is well cast and gives a stunningly credible performance as Vann he conveys such a lowkeyed eyeinthecenterofthestorm manner that he is instantly recognizable as the boy next door you'd be more than happy for your daughter to date.  And after watching him in action it becomes truly disconcerting to consider that in the real world there are those who look and act like Vann and are capable of such heinous acts of violence and deceit.  As the couple who takes Vann in and are subsequently taken in by him Ruehl and Cox capture the essence of the everymanwoman' that can be found in any neighborhood in any town and the fact that they are people with whom it is so easy to identify makes it even more upsetting when you realize that the vulnerability to which we are all prone can be exploited with such facility. In a supporting role Janeane Garofalo is a welcome presence as Ferrin a coworker of Vann's who is drawn in by his winsome facade and rounding out the supporting cast are Sheryl Crowe CasparLaurie Dwight Yoakam Blair Dennis Haysbert Graves and Alex Warren State Trooper.  Ultimately The Minus Man' is a cautionary tale that may spark a touch of paranoia in the viewer and with good reason and after spending some time with Vann it just may alter your perception of some of your more casual acquaintances and even some old friends especially those who seem so ordinary.'  It's a film that kind of sneaks up on you and takes you by surprise and it may leave you pondering the darker side of human nature.  I rate this one 710.".

It shows them in various locations and at each place they're involved in animated discussion about various aspects of the film.  Then suddenly the sun is rising and the couple discovers they've been talking all night.  When the woman realizes the hour she takes off in a mad rush.  She is late for work.  When she arrives she finds a couple of people floating face down in a pool.  They are dead.  She is a lifeguard. The tag line for the trailer says something along the lines of The Minus Man it'll have you talking for hours.  It's a clever trailer for an even more clever movie!!Holy Hampton Fancher!  This guy is amazing.  He wrote the screenplay from a book by the same title.  The script is so incredibly well written that it really DOES leave you talking for hours.  Each character is so dimensional you could eat them like a multilayered subway sandwich.Owen Wilson does an amazing job playing the likeable Vann.  So amazing in fact that not only does he manage to melt everyone's heart in the town the audience falls in love with him too.  That characteristic is key in creating a believable and deeply dimensional disturbing character.Brian Cox is also amazing as the masochistic fatherly landlord.Janeane Garafalo breaks out of her I'm so unamused role to play a fairly carefree almost naive small town girl.Some people have commented that this film moves too slowly.  In making it Hampton Fancher said he wanted it to move like a lullaby.  Well that it does.  And it is as sweetly sung a lullaby as I've ever heard.  I cuddled up into my theatre seat and sat back and enjoyed every minute of it.I could go on and on for hours and hours about the complexity and implications of this movie  but I won't so you can go and enjoy it yourself!

	schema:headline " never a sting";
	schema:reviewBody "Just a health warning from the start you might find that if you're depressive this film does generate a desire for suicide.What we have here is something to challenge your most basic social assumptions. Yes even yours my countercultural amigo. We have a charming serial killer Vann Siegert played by Owen Wilson we have a killing spree across anonymous sunlit rural America. Anyone thinking American Perfekt? Well what we have here is a bit more special than even that great movie.Here we have a gentle blondhaired murderer whose weapon of choice is a poisoned flask of amaretto what better way to die?. He's so nice that when he sees an upturned rubbish bin at a layby on the highway he rights it and puts the rubbish back in. Because of his sweet character we are left to wonder at the motive for his murders and it is not contradictory as some have suggested. Vann really believes he's being charitable.The first good deed of Vann we see is him putting a hardup depressed junkie out of her misery quietly and calmly without pain. 'Well done' we're led to think for correcting this error for subtracting this subtraction for this analgesic act. This complicity leads us into unease as his next victim is the local football star who we are told can get into any college he wants to and is all set on joining the FBI afterwards. Zounds! Eftsoon we are lead to wonder what sort of life we are leading. Where even success is failure in the mental calculus of Vann Siegert. Indeed what fool would suspect that footballcollegefbihappiness? Perhaps some of you gin veterans some of you workaday grunts and I am one too  sigh are nodding in agreement? This killer seems less of a Satan and more of an Evening Star. Here we have insight from the slacker culture Vann tells us that his job running mail is the best he's ever had something he could imagine doing forever. Why do we spend our waking hours consumed by greed and striving for status? This killer with argent veins with his reaving net a new Jesus? His message to live life with never a sting.It will take giant nerves from you raving teens to carry on sympathising after he murders a stressed working man after an incredibly brief encounter at a diner. He seems to become more reckless as the movie carries on. It has been suggested that Vann Siegert 'is merely a reflection of what those who encounter him want him to be'. Indeed when Vann takes a room with Doug and Jane Brian Cox and Mercedes Ruehl he quite creepily takes over the role of their absent daughter whom they pine for. And whilst certainly most of us have the socalled Freudian deathwish it would certainly be a stretch to suggest that Vann is acting with any sort of moral authority in fulfilling it for us. Common sense suggests that if you found out someone you knew had murdered the local football hero to save him having to suffer his perfect life you would give them a damned good kicking. 'The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions' is the tagline from American Perfekt but would serve well for this movie. It's quite an unnerving film because of how submissive Owen Wilson's portrayal of this character is. Something we're not used to seeing on screen. Brian Cox's masochistic portrayal of Doug is also unsettling.Have yourself an arts evening The Minus Man will keep you discussing sophomoric philosophy long in to the night as the theatrical trailer promised. It suggests to me the old dichotomy between ancient and modern philosophy those great Romans believed that one must have a reason to live and failing that drink a bitter draught. These days living is default and we must have a reason to die. Perhaps that's how our absurd culture manages to perpetuate itself.I can't claim to have The Minus Man all squared in my head. Wherefore the mysterious fainting of Siegert who murdered Jane and why the extent to which Siegert may be manipulated by supernatural forces or perverse destiny. What the hell was going on between Ferrin and Vann? Of course this suggests that the film will reward multiple viewings.Perhaps the best reason to watch the film for all you bloods out there is that Mercedes Ruehl in this movie is most eminently fable. Real wet dream material.In case you are nauseated by my dizzying verbosity consider how many of the instances of it in this review are anagrams of Vann Siegert. Something to ponder my friends. Especially as Vann in not in any encyclopedia of first names. I would suggest that 'never a sting' may be an intentional anagram.".

Well what we have here is a bit more special than even that great movie.Here we have a gentle blondhaired murderer whose weapon of choice is a poisoned flask of amaretto what better way to die?. He's so nice that when he sees an upturned rubbish bin at a layby on the highway he rights it and puts the rubbish back in. Because of his sweet character we are left to wonder at the motive for his murders and it is not contradictory as some have suggested. Vann really believes he's being charitable.The first good deed of Vann we see is him putting a hardup depressed junkie out of her misery quietly and calmly without pain. 'Well done' we're led to think for correcting this error for subtracting this subtraction for this analgesic act. This complicity leads us into unease as his next victim is the local football star who we are told can get into any college he wants to and is all set on joining the FBI afterwards. Zounds! Eftsoon we are lead to wonder what sort of life we are leading. Where even success is failure in the mental calculus of Vann Siegert. Indeed what fool would suspect that footballcollegefbihappiness? Perhaps some of you gin veterans some of you workaday grunts and I am one too  sigh are nodding in agreement? This killer seems less of a Satan and more of an Evening Star. Here we have insight from the slacker culture Vann tells us that his job running mail is the best he's ever had something he could imagine doing forever. Why do we spend our waking hours consumed by greed and striving for status? This killer with argent veins with his reaving net a new Jesus? His message to live life with never a sting.It will take giant nerves from you raving teens to carry on sympathising after he murders a stressed working man after an incredibly brief encounter at a diner. He seems to become more reckless as the movie carries on. It has been suggested that Vann Siegert 'is merely a reflection of what those who encounter him want him to be'. Indeed when Vann takes a room with Doug and Jane Brian Cox and Mercedes Ruehl he quite creepily takes over the role of their absent daughter whom they pine for. And whilst certainly most of us have the socalled Freudian deathwish it would certainly be a stretch to suggest that Vann is acting with any sort of moral authority in fulfilling it for us. Common sense suggests that if you found out someone you knew had murdered the local football hero to save him having to suffer his perfect life you would give them a damned good kicking. 'The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions' is the tagline from American Perfekt but would serve well for this movie. It's quite an unnerving film because of how submissive Owen Wilson's portrayal of this character is. Something we're not used to seeing on screen. Brian Cox's masochistic portrayal of Doug is also unsettling.Have yourself an arts evening The Minus Man will keep you discussing sophomoric philosophy long in to the night as the theatrical trailer promised. It suggests to me the old dichotomy between ancient and modern philosophy those great Romans believed that one must have a reason to live and failing that drink a bitter draught. These days living is default and we must have a reason to die. Perhaps that's how our absurd culture manages to perpetuate itself.I can't claim to have The Minus Man all squared in my head. Wherefore the mysterious fainting of Siegert who murdered Jane and why the extent to which Siegert may be manipulated by supernatural forces or perverse destiny. What the hell was going on between Ferrin and Vann? Of course this suggests that the film will reward multiple viewings.Perhaps the best reason to watch the film for all you bloods out there is that Mercedes Ruehl in this movie is most eminently fable. Real wet dream material.In case you are nauseated by my dizzying verbosity consider how many of the instances of it in this review are anagrams of Vann Siegert. Something to ponder my friends. Especially as Vann in not in any encyclopedia of first names. I would suggest that 'never a sting' may be an intentional anagram.";

It is useless to explain what happens and why as this is not a movie which wants to explain anything.The story is seen from the perspective of a mass murderer. Something is terribly wrong with this meek likable young man. He sometimes faints has regular and recurring visions suffers from a split personality  and likes to kill people. You are never sure if what he perceives is reality or figments of his imagination. Most people he meets act at times very strange and unnatural even the way he sees objects is often very unsettling the big diamond shaped glass pane in the entrance door of his adoptive parents is one of the scariest things for me in this movie.What to me seemed unique in Minus Man is the way the disturbed man deals with the fact that something is wrong He just seems to integrate everything into his everyday routine. Even the recurring dreams of Kafkaesque interrogations by a racially mixed team of some kind of investigators are faced with a cool detached demeanour. In a strange scary way the man seems to have found peace with himself and his condition. Others will have to pay with their lives.The Minus Man boasts an ensemble cast that is simply awesome. For some reason the female parts made a particularly deep impression on me especially Mercedes Ruehl as the adoptive mother and Alex Warren as the supernatural state trooper. Janeane Garofalo is really cute and easily the most uplifting character of the movie. Watch her bungalow  it seems to come right out of a children's book of fairy stories.".

Owen Wilson's laconic demeanor and syrupy drawl effectively paint a compelling picture of a desperately disconnected but amiable loner. His eternally forlorn expressions are matched by an insistently melancholic soundtrack creating a tone that's unusually restrained and subdued for a genre that normally revels in overblown melodramatic spectacle. With so much technology today meticulously and cavalierly contriving obscenely graphic hyper real vistas of nightmarish hell it's actually refreshing to encounter a film that relies almost exclusively on the power of suggestion to implant deep within our psyches its special horror.

This movie isn't for everyone...people who want a serial killer with panache or style should go see a movie like Silence of the Lambs. This is a very different film which disturbs you without a drop of blood...a talent that is even more difficult than it sounds.Owen Wilson plays Vann Siegert an amiable drifter who kills an asthmatic junkie at the beginning of the film in a nonviolent way. He then settles into a quiet West Coast community befriending a moderately dysfunctional older couple Brian CoxMercedes Ruehle getting a job at the local post office and also befriending a lonely coworker Janeane Garafolo.The performances are all above average at least and a few of the actors simply stand out. I'm a big Ruehle fan ever since Married to the Mob and she didn't really get the chance to shine here but Garafolo really came through in a supporting role. Dwight Yoakum and Dennis Haysbert are great as cops I won't say more who question Wilson and there are several other key performances.It is Wilson however who steals the show. Owen Wilson is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. He's made me laugh more than any American actor in recent memory Bottle Rocket and Zoolander immediately spring to mind but he really took his acting up a notch here perfectly capturing the ambiguity of this character. He's likeable and disturbing all at once a mystery all the way to the end of the film because Wilson never gives anything away. This is his best performance without a doubt.The movie is disturbing because Vann is an everyman a nice enough guy who can't really stop killing. The random methodical nature of what happens throughout the film chills not to mention his weapon of choice.Some of the comments I've seen complain that the movie is lacking in terms of dialogue or ingenuity but I generally loathe movies that try to understand a tormented or sick mind. This isn't to say that some or most serial killers aren't sick fks but a movie like this...where the killer is a boynextdoor type...hits home really hard. I don't think this movie is attempting to be clever I think it's genius lies in the feel it conveys and how it captures the rhythms of everyday life and how easy it is for a killer to weave his way into that life.The movie brings home not only how easy it is for someone to kill but how anonymous our nuclearfamily structured society really is. We know no one and safety is only in our imaginations. Unlike American Psycho or One Hour Photo this movie is a whisper instead of a shout but a whisper that is delivered effectively. I give this one a 910 and recommend it to anyone who wants to be scared subtly by the ordinary and familiar.".

	schema:headline " The Minus Man adds up to something good";
	schema:reviewBody "The tag line for this flick's dated trailer reads when he's around nothing quite adds up. That maybe so. For me though The Minus Man as a September 1999 release adds up to something mighty special. It's underrated. In fact it's so underrated that hardly anyone in the free world bothered to see it it played on about 45 screens total. I hope my enthusiastic review might stir up a small cult following. After all any movie this good deserves a little resurrection.Directed by the guy who scripted the futuristic Blade Runner and possessing daydreaming sequences that involve two philosophical detectives The Minus Man follows the journey of low key serial killer Vann with 2 n's Siegert. Owen Wilson plays Siegert and at the time he took this serious role in between comedic stints like The Cable Guy 1996 and his big hit Wedding Crashers 2005. I gotta admit his performance is pretty impressive. He comes off as a relaxed laid back psychopath. His character seems to be nonchalant carefree and having the equivalency of a resting heart rate in the mid 30's just a little movie speculation.He's a drifter who according to the proceedings lost his father doesn't owe anyone any money and wants to I guess end people's lives because of their suffering I guess he's that kind of sicko. He goes around poisoning people by persuading them to take a drink out of his silver flask full of Amaretto. It is mentioned that he may be from Oregon and is heading down the California coast. He decides to stop at a small town and rent out a room. While there he gets a job as a postal worker all the while continuing to commit murders as he masquerades as a normal shy person. He even befriends a married couple The Durwins played by Brian Cox as Doug Durwin and Mercedes Ruehl as Jane Durwin and catches the eye of a coworker in Ferrin played by Janeane Garofalo. Everyone seems to like him and take him in. He's easy to be around seems to be attractive to woman and is even able to evade any policemen who don't seem to take the time to wanna solve his killings there is a sketch of his face in the local newspaper and it looks nothing like him.Throughout The Minus Man's 1 hour 50 minute running time you never sense that he is in any danger of getting caught or spending his life in prison. That element which was interpreted by myself only added to the calm creepy vibe that forced me to think about things long after the final credits rolled.The Minus Man although categorized as your typical crime drama is different in that it focuses more on the antagonist and hardly ever hones in on the authority figures trying to capture him. Its plot and the unmotivated actions by the main character aren't exactly clear. However you'll still be pulled in as a viewer because of the stylishness the somberness and the cast of capable Blisters Brian Cox Janeane Garofalo and rock star Sheryl Crow.The script is wittingly and intelligently written by director Hampton Fancher. As mentioned earlier he cowrote the scifi bender Blade Runner. If you've seen that film you can tell that he uses his touches as a writer in that same light featured here. He's totally complex in his wording. There's a little bit of irony and you'll notice by the dialogue spoken by the actors that nothing is what it seems. I thought it was interesting that this is the only vehicle he has ever helmed but you wouldn't know it. He knows where to put the camera he's good with light I like certain scenes that are shown in a ray of bright sunshine he lets his shots pan out and he edits well in cuts. Minus was made 16 years ago. I kinda wish Hampton wasn't out of the loop and maybe someday he could put out something new doesn't matter what genre I'm game.All in all I dig this movie's title I love its indie feel and I think what translates on screen is a capably numbed down thriller. Upon a second viewing I now dub it as quietly almost sheepishly disturbing stuff. And give credit to Wilson for being in almost every frame not to mention holding the screen in the palm of his hand without doing a lot just underplaying to perfection. Overall as a rare art flick depicting a psycho killer The Minus Man is nocturnal bliss from the reclusive 76 year old Fancher. It gets a plus for being a solid late 90's cinematic tool of faux translation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dare I say this is a movie for adults and sensitive others about still another serial killer? Yes. As a thriller this ranks up there behind Citizen X and about at the level of Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer. Owen Wilson is the killer adrift in a world of lower middleclass environments and jobs. Wilson has always been hard to categorize. He has an innocent look about him a baby face a high and slightly cracked voice that with his pursed lips and wavy blond hair would suggest femininity only his features are remasculinized by a broken nose that does a couple of zigzags down the center of his face.His character is a genuinely nice guy. He's generous. He doesn't have much money but he pays the bar bill of a drunken junkie  just before he kills her. He's gracious and easily satisfied. When he rents a frilly room temporarily in the house of the mentally ill Dwight Yoakum and the distraught Mercedes Ruehl he couldn't be more gratified. It's just right! He's industrious without being ambitious. He finds a seasonal temporary job with the US Postal Service sorting letters behind the counter and going odd jobs but he's so efficient and his character so unassuming that he's promoted to mail carrier.But he has this disturbing habit of offing people he thinks might hurt others or at least that's as far as his rationalizations have got him. He doesn't put much effort into thinking about it and it doesn't occupy much of his life space. Violence is never involved. He simply mixes a bit of exotic poison with the Amaretto he carries around in a flask. The victim who has done nothing to annoy Wilson just drifts off into The Big Sleep quickly and painlessly. What a nice guy. No kidding every time something good happens to him his voice rings with wonder and amazement at his good fortune like a child's.I didn't mind him so much when he poisoned the football hero. I never liked football anyway. My game is trying to roll over in bed in the middle of the night. But I was worried when Wilson took up with his coworker at the PO played by Janeane Garafalo. She's a nice postal worker and I didn't care for it when out of nowhere while she's perfectly willing to shag a bit he starts treating her like rough trade. He's been nothing but an accommodating gentleman up to now so where did THAT come from? Well we don't know. Neither does Wilson's character. In fact he's quite good. And so is Garafolo in her ordinariness. Dwight Yoakum who is given to beating himself up is properly pitiful. And Mercedes Ruehl as his initially unfriendly wife is positively superb. Her performances sizzles on the screen.I didn't imagine I'd find myself recommending another serial killer movie. They've become a genre unto themselves designed for cretins. But this one is different. The musical score is by Marco Beltrami and doesn't have a single electronic percussion in it nor is it formulaic. Hamptom Fancher whom I remember only as Sue Lyon's main squeeze in Puerto Vallarta has directed it with skill leaving puzzles exactly where puzzles belong.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1999 film was based off of the novel of the same name penned by Lew McCreary. It follows the tale of a lone drifter named Vann Siegert with a polite disposition and an urge to kill. He's softspoken and highly curious reflective and carries an innocent air about him which may be what makes it seem a little less jarring than it should be when he poisons his victims to death whenever the urge tells him to. In the film we follow him through his thought process and his emotions hinting at a troubled past and an uncertain future. That's personally part of what I love so much about the film it has a sense of serenity and calm to it the freedom of the open road with no real destination. But there are darker parts as well lots of psychological issues that seem to creep up and take control in the form of dreams or visions that Vann gets when he blacks out sort of his way of justifying andor dealing with the morality of his actions. The film leaves a lot open to interpretation and really has that it factor that draws you back in for another viewing or three or four as you make little connections and come up with your own ideas and opinions about Vann and the events that take place throughout the few months that we get to see in his life. The score was composed by Marco Beltrami it's haunting and gorgeous with hints of darkness and even humor mixed in. An absolute perfect match for the film.I think this was a magnificent role for Owen it took him out of his usual funny man role forcing him out of his comfortable improvisational zone and presented him with a very deep character that he handled with both beauty and perfection. It's a shame that his performance as Vann isn't more recognized it shows depth and a sort of professionalism that deserves accolade.See the full review and more at Owenation dot com!".

That is if it was your ordinary everyday movie that you see.... every day.I start off by saying that if you are only into the clich Hollywood action and story lines then this will make you feel like you just sat through absolutely nothing and most likely won't appeal to you as you have read various people say throughout 'most movies have this and that and this but this had none of that' as if apparently thats a bad thing. and it is for most people. However if you are wanting a movie with a fantastic story that is laid back and just such a pleasure to watch then you'll love it. There isn't at all much dialog but the movie itself says more than if you string all the words from all three lord of the rings books together.I laughed a few times ad Vanns charming humour. If I was Wilson i would personally think that this movie would be my favourite piece that I have done.There is no happy ending. There isn't really an ending at all. This is a REAL movie in the sense that absolutely nothing that is actually unlikely to happen happens. It shows how easy it is to actually do what Vann does and get away with it.Vann isn't a bad man. He chooses his targets by noticing a willingness in them to die or who are angry.I give this movie a ten due to the fact that there is nothing bad you can say about the movie even though it is most definitely not everybodies ideal movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit that this film has a special place in my heart... not quite as big as the one my fiance holds but it's still in there. It's the first Olsen Gang film I ever saw and owned and thusly the one I've seen the most. Years before I saw their other efforts I had watched this more times than I suppose I should admit. This is a unique entry in many ways. It startsthough at Mallorca like the last one and ends very differently than any of the others. An interesting thing is that with the last film the two had written these characters into a corner... the former movie ended the series perfectly with the gang reaching their dream Mallorca as millionaires. But the audience requires more of the great series. How to solve this conundrum? Where Bahs and Balling could have written a copout explanation as lesser writers surely would have they simply properly explain the return by showing how these people are affected by their new way of life. After an incidentthat I refuse to describe as its simplicity and pure genius would not translate properly through my words. It needs to be seen they find themselves back in this country. While that isn't a choice they themselves made we still find that they are much happier here... in spite of still needing money of being mediocre citizens of suffering under the same shortcomings as they did before. Yes. East West home is best. Be careful what you wish for. Clichs. But aren't clichs often just truths that we find we've heard one too many timesand one does tire more easily of hearing something that is an annoying truth to have to admit to? So with that we're back... Egon's got a plan he's released from jail and he seeks out Benny and Kjeld trying to get their backup for his latest genius and welldevised scheme. That leads to what might just be the most excellent scene featuring Yvonne in the entire series... and that's all I'll say of the plot. The plot is brilliant. The way it develops is magnificent. Pacing is as good as it comes. Despite having seen this countless times before and knowing basically everything that would happen I wasn't bored for a second. The acting is topnotch as always. Bffen returns still messing up the gang's plans. This time Ove Verner Hansen truly gets to show off his great facial acting. Pouel Kern jumps on as well in a very small but incredibly funny role. Furthermore Paul Hagen and Helge KjrluffSchmidthis only role in any of the Olsen Gang films and it's tailormade to suit him join in as two preposterously oldfashioned highranking train workersdoing a nice job of making fun of the Danish railways which are featured quite prominently in this filmhence the title thatthe Danish train system by the way is also such a definite Danish thing that it's no wonder they basically built this film up around it and managing to reference a wellknown song by Benny Andersen several times in their dialog. The humor is always brilliant mostly sophisticated and at times downright sublime. The police are thoroughly made fun of yet againas is the general Danishness. The human touch remains still spreading smiles and laughs. This may just be the most hilarious of all the films in the series and the one that features the most laughoutloud moments. You'll laugh upon hearing Kjeld announce what he'd rather be doing than live in Spain. The laughter will become hysterical upon seeing his idea for making money. If you're not already crying with laughter by the time he misquotes the Three Musketeers you'll start. This may also contain the most of Benny's silly laughter in any one of the films. One of the best in a great series. Humorous wellwritten and highly memorable. I recommend it to any fan of the franchise as well as any fan of comedy and Danish humor in general. I would say though that having watched the previous entries is a must. 810".

	schema:headline " Little left of the silliness of the first two films... moving more towards the grandeur of the later films";
	schema:reviewBody "After the first two films which mainly consisted of silly humor with little plot this one improves the formula some and adds more of the trademarks that all us fans know and love. Taking the Gang to Jutland was a marvelous idea and it simultaneously exploits and reveals many of the prejudices us Zealanders have against the Judes... and utilizing the leftover Nazi bunkers on the shores of Jutlandfrom the occupation complete with the intricate weaponsystems that they mastered is one among countless examples of the extensive research and excellent use of facts by Bahs and Balling. The plot is fairly wellwritten if a few of the developments are perhaps too randomand using an opposing gang of criminals again seems a tad unoriginal. The pacing is quite good... the film is never really dull. The acting is great with topnotch performances by the leads as usual. The supporting players contain some magnificent and wellknown contemporary Danish actors... Helle Virkner Preben Kaasin a role quite different from DynamiteHarry and Karl Stegger as a greedy Jude... which he portrays with great skill. Peter Steen returns to portray another uptight overplayed semihighlyrankedbut without any real seniority professionalism or expertise... making fun of the Danish authorities authority figure. The writing mostly works out and the actions and plot is mostly crediblethough a new skill of Benny's revealed near the end was clearly a deus ex machina Bahs and Balling had written themselves into a corner and their workaround is neither subtle nor masterful. The humor is mostly more sophisticated than that of the previous two efforts though there is still a trace of the silly humorsome relating to Steen's character. Much of it however as is the case with the later better films is derived from humane errors and the likes. This marks the first utterance by Egon of I am tired to death as well as the first appearance of the Franz Jger safesand this film holds what is most likely the very reason behind them being chosen a German safe that still existsor at least did when these were produced and was around during the second World War as well as the first use by Benny of the doohickeyas Egon later calls it in a clever reference to the fact that it was never properly named. We are coming closer still to the excellence of the later films... reaching the height of this series the height of Danish comedy. I recommend this film to any fan of Danish films comedy andor The Olsen Gang... this holds some of the truly great moments of the franchise and shouldn't be missed by anyone interested in the characters or series. 710".

	onyx:emotionText "After the first two films which mainly consisted of silly humor with little plot this one improves the formula some and adds more of the trademarks that all us fans know and love. Taking the Gang to Jutland was a marvelous idea and it simultaneously exploits and reveals many of the prejudices us Zealanders have against the Judes... and utilizing the leftover Nazi bunkers on the shores of Jutlandfrom the occupation complete with the intricate weaponsystems that they mastered is one among countless examples of the extensive research and excellent use of facts by Bahs and Balling. The plot is fairly wellwritten if a few of the developments are perhaps too randomand using an opposing gang of criminals again seems a tad unoriginal. The pacing is quite good... the film is never really dull. The acting is great with topnotch performances by the leads as usual.
