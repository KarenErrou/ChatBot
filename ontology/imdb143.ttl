	schema:headline " Surprisingly good thriller with a terrific lead in Spader.";
	schema:reviewBody "Rating  out of Despite having one of the worst titles I've ever heard Jack's Back is actually a nifty little thriller a true hidden gem if I ever saw one. I happened to come across the film at a used video store like the title the cover box is pretty awful too makes you wonder if the trailers and TV promos were also just as lame and being a James Spader fan decided to give it a look. Nice to see this turned out to be one of the better impulse buys I've made in a while.The title refers to Jack the Ripper or more specifically a copycat who's committing similar murders in Los Angeles on the same days on the hundredth anniversary of when the original killings occurred. Without giving anything away I'll simply say that James Spader and Cynthia Gibb are the protagonists who are searching for the killer even though Spader himself might be the one.Despite a plot that plays somewhat like a routine thriller the story is still fairly enjoyable for what it is. There are a few plot twists and turns some unpredictable some which are fairly obvious. Fans of whodunnits and let's face it I think everyone enjoys a good whodunnit every once in a while will find just enough intriguing detail to make this at least an average viewing. But what sets this apart from many thrillers particularly those of the late 80's is the emphasis on characters. Writerdirector Rowdy Herrington probably spends even more time developing the lead protagonists than he does fueling the main plot I can actually see how this might somewhat disappoint whodunnit fans hoping for a very convoluted plot or slasher fans expecting more well slashing. Consequently the suspense is ratcheted up a few notches and we find ourselves caring about the outcome. Most of the credit for this should go to Spader who delivers a terrifically charismatic and extremely likable performance. He plays a man who's hardly a saint but realistic in that he's flawed and simultaneously more than capable of showing a genuine conscience. Cynthia Gibb who's very cute works well with Spader she's charmingly convincing and adorable. The rest of the cast isn't really worth mentioning except for maybe Robert Picardo as a thoughtful police psychologist who happens to live in a mansion no less. Everybody else is mostly present to act as suspects or people who are simply in Spader's way.Herrington's direction is quite good setting up a creepy atmosphere nicely accompanied with an equally creepy score. It's Herrington's storytelling that could use more work. While many details are set up well the finale stumbles due to a rather large leap in logic. To some the film's conclusion might also seem rather abrupt without quite enough explanation for all that transpired. If Herrington had tightened up his story he might have had a great thriller on his hands. As it is this is merely a good movie that rates well above average. But I shouldn't be complaining. Jack's Back is a pleasant surprise even moreso for a movie with such an awful title.".

James and Cynthia had great chemistry and I agree with others that their romance was not done in a typical overdone fashion. The title of the movie is bad and makes you think automatically that it will just be some stupid B movie but it's actually one of the best thrillers I've seen and definitely the best thriller out of the B section.

A med student Spader gets caught up in the last murder and winds up meeting a tragic fate.  Now his twin brother also played by Spader is out to find the man responsible for his death and gets caught up in the middle of the copycat murder case in the process.  Oh and he has to clear his own name because he is a suspect in the above mentioned case AND also a suspect in his brothers murder...Whooo.  Now that's a s load of plot!Jack's Back is an odd movie and kind of deceiving.  You see no one in their right mind is gonna market a movie this complicated.  So what the box tells ya is that Jack's Back is about a murderer mimicking the Jack The Ripper slayings of a century ago.  Well that's only half the movie.  Jack's Back is a murder mystery turned revenge noir turned suspense thriller that manages to avoid drowning itself in murky plot pointless subplot or endless dialogue in an attempt to competently tell the story and wrap everything up in the end.  From the title and basic premise of the film one may think it's just your basic slasher typemurder mystery exploitation stuff that was recycled over and over again when this movie was released. If so you're wrong...Jack's Back starts as a murder mystery about a nutball killing prostitutes when we meet a med student with a heart of gold John played by James Spader.  He soon finds himself at the scene of one of the Ripper murders and is eventually killed.  His shady twin brother Rick who sees the murder in a dream soon pops up.  The police are quick to write off John's death as a suicide but Rick knows better.  He soon sets out to find the guy responsible with the help of Chris Gibb who had a thing for John and is developing a thing for Rick when he finds that things aren't as they seemed and the Ripper copycat is out for more blood.  Writerdirector Rowdy Herrington gives us a strong well developed script with great characters and memorable situations.  His ability to shift from a murder mystery to revenge flick to thriller deserves major props.  Props to Herrington for creating such likeable and complex characters too.  Great job!  From a directing standpoint Herrington gives the movie a moody and uneasy atmosphere blanketed in thick fog.  Burnout Central award to Herrington.James Spader delivers a layered and very strong double performance that engaged me and kept my eyes glued on him.  Cynthia Gibb gives a strong performance as well.  I dug how the script didn't go into familiar romantic territory even though Spader and Gibb had great chemistry.  Burnout Central awards to both!It was great to watch a movie with such a dense storyline that never forget what it was supposed to doentertain.  I was intrigued and fascinated with the story performances and Herrington's ability to construct such a multilayered plot and still find a way to pull it all together.  Jack's Back isn't conventional in the least it marches to its own drum has class and is well written acted and directed.  Check it out!".

This guy has charisma! And he strongly pulls off the whole dual part of playing twins. The premise is one of those the less you know the better off you are. When you think you have it figured out you'll find yourself at square one again. It's a simple but cleverly penned whodunit murder mystery story. Its odd and manipulative multilayered structure offers unpredictable turns hidden clues suspicious red herrings but in the long run leaves some spotty developments and a real lack of motivation. It might annoy and could've used some tweaking but the wellpaced story that takes time to give our protagonist some depth and sense of urgency just grips you that you just go with it. Director  writer Rowdy Herrington's directorial debut shows assurance in his abilities. The thrills are routine but confidently done with razorsharp timing and jarring force. They're menacing brooding bloody and a little disturbing. He really does hold you at bay with powerful visuals and anxious suspense. The moody photography and lighting composition drills in well with the stirringly blues music score. This blends well in with eerily glum and sullen atmospheric tinge coming from the Los Angles' setting. The performances are wellsuited. Spader is the film's main drive but Cynthia Gibb is capably good and Robert Picardo turns in a sound performance. Its also stars Jim Haynie Chris Mulkey Rod Loomis John Wesley and Rex Ryon in amusingly fine support. A wonderfully quirky and darkly projected thriller that's better than your average output.".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this on TV late at night. Thought it would just be sometypical 80's slasher movie but I was pleasantly surprised to seewhat a genuinely wellmade thriller this was. It's a basic potboilerstory but thoughtfully executed and James Spader is excellent in adual role as twin brothers. It's got a little bit of everything reincarnating the Jack the Ripper myth twin brothers who are ofcourse total opposites a bit of the paranormal a great whodunitmystery and some genuinely creepy scenes.

He plays one twin who is the affablefriendly doctor who works in a local free clinic and then hisantihero badboy twin brother who works a minimumwage jobhas shady connections but ultimately shares his brother's senseof justice and good heart. And Spader's performance isn't thetypical uberyuppie not a whiny preppy wimp and not a totalpsychopath.

It's a basic potboilerstory but thoughtfully executed and James Spader is excellent in adual role as twin brothers. It's got a little bit of everything reincarnating the Jack the Ripper myth twin brothers who are ofcourse total opposites a bit of the paranormal a great whodunitmystery and some genuinely creepy scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "A serial killer in Los Angeles celebrates Jack the Ripper's 100th anniversary by committing similar murders.My first thought was how strange this film was for starting when there was only one murder left. It seems like it would make more sense to start at the first murder and allow the characters to solve the mystery of the pattern. Instead they know from the opening scene that the killer is following the pattern of Jack the Ripper. This takes out much of the mystery element...The cast here is pretty great with both James Spader and Robert Picardo both I think before becoming bigger names. Spader always had that boy next door charm and Picardo is interesting and plays his role as a psychiatrist well coming off as very suspicious at all the right moments.The New York Times said is so dull it leaves you plenty of time to marvel at how a plot can be this rickety how a production can look this shabby and how the firsttime writer and director Rowdy Herrington could borrow a story with so relentless a grip on our imaginations and in no time at all declaw it. This seems terribly harsh. While not the greatest movie it is still much better than many films out there and had a premise that was enough to carry it.I watched this film on Netflix and I am told this version is different from the one on VHS or that was shown in theaters. I would be curious to know the differences as I am told they are big enough to completely change the plot of the film... I liked the version I saw but maybe the other is even better?".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning minor spoilersJames Spader is such a fine actor that he can make even dreck fairly watchable. This film starts out well especially if you do not know going into it that Spader plays two roles. The surprise death of the heretofore main character ten or fifteen minutes in is an effective shocker. But much of the plot of this film is poor. A viewer would have to be heavily sedated not to realize who the killer is during the first third of the film  he is such a clich that all he is missing is a handlebar mustache to twirl and the actor playing him does everything but hold up a sign saying I'm an evil psychopath! Watch me! Plus his behavior in the final part of the movie is completely inexplicable. He isn't copying Jack the Ripper anymore his intended victim isn't a prostitute he has apparently gotten away with his crimes because someone else is under arrest and that person is guilty of at least one murder  why do what he does? Oh so we can have a final confrontation and end the film!However Jack's Back is somewhat redeemed by Spader who makes the twins distinct characters without overplaying their differences. Clearly the movie's director didn't realize how good Spader was because he insists on giving Rick a scar and a radically different hairstyle which are completely unnecessary especially since the two characters' roles in the film do not overlap. As Rick the comparatively ne'erdowell twin the main role Spader projects a fair degree of complexity and does so in subtle ways. Watch the scene in which he goes into his brother's house looks at books photos and then the unmade bed. Spader has no dialogue here and doesn't overdo it  no tears no punching the wall no bitter turning away  but the play of emotions across his face is brilliant and tells us everything we need to know about their relationship. That's great acting.Besides the awful villain other cast member are uneven. Cynthia Gibb is fine Robert Picardo convincing as a smarter than average psychiatrist working with the police and the always reliable Chris Mulkey one of those oh yeah that guy! actors plays his usual slightly dense and harmlessly if cluelessly lecherous cop. But Wendell Wright badly overplays the police captain who repeatedly leaps to the wrong conclusions.Otherwise the film suffers from being obviously of its era the late '80's.Thus the music is really bad especially for a suspense film and they give us the wretched theme song Red Harvest whatever that means by Paul Saax whoever that was over both the beginning and ending credits. The clothes are accurate for the time but it was not a good era fashionwise. The hairstyles look especially silly with poor Spader having to wear a swept across 'do that looks like he just missed the final cut when auditioning for a Flock of Seagulls tribute band and the otherwise lovely Gibb is trapped in a late '80's galmullet. Saucony shoes apparently paid for product placement. Even the opening credits look cheap and generic.All in all a mediocre film that starts out as if it will be much better but falls apart in the final reel and that is only worth watching as part of a James Spader film festival. 12".

As Rick the comparatively ne'erdowell twin the main role Spader projects a fair degree of complexity and does so in subtle ways. Watch the scene in which he goes into his brother's house looks at books photos and then the unmade bed. Spader has no dialogue here and doesn't overdo it  no tears no punching the wall no bitter turning away  but the play of emotions across his face is brilliant and tells us everything we need to know about their relationship. That's great acting.Besides the awful villain other cast member are uneven. Cynthia Gibb is fine Robert Picardo convincing as a smarter than average psychiatrist working with the police and the always reliable Chris Mulkey one of those oh yeah that guy! actors plays his usual slightly dense and harmlessly if cluelessly lecherous cop. But Wendell Wright badly overplays the police captain who repeatedly leaps to the wrong conclusions.Otherwise the film suffers from being obviously of its era the late '80's.Thus the music is really bad especially for a suspense film and they give us the wretched theme song Red Harvest whatever that means by Paul Saax whoever that was over both the beginning and ending credits. The clothes are accurate for the time but it was not a good era fashionwise. The hairstyles look especially silly with poor Spader having to wear a swept across 'do that looks like he just missed the final cut when auditioning for a Flock of Seagulls tribute band and the otherwise lovely Gibb is trapped in a late '80's galmullet. Saucony shoes apparently paid for product placement. Even the opening credits look cheap and generic.All in all a mediocre film that starts out as if it will be much better but falls apart in the final reel and that is only worth watching as part of a James Spader film festival. 12";

He performed much better in Stargate 1994 and The Watcher 2000. The title refers to a Jack the Ripper copycat who's committing similar murders in Los Angeles on the same days on the hundredth anniversary of when the original killings occurred. Plot A young doctor John Westford James Spader finds himself at the scene of one of the Ripper murders and is eventually killed. His identical twin brother Rick Westford James Spader claims to have seen visions of the true killer in a dream. The police think that John had committed the murder and was the copycat. Now Rick has the chance to prove his brother was innocent and the the murderer is someone else....... In conclusion not worth wasting 1hr 33mins on this flick. Do something else instead like cleaning your house or going for a walk in the park.".

I love 'those' types of movies the complete freedom to be crazy violent ridiculously funny or even scary and disturbing if the colours are mixed correctly. This movie is none of those things. The 'ripper' is notsoelegantly foreshadowed by his first 2 lines in the first 5 minutes in the movie so even the most unsophisticated viewer will know exactly what will transpire towards the end. Also the red herring is shamelessly gallivanted around as if to say it's this guy its this guy it's THIS GUY. And I think most of the IMDb and cult horror viewers like myself will struggle to not roll their eyeballs completely out of their sockets during the course of this movie.OK so the plot stinks! The acting is alright there's a bit of a sub plot love story between a younger more attractive James Spader look up recent pictures of him as an example of how to NOT age gracefully  and he's just not sexy enough to carry the 'mysterious dark loner' type guy. While horror movies do NOT need to have explicit amounts of gore or violence in order to be good it certainly tends to help in films like this that just end up being completely boring.I'm assuming this film was originally produced to air on TV and then later video as even the uncut version has zero nudity or violence. Jack the ripper would be ashamed if he had seen this. That being said if you really enjoy James Spader and whatever lady he costars with if you have an affinity for slightly trashy murder mysteries sans the mystery in this case or if you had seen this movie decades ago perhaps it is worth a revisit also be on the lookout for the single most ridiculous uppercutninja punch that I cannot believe wasn't edited out to look less ridiculous.".

These actors did a great job with a horrible script about nothing !";

Don't be led astray by the 'Jack The Ripper' analogy as the film has very little to do with that and the title seems like a gratuitous cashin on the centenary. All the killings bar one have already taken place at the start of the movie and the plot is driven not by the hunt for the killer but rather by the search for the killer of Spader's brother who is implicated in the murders. When the 'Ripper' is finally revealed it's obvious and unnecessary since the rest of the story has already been neatly closed. It's also preposterous to believe that the real killer having completed so perfectly his copycat 'Ripper' killings would implicate himself and provide a lifeline for the police's prime suspect who is behind bars by attempting to murder our leading lady. This final reel is pointless and only highlights the flaws in the screenplay which have allowed us to be sidetracked away from the real issue.".

It's closer in tone to Michael Powell or Jean Cocteau  and may be a 'hidden influence' on both A Matter of Life and Death and Orphee.Not least among his achievements...Lang pulls off the wellnigh impossible feat of making Charles Boyer interesting! Sorry but I'd always found this actor deeply resistible. A suburban housewife's stereotype of a suave Continental lover. But in this movie Boyer plays a role that even five years later would have been reserved exclusively for Jean Gabin. A tough carnival barker and petty crook. A sexy 'bad boy' in a striped clinging Tshirt and skintight jeans.Boyer as Liliom is a Gallic cousin of Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire. I could well understand why Julie Madeleine Ozeray fell head over heels for him because I did too. He treats her appallingly of course. Boozing whoring gambling...even a very nonPC touch of wifebeating. For all its fantasy elements this love story is as warped and sadomasochistic as any in later Lang movies like Secret Beyond the Door or The Big Heat. Hot coffee anyone?Eventually two angels show up and haul Boyer off to the hereafter  where he must atone for his sins! The term 'angels' is one I use loosely. Darksuited paleskinned and shavenheaded these two guys look like denizens of an Xrated Berlin nightclub. Kinkier still is Boyer's personal 'spirit guide'  a madeyed knifegrinder played by Antonin Artaud the twisted genius who invented the Theatre of Cruelty.Liliom is a rare treat for oldmovie buffs. Lyrical and fantastic yes. Soppy and sentimental never. It stands comparison with Lang's best work from Berlin or Hollywood. I can only regret he did not spend more time in France.".

	schema:headline " What a silence falls over the carnival";
	schema:reviewBody "The film writer Daniel Shaw in his Senses of Cinema essay on Fritz Lang dismisses the director's take on the Ferenc Molnar play Liliom as a piece of fluff. He should have done a bit more research because Lang himself described Liliom as one of his favourite of his own pictures. This is a fact that of all people an auteurist like Shaw should not be ignoring.You can see why the confusion arises. Liliom is very much a product of its time and place. Made in France in the early 30s it has the same blend of downtoearth realism and dreamy sentimentality that characterises the early films of Rene Clair or Jean Vigo's L'Atalante. And this is surely why many commentators on Lang most famous for his paranoiac thrillers find it so hard to accept as part of the director's canon. But Lang while he may have inflexible in style was by no means limited in genre.What connects all of Lang's pictures is the extravagant oddity with which they are shot. Metropolis is a baroque scifi Scarlet Street is a baroque film noir and Liliom is a baroque romance. The picture has the same intense and often musical rhythm of Lang's late silent pictures. As usual he places us somewhat forcefully within the action at key moments such as the opening scene where the two lovers meet where the camera accompanies them on the carousel. We are made to feel Julie's strife through numerous pointofview shots of Charles Boyer or ones of a plaintive Madeleine Ozeray looking straight into the lens. The heaven and hell sequences are pure Lang fantastical indulgence a far cry from the minimalist equivalents in the musical adaptation Carousel.But to the consternation of the auteurists who would maybe have Lang turn Molnar's classic into a grim fable of doom and destiny Lang makes it abundantly clear that he can do romance and do it with sincerity. In fact viewing the director's work as a whole this is not entirely surprising  Spione You and Me The Big Heat and many more are incredibly tender at times. Here he gives weight to the relationship between Liliom and Julie from the way he shoots its beginning. We see Charles Boyer doing his exuberant barking act always in midshot often partly obscured by foreground business. When he lays eyes upon Ozeray he suddenly comes into closeup. We thus connect with the character at the same time he connects with his belovedtobe. Their first moments together are shot with typical Lang quirkiness  low angles and rapid edits. However as the romance blossoms their moments together are allowed to play out in long takes and single camera setups.Which brings me onto my next point. There is one way in which Liliom differs markedly from the average Fritz Lang picture. Normally the actors under Lang's jurisdiction were excessively hammy all wild gestures and crazy faces even in the lead roles. In Liliom however the keynote is one of restraint and credibility. We have a young Charles Boyer displaying all the charismatic charm that would propel him to Hollywood stardom a few years later. Sure he is highly expressive but in a way that is believable for that character. Madeleine Ozeray makes an incredibly fragile figure playing out her emotions through tiny soft movements. It's a pity she didn't share Boyer's later success. There's also a wonderfully mannered performance from Henri Richard as the commissioner. Commanding acting such as that on display here is surely the most important asset any picture can have. Regardless of how it fits into the general scheme of his work Lang was right about Liliom. It is one of his best.".

	onyx:emotionText "The film writer Daniel Shaw in his Senses of Cinema essay on Fritz Lang dismisses the director's take on the Ferenc Molnar play Liliom as a piece of fluff. He should have done a bit more research because Lang himself described Liliom as one of his favourite of his own pictures. This is a fact that of all people an auteurist like Shaw should not be ignoring.You can see why the confusion arises. Liliom is very much a product of its time and place. Made in France in the early 30s it has the same blend of downtoearth realism and dreamy sentimentality that characterises the early films of Rene Clair or Jean Vigo's L'Atalante. And this is surely why many commentators on Lang most famous for his paranoiac thrillers find it so hard to accept as part of the director's canon.

Despite this I really had a hard time sticking with this fantasy film. Fortunately it did get better in the latter portion but overall I just didn't enjoy this. I think the biggest reason is that the central character Liliom is basically an unlikable jerk. When things turn disastrous for him late in the film I just didn't carea serious problem with any film.The film begins with Charles Boyer playing Lilioma hardliving sociopath who lies beats women loves fighting and is completely lazy. He lives off of unsuspecting women and oddly he's completely irresistible to women at least the stupid ones despite being a complete scumbag. It's a decent character study of an Antisocial personality but he's completely unpleasant and totally superficial.Throughout the film he lives off and uses women. Eventually though reality catches up to him when he discovers he's about to become a father. So his solution is to get money for his new life by stealing the payroll from a local company. But in the process he dies and the rest of the film is highly reminiscent of Faust. He goes to Heaven they send him to Pergatory and oddly they let him go back to Earth to see his wife and daughter who was born after his death. This part is much more interesting but the special effects for Heaven even by 1930s standards are pretty poor.The entire film just left me flat. If the film were remade other than as the musical CAROUSEL better special effects AND making Liliom somewhat likable and helping the audience to understand more about what a woman might like about him would help immensely. I wanted to like this film as I love French films AND the films of Fritz Lang but just couldn't. It is an interesting curio but nothing else...at least to me.".

It was a great performance from Boyer almost unrecognizable from the oily gigolo types he played in Hollywood. Boisterous and exuberant he brings his character to life and now I can't imagine anyone else playing this role.Apart from no musical score this picture differs from Carousel as Liliom enters his afterlife. In Carousel the sequence in heaven was almost an afterthought but here Lang infuses it with some touches that are both surreal and extremely imaginative and without the benefit of digital enhancement. No special effects here. I didn't care for Madeleine Ozeray's interpretation of the Julie character which came off as naive and withdrawn almost a form of neurosis.

I won't say more about the plot except to say it takes a very interesting turn when he reluctantly agrees to commit a crime with his lowlife buddy Pierre Alcover. Lang is very creative in this film keeping us offbase as to where the film is going and capturing nice shots with reflections and shadows.

	schema:reviewBody "Liliom is not a masterpiece of cinema but not a terrible movie. Moreover could he be considered as such knowing that Fritz Lang is also the author of the unavoidable classics such as Metropolis Fritz Lang 1927 and M Fritz Lang 1931? There is doubt but Liliom is no more or less than the account of a proud man who believes himself strong and who breaks the heart of his wife and who pays the price. It is a story based on the moral sense of a young man and the viewer is reflected in the message of the film. As for example in these famous situations of life where a little angel is on our right shoulder that dictates what is good to do and a little devil on the left shoulder trying to tempt us to succumb to our vices. Liliom meanwhile is vicious and manipulative but he has necessarily good in him.This feature is fortunately not that a beast series of annoying scenes. The film opens on a noisy stage or a thundering music tries to surpass the cries of Liliom and extras. The rather jerky assembly of this sequence combined with the avalanche of decibels is at least a sign of activity that is imposed on us from the first minutes. Moreover we witness a battle scene where the noise stops completely for a minute when Liliom and his colleague of the circus look at each other intensely. This unfortunately too short sequence could have been much more impressive but the viewer is left hungry. The rhythm of the film slowed down enormously thereafter. Some shots without music are much too long allowing us to appreciate the soft sound of the film in the beginning of the talk but also to fall asleep. We are very far from the style to the Charlie Chaplin where the action happens very quickly and where the gags are connected without respite. No Liliom he takes his time. It does not prevent that the film is played by very good actors. All the replies of Charles Boyer are sublime every time his character opens his mouth we want to laugh out loud. Liliom may well be arrogant and we hate him a little because of this but we find each of the exchanges he makes with the characters more or less secondary very entertaining. Madeleine Ozeray and Florelle both perform a convincing performance despite a game a bit too stretched. But the character of the commissioner is absolutely sublime. We love him so much in the role of the commissioner as in that of the angel who judges.We can also note the strangeness of the music of the film. Insupportable circus music comes back at several moments even during certain dramatic scenes where the atmosphere is heavy. Unfortunately this contrast only brings confusion to the viewer. Music completely opposite to the emotion created by the characters playing on the screen has no effect. The part that follows the death of Liliom is probably the most interesting. The spectator finds himself abruptly lightyears away from what he has seen until now. The film turns to the real fanciful comedy when the main character resurrects and is transported to heaven by two men dressed perfectly shadows of blacks with a complexion white as snow and that he is judged by an angel. In this sequence we have the confirmation that the film is not serious but the scene breaks the monotony whose film has appeared since the beginning and the spectator suddenly comes out of its passive state. We see the arrival of new characters the film changes costumes and sets and the dramatic tone before disappears to give way to a much lighter tone until the end. Liliom deserves to be seen but not to the point of being a classic. The moviegoers will find their account there for sure.".

	onyx:emotionText "Liliom is not a masterpiece of cinema but not a terrible movie. Moreover could he be considered as such knowing that Fritz Lang is also the author of the unavoidable classics such as Metropolis Fritz Lang 1927 and M Fritz Lang 1931? There is doubt but Liliom is no more or less than the account of a proud man who believes himself strong and who breaks the heart of his wife and who pays the price. It is a story based on the moral sense of a young man and the viewer is reflected in the message of the film. As for example in these famous situations of life where a little angel is on our right shoulder that dictates what is good to do and a little devil on the left shoulder trying to tempt us to succumb to our vices. Liliom meanwhile is vicious and manipulative but he has necessarily good in him.This feature is fortunately not that a beast series of annoying scenes. The film opens on a noisy stage or a thundering music tries to surpass the cries of Liliom and extras. The rather jerky assembly of this sequence combined with the avalanche of decibels is at least a sign of activity that is imposed on us from the first minutes. Moreover we witness a battle scene where the noise stops completely for a minute when Liliom and his colleague of the circus look at each other intensely. This unfortunately too short sequence could have been much more impressive but the viewer is left hungry. The rhythm of the film slowed down enormously thereafter. Some shots without music are much too long allowing us to appreciate the soft sound of the film in the beginning of the talk but also to fall asleep. We are very far from the style to the Charlie Chaplin where the action happens very quickly and where the gags are connected without respite. No Liliom he takes his time. It does not prevent that the film is played by very good actors. All the replies of Charles Boyer are sublime every time his character opens his mouth we want to laugh out loud. Liliom may well be arrogant and we hate him a little because of this but we find each of the exchanges he makes with the characters more or less secondary very entertaining. Madeleine Ozeray and Florelle both perform a convincing performance despite a game a bit too stretched. But the character of the commissioner is absolutely sublime. We love him so much in the role of the commissioner as in that of the angel who judges.We can also note the strangeness of the music of the film. Insupportable circus music comes back at several moments even during certain dramatic scenes where the atmosphere is heavy. Unfortunately this contrast only brings confusion to the viewer. Music completely opposite to the emotion created by the characters playing on the screen has no effect. The part that follows the death of Liliom is probably the most interesting. The spectator finds himself abruptly lightyears away from what he has seen until now.

	schema:reviewBody "The first real thing anyone can do when watching an expose on certain aspects of American culture is to ask yourself a very hard question Is this real?I had to do that with this film.Watching Larry Clark's 1995 film Kids an authentic and frightening expose of some particularly callous and reckless teenagers in New York City one cannot wonder if the film is a brilliant commentary on the state of America's youth or is a cleverly exploitive portrait of a corrupted culture.I believe the latter. It depicts with stunning authenticity the chilling underside to a culture that abides by its own standards while tossing away the teachings and hardlearned lessons of an elder generation.First of all I wouldn't believe anyone who says that this movie is hogwash or offers nothing close to a solution. Well the first question that people should ask themselves is do they know anyone like the kids in the movie? I do. I recently graduated from high school and I knew several people who were quite like the kids in this film. This film set out to do one thing to show American parents Hey these are your kids. Do you know what they do when you're not around?Thoughtful people will ask themselves that. This is a film that deserves a thoughtful audience as a thoughtful crew made it and took the risks associated with bringing such harsh subject matter to the screen.Like last year's Thirteen Kids shows youth on the edge. These kids are perfectly amoral and addicted. These kids aren't all right they're extremely dangerous.There isn't a whole lot to the story other than it chronicles an eventful day in the life of Telly Leo Fitzpatrick his friend Casper Justin Pierce and their innercircle of similarminded sexdrugcrazed associates. Telly has made it a duty to deflower as many girls as possible and later brag to his friends about his latest conquest but by day's end guaranteed he would've done it again a record for him to do two girls in one day. The main conflict of the story surfaces about 30 minutes in when Jennie Chloe Sevigny discovers that she had contracted HIV from Telly during their first sexual encounter and it becomes her mission to track him down before another young girl shares her fate.This is one powerful and dangerous film that is not for the faint of heart as it is authentically bleak. There is no hope for the characters in the end that is just how realistic this film is. The film is also filled with shockingly real images and a wall of furious sound to drive home its key points. These are the kids of yesteryear the forgotten generation these kids are America's worst nightmare because they are young dumb and just do not care the fact that they do not care makes them especially dangerous.As I stated before the imagery is extreme and frightening. If there ever was an honest thing these kids ever did it would have to be willfully giving change to the less fortunate a man with no legs who rides a skateboard on the subway. We also get images of younger children swearing drinking smoking talking like adults trying to fit in with their peers who are not much older than they are. I was actually quite frightened by some baby pictures of our main character and then I see what's on screen.Thennewcomer Leo Fitzpatrick puts a face on a sleeping monster in America the doomed generation of young people that disregard older generations completely and follow their own set of corrupted values. Telly is reckless and stupid it is impossible to really sympathize with his character even though we probably are. But it is difficult to do so mainly because of his preference for deflowering girls younger than him the first girl we see him with is only 12 he's about 15 or 16 and that could open up discussion for Telly possibly being a borderline pedophile.Where are the parents? One could very easily ask that question. Strangely enough Telly lives with his mother and baby brother. She is the only parent in the film and she seems as every bit as irresponsible as her misguided son.Watching Kids I couldn't believe how real it is how it sucks the viewer into its dark dangerous and seductive world it's easy to see how a weak person could believe that what goes on in this movie is cool. It begs the most fundamental question any responsible person could ever ask Do you know where your children are?It is a question that every good parent should ask when their teenage son or daughter steps out that front door and into the real world.Kids  1010".

If it's not your kid doing these things then it's the one sitting next to him in class. And don't be so sure it isn't your kid.";

	schema:reviewBody "To call this the best independent film ever is the equivalent to saying that Bush is the most liked president ever...its far from the truth. This film makes some wonderfully awful visuals about teenmales and what exactly they think about. What questions and conversations did this film mean to convey. It just showed crazy scenes of total extreme behavior....OK so Telly has a thing for virgins... thats believable and somehow with his goofy screwed up face and semichallenged speech pattern he sleeps with multiple girls....OK I'll let that slide. The character of Casper was one that I think a lot of kids can somewhat relate to until the totally outofcharacter rape scene which made no sense at all. The character did not exhibit that type of behavior all film but then in the last two minutes his character is ruined. Until that scene he had shown good attributes like giving that peach to the girl or giving money to the legless man but then the director made sure that he killed every ounce of goodness left in every character by the end of the film maybe that was his message every teenager is untrustworthy and criminal or at least the ones living in New York.How can this film be about normal kids? I guess the director just assumes that all urban New York kids have no code of ethics no sense of responsibility and care about no one. Jenny is a prime example of this how can she not contact Telly all day I guess she took a break from searching because the film goes from midafternoon to late at night and how can she just stand there or not rush in trying to save the other girl from contracting a potentially lethal virus. Once again the director portrays even the girls as being complete garbage. There was no overall message to this film. I guess the only thing that you could somehow derive would be lock kids up at night not let them out because they are all barbaric selfishand idiotic by nature. I watched this over a streaming connection on the internet and I still have to say I spent too much to watch this.If you want to see decent films on social commentary see American History X Clockwork Orange Equilibrium Fahrenheit 451 Natural Born Killers Crash or Syriana Juice Hoop Dreams or Requiem for a Dream Transpotting. Anything is better than this.".

	schema:headline " Could have done without it.";
	schema:reviewBody "After watching this film for the first time I have to admit that it might be scarier than any horror film I have seen. First of all I am a 21 year old girl from a suburb of large city. All of my friends in junior high all talked about this movie like it was great. I was expecting it to be great as well. When I was 14 all I wanted to do was rent this movie but I was never allowed. Fortunately it was a good choice not to rent the movie at 14. My life was nothing like the kids that were portrayed in the movie. I've never even encountered anyone who has lived a life similar to the kids in the movie. Yes I am naive and have lived a sheltered life. It probably would not of had that big of an effect of my life because I wasn't having sex drinking or doing drugs anyways.Furthermore I don't think the kidsparents who this movie was calling out to would really think twice about the actions they were doing. It cannot be a wakeup call for America if the intended audience just doesn't care. Do you think if the kids in the movie saw a film similar to this would they change their actions? No they will continue to think they were invisible to HIV STDS and PREGNANCY.I will give the movie credit for not glamorizing sex drugs and alcohol. Unlike other movies the kids in the movie don't look cool when they are engaging in these acts because they aren't attractive. The more they engage in these actions the worse they look which is true to life. When I first saw some of the actors I didn't realize why they weren't the typical beautiful people you encounter in films. Instead they look like normal people. Which makes it even scarier to watch.After watching Telly and Casper talk after he just devirginized a 12 year old almost made me vomit. I was tempted to turn off the movie but decided to continue watching to see if it got better. It really did not.My major problem with the film was how the females in the film were portrayed as desperate sluts or victims. All of them. Even Telly's mother seemed to be on the end of desperate. Why wasn't there a female character to stand up to these boys or say no? When Jennie is looking for Telly in the park the one girl said she didn't agree with the boys almost killing that kid  yet she did nothing about it. Perhaps they would have beat her up too? But she had a choice she didn't have to stay and watch. It was just disgusting to see these female characters get walked all over in the film. As a young female viewer I was appalled most at this. In addition the scene in which the females are talking about their sex lives is really disturbing and not realistic. My friends and I do talk about sex but not like that. Also why is female oral sex never mentioned in this film? If it is going to be realistic it should be mentioned too especially by the girls doing the talking in this scene but it is forgotten I guess because it is a male dominated film.Overall I was disgusted with the film. I would not recommend this film to anyone who does not want to see a 1213 year old having sex with a teenage boy who has HIV.".

Perhaps in part because the subjects were an urban group of kids rather than the angsty suburban set we've grown accustomed to seeing there is a rare and truthful ferocity to the characterizations. The emotive mechanism isn't their redemption as mere children but their total fallibility as young adults. Though obviously this represents a small sample of teenagers in the united states it will make you think twice about how much earlier we seem to lose our childhood these days. Great ensemble cast with very believable performances. Its attempt to approximate the reality of a documentary is a unique success. In addition to stong dialogue and direction credit should be given to the cast for that obviously chloe sevigny was a standout here. A really important subject for its time and a very credible portrayal.".

	schema:headline " Clark's brilliant and hauntingly accurate portrait of the bad side of humanity in our younger generation grips you by the throat and never lets go.";
	schema:reviewBody "There are two highly and deservedly controversial movies dealing with the issues of drug and alcohol abuse underage sex lack of control and the preteen and teenage minority of urban America. One of them is Kids and the other is Bully. The former is a haunting work of art the latter is a clunk of garbage. Both were directed by the same man Larry Clark. I saw Bully first about a year ago and I was blown out of my mind by how offensive and atrociously cruel that movie was and how it redeemed itself in no way. I initially condemned Mr. Clark as a director and vowed never to see another movie of his again.Then I happened to see the Siskel  Ebert review for his first movie Kids and after much deliberation decided to give this controversial filmmaker a second chance. I am so glad that I did.In many respects Kids and Bully are much the same movie. They're both frighteningly brutal appalling in their explicit content and vulgar dialogue and they expose the nasty undercurrents in the younger generations of today especially in urban cities where parental control or control of any kind seems all but present. So why is Kids a great movie and Bully an awful one? Because while Bully only pretended to have a purpose Kids has a purpose and it never once dumbs down on that. It's a sick and disgusting picture but it's also somewhat of a wakeup call. And I can fairly say now that as a reviewer and filmgoer I can forgive Mr. Clark.Kids is set in the drugriddled streets of New York. We see very little of parents or adults for that matter and focus on a group of rambunctious vulgarityspitting lecherous teenagers who are devoted to getting drunk abusing drugs and giving away their virginity. The most sickening of them is Telly Leo Fitzpatrick. Not because he can charm young girls enough to seduce them into deflowering them but because he's simultaneously signing their death warrants with the HIV virus. One of his victims Chloe Sevigny discovers she has AIDS because of her onenight stand with him and as she slowly suffers searches the city to confront him. Meanwhile Telly is trying to seduce his next victim while he and a group of other nasty individuals roam unsupervised through a place as horrific as any drug underworld. More shocking is that this is just a day in the life for them.Even more shocking is the daunting realization that this is one hundred percent accurate and we must commend Mr. Clark and screenwriter Harmony Korine the latter in particular. His screenplay is the core of why this picture is so powerful. He writes his dialogue without any apparent flow or structure as if the behavior of his characters are not even up to him. The actions of the characters are unpredictable as they would be. I also really commend him for his choice to not close up with an obligatingstyle ending but to choose a really haunting crusher of one instead. And Mr. Clark shoots his film in a strong visualfocused documentary approach with long takes from his camera swinging back and forth between the gossiping teenagers. He also pays good attention to their surroundings showing the conditions and lack of concern from their peers and elders that resulted in their being this way. Because he has a screenplay that is focused and sharp Bully did not his movie has a purpose and even his seemingly pornographic shots have a purpose as well.The content is oftentimes appalling but it also has a purpose. This time I must appreciate Mr. Clark's boldness and reluctance to be contrived. Whereas I got the sense he was indulging the drug use and sex in Bully here he clearly defines his intentions of turning our stomachs. These particular kids are scum and they are a product of their scummy environment. He wants to show us that. So the scenes of underage sex are jawdropping. They do not turn on the audience they appall. Furthermore he does not flood the screen with images of naked teenage bodies and relies on our imagination at crucial moments to exploit the real horror. He balances the explicit and implicit with professional craftsmanship.Kids is a very tough movie to watch and tough to enjoy but I must confess that it is to my mind a truly great film. As I sat there watching it I was appalled and disgusting and flabbergasted but at the same time I was drawn in. Mr. Clark's brilliant portrait of the bad side of humanity in our younger generation grips you by the throat and he never lets go. Not once. He's also got some very strong performances from his cast which include Leo Fitzpatrick a very young Rosario Dawson Chloe Sevingy and the late Justin Pierce whose brilliant performance reminds me so much of the scumbags that I had the displeasure to know in my adolescent years. I personally managed to avoid their paths of life and now looking at Kids I am even more thankful that I did.".

There's Tully the smooth talking deflowering and HIV positive teen Casper the cool hyped up and not all there teen and Jennie the girl who is full of depression and anger for the deflower man.  The film doesn't have much of a direct screenplay mostly dialogue you would hear while around friends which is good for the type of movie being made here.  The film gains much controversy by stating whether its true to life or just a mindless depiction of what could happen in the city.

I never hung out with people that acted like that and i've never publicly exploited myself like many of those girls did. It was really sad for me to realize how accurate the movie was though. It makes the movie Thirteen look like a Disney movie. The movie makes me want to lock any future kids I end up having in a box and not let them out until they are 30. It's definitely a movie parents should see. I've had way too many friends who's parents live this life of ignorance. They turn their backs and deny that their children could be doing anything wrong. It's true that you live and you learn but the scary thing is is that not all of the kids grow up and wake up.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think I've ever been more grossed out by an opening scene in a movie. The main character is tongue kissing what appears to be a thirteen year old girl over and over. The noise that it was making was particularly disgusting. Telly is only seventeen years old but he is already a real dirt bag. He steals money from his parents and tries to deflower as many girls as he can typically preying on girls that have just finished going through puberty. It is here that the main conflict of the movie is introduced. One of Telly's former conquests contracts HIV from him and tires to stop him from spreading his disease to his unsuspecting victims. Over the course of the movie at least three people are given the HIV virus from Telly the first virgin that he deflowers at the beginning of the film the second girl at the end of the film and the guy that they beat up in the park. But what I found troubling was that the girl who knew she got AIDS from him decided to just take some ecstasy and forget all about the fact that she was trying to stop him. She herself even becomes an instrument to spread AIDS by the end of the movie due to her irresponsible behavior. This is where the movie kind of just became an ambiguous story about how teenagers behave and forgot all about its own plot.Overall this movie mostly just felt like a public service announcement about the dangers of unsafe sex. I'm sure that back in the 90's when AIDS was an automatic death warrant this movie was very shocking and even more terrifying but in the twenty first century where AIDS has lost most of its potency due to modern medicine this film is little more than a friendly reminder that condoms can save you from a lot of problems. Kids is still a good movie and it's worth watching just don't expect to get any life changing message from it. Much of the point that it was trying to make back in '95 is just common knowledge nowadays but I would say that it is still worth a watch.".

The world can be a dark place. There ARE kids like this who are set on selfdestruction. If you look around you can see them.

What am I talking about? AIDS.Now I believe Kids is more than just a prosafe sex movie but what you take away from it is up to you. Everyone has an opinion on why kids grow up like this so I won't subject you to my opinion. As for it being exploitative I'm kind of torn. On one hand it deals with very dark harsh moral subject matter. The filmmakers have tried and for the most part succeeded in telling a tale of growing up on the wrong side of the tracks so to speak. At the same time though they could have dealt with the proceedings a little more sensitively. For instance it would have been even more shocking if the filmmakers hadn't resorted to long drawn out scenes of simulated sex that were supposed to be horrifying but ultimately weren't.At the end of the day Kids showcases a nasty glimpse into a generation that is already messed up and concerned with growing up the fastest way possible. As a film it needs some serious work in areas but it's up front and harsh message remains clear to the end.".

When I saw the movie I took out by Blacklist and put the director and writer on the top. Kids has got to be one of the most exploitational pieces of cinematic garbage ever to be filmed.Kids is basically unnerving pornography disguised as an art flick and a social commentary. The message of Kids is this Kids suck! Kids are scum! Kids have turned America into a raging hellhole!Just about everyone in this movie does drugs has sex and beats up people. All the kids talk about is sex or how their last experience was quite graphically I might add. The movie later goes on to state that most of America's teenagers act like this! Kids is propaganda. Kids gives in to stereotypes especially the stereotype that adults commonly have of teenagers today that they are drugusing Satanworshipping unprotectedsexhaving degenerates which for the most part is entirely untrue!. Kids is to teenagers what Nazi propaganda was to the Jews.I do know that drugs and sex are a problem for some teenagers living in America but certainly not to the extent that the movie portrays them. I would say that less than 1 of America's teenage population actually acts like the kids in Kids.Keep in mind that it is not just the message but how the message was expressed. Like I said before sex is all they talk about.The movie starts out with this slackjawed idiot teenager named Telly trying to persuade this teenage girl into having sexual intercourse. The girl says yes and pretty soon they are going at it. He walks outside to meet his scumbag friend and tells him how he only likes virgins even referring to himself as the virgin surgeon. The movie then cuts to two girls who have had sex with this neanderthalic bastard as they are talking about their experience with him. They then go to a health clinic where one of the girls is tested positive with AIDS. The AIDS girl then tries to stop this selfproclaimed fck monster from infecting other innocent teenage girls. In the process she stumbles upon all sorts of questionable activity. She sees a vicious fight drug parties rampant and graphically ridiculous sex including three girls on one guy and contempt for humanity. All of those activities involved teenagers. She eventually makes it to a party where Telly is picking up his next victim where she tried to save her but she is too stoned to do anything. She is then raped by one of the partygoers who takes advantage of her stoned state. That last scene has got to be one of the most graphic and unnecessary scenes ever filmed. The camera shows everything and never goes away.The scenery is appalling too. You see grungy apocalyptic rundown apartments where little boys are smoking marajuana and having sex where filth and contempt are so rampant that you want to throw up. This my friends is the true definition of propaganda. There is one big thing that this movie is lacking TRUTH!Don't get me wrong the film was wellmade. They did ever so great a job at conveying how scummy us teenagers are. The movie was original wellacted and brilliantly directed. If only that skill was used to make a truthful movie.I consider the Harmony Korine the writer who was only 19 at the time to be a sellout to all the teenagers out there. He made us look bad and in doing so he attracted the attention of a media who is ever so eager to spread controversy. He took advantage of gullible adult minds and from all of these atrocities he became a somewhat succesful filmmaker. He pulled a fast one on America. He now has parents and liberal critics saying that everyone should see this. It is proclaimed as a masterpiece and a wakeup call to the world. Sorry Mr. Korine your film is just propaganda filth. You add fuel to the antiteenage campaign that has been a serious problem in the last ten years already being fueled by uptight soccer moms the Christian Coalition and the Media itself. These are the people who say that kids nowadays are evil and out of control and that today's young generation has gone down the gutter.To all readers out there I suggest that you see Kids. Don't see it to take it seriously see it to get an idea of how art can be used to twist the truth. See Kids to get an idea of how Adult America sees us.We teenagers are decent people that is the bottom line.".

She eventually makes it to a party where Telly is picking up his next victim where she tried to save her but she is too stoned to do anything. She is then raped by one of the partygoers who takes advantage of her stoned state. That last scene has got to be one of the most graphic and unnecessary scenes ever filmed. The camera shows everything and never goes away.The scenery is appalling too. You see grungy apocalyptic rundown apartments where little boys are smoking marajuana and having sex where filth and contempt are so rampant that you want to throw up. This my friends is the true definition of propaganda. There is one big thing that this movie is lacking TRUTH!Don't get me wrong the film was wellmade. They did ever so great a job at conveying how scummy us teenagers are. The movie was original wellacted and brilliantly directed. If only that skill was used to make a truthful movie.I consider the Harmony Korine the writer who was only 19 at the time to be a sellout to all the teenagers out there. He made us look bad and in doing so he attracted the attention of a media who is ever so eager to spread controversy. He took advantage of gullible adult minds and from all of these atrocities he became a somewhat succesful filmmaker. He pulled a fast one on America. He now has parents and liberal critics saying that everyone should see this. It is proclaimed as a masterpiece and a wakeup call to the world. Sorry Mr. Korine your film is just propaganda filth. You add fuel to the antiteenage campaign that has been a serious problem in the last ten years already being fueled by uptight soccer moms the Christian Coalition and the Media itself. These are the people who say that kids nowadays are evil and out of control and that today's young generation has gone down the gutter.To all readers out there I suggest that you see Kids. Don't see it to take it seriously see it to get an idea of how art can be used to twist the truth. See Kids to get an idea of how Adult America sees us.We teenagers are decent people that is the bottom line.";

You should watch it with your teenagers and let them know what really happens of they get involved with these important facts. Let then know what drugs and sex will come out with them at a young stage.

Everyone warns her to stay away from her upstairs neighbor but he is the only one who shows any kindness. Supposedly the neighbor below her is an 80 year old woman but she hammers the floor so hard when the young woman moves furniture that she breaks tiles. Another neighbor seems kind enough to begin with but later seems more interfering and threatening. Also her weatherman boyfriend can't be ruled out.

The movie The 4th Floor has a lot of false leads as to who the person or persons are that are terrorizing the hell out of Jane. If your very attentive you'll notice something almost at the beginning of the movie that is repeated in the films final sequence why all of this is happening to her. After her Aunt Cecile was killed from a fall down the stairs of her building it was found out in Aunt Cecile's lease that she put Jaen on it as cooccupant to her apartment. Jane was all set to move in with her boyfriend Greg Harrison William Hurt a local TV weatherman in the house that he just bought in the New York city suburb of Westchester County. Jaen instead canceled her plans in order to move into that empty and very affordable apartment in the city. As soon as Jaen moved in things began to happen all originating from the 4th floor the apartment just underneath her. The director and writer of the movie The 4th Floor leave a lot of red herrings as well as yellow and orange maggots and white and gray mice to what is behind all this and you almost suspect everyone in the movie that Jaen comes in contact with. The ending is quite a surprise because even when it comes it still may keep you hanging as to what was the reason for tormenting Jaen and driving her almost mad and out of her brownstone apartment. The very last scene in the movie really explains it all. Besides Juliette Lewis William Hurt is very good in an unusually small but important role so are Shelley Duvall Martha Stewart no not the Martha Stewart in the news. There's also Austin Pendleton Mr. Collins as Jaen's neighbors and a very good performance by Tobin Bell the locksmith and nextdoor neighbor of Jean who knew a lot more to what was happening in Jane's building then what he let her on to. Tensionpack and really creepy movie that will make your skin crawl as Jaen is slowly constricted by the four walls around her as the terror that's a lot closer to her then she thinks closes in on her for the movies surprising as well as really weird and shocking conclusion.The 4th Floor is a lot better then you would or I did expect from many of the negative reviews that it got and is well worth seeing.".

Lewis plays a niece who inherits a rentcontrolled apartment in the big city NY of course and along the lines of Rosemary's Baby starts to realize there is something strange happening in the building.Some of the tenants are Shelley Duvall Austin Pendleton and the locksmith Tobin Bell always excellent and creepy. There are some scenes reminiscent of Hitchcock's Rear Window as Ms. Lewis is observing the goingson in her neighborhood be careful of what you may find out! The movie culminates in terror and if you have ever lived alone in a city with strange neighbors you will enjoy this movie. Watch it on a rainy night better than the original When a Stranger Calls. 910".

Over time Jane comes to meet the various people that make up the rest of the tenants. They include a snoopy loopy old lady a slightly unhinged superintendent a mysterious but kind old man a blind and deaf old couple and a rather meanspirited old woman. Not to mention the man across the way from her may be a murderer but hey can't win 'em all right? Amidst all this Jane finds herself being attacked by the woman living one floor below obsessing over the oral disturbances that Jane just can't seem to cut out.So yeah rather a predictable old plot but still unique in a strange way. I own the movie and have watched it a few times already. Perhaps its the atmosphere and quirky in some cases almost stereotyped characters that keep me coming back. Perhaps its the smooth creepy music or use of scenery. Then again it's probably Tobin Bell in his role as the Locksmith. Yeah that could be it too...".

The other tenants in the building are very strange Jerry Artie Lange Martha Shelley Duvall and the woman on the floor below her are very shady as well as the man across the street Tobin Bell. Mr. Collins Austin Pendleton seems to be the only normal person in the building. However odd and eerie things begin happening in the apartment below her and Juliette Lewis suspects that things are not what they seem. This was much better than I had expected with an allstar cast and a good script this movie went a long way. Suspense and mystery made this a winwin movie with barely a boring moment. Beware of the many red herrings in this movie almost every character could be a murderer. I strongly recommend this eerie thriller!Rated R for Violence Brief Nudity and Profanity.Grade C".

A lone woman or just lone person moving into a flat in a building filled with psychos is a popular theme. Second of all the story might work up until the end. Then it usually falls apart more or less completely the way it does here.Juliette Lewis and William Hurt are both decent actors and they do a decent job here. The supporting actors have bigger problems with Shelley Duvall and Austin Pendleton both coming off as completely unbelievable characters playing neighbors in the strange house.What i think worked well in this movie is first off the house itself. It's got a nice Gothic New Yorkfeel to it with seedy rundown interiors and huge staircases. Also like i said above Hurt and Lewis do their parts OK although i feel Hurt almost always has something a bit unnatural about him. I don't know what it is but his delivery is slow and contemplated almost theaterlike. It's not always fitting.The negative aspects are mostly the supporting actors which have a hard time with the script giving them characters that are just too much to believe. The one that stands out especially though is Sabrina Grdevich as Lewis work colleague. She seems to be in a pornomovie or something of the kind flirting with the camera no matter what she's saying. Also the script has other problems mostly with plausibility. That is not unexpected though as these kinds of movies usually need a villain capable of extremely intricate measures for a very small potential gain.In the genre this is not a disaster. I can't say i recommend it though. 510.".

My advice to him is to stick to that job.After a couple of minutes I already figured out the ending.

Besides The Shining I don't think that I ever have seen her in a other movie. I also enjoyed Tobin Bell who I like as an actor. Too bad he never ever really stars in big roles in big productions. William Hurt is a good actor but his role was simply too small in this movie to be really notable.I can't think of any reason why you should watch this movie.

She is warned by one payed by an almost unrecognizable Shelley Duvall to stay away from certain tenants and is given a list of rules of the building that would choke a horse. All heck breaks loose from there. The film is very predictable and the stalker of Ms. Lewis should be learned of by mid film for many viewers. Lewis is an interesting actress and is not hard to look out but the real disappointment is William Hurt who plays Lewis' weatherman boyfriend. Hurt looks bored has a very bad hair weave and its sad that an actor with his status has been reduced to second rate roles. No fire in him at all. Overall '4ht Floor' is a mediocre flick and cant be over soon enough. rated 2 of 5 stars.".

Story is about a young woman who moves into her late aunts apartment but her boyfriend wants her to move in with him. Juliette Lewis plays Jane Emelin and William Hurt is the weatherman Greg Harrison who is dating her. Jane moves in and meets all the strange tenants like Shelley Duvall who is the resident snoop. Austin Pendleton is always running up the stairs in a long coat to try and avoid Duvall and Artie Lange is the Super who lives in the basement. Once she is in her apartment she watches the tenants in the other building Like Rear Window and thinks she might have witnessed the locksmith murdering his wife. The neighbor below Jane keeps banging on her floor and leaving notes telling her to keep the noise down and gives her instructions on when she can make noise. Jane bangs on their door and replies to the notes but no one answers the door. Soon Jane has maggots coming up out of her drain and is plagued by mice! This little film is directed by Josh Klausner who has worked primarily with the Farrelly brothers. Its his first job as the main director and he does a pretty adequate job. Its not fancy but he seems to know exactly what he's doing. Klausner also wrote the script and its not predictable For the most part and as I watched this film I have to be honest and say I really didn't know what was going to happen next. You watch each strange character and its hard to guess who is doing what. SPOILER ALERT The one aspect of the film that didn't surprise me was the fact that the character by Pendleton is behind everything. He came across as the only normal guy so of course he's behind it all. But wait! He's not the only one behind it and the last shot of the painting with Pendleton and Hurt together is one that I did not expect. At the beginning of the film I suspected Hurt but then I figured it was someone else. This is one of the few times that Lewis has actually played a normal role. She carries the film well but why would she be dating a dullard like Hurt? And after all the maggots why didn't she call the health commission? Isn't it the job of the exterminators to report things like that? This is just nitpicking because the film does keep you guessing and its not a bad overall thriller.".

Still I will give her credit for trying hard and doing a better job than she has done in the past. William Hurt on the other hand seems to have deteriorated since his great acting days in such films as Broadcast News  Body Heat. The second problem with the film is too many questions are left unanswered. That causes the film to lose direction. Finally the biggest problem is the film has no believability to it. For this film to be successful you have to believe what you are seeing in order for it to surprise you later. At the first sign of trouble most people would have left the building but the character Jane seems impervious to every attempt to scare her off.

Jane Lewis has recently inherited a terrific 5th floor apartment from her grandmother and per agreement with the landlord gets a ridiculously low renting rate. Her boyfriend William Hurt as a creepy weather man wants her to move in with him but she wants her own space. So she moves in and weird stuff starts happening and because this is a Bgrade horror flick there's a dumb nottobefoundinreality reason why. As the nonetoointriguing Jane keeps trying to tell others her boyfriend the police coworkers what's going on everybody thinks she's losing it. So of course she has to face the problem the lunatic living right below her alone. Neither scary nor interesting The movie's single saving grace is Lewis. She's a very fine actress but poorly used here which is not to say she isn't the best thing about this flick because she is. She has feral charisma and holds the screen better than a dozen of the silicone bimbos that routinely populate this type of movie. This type of movie though is not worthy of her which is ironic given that she's probably the only reason anyone would see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "As with many other independent films this one is weak in the acting directing and some of the technical production. Christmas Mountain is a good Western story about the real meaning of Christmas. Unfortunately the weaknesses detract from the film and that sense of Christmas.Mark Miller and Slim Pickens are fine as Gabe and Murf respectively. But most of the rest of cast seem hesitant at times. They often seem as though they are waiting for a cue for their next line or movement. One character comes across as very selfconscious of his role to the point that he seems like he was in rehearsal for a play. That's Mr. Findley the store owner. It's strange that he isn't listed in the credits of the film because he is one of the major supporting actors. I have no idea who the actor is playing that role.Had the filmmakers done better jobs in a number of areas this could have been a much better movie. Consider this one serious problem with the script. Christmas is just a couple of days away. The dialog of the few townspeople playing cards is a dead giveaway of a huge problem in the plot. The sheriff says I think someone should do something wondrous for that poor shepherd family up on Christmas Mountain. A woman being a widow and all and having a baby soon. Then Rev. Thorndike says Both of those poor women losing their husbands in that avalanche last year  my prayer is with them. If the avalanche was the previous year and Christmas is about to be here this year that means that the men probably died in the avalanche the previous December or even earlier. So here's one of the wives now expecting a baby  12 months or more later. I don't think the plot meant to imply anything else so this is an obvious major goof in the screenplay. I can't believe nobody involved with the film caught that. It would have been simple to have had the avalanche at the end of last winter or early spring the end of March and not raised eyebrows or distracted viewers. The fantasy aspect of this film has Gabe seeing his friend Murf who died the previous year. Murf appears to him and says he is an angel. Most Christian faiths don't hold that humans become angels after they die. But some faiths and fiction stories over the ages refer to people who have died as being angels. This movie was filmed in Utah. The scenic outdoor shots mostly likely were in the UintaWasatchCache National Forest.".

Then the military had just taken over and the political climate of the country was uncertain. As Christian kids enjoying a Christmas vacation in a predominantly Muslim area we were understandably scared of whether the Muslims will use the coup as an excuse to massacre Christians.Then out of the blue this wonderful whimsical movie was aired on TV.The film centered on an ex convict and his relationship with a poor Mexican family especially the little boy that inadvertently brought out the heart the ex con never knew he had. The ex con now finds himself trying to help the family overcome their poverty and finds himself pitted against a reluctant white community who felt they had given the Mexican family all the help they deserved.Despite all the problems facing the Mexicans the little boy still has time to pray for the ex con. The prayer is answered in the form of a cowboy angel. The angel had died years ago but the con knew him when the angel was alive. It is up to the angel and the boy to show the con that he was a better man than he believed himself to be.In today's Hollywood with the pervading sense of cynicism and materialism and atheism the movie will be scoffed as being corny and clichd. Definitely its a low budget movie with a simple storyline. But still a beautiful movie with even a more beautiful message of hope and love. The final scene when the ex con was leaving the Mexican family and the kid was chasing him for a final goodbye was a tear jerker. I can still remember how my younger sister and myself cried silently.The film is a gem and I thank both the movie producers and the channel that aired it on TV. At least because of it some frightened kids that were hiding in unwarranted terror of being killed by Muslims were able to lose some of their fear and realize that hope really sets us free.".

	schema:headline " Holds Up VERY WELL to The Great Escape";
	schema:reviewBody "Updated review I just read the book by the same name. The film tells about 40 of the book and differ's significantly with Mr. Cowards escape. I originally rated this film an 8 of 10 but after reading the book I'm downgrading it to a 6. Coward was sent to a camp near Auschwitz and almost half the book deals with his time there. He discovered there was a British Officer of Jewish blood who was put in the death camp and Coward managed to swap places with a Jew inside Auschwitz to try to rescue this British POW from certain death! If you can imagine the courage that feat alone took you get the idea of a man who lived as if he had nothing to lose almost inviting death to take him throughout his 7 escapes yes 7 times he crossed the wire. The film on reflection is quite shallow in it's telling of Mr. Cowards story. Because of his night inside Auschwitz he was later to become a key witness in repatriation trials against the German firms that used slave labor. Perhaps because of the time this film was made early 60's with the cold war in it's full intensity and the West embracing our now West German ally and the fact that Mr. Cowards tale of Auschwitz may have be well known with the press coverage of trials he was a witness in the film took a lightharded look at the book. On it's own it is an entertaining film to watch but now in balance after reading the book which itself wasn't the best written but just the incredible story itself is riveting it's a shame that a more wasn't put into the film than the Hogans Heroes treatment this film got. I really hope they remake this film and have the whole story inside about the time Coward killed his oppressive Guard with an overdose about the Polish Underground Army and the TNT that was smuggled into Auschwitz to blow up the incinerators and factory by the Jews about the hooker that Coward tried to pay for to seek shelter for the night but instead took him to the police about the time Coward stumbled into a V1 research plant and how he got that info to the British at home I mean NONE of that is in the film and it's just an incredible story. Following is my original review before reading the book I have seen the Great Escape at least a half dozen times and its a Guy Movie Icon. I even watched it one time on TNT and it was like over 3 hours long with the commercials just to see Steve Mcqueen jump the barb wire wanted to see if I could tell when the stuntman was in I guess. Anyway I watch it that long and they actually cut that scene out! Boy was I p.o.'d but it shows you how I loved that movie. I just watch Password is Courage and it was a real treat! I found it a very entertaining movie and I loved seeing Bogarde he was awesome. I did laugh out loud a couple of times at this and it had to be a partial inspiration for the TV show Hogans Heroes. Some of these reviewers to me don't seem to realize that Great Escape and this movie are both based on the same true event so that's why they are both similar LOL! It isn't that one or the other is a copy! Also the character of SGT Major Coward is a REAL person! He is listed right there on the opening credits as a technical adviser! I did a very limited amount of research after watching this movie because if HALF of this movie is actually true Mr Coward has some real big brass ones! What did I find out in just 5 minutes of a Google search? Mr Coward saved 400800 Jews from death at Auschwitz! I just ordered the book by the same name to read more about a truly brave and blessed man Charles Coward. And to the people that find the prisoners having a good attitude hard to swallow thats one reason why escapes were organized and are still taught to the US military so you don't grow into despair! Plus since Mr. Coward himself was technical adviser I'm gonna take his word that most of this actually happened. See it and than you'll probably want to know more about this man's story!".

	onyx:emotionText "Updated review I just read the book by the same name. The film tells about 40 of the book and differ's significantly with Mr. Cowards escape. I originally rated this film an 8 of 10 but after reading the book I'm downgrading it to a 6. Coward was sent to a camp near Auschwitz and almost half the book deals with his time there. He discovered there was a British Officer of Jewish blood who was put in the death camp and Coward managed to swap places with a Jew inside Auschwitz to try to rescue this British POW from certain death! If you can imagine the courage that feat alone took you get the idea of a man who lived as if he had nothing to lose almost inviting death to take him throughout his 7 escapes yes 7 times he crossed the wire.

The fact that it was based on a true story makes it even better as far as I am concerned. One of the other reviewers says the film isn't quite sure whether it should be serious or not. Perhaps it is supposed to be both. The fact that it tells a true story is great and that some fun could be had in the midst of all the war surely helped pass the time and elevate the spirits of the prisoners. One of the other reviewers noted that The village scenes are quite obviously filmed in England with little attempt to disguise any telltale signs. Probably very true  I go to the cinema to be entertained not to be critical of the movie. As a nonBrit I wouldn't be able to know about the carriages etc so it would not affect my appreciation of the film as it did his.

It is a much more light hearted view of his imprisonment in a POW camp and his efforts to escape and cause the Nazis as much trouble as possible including the hilarious burning down of an entire lumber yard. It may not have the range of actors and characters of The Great Escape but for anyone who enjoyed that movie should definitely see this as well.

This movie in particular is one of my alltime favorite movies of this type. Dirk Bogarde portrays a reallife personality in the name of Sergeant Major Coward. I think that Bogardes acting in this film was most excellent and is one reason why this film must be remembered and brought back into mainstream movie watching.This film though is a serious film also has many comical moments in it as well. One moment I really liked was when the Allied POWs managed to sabotage two German trains by switching their delivery signs around as well as sabotaging parts on the trains to make sure the trains wrecked. Another comical moment is when their camp was almost burnt down to the ground when they made sure a careless German Unteroffizier who had a routine when he smoked his pipe that the allied prisoners quickly caught onto and set up an elaborate plan. The plan was that they switched the sand in the Firebuckets with Petrolunbeknownst by the German guards.On a particular windy day the German NCO was careless a usual by throwing his match into a pile of woodwhich immediately started a fire. The POWs then threw the contents of the buckets onto the firemaking it rapidly spread. In short they almost completed in burning down that camp.This movie was so well made that it really needs to be released in DVD so that we all can enjoy watching it over and over again.".

The rest of the characters are a bit muddled in and simply not interesting enough. The movie also changes often of setting with as a result that new characters get introduced and old ones abandoned.All in all its not a terribly memorable movie and certainly no classic.

	schema:reviewBody "I First saw this film on its release in 1962. Unfortunalely I had read John Castle's biography of sargant major Charles Coward before I saw the film. A large section of the book deals with Coward's attempts to help Jews escape from the Auchwitz death camp. The film dealt with this by having a five minute segment where Henry Piek's drawings of the horrors of Auchwitz are shown with Dirk Bogarde giving a voice over commentary. Well at least it was a film that mentioned the Hollocaust . A very rear thing in the early 1960's. I saw this film again just recently on television and the Auchwitz segment had been edited out of the film. So now the film is just another Second World War adventure movie along with an unlikely romantic interest that was not in the biography Coward was married and very much devoted to his wife. But there is something about this film that makes it different from other British war time escape films. It is about ordinary soldiers and not officers. These soldiers have been put to work by the Germans and the p.o.w. camps do not have the air of the British public school. These other ranks do not just try to escape but commit dangerous acts of sabotage. Therefore on the whole this film is still worth seeing. It it was great to see the wonderful Dirk Bogarde playing a cockney character part that he does so well.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this film a lot. So much in fact I've lost count. I always confuse it with The Foreman Goes To France because of the very similar type of endings that they both have.Dirk Bogarde is our hero a British Army SergeantMajor who as an enlisted man later goes on to give his word as an Officer slight mistake there. He's a prisoner of war and by the sounds of it he's been escaping from lots of places hence him being in a rather unpleasant camp as the film starts.Him and his best pal are constantly trying to escape or wind up The Goons. Most of the escapes get scuppered but they are often successful at upsetting the Germans and hindering them.They are digging a tunnel and disposing of the dirt in a storyline that was directly stolen by the film The Great Escape. Perhaps they were using the same techniques in a different camp. When pushed in tight situations people will come up with the same ideas in different places.Dirk is moved by The Germans to a lumber camp on a work detail to command some lazy troops. But The Germans have sent Dirk and his best pal into a trap to be killed by people who think they are spies traitors or 5th columnists. Dirk fights his way through and defuses the situation bringing the so called lazy troops over to his way of thinking to upset and confound The Germans.They manage to burn down the lumber camp and get sent to a train yard. At the train yard they sabotage trains sending them to the wrong places.Finally Dirk makes contact with The Polish underground who give them maps and assistance to escape. Oh and the password was actually Cleaning Cloths not Courage.They are sent back to their original camp and escape through a tunnel that was dug too short again another idea that The Great Escape stole from them. An old soldier with an accordion pretends to be drunk and saves a whole hut full of escaping men from being discovered.After a poor attempt at buying train tickets making a fellow train passenger suspect them they are caught by a badly forged travel document with a logo facing the wrong way.Dirk and his best pal finally escape posing as workers repairing bombed buildings who are finally met by retreating American soldiers telling them they are only a mile away from the Allied lines but there are thousands of Germans in their way.Of course they steal a Fire Engine and The Germans stand aside to let them through and finally on the road to freedom.A good ending and an excellent film.".

Everyone else turns in such lightweight portrayals you'd think they were vacationing in a holiday camp. Even the Germans are an unconvincing lot. On the plus side the movie does present some spectacular moments for railroad buffs and the photography is suitably bleak.

I must say that I was very disappointed. Like one of your other reviewers says the film isn't quite sure whether it should be serious or not. The fact that it tells a true story is a shame because this shambles of a movie makes a mockery of the courage of it's subject. I'm surprised Dirk Bogarde got mixed up in it.The village scenes are quite obviously filmed in England  there seems to have been little attempt to disguise any Englishness in the village which was used. There are modern electric light switches clearly visible in the living quarters of the lady optician. In one scene you can see traffic passing in the background which is clearly contemporary for 1962 not WW2. The railway carriages ar patently those in use by British Rail in the 1960's. The detail on some of the German uniforms leaves a lot to be desired too. I could go on but I won't. Suffice to say I won't be watching again.The film has the feel of an amateur dramatic group being let loose for a weekend with a film crew that just happened to be available and a lorry load of uniforms handy for everyone to strut around in.Poor stuff 110".

	schema:headline " Engrossing Revolutionary War tale though not historical";
	schema:reviewBody "Being Canadian I probably know fewer details of the Revolutionary War than the average U.S. viewer but note that many seem absolutely outraged at the historical untruths of this movie. When I watched it I personally found it quite captivating but always have enough sense not to get my history from Hollywood. Since my viewing I've looked up some info and note various inaccuracies such as misplaced characters exaggeration of British atrocities inaccurate torching of a church with townsfolk inside being burned alive and depiction of American owned slaves being freed to serve in the Continental Army. Apparently it was the British who promised to free them if they joined their forces but later reneged. My apologies if my facts aren't straight. It's the FICTIONAL story of a widowed South Carolina farmer Benjamin Martin who is disgusted by his past supposedly heroic deeds during the French Indian Wars. He has resolved to avoid participation when the Colonies revolt against Britain and stay home to protect his seven children. However he witnesses atrocities against his two older sons Gabriel and Thomas by the cruel British Colonel Tavington. Gabriel the oldest has joined the battle against the Redcoats early on been captured and sentenced by Tavington to hang. Thomas the second son attempts to free Gabriel as he is being taken away only to be killed by Tavington right in front of his father. This forces the reluctant Benjamin into the fray organizing a local militia group of farmers and ex Indian fighters who will tie up the British until the French arrive.Mel Gibson gives a moving portrayal of the father who is driven into a battle he sought to avoid in order to protect his family from the British. For me his personal and family story is the essence of the tale. Just as one would expect Benjamin Martin comes across as very sympathetic and heroic. Apparently this character is sort of a composite of possibly three different real men of that era. The film has wonderful period costumes though also like Gibson's earlier Braveheart more than enough violence for my taste. However it did bring to life for me the Revolutionary War unfortunately in a purely fictional rather than historical way. Though I enjoyed this picture it seems to have taken a lot of liberties with the truth. The movie should therefore be considered strictly as entertainment not a history lesson.".

Nicely made with good characters good acting a strong storyline and fabulous cinematography.But to say this movie distorts history would be an understatement.  And that is extremely sad in a movie that sells itself as an accurate portrayal of events during the revolution.  The Patriot unfortunately crosses the line and try's to portray as 'actual fact' a film which is predominantly fictional.  Hence the 'real life' equivalent of Benjamin Martin actually used to scalp Native Americans in his spare time a fact neatly overlooked by the director.This 'rose tinted' view of history is at its worst during the churchburning scene where a British Army officer ordered the murder of many innocent civilians by locking them in a church and setting it alight.  This event never took place and yet thanks to The Patriot a whole generation of Americans will believe that the British Army actually committed this horrendous act in South Carolina  when in fact history shows that it was not the British Army that burned a church full of people in 1776 but the Nazis that did during WW2.As a Brit I don't so much mind Hollywood always portraying us as the 'bad guys'  after all it is American money making these films  I'm more concerned that some Americans actually believe what they watch.  This is especially true in movies like The Patriot which 'pretend' to be real.It's a shame that in such a technically competent movie which pays such attention to minutiae detail like the costumes that something as significant as the accuracy of the screenplay could have been so grotesquely overlooked.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Patriot the story of an American farmer who fights in the War of Independence is sometimes used together with Braveheart as evidence of a supposed antiBritish prejudice on the part of Mel Gibson. This is perhaps unfair to Gibson who has gone on record as supporting the ties between Australia and the British monarchy hardly the stance of a Brithating bigot. Although Braveheart which he produced and directed was very much Gibson's own pet project he was neither the producer director or scriptwriter of The Patriot. Indeed he was not even first choice to play the lead. The producers originally wanted Harrison Ford who turned the part down reportedly because he felt that the script turned the American Revolution into the story of one man's quest for revenge.Because of its antiBritish stance the film was badly received in Britain. One newspaper accused it of blackening the character of the British officer Banastre Tarleton who served as the inspiration for the villainous Colonel Tavington. One commentator went so far as to say that it was the sort of film that the Nazis might have made about the American Revolution had they won World War II. Unlike some of my fellowcountrymen I was not too worried about this aspect of the film. The total death toll in the American War of Independence was remarkably low not only by modern standards but even by the standards of other wars of this era such as the Napoleonic War. Nevertheless in every war ever fought there have been crimes on both sides and the War of Independence was no exception. The rebels could be as ruthless as the British but none of their atrocities are shown in this film. Some of the deeds attributed to Tavington may be fictitious such as the churchburning scene but in real life Tarleton had a welldeserved reputation for brutality and was not only loathed by the American colonists but also distrusted by his own side. In the film the British commander Lord Cornwallis is shown as outwardly gentlemanly and honourable but prepared secretly to countenance Tavington's methods. In reality Cornwallis wanted to have Tarleton courtmartialled Tarleton was only saved by his influential connections.I did however have some reservations about the way these events were portrayed. It was originally intended to make the film about Francis Marion a reallife figure. Unfortunately Marion although undoubtedly courageous and a skilled guerrilla leader was also a slaveowner as any landowner of substance in 1770s South Carolina would have been and was therefore deemed unworthy to be the hero of a modern blockbuster even though a TV series about him was made in the fifties. His exploits therefore are credited to a fictitious Benjamin Martin. The slavery issue could have been avoided by moving the action to say New England but instead the film gives us a wholly unrealistic picture of race relations in the period. The black workers on Martin's land are all free men and black and white live together in harmony with black soldiers willingly fighting alongside whites in the Continental Army. This sort of dishonest idealised portrayal of slavery was at one time common in films like Gone with the Wind but I thought that it had died out with the growth of the Civil Rights movement.Incidentally a reason why so many Southerners supported the revolutionaries was that slavery had been declared illegal in Britain itself in 1771 and they feared that the British Parliament would eventually legislate to ban it in the colonies. Needless to say there is no mention of this attitude in the film. In later life Tarleton became MP for Liverpool and a vehement defender of slavery. In this if in nothing else he and Marion had something in common.My other reservation about the film's political stance is similar to Ford's. The film probably concentrated so heavily on British brutality because it is difficult to interest a modern audience even an American audience in the actual reasons why the war was fought. It is easy to make out an intellectual case for the principle of no taxation without representation which had been part of British constitutional thought since at least the Civil War in the 1640s. It is much less easy to justify the spilling of blood in defence of that principle and Martin scarred by his experiences in the French and Indian Wars is originally shown as a pacifist unwilling to fight or to support the Declaration of Independence which he believes will lead to war. His son Gabriel however joins the Continental Army but is wrongly accused of being a spy and threatened with execution. Tavington believing Martin to be a rebel sympathiser burns down his home and murders another son Thomas. Martin is forced to take up arms to defend his family and then forms a guerrilla band which he leads against the British. Despite the title of the film however Martin is not really motivated by patriotism he seems less a patriot than a pacifist who has abandoned his principles in order to seek revenge.The film is attractively photographed although I felt that it sometimes showed a sanitised prettified version of eighteenthcentury life. In some ways it reminded me of The Last Samurai another visually attractive epic flawed by a dishonest approach to history and by excessive length although I would rate it slightly higher largely because Gibson makes a more commanding and impressive epic hero than does Tom Cruise. From the viewpoint of anyone without patriotic preconceptions it can be seen simply as an exciting if overlong adventure film my wife who is not British by birth was cheering on Martin and booing Tavington. Nevertheless its approach to history never gets beyond a simplified story of heroes and villains. 610".

Last I heard this was FICTION  NOT a documentary Ken Burns did not produce not write nor direct nor narrate this piece  Roland Emmerich a man known for action FICTION did. Yes the depiction of the Revolutionary War was NOT 100 accurate but was never intended to be just a drama set against the background of a war and it was refreshing to see the war in the background whereupon American blood is spilled on American soil was the Revolutionary War and not another Civil War piece indeed the Civil War has been played so many times in films over the past quarter century it was just refreshing to see a different war....Being somewhat of a military historian I will say that the depiction of soldiers going musket to musket in the open field was indeed accurate many may find it interesting to know that according to the gentlemanly practices of King George's army both sides would also recess for tea at noon every day and resume the fighting afterwards  guerrilla warfare was not popular during the day which is why Gibson's militia unit was so overtly successful early on. That being said the comments about the accuracy with the muskets are fairly accurate but I will say that I only see straight barrel musket rifles  none of the bell shape tipped muskets the longer you keep a projectile on a straight course the more accuracy at longer ranges despite the lack of rifling grooves in the barrels I spent time on Rifle Teams for 5 years. The prime inaccuracy I noted was when Tavington shot the rider running away on horseback in the back with a musket pistol at probably 40 yards or more  so unlikely it tarnished the whole scene.My favorite person  Billings Leon Rippey's cynical almost giggly snickering laugh completely stole the every scene where it was used and he is a long term favorite actor of mine Jason Isaacs absolutely best screen villain of this movie and perhaps in top 10 screen villains of all time.I guess it boils down to different strokes for different folks we all have our opinions on this and I've aired mine.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always had a weak spot for historically inspired dramas. I like movies like for instance Braveheart Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven. I don't like them because they give me some good insight on what that time period was like. Most of them aren't very accurate and if I want to know more about the real history I'll watch some documentaries or read a couple of books. No I watch this movies to be entertained and that's also the most important thing I focus on when reviewing this kind of movies Did I like what I saw or was it boring as hell? The story of the The Patriot is situated in South Carolina in 1776. Benjamin Martin a hero from the FrenchIndian war who has recently buried his wife is haunted by his notoriously brutal past. He decides not to take part in the American Revolution against the British because he wants to protect his family and doesn't want to leave them behind fatherless. When one of his sons who earlier on had enlisted against his will returns home it all starts to go terribly wrong. The son is arrested by the British Colonel Tavington and accused of being a spy. He will be executed but before it comes to that point one of Benjamin's other sons runs towards the soldiers and is instantly killed. This makes Martin decide to enlist anyway and he becomes the leader of a makeshift militia which consists of peasants slaves a minister and other irregulars. They are successful in their fights but will all soon be confronted with the personal consequences...As I already said in the introduction I'm not looking for historical accuracy because I know I'll not find it in movies like this one. Hollywood has a tradition of changing the actual facts to make a movie look more appealing for the audience and I'm sure the same has happened more than once with this movie as well. No what I want is entertainment and THAT I did get. Some major battle scenes some drama the obvious patriotism some decent acting... it can all be found in this movie and I must say that I liked it most of the time.The main problem that I had with this movie was the sometimes oh so obvious struggle for the American hearts. It's almost like if they forget that there are also people outside the USA who will watch their movies. All the Americans are good and all the English French... are bad and arrogant. Perhaps the American audience needs such stereotypes in order to be able to identify themselves with that fierce warrior on the big silver screen but personally I can see past that fake patriotism.Nevertheless this is an entertaining movie and I would say that it sure offers some good value for your money if you aren't looking for too much historical accuracy. The acting and most of the story like for instance the part in which he loses his boy are touching and more than OK. Overall I liked what I saw and that's why I give this movie a 7.510. It's no masterpiece but it sure is better than average.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Patriot is NOT a documentary. It didn't pretend to be and wasn't. Loosely based upon Francis Marion the Swamp Fox it only touched on Marion's impact on the Revolution in South Carolina. If anything it was downplayed. For instance in real life he had over 150 men in his guerrilla band. The movie portrayed him as having far fewer. As a documentary it fails on this and many other points. As a movie it is a tremendous success.As far as visuals they were stunning. The wideopen vistas and battle scenes were breathtaking and beautifully filmed. Yes it was violent but that lent a realism to the film that most other films about this era lack. The look and feel of this period was portrayed well.The acting was superb. I won't give anything away but this did NOT arguably have either an entirely Hollywood plot  people including civilians DIE as they do in war  or much of a Hollywood ending despite a relatively happy one. That was impressive and made the film genuine exciting and at times shocking. Plot points such as Benjamin Martin's youngest daughter's feelings about her daddy and the romance between his son and a young girl were touching and even emotional.I found some things complain about. Crisp clean brandnew Colonial American flags suddenly appear after and during the final battle. In reality they would have been rags by then  or at least not so clean. One bad bit of dialogue Benjamin Martin is on the beach with his sisterin law and he asks if he can sit down. Her reply It's a free country  or will be soon was a 20th century throwaway line dressed up with a 1780 caveat and I cringed at it.The film was historically accurate in many respects. The formal way of speaking plus the familyaboveall loyaltytoTheCause attitudes expressed throughout were genuine even though both are out of favor today. Children using weapons and going off to fight on a moment's notice was not an uncommon story and supposedly happened in a branch of my own family. Relationships like Martin's and his wife's sister did occur often out of necessity. I was surprised to read afterwards that the battle tactics of the last scene occurred almost exactly as shown at the Battle of Cowpens including fierce handtohand combat. Colonel Banastre Tarleton  the basis for the movie's character William Tavington  was indeed seen as a war criminal by American colonists at the time and the real Tarleton even had a horse shot out from under him!But was it biased? Sure it was. Roughly a third of the American colonists were Loyalists another third were rebels and another third were undecided. It would have made the story more complete and complex to portray this or the time Tarleton mistakenly slaughtered some of those very Loyalists! But I've read a poem online Ode to Valour dedicated to Col. Banastre Tarleton's heroic exploits that would shame modernday propagandists.I think we all accept that not every British officer of this era was a monster. In fact in the movie  as in real life  Cornwallis and other British officers were appalled that the GhostSwamp Fox did not play by the rules of civilized warfare and chastised characters like Tavington who also breached them. The real Swamp Fox knew a bit about balance however. After after the war when the real Francis Marion served in the South Carolina Senate he is said to have advocated a lenient policy toward the Loyalists. The real Tarleton survived the war went home to write his memoirs was seen as a hero and was elected to Parliament. Maybe we need a sequel to cover all of these other aspects of the story. Until then this one is a must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since the last film I reviewed was COME AND SEE the Soviet film depicting Nazi war crimes in Bylorussia in World War 2 most distressingly the inhabitants of a village being burned alive in a barn I thought it'd be a good idea to rewatch THE PATRIOT a film set during the American War of Independence starring Mel Gibson and directed by German Roland Emmerich to see if it's every bit as bad as I remembered and which caused a lot of controversy when it was released Unsurprisingly it is every bit as bad as I remembered . The battle scenes of massed ranks standing in front of one another firing muskets are vaguely realistic if only on a tactical level because in those days chivalry at its most basic still existed in the mind of military men and was a gentlemanly act . Strangely Richard Rodat  The screenwriter of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN  and Emmerich seem to have created an alternative universe where butchering the civilian population just because things were going slightly badly was part of a strategy by the Brits . There is some debate about atrocities happening during the period but historians are unanimous that while some things may have happened that could be classed as war crimes nothing on the scale as seen in here did happen during the period . It led to one critic Jonathan Foreman writing a famous article in The New York Post decrying THE PATRIOT as  blood libel  Interestingly the film draws attention to the fact that the colonial rebels were helped by the French . Before anyone starts to applaud this fact their role is totally downplayed . There is a French officer present who's aiding these patriots because his wife and children were burned to death by these nasty Brits . Goodness me according to this film the British empire's idea of war is stocking up on a lot of matches setting fire to the nearest passer by who can't fight back . You can almost understand why he likes to slaughter surrendering red coats and it's left to Mel Gibson  I won't refer to him as his character's name since he's Mel Gibson playing ... well Mel Gibson  to point out that killing unarmed prisoners is wrong . Interesting too that that it's heavily implied at the end of the film the French only turned up at the end when the war was effectively over . I think that might have been true of America's role at the end of WW1 but certainly wasn't true of the French in the American War Of Independence . France  Holland and Spain all gave military help to the colonials throughout the war especially naval power . Effectively the whole world was against Britain helping the revolutionaries on land and sea In this version of America everyone lived in a multi ethnic egalitarian utopia where all men are equal before God . Not only were black people not slaves but if look closely you can spot the occasional black face walking along streets unhindered .One can understand how much hatred Spike Lee has for the film and has been very vocal about it and it really is laughably bad the way the film spins out how much equality is afforded to African Americans in the late 1770s . It's a bit like watching a version of SCHINDLER'S LIST were no one actually gets murdered for being Jewish . Just for the record Britain abolished slavery in 1807 while the Americans didn't get round to it for decades later . This is a movie that shows Hollywood at its very worst . If it'd been made by a bunch of American journeymen film makers it would have just been Hollywood rubbish . However since I'd previously seen COME AND SEE it does leave a very disgusting taste in the mouth that it stars Mel Gibson and has been made by a German director . The only good thing to say about it is that it's so bad that no one will be able to take it seriously".

	schema:headline " A failed action movie that distorts history in every way possible.";
	schema:reviewBody "We all know and have seen the bias that is almost always presented in books such as American books of history. For example many historical books I've read praise America no matter what circumstance they're in such as during the Revolution or Civil War. Even during such tragic events as the 1833 Trail of Tears Indian massacre you'll rarely read any criticism of it in the typical history book.Why? Because it's about America. America has built up a false image of itself America is shown as omnipotent with no nation able to even hope to match its power and it shows America to be a pure nation with few if any faults.Obviously we all know that that image couldn't be farther from the truth as America has numerous faults and many nations have the same if not more power than America.But unfortunately America won't stop brainwashing the public and make them aware that this image is false. The Patriot is a prime example of this propaganda.Basically Mel Gibson plays as an invincible farmer who has a vendetta against the British as he does in almost all of his historical movies. Once again he plays the role as someone who despises the British more than any other human on Earth. I didn't watch this whole movie mainly because I am simply too disgusted to watch it. Though a few parts of the movie are historically accurate such as the decisive British victory at the Battle of Camden but the rest of it is nothing but American flagwaving idiocy.One scene that I really despise is when Gibson and his two sons fight a squad of British troops who are taking a prisoner away. His sons have dead accuracy and Mel displays superhuman strength as he kills over 10 British troops  including their officer  without taking a scratch. Historically any rebel foolish enough to attack even two British troops would quickly be killed. But no the directors made the movie as far from historically accurate as possible so Mel slaughters the troops. Another scene I hate is when the British are shown to burn down a church trapping the people inside. What were those idiotic directors thinking!!? Great Britain's state religion was Protestantism even if a British officer ordered a Protestant church to be burned he would executed for high treason against the church. Burning churches was something the Nazis did not the British but apparently the directors were so braindead that they decided to make the Britsh do this. Another scene I hate is when Tavington kills an innocent civilian for no reason. Tavington is based on the reallife Colonel Banastre Tarleton an excellent Britsh commander of cavalry. He was an excellent general not a coldblooded killer and most likely he never shot an innocent civilian in cold blood.Allinall this movie is just plain terrible. The fact that it is so incredibly historically inaccurate simply ruins the movie entirely.".

Another scene I hate is when Tavington kills an innocent civilian for no reason. Tavington is based on the reallife Colonel Banastre Tarleton an excellent Britsh commander of cavalry. He was an excellent general not a coldblooded killer and most likely he never shot an innocent civilian in cold blood.Allinall this movie is just plain terrible. The fact that it is so incredibly historically inaccurate simply ruins the movie entirely.";

	schema:headline " Old Hollywood Myths Peddled Anew";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is most frustrating in the way it misrepresents the nature of the war and the nature of the British rulers from whom the patriots freed themselves.The first myth is that a few minutemen fought off an empire. In reality the British government was trying to run the war on the cheap so that the army was always undersupplied and short of men. This prevented them from properly following up their consistent success against the Americans in the field. Eventually France and Spain saw the opportunity to further their own colonial ambitions by joining the war on the side of the Americans and by taking away maritime supremacy made it impossible for the British to win.The second myth is the nature of the British ruling class at that time. We are presented with the main villain who is a thinly disguised representation of Banastre Tarleton one of the most effective commanders on either side. He is characterised as an oily Edwardian toff with an Oscar Wilde accent and the airs of a prince of the blood. In fact Tarleton was from a middle class Liverpool family. At that time Liverpool was a dynamic and growing world commercial centre. Its culture and atmosphere was much more akin to the Chicago of the 1880s than the leafy shires of HollywoodEngland with country houses milords milkmaids and faithful family retainers.The Tarletons and their ilk were very American in their aggressive pursuit of wealth which they then used to purchase high positions in society. Young Banastre did not get his commission in the army through the nobility on his family tree. It was bought with hard cash earned by the family from the shipping trade. His relatively high rank at an early age was awarded in recognition of the ability he displayed in the field. He was by no means unique in this respect. Indeed the character of the British officers would be much better modelled along the lines of Lawrence Harvey and Donald Wolfit in Room at the Top than the Merchant and Ivory anachronisms this film offers.As to the cruelty ascribed to Tarleton and vividly practised by his proxy in the film there may have been some truth to his having killed troops who had already surrendered. It does happen in war. But there is little evidence of a sustained policy of murder on his behalf. However his ability to win even when at a disadvantage was certainly a problem for the enemy. No doubt inflating his reputation for ruthlessness was a useful American propaganda ploy to convince their notoriously unsteady troops that surrender or flight was not necessarily going to save them from the fury of Bloody Ban and his redcoats. It was sold to them as a case of fight or die.Certainly his alleged cruelty was not seen as generally representative of British treatment of the colonists. This is evidenced by the fact that he was the only commander of note not invited to a dinner to celebrate the end of the war attended by American British and French officers.Furthermore this reputation did not follow him home where he returned and was elected to represent Liverpool in Parliament for many years before an honourable retirement to Shropshire.".

What concerns me is that all of these inncuracies in many films are ALL pointed against the British. They form a steady drip drip of anti Britishness which can hardly be warranted. I feel that reasons for this are possibly that our inherent sense of decency means that we tolerate such criticism and that we are easier targets than some of the real villans in the world whom Hollywood seems frightened to portray.Let me mention one scene in particularSPOILERS The burning of the people in the barn this has been mentioned previous and obviously this never happened. What is disturbing is that the only well documented instances of this actually happenning was when the Waffen SS burned the village of Orudur in France in 1944 with all of its inhabitants. and also in countless villages on the eastern front. The director Roland Emmerich a German should be ashamed for linking this atrocity with Britain who did more than any other country to fight such tyranny in WW2  disgraceful ! and remember Britain led the world in doing away with slavery when the colonies fought to retain it. Even the Alamo was fought to retain slavery in Texas after the Mexicans had banned it  didn't see that in the film of the Alamo.This is a fairy tale  read the history books.".

It's very easy to accept him as a staunch family man who transforms into a blood thirsty warrior. The problems acting wise lay away from Gibbo's central performance. Surrounded by caricature villains tho Jason Isaacs' Tavington is deliciously vile and underwritten characters Chris Cooper wasted and Joely Richardson is but a mere prop Gibson has no choice but to hog the screen. So much so it ultimately turns into a one man star vehicle which for a costume war epic isn't a great thing really.Roland Emmerich Independence Day and Godzilla directs and handles the battle sequences very well there's lashings of blood as men line up to shoot and dismember one and other. While cannonball's whizz bang and tear off body parts it's grim yet oddly rousing stuff. Not even the overtly flag waving and sloganeering on show can off set the impact of the well constructed battles. There is of course lots of tragedy to be found in the film and these are some what surprisingly tenderly handled by Emmerich but mostly it's via an on song Gibson who remains one of the few modern day male actors capable of believable grief. All of this given a John Williams score that suitably flits between rousing and ethereal and things are further boosted by the sumptuous photography from Caleb Deschanel.There should have been more thought given to the racial slaves aspects in the conflict and this coupled with the bad errors of under developed characters hurts The Patriot. Not so as to stop it being entertaining but more to stop it being a one man show. But as it is thanks in the main to Gibson and in spite of its faults it's an above average drama. 610".

Gabriel Heath Ledger distraught at the death of his new bride and several other annoyingly selfrighteous dogooders rides off with some pals to confront and destroy the evil Colonel Tavington Jason Isaacs in an excellently evil performance  if this was XMen. What follows is a lot of slowmotion killing a 'don't go over there you fool he's not really dead!' segment a gasping for breath twitching death scene in the arms of a loved one and the most hilarious reaction acting from Gibson. He spends a couple of minutes trying to look lost in grief and ends up looking like he's chewing a wasp. Dreadful!As for the rest of the film nothing really comes close to this scene although watching Mel fight off the entire British army with only his sideburns and an American flag for assistance is pretty damn funny.All other characters are woefully underwritten and act as windowdressing only and that's a shame. The token slave would have made an interesting subplot but he ends up just that a token slave and the film makers lack the conviction to tell us anything about him at all.I suppose a lot of people will expect this movie to be a true and honest portrayal of an important part of american history. If they don't come out of the theatre feeling let down and disappointed I would be amazed.On the other hand they might just laugh their 'nads off!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is possibly the most historically inaccurate film I have ever seen and I've seen Braveheart. THe film had so many inaccuracies it would be hard to name them. What was most shocking was that in order to make us 'sympethise' for Benjamin Martin they changed many of his important character flaws making it appear that he was just a normal kind hearted man who's only flaw was the inability to make rocking chairs. Another appalling flaw was how the entire film appears to be centred around the atrocities carried out by the British when the fact that Benjamin Martin butchered a tribe of Mohawk Indians cut up their bodys and set the body parts back to the Indians families is little mentioned. Also its portrayal of General Cornwallis was despicable it failed to mention that Cornwallis' wife died an act that emotionally damaged him and it says that after loosing the war of independence he never recovered this is a lie he returned to England sat in the house of lords for a while then he went to be the governor of India and successfully untangled the messy web of Indian politics. There are many other inaccuracies such as Heath ledgers talk about a new world where all men would be equal this ignores the next 50 odd years of American history and also the bit where Mel Gibson and his two sons kill an entire British platoon and Mel fights half of them with an axe seemed a TAD unrealistic to me! Anyway If you do have to see this film make sure you don't pay borrow it because we wouldn't want any more money from his anti English films going Mr Gibsons fortune. What happened Mel?

	onyx:emotionText "This film is possibly the most historically inaccurate film I have ever seen and I've seen Braveheart. THe film had so many inaccuracies it would be hard to name them. What was most shocking was that in order to make us 'sympethise' for Benjamin Martin they changed many of his important character flaws making it appear that he was just a normal kind hearted man who's only flaw was the inability to make rocking chairs. Another appalling flaw was how the entire film appears to be centred around the atrocities carried out by the British when the fact that Benjamin Martin butchered a tribe of Mohawk Indians cut up their bodys and set the body parts back to the Indians families is little mentioned. Also its portrayal of General Cornwallis was despicable it failed to mention that Cornwallis' wife died an act that emotionally damaged him and it says that after loosing the war of independence he never recovered this is a lie he returned to England sat in the house of lords for a while then he went to be the governor of India and successfully untangled the messy web of Indian politics. There are many other inaccuracies such as Heath ledgers talk about a new world where all men would be equal this ignores the next 50 odd years of American history and also the bit where Mel Gibson and his two sons kill an entire British platoon and Mel fights half of them with an axe seemed a TAD unrealistic to me! Anyway If you do have to see this film make sure you don't pay borrow it because we wouldn't want any more money from his anti English films going Mr Gibsons fortune. What happened Mel? You used to be cool.";

However the trailers left me feeling a bit flat and I skipped it in cinema's.. my brother rented it on video and I caught a few scenes as he watched it as I was in and out of the room. What I seen was laughably bad. Almost as if it was a spoof movie!! My impression of it was so poor I've never sat down and watched it until now. Well.... nothing I have seen here gave me the impression I was wrong!! The Patriot is boring pretincious ridiculously clich and is just bad movie in general. Also the title makes no sense either. As Gibson's character was not a Patriot at all. He couldn't care less about the war and had no desire to get involved at all until a character dies which spurns Mel's desire for revenge. Revenge not his patriotic duty. Gibson goes through the motions Heath Ledger gives the impression he is reading his lines from a none to helpful actors prompt book.. and Jason Isaacs is awful in full pantomime villain mode. It seems like Emmerich tried to cram as many clichs in as possible as if he was winking at the audience. But no. Sadly it's serious. A peaceful man refuses to fight until a personal tragedy forces him into action Children who can not only outsmart red coats they have a much better shooting accuracy than trained red coats too!! As the bad guys all have terrible aim so not too many heroes die the token black guy and the lone racist only one racist guy in 1776 South Carolina?? PLEASE who learns the error of his ways fighting side by side with him and the final battle which America is never in any danger of losing in which the hero singlehandedly kills the villain of the piece and wins an important battle in the war!! PatheticTo put it bluntly I'd rather go see a firework display during a thunderstorm than rewatch The Patriot.However my thoughts were not echoed by many as The Patriot was another 100 million grosser for Gibson as it ended the year with 113 million at the domestic box office to finish the year as the 19th highest grossing movie of 2000.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although the British are engaged in war in neighbouring areas Benjamin Martin sees no reason to get involved as he is a peaceful man now despite his infamous military background. However when the British burn his home and heartlessly kill one of his young sons Martin knows he must take a stand and enters the conflict. With great personal sacrifice he joins the bloody conflict for freedom and honour and the love of his country.In his episode of The Simpsons Mel Gibson starred in a remake of Mr Smith Goes to Washington except Homer helped him to change it into a film that was closer to Lethal Weapon than the James Stewart original. That was a joke but having just watched Mel Gibson turn the American Civil War into a sort of revenge action movie I considered that perhaps Homer had a hand in this one too and that the joke was on us for spending three hours watching it. It starts out with a bit of moral chat about the importance of peace etc but one dead son later and Benjamin Martin has become a oneman war machine wiping out 20 British soldiers in a blink of an eye. It is the start of a morally simplistic film that offers little for those looking for a historical piece. In fairness the film never actually aims to be anything other than a modern action movie in a historical setting but having low ambitious doesn't mean it can't be criticised for being crap  because that is just what it is.So we have the pantomime villains of the English killing women and children while the good wholesome American people most of whom employ blacks to pick cotton rather than use slaves try to do the right thing but are drawn into a bloody fight for freedom and justice. It is as simplistic as it sounds and every time Emmerich fears that his audience are losing touch with who the bad guys are he'll have them burn kill a load of women with gleeful glints in their eyes. It gets tiresome very quickly and the fact that it is three hours long give or take  I'd prefer to take just makes it worse. Visually it looks as good as you would expect a big budget production to do but substancewise it is just nonsense with overblown if impressive battle sequences which laughably include lots of John Woo style use of guns slowmo and catching weapons in midair before using them. The bits in between the action are no better as they are merely twists of an emotional knife that the writer must have hoped would make us overlook how simplified everything is I was waiting for the scene where Col Tavington drowned kittens in a sack to demonstrate how evil he was. No this is not a film to come to for debate because as far as Rodat is concerned that is all done and dusted in the early stages and then completely dismissed as nonsense by the next 160 minutes of film. I'm not going to even get into the historical liberties taken because even ignoring them this is still a terrible load of rubbish.Once the film gets going Mel Gibson only does a couple of things he is either cocky like Riggs brave like Braveheart or full of indignation and swelling pride in his country. He flicks between these like someone was turning a switch in his back he is never consistent and he is never a real person  in fact he is never anyone other than Mel Gibson. Heath Ledger gives a simplistic performance but with no material to work with what could he do? I don't know why Richardson bothered to show up although I can appreciate that Karyo and Wilkinson have mortgages to pay just like the rest of us. I don't give the same excuse to Cooper because he always struck me as an intelligent actor who makes good decisions  he is really too good to be earning his money from this. The support all do what they are told but I don't want to be too hard on the majority of the cast simply because the material is not there and nobody can do good work with characters that would seem underdeveloped on children's television.Overall this is a good looking and noisy action movie and as such it might just please audiences that like lots of things blowing up and Americans being the good guys. However for the majority of viewers the simplistic material stomachchurning flagwaving emotional exploitation and dumb action movie clichs. It is nonsense from start to finish in my opinion and it is not worth 90 minutes far less 170.".

In fairness the film never actually aims to be anything other than a modern action movie in a historical setting but having low ambitious doesn't mean it can't be criticised for being crap  because that is just what it is.So we have the pantomime villains of the English killing women and children while the good wholesome American people most of whom employ blacks to pick cotton rather than use slaves try to do the right thing but are drawn into a bloody fight for freedom and justice. It is as simplistic as it sounds and every time Emmerich fears that his audience are losing touch with who the bad guys are he'll have them burn kill a load of women with gleeful glints in their eyes. It gets tiresome very quickly and the fact that it is three hours long give or take  I'd prefer to take just makes it worse. Visually it looks as good as you would expect a big budget production to do but substancewise it is just nonsense with overblown if impressive battle sequences which laughably include lots of John Woo style use of guns slowmo and catching weapons in midair before using them. The bits in between the action are no better as they are merely twists of an emotional knife that the writer must have hoped would make us overlook how simplified everything is I was waiting for the scene where Col Tavington drowned kittens in a sack to demonstrate how evil he was. No this is not a film to come to for debate because as far as Rodat is concerned that is all done and dusted in the early stages and then completely dismissed as nonsense by the next 160 minutes of film. I'm not going to even get into the historical liberties taken because even ignoring them this is still a terrible load of rubbish.Once the film gets going Mel Gibson only does a couple of things he is either cocky like Riggs brave like Braveheart or full of indignation and swelling pride in his country. He flicks between these like someone was turning a switch in his back he is never consistent and he is never a real person  in fact he is never anyone other than Mel Gibson. Heath Ledger gives a simplistic performance but with no material to work with what could he do? I don't know why Richardson bothered to show up although I can appreciate that Karyo and Wilkinson have mortgages to pay just like the rest of us. I don't give the same excuse to Cooper because he always struck me as an intelligent actor who makes good decisions  he is really too good to be earning his money from this. The support all do what they are told but I don't want to be too hard on the majority of the cast simply because the material is not there and nobody can do good work with characters that would seem underdeveloped on children's television.Overall this is a good looking and noisy action movie and as such it might just please audiences that like lots of things blowing up and Americans being the good guys. However for the majority of viewers the simplistic material stomachchurning flagwaving emotional exploitation and dumb action movie clichs. It is nonsense from start to finish in my opinion and it is not worth 90 minutes far less 170.";

Try to replicate this today with an equivalent assortment of actors and it would not be possible.What makes this Alist superfest even more golden is the fact that nearly every major player in this picture is now gone or well up in years.

	schema:reviewBody "This film has no race and no chase. Okay there is a race but it has really nothing to do with the movie. The first film of course is all about The Cannonball Run which is an illegal race from coast to coast written by Brock Yates who along with director Hal Needham actually drove an ambulance across America  and it's Yates who invented the Cannonball Run. In the original Burt and Dom use the very same ambulance now we have a sequel which isn't written by Yates and is as bad a sequel as I've yet to witness on screen. As mentioned the actual coast to coast race has little to do with anything this time around. Instead there's a lame subplot about mobsters trying to hijack Jamie Farr's character an Arab with tons of oil money who this time around is funding the prize at the finish line. So basically this is a comic mobster film with a bunch of actors thrown in who are driving cars. Jack Elam who is incredible in the first film is thrown in as wallpaper. Burt and Dom are horrible and lazy you can tell they were just doing the film for a paycheck. Shirley Maclaine and Marilu Henner play actresses dressed as nuns and we have to sit through people doing doubletakes as these impostor penguins curse in public. Boring. Horrible. Jackie Chan is even ruined this time around. In the first film Roger Moore plays a guy who thinks he's Roger Moore and thus he drives a gadget filled car ala Bond. This time around Chan who had some gadgets of his own in the original has even more gadgets as he's basically replacing the MooreBond character from the original. And his driver is Richard Kiel best known as Bond nemesis Jaws. Chan's car even goes under water just like Bond's car in The Spy Who Loved Me which featured Kiel. Other contestants include an ape teamed up with Tony Danza. All I have to ask Tony is Didn't Going Ape teach you not to work with primates? Jamie Farr's character is ruined because he's too involved his sheik was far better as a cameo in the original. And Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr are totally wasted this time disguised as cops instead of priests and they don't even get into any trouble. Burt and Dom are dressed as soldiers Burt is a general and Dom is a private. They pick up Jim Nabors along the way as Private Lyle guess what they're spoofing here? and his cameo is as useless as an air conditioner in an igloo. It doesn't feel as if there is any need to win the race for any of the characters. You forget there is even a race at all. Man I tell you this is one of the worst sequels  if not the worst sequel ever ever ever made. Avoid it at all costs. Even as a kid I knew it was chum.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once again Hal Needham brings together a half respectable cast like in the first Cannonball movie but again forgot to bring a script. The madcap lunacy is still here as are the cheap gags and stunts but now it seems strange that all of this actually worked in the first movie because it sure doesn't here. I found Burt and Dom laughing at their own jokes more than I did. It's no wonder Reynolds' career took a dive around this time if he was starring in films as dire as this.The usual suspects are here while a few have sensibly dropped out of the race. Catherine Bach and Susan Anton are attractive enough but don't quite cut it like Adrienne Barbeau and Co. did and all they had to do was smile and flash their ts once in a while. Richard Kiel is an unusual partner for Jackie Chan but the little and large pairing works well. Chan also helped by bringing along his own stuntmen for the fight scenes and it shows. Shirley MacLaine seems oddly at home with her trashy lines while Telly Savalas fittingly over does things but is ultimately wasted in the movie the same could be said for most of the cast. Frank Sinatra's intercut scenes are sickeningly shoddy and make the film appear as amateurish as it undeniably is.If you did like the first Cannonball Run and there are a few! you'll undoubtedly be disappointed with this outing while those who didn't enjoy the first movie will no doubt detest the sequel.".

	onyx:emotionText "Once again Hal Needham brings together a half respectable cast like in the first Cannonball movie but again forgot to bring a script. The madcap lunacy is still here as are the cheap gags and stunts but now it seems strange that all of this actually worked in the first movie because it sure doesn't here. I found Burt and Dom laughing at their own jokes more than I did. It's no wonder Reynolds' career took a dive around this time if he was starring in films as dire as this.The usual suspects are here while a few have sensibly dropped out of the race. Catherine Bach and Susan Anton are attractive enough but don't quite cut it like Adrienne Barbeau and Co. did and all they had to do was smile and flash their ts once in a while. Richard Kiel is an unusual partner for Jackie Chan but the little and large pairing works well. Chan also helped by bringing along his own stuntmen for the fight scenes and it shows. Shirley MacLaine seems oddly at home with her trashy lines while Telly Savalas fittingly over does things but is ultimately wasted in the movie the same could be said for most of the cast. Frank Sinatra's intercut scenes are sickeningly shoddy and make the film appear as amateurish as it undeniably is.If you did like the first Cannonball Run and there are a few! you'll undoubtedly be disappointed with this outing while those who didn't enjoy the first movie will no doubt detest the sequel.";

	schema:reviewBody "It was not all bad but to completely honest I thought Speed Zone was a better sequel to the Cannonball Run than this movie was as this movie was almost the exact same movie only with inferior parts to it. Throw in a unfunny kidnapping plot for the only real difference in the movie and you have your sequel that came out three years after the original. That is another sad thing about this sequel it came out long after the first one and they still went in exactly the same way. Burt Reynolds Dom Delouise Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin are back along with a few others from the original. In though are a lot more B ranking actors. Roger Moore out Richard Kiel in the guy who played the villain Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker. Adrien Barbeau out and two chicks I do not know in. Farrah Fawcett out and two others I do not care for in. Jim Nabors and Tony Danza in which is definitely not a good thing. Ambulance that was a great idea out and for some reason a military car and uniforms in. That one made no sense they would have been better off just using the ambulance again. The plot is the same race across the country the only difference being the guys trying to catch the sheik character to hold him for ransom and this does not stay original as it basically sets up another brawl like that found at the last part of the first movie. After this fight though the race just about is over with no fanfare. Just a pointless sequel that has a few humorous moments the best being the scene with Tim Conway and Don Knotts.".

If you are the sort of person that thinks Smokey  The Bandit 3 is the height of cinematic art then you'll probably love CR2 but for the majority of us this is just a collection of noisy scenes hung together with the most basic of plots and a load of stars having fun or at least I hope they were having fun because I certainly didn't. The basic plot is used to produce a few fights some fast cars a little bit of cleavage and a whole load of not much else.The comedy is of the most basic sort and the cast do seem to be having fun with all their mates but this does not make their performances any good. Reynolds just sleeps through it in the way he always does while anyone hoping that Dom DeLuise will be good for laughs deserve everything they get in life. Martin and Davis Jr seem happy for the paycheck but really you get the feeling that they are crying inside. Likewise Savalas and MacLaine are much better than this while Rocco Silva etc all deserve a damn good kicking for this mockery of their most famous roles. Elam Danza Farr Chan and Kiel all fill the screen but at least Montalban and McClure are good value although that may be less to do with their ability and more to do with Star Trek 2 and the Simpsons spoof respectively.Overall a very very basic comedy that does very little worth seeking out. The stars all appear to be enjoying themselves and it is really just as well that somebody is because the majority of viewers won't be. In its defence though if you're watching this film then what did you expect  although that doesn't really excuse any of this nonsense.".

There are at least a dozen other notable costars in various roles Jamie Farr Telly Savalas Sid Caesar Tim Conway Foster Brooks Ricardo Montalban  Charles Nelson Reilly Don Knotts etc.This is a fun turnoffyourbrain flick with an incredible allstar cast that's worth the price of admission. Unfortunately the script needed a rewrite with better jokes but the producers obviously didn't want to blow the money. As it is too much of the humor falls flat but Cannonball Run II is still leagues better than comparable junk like Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 1983. And there's a worthwhile sequence where Dom does an amusing Brando impersonation.Moreover the movie scores good marks on the female front with Catherine Bach jawdropping in formfitting blue spandex during the first half teamed with her Amazonianish partner Susan Anton who's no slouch in the beauty department. Bach's buttocks looks like it was sculptured by God Himself. In addition there's Marilu Henner and Shirley MacLaine who catch a ride with JJ  Victor masquerading as nuns before revealing their real identities. Maclaine was 48 during shooting but still had a great figure.THE FILM RUNS 1 hour 48 minutes and was shot in Nevada Las Vegas Henderson Arizona Tucson Bisbee and California Redondo Beach.GRADE C".

This is literally and I do mean literally this is not hyperbole the low point of western civilization since the Spanish Inquisition.I enjoy a goofy Saturday afternoon or late night insomnia movie like anyone. I even enjoy bad movies if they are bad in a charming or kitschy way. What really makes this movie offense and vulgar is the sense of smug satisfaction of the giant ensemble cast.One of the worst feelings you can experience is embarrassment for another person and this movie is from beginning to end a combination of feeling embarrassed for everyone involved coupled with insult and outrage. The idea that someone would find this worth watching is insulting. The idea that such a thing as this movie should even exist on a roll of film somewhere is offensive. I will have trouble sleeping knowing that somewhere within one thousand miles of me some unclean television sits that once showed even a split second of this film.Quite literally you who are reading this comment could have made a better film if I handed you a home video camera and shoved you out into the desert then kneecapped you and left you for dead without water so that all you could film was the meager piece of ground you were capable of crawling across.I am wounded psychologically from having to sit through the sight of Burt Reynolds Sammy Davis and Dom DeLuise in drag.I could go cast member by cast member here each of whom should be ashamed of themselves to this day and should be made to atone for their sins before a public tribunal of fire and pitchforks and angry mobs. All of my political principles go out the door when it comes to this movie  I want to see someone hanged publicly and brutally for bringing this abomination of a film into existence. I want to go Jacques deMolay on the whole cast. Forget dreading Friday the 13th we should all rue the day this film was released instead.I am permanently and incurably scarred by having to look at cars in this movie from the worst era for car design in the auto industry's history. What in God's name were people thinking in the 1980s  about EVERYTHING? The Mitsubishi in particular is one of the most shameful and odious pieces of machinery I have ever had the misfortune of laying my eyes on. I have yet to encounter anything for example in the dark recesses of the internet so thoroughly offensive as the vehicles in this miserable film. This is a movie about a race the least they could have done is found some decent cars rather than relying on the miserable unclean blasphemous detritus of the era. The cars and Burt Reynold's mustache in this film are an affront to God and humanity. Each should be punished severely and swiftly. I want to hear someone scream.This is a movie full of people very amused with themselves with zero regard for the audience. The contempt for the audience is palpable. Not a single shred of effort was made  this is Burt and Dom partying on someone else's dollar and the film itself equates to abuse and trauma. Not a single idea here is new  simian literally humor dressing people up in drag stereotypes and a bunch of unlikely and trite crashes and disasters evoke nothing so much as Stalin era gulags and syphilis experiments.I hate this movie. Hate everything about it. Hate its presumptuousness hate every actor who appeared for appearing in it. The entire acting career of everyone involved here should be completely discredited simply by virtue of appearing in this film. I want to see people kicked out of SAG blacklists exile and angry mobs rampaging through the streets of Beverly Hills or Malibu or wherever these people live. I want to see tribunals and fire and primitive religious symbols and hooded men with axes.I will never be the same again and I curse the day I saw this film.I have seen many movies and this I have to say is the worst movie ever made. I am an enthusiastic and radical opponent of censorship but I make an exception for this witless charmless unfunny vacuous disgrace of a film. Every copy in existence should be hunted down and burned and any note of its existence should be wiped out of film guides and so on under penalty of death. When this campaign ends we should start history over with Year 1. History should be rewritten exactly as it happened minus the existence of this film. Penalties should be doled out. We are talking stretch racks and iron maidens and bamboo under fingernails.I HATE THIS MOVIE.".

Themroc is an ode to symbolism a prime example of how you can do political commentary and show to people that freedom is easy to attain and that half measures is the mean authority uses to control us.

It captures the absurdity of everyday life in a repressive social order and portrays the infectious poetic revolt of one man who goes mad against authority in every form.It's interesting that the strategy of liberation in the film revolves around a very personal and playful attack on the architecture most immediate to our lives. This destruction and transformation of space is accompanied by a kind of sexual revolution disrupting bourgeois family dynamics in a contagious way. Readers may recognize the resonance of these themes with the theory and agitation of the Situationist International the revolutionary  avantgarde organization credited with sparking the revolt of May 1968 in France. Five years previous to Themroc's release millions of people actually did occupy public spaces including universities and factories creating passionally superior ambiances in many cases armed to a significant extent with Situationist ideas graffiti slogans from which plastered Paris.Not that seeing Themroc is any substitute for actively engaging the rigorous revolutionary theory of the S.I. see www.bopsecrets.org. But the film is in a way a dreamlike rendition of the Situationist vision of changing life. And in fact there is a passing reference to Themroc in Can Dialectics Break Bricks? a film by Situationist Ren Vienet when the hero of that film is confronting the bureaucrats some onlookers comment something to the effect that wow that guy must have seen Themroc.".

Themroc lives with his mother and sister in a depressing flat where the monotonous silence is only broken by a cuckoo clock. Themroc's day begins with a bicycle ride to the railway station then a train ride to his workplace. At his works Themroc goes into a locker room with the other men. They then split into two groups one group wearing white overalls the other wearing yellow. Each overall has an image of a man painting on the back. The two groups then quarrel in gibberish some even seem to be squabbling with their lockers. Work then begins. The men start to paint an iron fence. One of the groups use white paint the other uses black on the same fence. Which colour wins? Themroc is then up a ladder and caught peering through the window at his boss and secretary. His boss opens the window and bangs Themroc on his nose bloodying it. His boss demands to see him. He waits outside his office and watches a man sharpening different coloured pencils. The pencils are put in two rows one at the top one at the bottom. The man sharpens the pencils from the top line breaks the tip then puts them on the bottom row.Themroc is fired by his boss. He goes into a toilet cubicle and grunts and growls loudly like a mad dog. On his way home he enters a subway station. He walks down the line into the tunnel howling at the passing trains. Themroc arrives home and is greeted at the door by his sister who has her breast showing. He fondles her and she seems to like it. He then gets a sledgehammer and knocks a huge hole in the wall of his flat. He throws out his television and other appliances onto the forecourt below. He enters and leaves his flat via a rope ladder dangling from the hole. Soon other neighbours start to knock holes in their walls too.The police eventually arrive some in riot gear. Themroc and his sister throw anything they can find in the house at them in the forecourt below. The police throw tear gas cannisters in Themroc's flat but he soon gets rid of them and gleefully throws them back and forth with his neighbours who are all now behaving like Themroc.The police then leave. Themroc manages to capture a policeman at night. He takes the officer to his flat and then all the neighbours gather round and cook and feast on him although the carcass shown is amusingly a pig's. A builder then arrives at and tries to build a wall over the hole. Themroc jests with him and persuades him to kick it down after two layers are built. Throughout the film a man is polishing his car near the forecourt almost oblivious to the proceedings. He now takes a sledgehammer and destroys his car. Themroc and his neighbours are all groaning loudly. The incessant banal rat race begins again.".

I find the idea of a person reevolving back into his previous state pretty damn cool. And when you see the cover with Themroc screaming you know this could be a pretty good movie. Actually it was a very good movie.If you haven't read anything about Themroc the story is about a man who after years of the same daily routine is changing in a pretty bizarre way. His day usually starts this way Wakes up makes coffee sees his mother? point at the clock telling him to get a move on sees a girl no idea the relation naked walks down his steps always passing the same attractive woman rides his bike to work hits the work locker room and begins his day. Well the day starts off the same but Themroc? has this little cough going on but isn't really a clue to him getting a cold but actually the start of him reverting back to caveman ways. Eventually the cough turns into yells and groans. What follows is an entertaining look at how this modern caveman interacts with people and his surroundings.Going into Themroc I didn't know that much about how the story would play. I kinda expected a dark film with more violence but what you really get is a dark comedy with more sexual themes than violent ones. Unfortunately Themroc suffers from repetitiveness. The movie slightly drags in a few scenes but since the movie's idea is so unique you're always expecting something surprising to happen. You do get a few nice surprises but you also do feel a sense of repetition. Also the approach to showing a modern caveman in this manner would cause massive chaos and would be dealt with in a much more harsh manner. And during the film I thought to myself a lot that it's pretty unrealistic but for the ending to work it had to go this way. And that's fine with me.Themroc was well worth the wait. When he's making that change into the Caveman state and he's about half way there so he's groaninggrunting and yelling but at the same time he's still attempting to be civilized. That stuff is pretty damn funny. Overall Themroc is a unique flick that most movie buffs should check out. It's entertaining funny wellacted and definitely different.

Michel Piccoli who is an excellent actor is the perfect choice for the character that gives the title of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Pacino's characters are always warm intimate and personal  yes even Michael Corleone  and in this film also sensitive and kind. Here he gets to share those qualities with lucky children whose parents abandon them.As a father he's tough when he needs to be tender and concerned when he's called on to be and just a big kid when he feels impelled and its appropriate. His character here as in many of his roles is selfcentered if not selfobsessed and that can drive the adults around him bonkers when they need his attention but he never lets the children down.His house evolves into a kind of wayward home  a place to where his exwives's children return of their own will because it's the only place they feel wanted comfortable and respected. There they matter as human beings. Pacino is a playwright and apparently a good one but he seems less concerned with the art of his craft and more concerned with it being lucrative for the benefit of his now extended family. He's shown to be the only responsible adult in the movie and he's barely hanging on to the coat tails of sanity as it is. The children all seem to have more sense than the adults. With Pacino they take an us against the world approach to their problems. We root for them of course because they're much too important to be ignored and they've got the spunk to insist that they be seen and heard.The household has a summer camp bunk mate feel. The children have distinct and in some way opposing personalities. Each stands out as special and for the most part there is little conflict. That may be a contrivance or it could be a believable happy accident.Tuesday Weld Pacino's estranged wife and the mother with different fathers of four of the five children is the embodiment of the enemy. A selfish uncaring unloving mother  oh they're out there  but she probably also represents society on some level especially at the tail end of the medecade 70's. Perhaps for the sake of ratings there is no direct reference to drugs or promiscuity but it ain't a far leap to make to explain the history of the characters.As at least one other reviewer has said the film probably works a lot better for people who have lived the kind of life portrayed.".

Johnny Depp has been a religious experimental actor seeking his niche trying on new and widely versatile characters until he earned his stardom with the Pirates of the Caribbean series.Here Pacino has spread his wings and some have said fell flat on his face. I must disagree. He plays comedydrama quite well. This work features some dynamic elements which helped support his role namely the beautiful performances by the then child actors.This is by all accounts a feelgood family movie complete with fairy tale ending but the path to that magical ending is strewn with pitfalls stumbling blocks and other problems. It is far from realistic but does not break the contract wherein we the audience agree to suspend belief and attempt to subscribe to the premise.Although I can't say this is one of my favorites I do enjoy this work and have found that Pacino is quite aptly cast herein. This work does however explain by what template Eddie Murphy seemingly molded his failing career.

It may have been better suited to a Robin Williams who was doing Mork  Mindy on TV in those days or a Burt Reynolds who was at the top of his game in 1982 but he is by no means wrong for it. I appreciate it when actors try something new. Like when Reynolds made 'Starting Over' or Williams made 'Good Will Hunting'. And Pacino tries something new here he is as watchable as always but these are not two of his better hours. Of the rest of the cast Dyan Cannion is gorgeous and still an attractive lady if only the rest of the cast were as appealing as the two leads. The kids were on the awful end of child actors scale and everyone else just blends in to the background. As far as I know this was the first and last time Pacino tried a full out comedy.

He spends all his time creating and we are told that he has spent two years working on his play the production of which marks the beginning of the film. However during the film the playwright' s priorities are superseded by the children of his unfaithful and thoroughly horrible wife who has a blatant albeit unconscious disregard for the wellbeing of her offspring. She makes a great speech about how she is 'herself' and 'nothing more' and in doing so makes a mockery of the socalled righteousness of individualism. Oh and there's some good acting by young kids no mean feat for any director. And it's got good New York Jewish gags that reminded me of 'My Favorite Year'. Bravo! Author author!".

LOL It was more of an adult movie than for children because of the language and the little scene with Al and Dyan in bed.

Also I was expecting the movie to be funny  which it was not. Other than that I enjoyed watching it for the nice sense of a strong family even if it's a bit contrived and how they handle adversity.

	schema:reviewBody "Although Leonardo Sciascia may be a name that means nothing to most viewers he was a brilliant Italian novelist of Sicilian origins who acted as his country's moral consciousness for several decades writing novels and shortstories that analysed Italy's Mafia the fascist years and the recrudescence of totalitarianism during the chaotic 'years of lead' during the '60s and '70s. So popular and extraordinary were the novels of this firstrate storyteller that many of them were turned into movies and quite good in their right.Porte Aperte based on one of his final novellas concerns an elderly judge burdened with the responsibility of trying a multiple murderer. It's 1938 the Fascists are in power and Italy is reenacting the death penalty again in order to show the regime's strength and zero tolerance with crime. Judge Vito Di Francesco although not an antifascist isn't ready to simply sentence the defendant to death. Carefully and meticulously he tries to understand the motives of the killer and to find a way of reducing the penalty to life imprisonment. Against him is the regime which wants an example of swift justice and the defendant himself who demands to be executed.This movie to me has flaws and weaknesses that need to be quickly addressed. I found the killer's motives to demand the death penalty unclear was he making a political point? Was he holding the regime's inhumanity to their eyes? I never understood what motivated him to act in such a suicidal manner. I also found it hard to sympathise with the plight of a man sentenced to death who himself had killed four people including his wife right after raping her. But perhaps a point of the movie was just that  that even the most vicious criminals have a right to live.Otherwise the movie is quite solid and watchable. As a court room drama the movie is slowpaced and introspective rather than frantic and bombastic. There are some fine verbal skirmishes between the judge and the witnesses and the defendant but otherwise the movie focus a lot on his doubts and attempts at finding a loophole to save the man from execution.Gian Maria Volont the great Italian actor plays the judge and needless to say he brings the gravitas and serenity required for the character. Although Volont is mainly known as El Indio from Sergio Leone's For a Few Dollars More movies like Porte Aperte were really the sort of movies he preferred to star in. Volont took seriously the '60s and '70s call to artists and intellectuals to join the revolutionary struggle. Whatever people may think of that nowadays it led to Volont starring in many fine movies with a political tinge Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion Todo Modo another Sciascia adaptation and hilariously and chillingly prophesying the murder of Italian primeminister Aldo Moro Ogro The Working Class Goes To Heaven etc. Watching Porte Aperte however I was taken aback at his age and frail look. Knowing him mainly from when he was a younger actor filling his performances with rage and energy it was a surprise to see him still deliver such a nuanced and powerful performance just a few years before his death.".

So I must reply to Mr. ccthemovieman1 whose comment really goes over the top as shown in the following quote   In this movie people who support the death penalty are called fascists. Well I used to be a flaming Left Winger and I remember calling anyone who disagreed with us a fascist back in the '60s so I guess nothing has changed in that regard.  Well it's because in this Italian film the action is taking place in 1938  that is under the Fascist regime. So the people who support death penalty are not CALLED the fascists they ARE the fascists the real thing the genuine article  fascismo 19221944. Nothing to do with the blatant ignorance of fascism displayed in the sixties by some American 'Liberal' activist which by now has become the blatant ignorance of fascism displayed by some American 'Conservative' activist. As is well known death penalty in Italy was abolished in 1890 reinstalled in 1922 by Mussolini's regime and abolished again in 1946.Now this Gianni Amelio courtroom drama watch out the SPOILERS are coming tells us the story of a 1938 magistrate Gian Maria Volont who while not being exactly an antifascist has always been at odds with the 1922 reenactment of death penalty and is now trying to find some loopholes or small print or mitigating circumstances of any kind to avoid delivering a death penalty verdict at the trial he's presiding  except that the accused is as uncooperative as possible since the guy WANTS to be executed.I shall also add that the Leonardo Sciascia book from which the movie is adapted is based on a true story. A writer with the mentality of an historian Mr. Sciascia has been digging into old Sicilian trials that took place during the Ventennio i.e. Fascist era and found this story. So the movie is also a living page of history. The fascists in the story are called the fascists because they are the fascists.ccthemovieman1 should stick to watching American movies period. Anyway aren't American movies the best ? Of course they are. So why not keep watching them and forget about the rest.".

Volont is simply amazing the character is explained even with a closeup expressing what not only a judge but every man should think about socalled undisputed truths... Trying to be anything but superficial trough doubt and curiosity. Maybe ccthemovieman were too leftwing or better were too convinced of his opinions once and unfortunately nowadays. He's partially understandable because this movie is deepseated in Italian culture so is pretty difficult to a foreigner get some light nuances amplified by the Sicilian environment of the script based on novel of the great Leonardo Sciascia. In my opinion this movie deserves 9 out of 10 stars for the psychological deepening of the characters.cheers".

He's partially understandable because this movie is deepseated in Italian culture so is pretty difficult to a foreigner get some light nuances amplified by the Sicilian environment of the script based on novel of the great Leonardo Sciascia. In my opinion this movie deserves 9 out of 10 stars for the psychological deepening of the characters.cheers";

Above all they were forbidden to tattoo their faces. And these tattoos were seen as the Seediq's traditional belief to transform themselves into Seediq Bale true humans. Mona Rudao the protagonist witnessed the repression by the Japanese over a period of 30 years. Sometime between autumn and winter 1930 when the slave labor is at its harshest a young Seediq couple are married and a joyful party is thrown.

Just Wiki Wushe Incident and Taiwanese Aboriginal and that makes things much better as you watch.Anyway back to the film the selling point seems to be all the killing the action the big budget. However after watching it I've found out it's more about the value of death that the film tries to bring to us and death weights in front of abstract values such as tradition dignity etc.It's really an entertaining film for sure and throughout the 4.5 hrs time just flies and you have to adjust yourself to have that desire to discover more about aboriginals believes and ways of living much like watching documentary films mentality.I can't stop comparing this Civilization vs. Barbarian plot to what is happening in middle east right now. In such sense history is repeating and the film is definitely pointing out how pointless the loss of lives is depends on which stand you are taking though.Overall this is one of the best and most enjoyable films in recent years.

I have heard people arguing if it is necessary to have so much violence in this film but I have to say that the value of peace or antiwar is the main stream nowadays but not so to the traditional Seediq that time. Therefore I think the director is not a moral relativist he just chose not to judge the past with today's value and resisted the mainstream that drowned the voice of the minority.It impressed me that there was little Chinese or Taiwanese through out this film. Instead the film is composed of Seediq language and Japanese. We should cherish it that 80 years after the The Wushe Incident we can finally see a film which represents historical event not based on the authority opinion but on people who didn't lead the history i.e. the native.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of Taiwan's biggest ever films today probably the most expensive ever made and looks set to be the highest earning to date. The story of Seediq Bale based on the Wushe Incident is split into two segments the first being entitled The Sun Flag taiyang qi and the second The Rainbow Bridge caihong qiao. Seediq Bale is the best looking Taiwanese production to date it seems on par with the majority of action films coming straight out of Hollywood. The battle scenes are impressive they're fast paced with a lot of of excitement and thrills there's explosions blood splatters and much like you'd expect from headhunters there's a few heads rolling.Story The story moves quickly despite the movie being close to 2 and a half hours long. There is a small bit of background and lead up to the Japanese arriving but not a great deal. When the Japanese arrive it also doesn't seem that much happens in the story it doesn't give you complex characters or anything you must grasp or understand. It's a simple story but flows well and entertains.Characters Character building and general development is a problem in this movie although it is entertaining with no boredom from start to finish it doesn't have much depth to it. You must take the characters on face value as you don't really get a sense of who they are. There is one character who can be classed as the lead but you even don't get to know who he is. Throughout the movie you're introduced to numerous characters both on the aboriginal side and the Japanese side yet you don't get to know more than the basics of who they are.Directing TeSheng Wei has previous had a bit hit in Taiwan with Cape No.7 which guaranteed him the funding for this movie. But still his style is not flawless at times he comes across as still being an amateur with some very strange shots and some even more bizarre cuts. More than one scene had him building up suspense and emotion was all there and then he suddenly cuts to something completely different. It kills the feeling but also provides a kind of shock.Also its probably worth having a little background on headhunting traditions before watching this film without understanding about their culture at times you might just find yourself rooting for the Japanese side.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie sure it could've been better but at the same time it could've been a lot worse. It's receiving a lot of praise in Taiwan with this movie smashing records and the follow up looking set to break even more. One things for sure I'll be booking my tickets for the second instalment.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are looking for an epic sized film look no further than the Asian film market. They have cornered the market on delivering huge scale movies on a regular basis like no other. Warriors of the Rainbow Seediq Bale is not only an epic film it is the most expensive film to ever come out of Taiwan. Produced by John Woo the film was originally released in Taiwan as two films running at over 4 and a half hours but released in a single US version at about 2 and a half hours. Can this much be trimmed from a movie a still work clearly enough to keep the film's epic story intact and capture audiences? Warriors of the Rainbow is based on the 20th Century history of two warring tribes that not only clashed over the land they inhabited but also a bigger war against the Japanese as they begin to colonize the island and wipe them out. Forging an alliance with the other tribes they took the Japanese by surprise only to have to face an unstoppable force as they are attacked by aircraft and poison gas. This is not only a truly epic film it is one that will leave you with some sort of emotional response. Whether its sadness anger or just awe you cannot walk away from this movie without it affecting you in some way. This is an extremely violent and graphic movie but is necessary to really convey this little known time in Taiwan history. At first this film feels a bit like Apocalypto then takes a turn to something like Last of the Mohicans but with a way more violent and deep emotional story. It's hard to believe the amount of action that is crammed into this film and still have such a powerful story. This is a wellmade wellexecuted film that is hard to watch at times due to the content. Besides the war violence there is a heavy amount of gore as well as suicide and children being killed that may be hard to watch for some people.This is easily one of the most emotionally charge epic war like movies to come out in a long time. With the amount of content that is included in this film you can only imagine what else could have been cut out for this condensed US release. If you love Asian cinema war films or just great filmmaking this is a must see film. Just be warned as mentioned before that there are some pretty heavy visuals.httpwww.examiner.commovieindallasbobbyblakey".

	schema:reviewBody "One thing any viewer of this movie needs to know before going into the movie is that their are a few ridiculously cheesy scenes such as when a hut explodes the images of the native warriors are badly added into the effects of the explosions as well at the ending the remaining Warriors walk on a very unrealistic rainbow into their heaven. Along with that their are many scenes with fake looking rocks jumping scenes with actors and back drops. There are also some drawn out singing scenes beautiful songs.... but still. Might as well add in that the ending is fairly weak.With the negatives out of the way the film is very well acted. The battle scenes constantly leave any viewer wanting more if of course you enjoy brutal war scenes. Besides the scenes which I have listed above the set in most cases is quite beautiful. The story drags on for a good four hours but I find most of the scenes necessary to bring the message of the film.

	onyx:emotionText "One thing any viewer of this movie needs to know before going into the movie is that their are a few ridiculously cheesy scenes such as when a hut explodes the images of the native warriors are badly added into the effects of the explosions as well at the ending the remaining Warriors walk on a very unrealistic rainbow into their heaven. Along with that their are many scenes with fake looking rocks jumping scenes with actors and back drops. There are also some drawn out singing scenes beautiful songs.... but still. Might as well add in that the ending is fairly weak.With the negatives out of the way the film is very well acted. The battle scenes constantly leave any viewer wanting more if of course you enjoy brutal war scenes. Besides the scenes which I have listed above the set in most cases is quite beautiful. The story drags on for a good four hours but I find most of the scenes necessary to bring the message of the film. Also it would not hurt to do some research on the historical side of the film either to know where the story derives from.Over all it is a magnificent film but you just have to get over the CGI.";

And is this that much different to the change happening to our very own culture both Eastern and Western in the face of globalization and extreme consumerism? This is how much the film has provoked me into contemplating. Also with all the head chopping and fighting scenes the director has successfully illustrates the values and beliefs of life of the tribes without a taint of violence. Yes it's bloody but not violent. Wonder how that is possible right? This is refreshing in the midst of our media culture on big screens and on TV.I would not use the word entertaining for this movie but nonetheless it is not as seriousboring as the topic and plot might sound. And 144 minutes just flew by without my notice and my 60 years old parents were actually hoping to watch the second half right after the first.Definitely a nottomiss for this year!".

	schema:reviewBody "Wei TeSheng had this movie planned way before his hit movie Cape No.7 which was a big hit. And his efforts really shows in this movie it's basically a high budget epic from taiwan that is most definitely worth watching. On the exterior it might seem like another historical movie about Japanese occupation and invasion and how they mistreated enslaved and also raped the people on the land they invaded. While also taking away their tradition culture language and freedom. Thus making the people rise up and throw a rebellion and fight the Japanese for justice pride and freedom. But this movie has a lot of interior elements as well. It really does a good job of now going down a narrow rebellion movie but brings out the scars the harshness and manly pride. Some scenes are uncomfortable to see but it shows the brutality and the length the rebels are willing to go. The movie takes place in taiwan during the 1895 and 1945 on a land where two tribes use to fight each other. but what happens when a more menacing enemy comes to enslave all of them? This movie is simply very well crafted with good pacing and editing. Wei TeSheng seems like a talented director and I am grateful that his vision his got from a comic book came to life on the big screen. This feels kind of like a taiwanese version of the movie 300 except with more substance and emotion with scars going for it. Highly recommended to anyone that enjoys historical movies with some realistic guerrilla battle tactics.8.210".

But this is the first time that I felt this movie was a very mature production since I never found anything like it out of Taiwan. Because usually all movies from Taiwan the dialogs were disgustingly embarrassing feminine males whining like females. Yet this movie is absolutely masculine and this is first time that I felt the male population in Taiwan sounded and acted more like man not just whiners. Furthermore this is also the first time that I consider this movie is at a higher international level with great acting directing and cinematographic achievement. And this is very rare to me and totally win my respect back to the Taiwanese movie industry. Salute!".

It is captivating from start to finish telling a historical story that not many would know or have seen before. It reminds me so much of the plight of the Sioux and other indigenous peoples.

The Japanese were a more controlling Colonial force and did not tolerate aboriginals such as the Seediq and called them 'Seiban' or 'barbarians' and treated them as inferiors. They ruled harshly and built up resentments that led to a number of insurrections that led to The Wushe Incident of 1930 that is the central point of this film.The indigenous tribes had also fought one another over hunting grounds and other causes for centuries and the divisions that this caused are exemplified here and indeed how the Japanese exploited such to turn tribes against each other. The chief of the Seediq was Mouna Rudau and he ha tried appeasement but one slight too many pushed him to seek to join the tribes together and make a stand against the vastly better equipped Japanese. Once the die was cast they had all foreseen where it would end.Now this film sticks to the documented facts extremely well the acting is all excellent and there is a ton of action. It was made in 2011 but some of the CGI is a bit obvious. Despite that this will bring you along for a great roller coaster ride of action. The fight scenes are all done extremely well and when people get hurt they really are hurt. This is a great tribute to the culture of the Seediq and their allies and to a part of history that we have not heard much about. It is also the sort of film you could easily watch again. In aboriginal Japanese and Hokkien with pretty good subtitles and a run time of just over two and a half hours  every second of which is put to good use  completely recommended.".

The movie is presented in the Seediq native tongue and so translationssubtitles were necessary which kept me from fully enjoying the beauty of the shots of landscape and action  etc. It tells the whole incident and explains everything that happens perfectly. the introduction is sufficient the building to the climax is smooth but what i think killed it was the hour or so fighting scene... it made it seem too long and by the end of the movie i felt as if the whole movie was basically fighting... though that IS what it's based upon it felt... a bit too much. not that its a bad thing or anything but all in all i think it was a great movie... for anyone 14 or above.".

	schema:headline " Deeply flawed Taiwanese historical action epic";
	schema:reviewBody "WARRIORS OF THE RAINBOW SEEDIQ BALE is a homegrown historical action epic from Taiwan featuring the story of an Aboriginal tribe who rise up against their Japanese oppressors during the early 20th century. It starts off on a rather dodgy note asking the viewer to be interested in and accept as protagonist a man Mona Rudao who is introduced to the viewer when he kills and steals from some innocent tribesmen. Thankfully things then jump forward twenty years or so and it all becomes straightforward.The first thing to note is that I saw the international cut of this film in which two parts are condensed down into one whole. While I enjoyed it on a superficial level I have to say that there were too many problems with it for me to want to seek out the full version. The main issue I had is that the main tribe of characters are completely unsympathetic. They're headhunters and when the Japanese describe them as 'savages' you tend to agree with them. I'm afraid I was on the side of the Japanese throughout in this one.Elsewhere the film is ridiculously onesided in showing the Japanese to be a cowardly and easilybeaten foe except when the text comes up at the end you see that things were completely different to the fantasy portrayed here. I did like the look of the film although it's variously influenced by the likes of APOCALYPTO LAST OF THE MOHICANS BRAVEHEART THE LAST SAMURAI and BANG RAJAN without ever quite giving the viewer a flavour of its own.The action is quite well done however although marred by cheap CGI as is the case with so many eastern films these days. The scene in which the tribe rises up to attack the Japanese garrison is the highlight really bloodthirsty and hairraising stuff. But in the end the lack of likable characters and the sheer ridiculousness of some moments like the bratty kid running amok with the heavy weaponry stopped me enjoying it too much.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was supposed to give a score of 7 but changed a bit after seeing the latter part of the film in theatre. Here's my own thought It begins with Mouna being chased by another tribe's men in water and ends with almost of the dead male aboriginal characters marching together on the above whether they're old rivalries in the woods or not. Surely the film surrounds the Wushe incident in Taiwan but its materials are from the interviews with the remainders of Seediq and also based on a comic book...80 years have past for these people so how many true memories can serve the elders well? At least I believed in those different men's and women's struggles posed in the film because they are too real to make up. I was anticipating why and how the main character Mouna Roudo would find himself fighting the Japanese with no chance to win and the director and plot writer TeSheng Wei did not disappoint me in the first part of the movie namely 'The Sun Flag' of local theatrical release. But then the comicallike scenes start to be annoying...especially Mouna performed by ChinTai Lin always started to dance and sing before the big confrontations with the enemy and near the end he and a little few men of his were fired by Japanese cannons on a drawbridge without any serious damages afterwards.I discovered that the film lose some parts for a successful typical blockbuster in terms of war movies yet more than of just that. Unfortunately I think the latter part 'The Rainbow Bridge' dwelled upon the outcome for Seediq people's belief of Gaya too much. What's worse it really became a mess when Seediq nonSeediq aborigines and Japanese had the fights 'within the fights' altogether during the final 30 minutes or so. You have to be very cool to follow them. I have to admit that these factors overall killed some numbers in my final rating of the film and that's a pity for the 'biggest ever movie production cost of Taiwan' Meaningless killings and stirring suicides may be seen within a comment of a certain number of viewers which the film tries to target with mostly due to the vagueness of right and wrong the filmmaker wanted to convey. It's not a welcomed clich that should be used in commercial films...only who knows how it is knows how.The computer CG scenes I can promise you on par with some war drama like 'Tae Guk Gi' and 'Letters from Iwo Jima'. Interestingly they are all not the type of cinema that is all about unfolding the historical events but with some extent of thinking of humanity mixed. However like I said before the comicallike scenes may not harm the authenticity of the real history for too much but some of the untimely ones that stop me from hyperbolize how good the movie is like many locals do. Would it be a commercial success overseas? The title of this review implied a mixed 'no answer'.".

It had an interesting plot lots of action nice character development and an excellent performance by Michael Ironside. This movie held my interest all the way through until the last scene. It is categorized as sciencefiction however there was very little scientific lingo so it is easy enough for anyone to follow. I especially enjoyed how the characters began as strangers in the movie and slowly melded together into a sort a renegade troupe determined to stay alive. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who can get there hands on it!".

Maybe it's because it rips off some amazingly awesome movies and it reminds me of them constantly.

Maybe it was because this is actually a pretty decent movie underneath the layers of homage. I've always thought that this forgotten B movie could have been a cult classic if only it had gotten a little bit more attention.If you're expecting a big budget amazing sets famous Alist actors mindblowing special effects and an original plot then yeah you'll be very disappointed.

	schema:reviewBody "Take a deep breath it may be your last. Welcome to the year 2053! In the year 2053 the world is a postapocalyptic wasteland. In this movie it is called The Outland with a blatant disregard for the Sean Connery film of the same name. The Outland doesn't have a lot of clean air or water. People are eating dogs for sustenance.Enter Harry M. Stark Ironside a nononsense bounty hunter who looks like Jack Nicholson. His job is to bring Reno Vanity back to Neon City. He handcuffs himself to her because she is always escaping. There are so many outlaws in The Outland that one can collect Red Star Credits for bringing them to justice. What you can exchange these for aren't explained. Is it like Skee Ball tokens or Coconut Coins? The world may never know.Luckily there is a bus going to Neon City. The movie never explains where they are and how long it takes to get to Neon City. The bus driver is named Bulk and he is played with aplomb by Lyle Alzado. As if the name Bulk wasn't enough he is nicknamed The Killer Tomato because He crushes people's heads as easily as an overripe tomato. Bulk and Harry don't get along at first because Bulk is an excon that Harry brought in.Also going to Neon City in this bus are a bad standup comic looking for work a sketchy doctor with a mullet a spoiled rich girl and a woman who looks like Hillary Clinton. Riding shotgun with Bulk for most of the journey is a mysterious Asian man named Wing Arsenio Sonny Trinidad Along the way there are many obstacles and pitfalls. Besides the obvious personality clashes there are roving bands of killers dubbed Skins. They ride soupedup broken down motorcycles if such a thing is possible. There are continuously chasing the bus and shooting at it. We don't know why. Stark shoots back with a laser that makes a classic laser noise Pew! Pew! The many chase sequences are very repetitive and strongly reminiscent of the Orange Grove Chase from the classic Cobra 1986.Other dangers our heroes have to face include something called a Zander Cloud which is a poisonous cloud. It would make more sense if it was a Zzand Cloud. Similarly there are some hot lights which are a silly menace that pads out the running time. Not to mention if they are so hot why don't they melt all the snow around the area? They take a million breaks on the way to Neon City and they could have gotten there a lot faster. The importance to getting to Neon City is negated with all the breaks. One of the important breaks involves healing water that Harry and Reno take. It doesn't make much sense.After all those breaks they finally get to Neon City which is just a Neon Room No city is actually seen They are welcomed into the room by none other than The Office's Creed Bratton Who was also a grip on the film. Already overlong at this point after multiple endings Stark confronts his commanding officer who is also evil and is named Jenkins.There are some twists as far as relationships are concerned Will Stark and Reno stay enemies or become an item? Will that annoying comic get his comeuppance for selling poison to cavedwelling burn victims? And will Bulk get his wife's ring back from the Skins? and is Wing once again played by Arsenio Sonny Trinidad who he seems to be? All will be answered if you watch the entire thing.Neon City closely resembles the recent box office smash The Book Of Eli obviously the Hughes Brothers closely studied this flick. Honestly the movie is a Mad Max knockoff and scenes from it are ripped off wholesale.Make sure to watch Neon City in the future! Interesting side note Fan favorite Chuck Zito did some stunt work on the film.Comeuppance Review by Ty  Brett For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

As they try to reach Neon City they have to deal with mutants cannibal tribes freak whether phenomenon  the fact that there is a murderer among their number...Cowritten  directed by Monte Markham I personally thought Neon City was a pretty lacklustre post apocalyptic scifi adventure. The script by Markham Jeff Begun Buck Finch  Gus Peters is basically a ripoff of the classic western Stagecoach 1939  takes it's plot  transports it into the future. However that's where the similarities end I'm afraid as Neon City has dull  unexciting action scenes clichd  forgettable character's especially the main leads  subplots which seem to go nowhere  serve only to stretch the things running time out even more. I found it to be a touch on the slow side with not much happening  average at best action scenes to punctuate the boredom  it takes itself far too seriously. The ending was also a disappointment  it's almost as if the filmmakers didn't know what they wanted to do  just wrapped things up as quickly as they could. The world depicted in Neon City is your typical post apocalyptic vision with wastelands full of mutants  gangs little law  order the daily struggles to find water  food  life threatening whether conditions. Mad Max 1979 was doing all that sort of thing much better over a decade before Neon City in fact besides stealing most of it's best ideas from Stagecoach  Mad Max the whole film feels like it's one big ripoff  doesn't have an original idea in it.Director Markham does a surprisingly excellent job here Neon City is one of the best looking post apocalyptic films I've seen  I'm even more surprised by the fact this must have had a pretty low budget. The landscapes are fantastic  really help the look of the film apparently shot on the Utah flatlands during winter it has a great feel  desolate atmosphere to it. The production design is also rather good with nice costumes  good sets. The look of Neon City is easily it's best aspect. The infrequent action scenes are bland  simply don't excite which is the films biggest problem it's just not that much fun to watch  it's as simple  straight forward as that.Technically Neon City is fine  even quite impressive when everything is considered don't expect many special effects though  the violence is rather tame. The acting isn't up to much although the usually great Michael Ironside has a rare lead role.Neon City is an average time waster at best  a lifeless unoriginal bore at worst generally speaking I'd say it's somewhere between the two.

	schema:reviewBody "NEON CITY is another film that openly copies the MAD MAX franchise in particular part two of the series given that the whole second half of the film involves the main characters inhabiting a truck which is driven through a perilous landscape and chased by nameless bad guys. It's a much lower budgeted and thus inferior product when compared to the George Miller series but cult film fans might just like this one regardless mainly due to Michael Ironside who appears in the starring role. Ironside only plays the good guy in a film once in a blue moon but he's the protagonist here and he's excellent as you might expect. Still a total bad ass but on the side of good for once. The rest of the film is a mix of cheap action scenes snowy vistas and characters arguing and fighting amongst themselves. There's a little humour to lighten the experience and overall it's a fun enough picture massively enhanced by the reliable Ironside.".

Yet I must confess I quite enjoyed this film.  It's been a number of years since I saw it and I've actually forgotten most of the violent scenes. Probably what held much of the attraction for me was the theme of moral uncertainty which it maintains until the very end.This is a much more humanely stimulating movie than Jaws.  In this film there are no real bad guys either human or otherwise and we feel compelled to feel pity for both the orca and the character Nolan.The We are One song the music of which features throughout the movie is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard and the scenes which show the orcas slowly swimming together to this music are quite entrancing.The chilling scene in which the female orca aborts her unborn foetus is of course unforgettable and it is this scene that begins the tragic theme of the story.  This is a different movie altogether from Jaws and the dramatically different endings of the two films perhaps show this difference most of all.Watch Orca  you won't regret it.".

The first time I saw it I was very young perhaps 8 or 9 and while I found it upsetting and sad at parts as an adult I can look back and say it speaks so much more to me than say Free Willy.  The movie follows the events in a fisherman's life following the capture of a killer whale.  On the surface it can appear grim and gory but underneath there is a stirring tale about a man who has lost everything he held dear has given up all feeling because of past events and leads an almost hostile towards life existence and then gradually comes to understand that because he was hurt does not give him an excuse not to feel.  Yes the premise does dabble in the fantasy world however the point isn't whether this could happen but the growth of the central character. Not once have I been able to watch this movie and not been moved by it.".

	schema:headline " Difficult to rate  Raises Mixed Emotions";
	schema:reviewBody "1977's Orca starring Richard Harris Gladiator Harry Potter is one of the more difficult films I believe I've ever tried to categorize. Also I'm uncertain exactly how to rate it given that it stirs up a number of mixed emotions.spoilers followOrca tells the story of Captain Nolan Harris a fisherman who is trying to set himself up for a financial windfall and thus pay off the mortgage on his boat by capturing a Great White Shark and selling it to an aquarium. When two divers become involved the situation nearly leads to tragedy however a killer whale intervenes killing the shark and firing the imagination of Captain Nolan. Enlisting the unwitting aid of a female marine biologist named Rachel Bedford Charlotte Rampling Nolan decides to change course and pursue the capture and sale of a killer whale. The capture attempt is a dismal failure. In the process a male Orca is wounded its mate is killed and the female's unborn calf gruesomely miscarries on the deck of Nolan's ship Bumpo. By this time in the film we've already sat through a crashcourse on killer whales most notably two ideas 1 killer whales may have an intelligence level on par with man's and 2 killer whales are vengeful creatures. These ideas combined with Captain Nolan's unintentional killing of the female whale and her calf set us up for the main body of the film which concerns itself with the male Orca doing whatever it can to lure Nolan back to sea for a final confrontation.Many people seem to feel that Orca is a Jaws ripoff and while it may have been made to capitalize on the success of Jaws I don't see it as a true ripoff. For one thing other than the story of a fisherman challenging a powerful animal at sea Orca doesn't really follow the pattern set by Jaws and emulated countless times since in lesser films. In Jaws a Great White Shark simply shows up in New England waters one day and embarks on a killing spree leading to the film's climactic hunt for the animal. There is no explanation for the shark's actions save for animal instinct and while powerful the shark is not portrayed as intelligent nor do we feel any sympathy for the animal. True Jaws ripoff films merely change the animal in the title role or not in the more blatant examples substitute another location and a different cast and supply a different ending. See Tentacles Piranha Night of the Grizzly Kingdom of the Spiders etc.Orca on the other hand doesn't truly emulate the pattern of any of these films. The Orca has a reason for its actions displays intelligent manipulation to get what it wants and is somewhat sympathetic. For a true comparison to another film try reversing the plot elements of Moby Dick. With a few tweaks you basically get Orca. In fact as opposed to being a ripoff I'd argue that Orca is a rather unique film. It's a revenge story with an animal in the lead and I don't believe I've ever seen another example of that.As for the film in terms of production I wouldn't say that Orca is an awful film but it certainly tries to be more than what it ultimately becomes and thus may seem worse than it is. I enjoy watching it myself but I hesitate to recommend it to others. Richard Harris is a surprisingly complex Nolan. He doesn't always react as you'd expect him to and thus rises above the onedimensional range this role could easily have been for him. Charlotte Rampling plays a coolheaded intellectual type who doesn't know whether to love Nolan or hate him so she settles for something in between. Her acting isn't the most inspired but it's adequate to what she's asked to do here. She could be called wooden I suppose but most coolheaded intellectuals seem that way in real life. Admittedly the rest of the cast with the exception of Will Sampson as Umilak are display material. Bo Derek is very attractive but looking simultaneously attractive and helpless is really all she's asked to do here.The best aspects of Orca are its rich photography and Ennio Morricone's mournfully haunting score. Both are absolutely beautiful. The film is a viewing and listening pleasure. Michael Anderson's direction is also quite good. There were a few scenes that appear to have been cut for time perhaps but other than that the flow is very good and the chosen shots work well. The storyline is Orca's weakest point. The idea of a killer whale trying to avenge the death of its mate is workable but some of the Orca's feats in this film are unintentionally amusing. The dockside fire scene is definitely the most overthetop of all as others here have already pointed out and the Orca signaling to Nolan to follow is probably the runnerup at least for me. Some stock aquarium footage also got annoying. The recent Orca DVD release has no extras but does feature a beautiful transfer and excellent sound. I can understand why they didn't go to too much expense with Orca but it would have been nice to at least get a trailer.Bottom line Unbelievable storyline but surprisingly wellmade and likable. This may be the best bad film I've ever seen.Rating 5 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Orca is the greatest movie of all time. I'm sure most people say that their favorite movie is the greatest of all time but they are all wrong.Orca brings together some of the finest actors. Richard Harris who unfortunately will be remembered for some trivial movie about a boy wizard and a throwaway musical about King Arthur does his finest work in Orca. His portrayal of Captain Nolan an emotionally torn fisherman coming to terms with the fact the marine animals have feelings deserved the Oscar. Did he win? No that is not a strike against this fine film. Charlotte Rampling brings texture to the marine biologist in love with a whale baby killer. The romance between the two is subtle. While most modern Hollywood movies would just throw in a gratuitous sex scene Rampling accomplishes just as much with confused looks and having her shirt zipped down in one scene. Will Sampson who is sadly better known for some movie about flying over a cuckoo's nest also does a fantastic job of playing the Native American guy who says cryptic things and has ice fall on him. Robert Carradine famous for Revenge of the Nerds shows great range in not being around much and then being eaten by the whale. Bo Derek never equaled her success in this film elsewhere. I really believed her leg was bit off. She sold me.The effects were great for the time. Many forget what special effects were like in those days myself included because I was not born yet but the point remains. The strange fisheye lens used to represent the whales point of view was genius. And I challenge everyone to find a more realistic looking whale fetus in a movie. You can't you just can't. The dramatic fight between Captain Nolan and the whale could have easily become silly but it doesn't. The Arctic Circle is accurately represented as a cold place with many iceberg some of which whales can thwack themselves upon catapulting middleaged Irishmen forty feet in the air. Keep in mind also this was done without the use of computer graphics. Steven Spielberg did not even put the shark in Jaws until over halfway through the film. Why? To hide a machine so fake that I can only assume one of his children made it at camp. The mechanical killer whale in Orca is almost indistinguishable from the stock footage of killer whales continually played throughout the movie.In 1977 how many directors were brave enough to shoot a killer whale jumping from one side of the boat eating actor Robert Carradine and landing on the other side? Just one Michael Anderson. His bold choices along with screenwriters Luciano Vincenzoni and Sergio Donati who both show an above average command of the English languages for nativeborn Italian speakers make the film a statement not only about whale hunting and whale forgiveness seeking but also about humanity. Charlotte Rampling's appeal to Nolan not to go fight the whale just because the whale wants revenge is not just about social protocols of how to make it up to the father of a whale baby you accidentally killed but also an argument against the death penalty. Will Sampson's pointless death is an indictment of the senseless slaughter of tens of millions of Native Americans. When the whale knocks down Captain Nolan's house without any explanation of this whale became such a genius that he can not only knows to knock down structural supports but also can look up addresses in the phone book it directly shows how our incursion into the world of nature is twofold. Robert Carradine's tragic death in the film is social commentary on the probability of being eaten if you stand around on a boat being followed by a crazed killer whale. And probably also something about Vietnam I assume.And while most in Hollywood choose not to admit it many have ripped off Orca. The dead baby scene in Trainspotting is suspiciously reminiscent of the dead whale fetus scene in Orca. The creepy quasiromance between an intelligent female and a somewhat crazy violent child murderer is directly stolen by George Lucas for Star Wars Episode II. The use of icebergs is blatantly coopted by Titanic and I have never heard James Cameron so much as thank Michael Anderson. And don't even get me started on Free Willy. Orca is a complicated story. If you only enjoy movies with obvious heroes and villains this is not for you. The characters are conflicted. Very conflicted. Take for instance how the killer whale jumps for joy after biting off Bo Derek's leg. The whale shows both glee in his jumps but also the pain of having lost his family and never being able to bring them back no matter how hard he fights those who took them from him. Like Batman. You see the only thing black and white in this movie is the killer whale itself. While Orca does not now get the respect it deserves in time people will realize its genius. Just as people did not understand gravity or continental drift in time they will come to recognize Orca as the greatest cinematic achievement of all time.".

Both are downer movies with a message  not an especially subtle message but one definitely worth considering.This was one of the first movies I bought many years ago on the old RCA CED video disc format. But then RCA bailed on CEDs so I hadn't seen it for years it never came out on LaserDisc and rarely shows up on cable. While browsing Amazon I found it is now available on DVD so I bought a copy. The DVD is quite rudimentary and could stand cleaning up and remastering but I still like it as much as ever.Yes the plot is a bit silly and overwrought but then so was Silent Running hence my comparison. At least the plot has some weight to it which when you get right down to it Jaws lacked.The Jaws comparison is apt however. Both films came out within 18 months of each other IIRC so Orca was dismissed as a rip off of Jaws. But they're two entirely different films which had been in simultaneous development. Jaws is a scary thrill ride while Orca tries to get the audience thinking about something of substance.As usual Richard Harris chews the scenery. Will Sampson occupies his usual wise old Indian role. Charlotte Rampling is excellent as a marine biologist who dilutes the testosterone with a thoughtful excellent performance. It's also enjoyable to see a young Robert Carradine and Bo Derek her first movie in minor roles.".

Looking back at these reviews i must say that my memory of the plot is pretty good. Personally when i saw this film I thought it to be pretty intense. The plot was not entirely bad. Sure it was inplausible that richard harris picked on the one genius killer whale in the whole atlantic. But am i to believe that nonhuman animals don't have emotions that include vengeance? No i don't believe that at all. We hairless primates should learn not to ascribe any moderately complex emotion solely under the category human.To me the real strength of this film was its allegory to the destruction of nature. I don't think it entirely inplausible that the writer wanted to symbolize the strife between man's greed and the annhilation of this planet's animals and ecosystems. The point could  have been that our own planet at some critical point might strike out at us.And come on you guys after watching JAWS you want killer animal flicks that conform to modern day science? You're telling me that great whites do in fact stalk tourist filled beaches as if they were seal colonies? Now look who's living in the 70's.....peace.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw part of this once when I was about 12 and finally got to see the whole thing when I was 20. I was impressed especially with the photography  Ennio Morricone's amazing score!I must disagree with those who called this a JAWS ripoff. It was anything but that. In JAWS Police Chief Brody Quint and Matt Hooper were the heroes  the human element. In ORCA the reverse is true  the whale is the hero of sorts and Richard Harris' character is something of an enemy  much like the 'war' between Moby Dick  Captain Ahab. While real Orcas are unlikely to engage in destructive acts toward man this movie depicts them as highly intelligenton a par with man and as such just as capable of the most basic instincts as man  a desire for vengeance.WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADThe movie starts with an amazing scene showing two orcas mating setting the stage for what's about to happen later. Rachel Charlotte Rampling is menaced by a shark but the orca intervenes and kills the shark. After the giant whale's pregnant mate is maimed  killed by Captain Nolan Harris during a capture attempt the angry male orca seeks revenge on Captain Nolan. It attacks  sinks boats in a fishing port harbor  save for that of Nolan after pushing its dead mate to shore in a whale's apparent show of grieving for its lost mate  child. After the whale destroys a flammable liquid cannister causing massive destruction by fire a highly improbable event admittedly Nolan is forced by angry fishermen to leave the town and confront the whale on ITS terms  in an ice field. In a rare reversal of 'hero' roles the whale triumphs  by throwing Nolan against an iceberg with its huge tail. Nolan is killed outright but the whale leaves Rachel alone  as if he knows she never tried to harm his mate. Afterwards the orca quietly swims away into the Atlantic his mission fulfilled.The amazing scenes of the two orcas at the start of the film were very touching especially when mixed with Ennio Morricone's terrific score  it adds so much to the movie. The theme played during this scene appears several times throughout the movie accenting the male orca's grief over the death of his mate and offspring.I DID NOT think that ORCA portrayed whales in a bad light  in order for that to make sense you would have to apply the same logic to Moby Dick which this story bears a resemblance to. Admittedly some of the orca's destructive acts are unlikely but if anything they showed the whale's high intelligence which no one has denied actually exists.An underrated movie that does well on its own and didn't have to imitate anything else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Depending on where you live Orca is either shown all the time or never it all. The film has an incredibly bad reputation and in fact this does not really come as a surprise this is a film by Michael Anderson the director of Logan's Run another film with a bad reputation. I'll try and explain why I think Orca worked for me.It is very hard or even impossible to label Orca also known as Orca Killer Whale. What exactly is this film? It's a drama a love story an odyssey a revenge film and then you haven't thrown in the scientific bits and its flirting with exploitation. Films that can't be labelled are often not very good. Compare it to the proverb Too many cooks spoil the broth. If you try to flavour your film with ingredients of many genres you often end up with a dinner that doesn't taste good at all. But just like there are cooks which are able to mingle the weirdest ingredients and end up with a yummy dish some directors are talented enough to make a film that goes beyond genre conventions. Anderson is such a director. Logan's Run and Orca are both examples of genreless films. Logan's Run never decides whether it's a scifi adventure story or a love drama. Orca as I mentioned above has no clue whatsoever of what sort of a film it is. That is what makes the film so fragile. You're not supposed to expect anything when watching the film or you might end up bitterly disappointed.The first images of Orca are extremely beautiful. We see a couple of orcas making out in the middle of the ocean. The sky is beautifully photographed and it gives you a fuzzy feeling. The first human being we see is Charlotte Rampling diving and trying to avoid a shark. The sight of Charlotte Rampling is virtually always a sign you're watching a cult movie. In a filmography of over 65 films Rampling has starred in dozens of essential cult films including the highly controversial The Night Porter. Furthermore she's a good actress. Rampling's character blocks Richard Harris's attempt to kill the shark. He is a hunter she is a biologist. Both are intrigued by each other she would like to know how someone who's always at sea knows so little about his surroundings he wants to know more about the orca they've seen. Harris ends up catching the female orca and in one of the most painful scenes of the seventies it turns out she was pregnant. The male orca is the perfect example of the lover who swears a pitiless revenge.Though a lot of the scientific mumbojumbo in the film is apparently nonsense that just sounded good the film's tagline gives you a good sense of what to expect The killer whale is one of the most intelligent creatures in the universe. Incredibly he is the only animal other than man who kills for revenge. He has one mate and if she is harmed by man he will hunt down that person with a relentless terrible vengeance  across seas across time across all obstacles.Though Orca is mainly a revenge film and an almost mythical clash between two heavyweights Harris and the orca Anderson's film doesn't just show orca revenging his wife plus man hunting orca. I fear such a film would end up either boring or a ripoff of Jaws. Some have already dismissed Orca as a ripoff but those viewers obviously didn't pick up on everything else in the film. The characters even the orca are not onedimensional and so their personas are explored. That does stand in the way of a revenge tale but Orca doesn't care. The film shows how characters cope with being in such a situation and therefore takes time to explore other parts of the characters. If you must label it as a mythical drama.The film is also helped by a wonderful soundtrack of Ennio Morricone. Richard Harris and Charlotte Rampling are great in their roles and alongside them you have Bo Derek in her debut role a few years before she'd become a sex symbol with films as 10 and Bolero. Bo Derek turned down the leading role in the King Kong remake going for a mythical orca rather than a giant ape.I hope I warmed you up for Orca. When you see it do not forget this most important advice do not expect anything. Just sit down and follow the myth. And who knows you might enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Surprisingly good killer mammal over the open sea flick which happened to follow only two years after a certain film directed by Steven Spielberg about a predatory killer Great White. That bit of misfortune plagues what is otherwise a rather nifty nature goes a killin' horror flick. Good casting is especially in this film's favor. Richard Harris is really a very valuable anchor for the film pun intended while Charlotte Rampling was another bit of solid casting that helps to bring some real acting chops to what can viewed as just another one of those Jaws ripoffs. Ultimately this is about revenge on the mind of a male killer whale after Harris's captain accidentally kills its pregnant female mate trying to capture it with a harpoon. Knicking the fin of the male this mark of identification lets the viewer know when the whale doesn't leap from the water to recognize its presence to those he wants to see his handiwork like causing boats to sink after attacking them or causing a nearby fishing village factory to go kaboom when the whale is hanging around. The fetus spilling from the ropecaught female with large cuts on its torso onto Harris' deck is horrifying as it should be reminding of him of his loss of wife and child to a drunk driver.Rampling is a marine scientist with extensive knowledge of whales. She tries to reason with Harris over confronting the killer whale soon realizing that fisherman and whale are fated to meet in a violent conclusion. This near a polar region with ice bergs. Will Sampson arrives in the film a little later to try and convince Harris that if he doesn't do battle with the whale that the fishing village would turn on him due to its detriment to their livelihood. The whale's antics include snatching Rampling's assistant Robert Carradine Revenge of the Nerds and two of Harris' fishermen Keenan Wynn basically wasted but proving how active he was even as he was aging and Peter Hooten while on the water. A rather startling but effective attack on a rental home overlooking the sea has the whale biting off Bo Derek's casted leg in perhaps its most memorable scene. Speaking of Bo she isn't used much I just assumed the filmmakers would try to get her beautiful looks in as much as possible although her fate is quite a shocker. Harris really lifts this film with a performance that Orca needs in order to be even in the conversation with Jaws. His teetering on the edge influenced greatly by Rampling's appeals for the whale as the two attempt futilely to avoid a fight on the open sea shows that he isn't just some thoughtless honorless heartless sociopath. And a good scene has Harris contemplating to Rampling about why he wanted to capture the male whale and how doing so has cost him so much. Morricone's score also adds dramatic weight and power to the film. The opening with the male and female whales soon to be parted and destroyed by Harris' carelessness rising from the water as the sun peeks from clouds is a jawdropper. Along with Pirhana I think Orca is one of the best of the emerging killer fishmammal water flicks to show up after Jaws. There have been so many rotten apples that came out of the aftermath of Jaws but I think Orca is one of the few decent efforts of the swarm. The killer whale dismantling the shark at the beginning saving Carradine only later to kill him irony at its darkest in the process an amusing message that speaks loud and clear regarding the attempt to pound the chest towards Jaws. The animatronic whales are incredible in their lifelikeness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Inadvertently killing it's mate while fishing a fisherman and his crew come to find themselves being stalked and killed by the surviving killer whale in retribution and forces him into an epic quest to settle the score.This one turned out to be quite an enjoyable and entertaining creature feature. One of the better features here is the fact that this one sets up the crucial revenge aspect of the storyline here in an incredibly welldone with a lot to like starting with the scene that sets if off when she's accidentally killed in the fishing attempt gone wrong. It's a heartbreaking scene more than anything through the actions of how sad it is hooking into the creature and bringing it aboard and how the whole scene is played out in front of the mate as the whole scene comes off with a sense of poignancy that's ultimately touching. It's mournful cries and seeing how it reacts after the fact makes this all the more touching and also leads into the film being quite fun showing off the creatures' antics as it orchestrates a rather complex and involved plan for revenge. The destruction of the fishing boats is rather cheesy but comes off in a clever way that plays into the revengedriven storyline rather well the destruction of the complex is a spectacular pyrotechnic showcase that really has a ton of outstanding action in it and the following attack on the house with the resulting injuries on his crewmember leaves this with a really exciting suspense scene as there's the race to get out before both the house falls and the whale attacks. That all leads into the incredibly fun and exciting finale which is setup as the grand epic showdown between the two as a huge chase through openwater and on into the Arctic iceflow that really meshes a lot of exciting action with the attempts to track down the creature and it's countermeasures for a wholly enjoyable sequence. These here all combine with the suitably majestic feeling for the titular beast as the film's positives that are more than enough to hold off the lone negative in here which is the rather overthetop and needless exploitation crammed into the accidental death of the mother. Despite adding another suitable layer needed for the revenge scenario it works fine enough as is without it and the sight of it doesn't need to be featured. Otherwise this one is incredibly entertaining.Rated PG Violence Language and graphic violence against animals.".

Harris is superb and Morricone's music is magnificent.

	schema:reviewBody "After JAWS 1975 started taking off producer Dino Di Laurentiis got on the phone with Italian writer Luciano Vincenzoni of THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY fame and had him begin work on a similar script that could outdo Spielberg's film. His only specificity was that the film contain a sea beast tougher and more terrible than the great white shark. Yes that's the genesis of the particular film whether you want to call it a ripoff or just inspired by... is up to you. Upon release in 1977 it was poorly received with mediocre box office and scathing reviews from most critics. Was all that deserved? Actually yep! But this isn't a bad movie because it was made in response to another film's success it's a bad movie because it's poorly acted and directed and horribly written. I don't mind films being a little farfetched but there's a big difference between being farfetched and downright preposterous. ORCA is not only impossible to take seriously but tries to have it both ways by running down a checklist of killer whales 'facts' before disregarding the scientific research it supposedly hinges its own story on. In addition to that the pacing seems off the characters aren't the least bit likable and the dialogue is unintentionally laughable Y you revengeful son of a bitch! throughout.Things actually begin very promisingly with elegant shots of whales peacefully swimming and jumping all set to a truly beautiful and moving score composed by Ennio Morricone. We then meet Captain Nolan Richard Harris and his small crew who are at a fishing village in Newfoundland with one goal in mind capturing a killer whale and transporting it to a Sea Worldlike aquarium. If they are able to do so they'll receive hundreds of thousands of dollars and well Nolan has a mortgaged boat to pay off. They meet zoology professor and whale researcher Dr. Rachel Bedford Charlotte Rampling and her assistant Ken Robert Carradine and even bear witness to Ken being saved from a great white shark BY a killer whale sort of a jab at Spielberg's film in a way but it does nothing to deter Nolan and crew from their mission.Aiming for a male orca Nolan ends up accidentally harpooning a female who then promptly attempts suicide ! by ramming herself into the boat's propeller. They hoist her up and soon realize she's with child when one splatters out onto the deck. Nolan disposes of both the baby and the mama into the ocean and the irate male orca sets out for revenge starting with leaping out of the water and chomping down on deckhand Keenan Wynn. Up until this point I was actually enjoying this movie and feeling sympathetic toward the whale's situation but that didn't last long as this rapidly starts going right downhill. The whale sinks all of the boats in the harbor except for Nolan's because apparently it wants HIM to be able to come out to sea to fight it somehow knows that knocking a few pipes loose will blow up some fuel tanks and nearly half the marina along with it and then bumps a house on stilts down so it can bite off crew girl Bo Derek's leg which is followed by a hilarious crunch sound similar to that of someone biting into a potato chip. After each attack the whale is shown shrieking or leaping from the water in a perfect arc as if it's doing some theme park act. The finale has Captain Ahab er Nolan and company letting the whale lure their boat out to some remote Arctic location ludicrously by waving its fin to direct them along and picking them off one by one since they continue to lean over the railing and hang from rope dangling over the water like idiots.Harris and Rampling are good actors but they're saddled with such poorlyscripted characters neither is able to do much to save this film. Peter Hooten playing Nolan's righthand man seems to have been dubbed by someone else in post and comes off horribly as a result. Derek  in her film debut  proves here why she was only suitable for getting naked in her narcissistic thenhusband's Razziewinning softcore porn flicks in the 80s. Most embarrassing of all is Will Sampson as the horriblystereotyped wise Indian who materializes out of thin air insisting on going along on the final fateful voyage. This character contributes absolutely nothing at all to the film and is apparently there simply because any movie dealing with Mother Nature's wrath must include a wise Indian to tell everyone what they're up against. Only this time they forgot to have the Indian do or say anything that had any bearing whatsoever on the plot.There are numerous other moronic scenes in here my favorite being when Nolan goes to ask a priest whether or not it's a sin to kill an animal ?! During another scene toward the end the Captain angrily throws down his gun and goes into some rant about how he wants to have a fair fight on equal terms with the whale. The very next scene he is shown flinging a harpoon and shooting his rifle at the animal. And I doubt I will be the only person who laughs when the whale nudges an iceberg with its nose a few times breaks off a huge chunk and then starts PUSHING it toward the ship!The best attributes here are clearly the aforementioned Morricone score and the cinematography. The whale effects are also reasonably effective using closeups of real killer whales obviously filmed somewhere in a tank and scale model whales which are fairly welldesigned... aside from a dead one on the beach that actually sways back and forth when the wind blows. Shame about the rest of the movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "After JAWS 1975 started taking off producer Dino Di Laurentiis got on the phone with Italian writer Luciano Vincenzoni of THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY fame and had him begin work on a similar script that could outdo Spielberg's film. His only specificity was that the film contain a sea beast tougher and more terrible than the great white shark. Yes that's the genesis of the particular film whether you want to call it a ripoff or just inspired by... is up to you. Upon release in 1977 it was poorly received with mediocre box office and scathing reviews from most critics. Was all that deserved? Actually yep! But this isn't a bad movie because it was made in response to another film's success it's a bad movie because it's poorly acted and directed and horribly written. I don't mind films being a little farfetched but there's a big difference between being farfetched and downright preposterous. ORCA is not only impossible to take seriously but tries to have it both ways by running down a checklist of killer whales 'facts' before disregarding the scientific research it supposedly hinges its own story on. In addition to that the pacing seems off the characters aren't the least bit likable and the dialogue is unintentionally laughable Y you revengeful son of a bitch! throughout.Things actually begin very promisingly with elegant shots of whales peacefully swimming and jumping all set to a truly beautiful and moving score composed by Ennio Morricone.

	schema:reviewBody "Judging by the few IMDb votes this film has and the fact that it's seven years old it appears that this one escaped the consciousness of even the gay audience which is a shame because it's actually very good. Its emotional detail is just about note for note on target. I'd put it in the same class with Edge of Seventeen a deceptively simple movie with the same kind of quiet intelligent emotional resonance. I'm looking forward to see if I can get some of Gisler's other movies which looks like it may be a task.The film starts Sunset Boulevardstyle with a tragedy but luckily the film proper is fully fleshedout  it doesn't feel like an afterthought it's more like the framing device used is a nice little stylistic device. It doesn't need to be there but it doesn't detract either. I felt while watching it that the film would make a very good book  and it was based on one apparently. But because this is a film and a fairly smallbudget one at that it focuses primarily on the intimate and that's what makes it such a consistent pleasure. The intimacy is quite startling the first sex for instance with Beni's spit dangling from his lip to Fogi's skin exploring Fogi's body with his lips and nose. It's incredibly erotic. But better than that there's a rare tenderness that's very admirable. And I don't just mean their kisses though that is part of it I mean the generosity the filmmaker gives to the characters the way he indulges in the druggy ecstasy of the first lustlove but also doesn't shy away from their tendency toward selfhatred.Their relationship is very much a roleplaying game it's the rock star fantasy and Beni in his tight shirt is a male groupie  Fogi's special boy. His infatuation with Fogi makes sense if we get in his head but the film doesn't make us feel it especially we don't feel the rebellion that Beni sees in Fogi and Fogi's music isn't very memorable or outrageously rock. As the relationship deepens the roleplaying becomes more sexual in nature but the undercurrent of damaging emotions remain. Beni becomes a slave boy to his studly master and the emotional degradation we begin to witness Beni clinging in his underwear to Fogi's legs as he kicks him out brought to mind Frank Norris' writing  Beni barking like a puppy dog for sexual play but also with a degree of selfloathing. It recalls the rush of contradictory emotions in the scene in Blue Velvet where Isabella Rossellini begs Kyle MacLachlan to hit her. It would seem that when we see this formerly innocent fanboy now nuzzling his face in Fogi's crotch after having been humiliated by him Fogi pours milk on him when he refuses to move the Beni character has taken an unbelievable turn but the transitions  both of the film and of Beni's character  feel smooth. And the emotional specificity of the sexual games ring incredibly true.I think by the time the end comes around a certain sense of sadness permeates the film that is quite fine. The ending works according to the delusional aspect of the relationship  at first Beni's recollections seem almost ridiculous but it's very much in tune with what we've just seen. Heartbreaking because kids do think like this. 910".

	schema:headline " Great film about a dysfunctional gay affair.";
	schema:reviewBody "From the other comments as of 2001 when I first wrote about this film here you might think Fogi is a Bastard is a total loser film but I think those others missed the boat on this one. It remains the 1 film I'd like to own on video one that actually breaks new ground in examining a hot if dysfunctional gay love affair. For me it was the best film at OUTFEST 1999 and even though as a film it probably is not a masterpiece as a gay film it is so amazing and mind blowing that it has replaced Law of Desire by Almodvar as my alltime favorite gay film. Vincent Branchet plays Beni a schoolboy in 1974 Switzerland who develops a crush on Fogi the notoriously gay lead singerguitarist of a local punk band The Minks. They form a relationship which starts out as innocent puppy dog attraction with wonderful sex and which devolves to heavy sadomasochism as Fogi descends into heroin addiction and starts hiring out Beni as a callboy and treating the willing and cooperative Beni as his dog too bad the more apropos title My Life as a Dog was already taken. It sounds unpromising I know. Yet the film is such an unsparingly realistic portrayal the actors so outstanding Branchet is both the most attractive young actor and one of the best actors period that I've seen in several years and Frederic Andrau who plays Fogi is no slouch himself that it all works. The film is beautifully shot in a realistic gritty style with a very mobile camera which defies description a scene where the characters have dropped LSD and the whirling camera is used as a metaphor for their internal state is simply stunning. It is exciting and innovative film making and the director Marcel Gisler is one to watch for. This is a film I would go back to see over and over if it were ever to get a release here.I finally got to see this film again on DVD in March 2012 and the film has lost none of its power to shock and amaze. Twelve years have passed since I saw it and still no other filmmaker has managed to make a gay themed dramatic film which so ardently and truthfully managed to capture the unvarnished essence of the sex drugs and Gothic Rock gay culture of the '70s. This film might have been set in Switzerland but it could have been set anywhere that gay people congregated in that preAIDS postStones era. This film remains a milestone of the gay cinema and deserves its place in the canon.".

Yet the film is such an unsparingly realistic portrayal the actors so outstanding Branchet is both the most attractive young actor and one of the best actors period that I've seen in several years and Frederic Andrau who plays Fogi is no slouch himself that it all works. The film is beautifully shot in a realistic gritty style with a very mobile camera which defies description a scene where the characters have dropped LSD and the whirling camera is used as a metaphor for their internal state is simply stunning. It is exciting and innovative film making and the director Marcel Gisler is one to watch for. This is a film I would go back to see over and over if it were ever to get a release here.I finally got to see this film again on DVD in March 2012 and the film has lost none of its power to shock and amaze. Twelve years have passed since I saw it and still no other filmmaker has managed to make a gay themed dramatic film which so ardently and truthfully managed to capture the unvarnished essence of the sex drugs and Gothic Rock gay culture of the '70s. This film might have been set in Switzerland but it could have been set anywhere that gay people congregated in that preAIDS postStones era. This film remains a milestone of the gay cinema and deserves its place in the canon.";

And after reading some of the previous user comments you would thing that would be the case.  But I think some of these people are wrong wrong wrong about this one.  Fogi is one of the most stunning mesmerizing and sexy yet profoundly disturbing films I have ever seen about allencompassing unrequited love.  The fact its main character is a homosexual 16yearold boy only adds to the power of the picture.Played by the youthful and disarmingly attractive Vincent Branchet Beni is a young schoolboy who falls under the spell of Fogi Frederic Andrau the lead singer of a local Swiss rock band.  After he writes Fogi a lovefan letter Fogi invites Beni to his apartment where they begin a puppy love affair with terrific mutually satisfying sex.  For Fogi of course it's just a casual fun fling with a groupie he knows will do anything for him. For Beni it's the real thing a love so strong with sex so powerful you can literally feel the love and devotion for this guy taking over this young boy's soul to the point that nothing else in life matters beyond being with Fogi whether it's in bed or tending to his every need.  Fogi returns the favor by getting the poor kid hooked on drugs leaving him alone for days on end and abusing him emotionally and mentally.  Things begin to spiral out of control in this dangerous relationship when the band's gigs dry up and Fogi leaves town to make money by selling drugs leaving Beni to mope around the apartment like an abandoned housepet.  When Fogi finally returns Beni  is ecstaticthink of a military wife welcoming her husband home from warbut something is terribly wrong with Fogi who has become hopelessly addicted to heroin and becomes increasingly abusive and cruel to his young lover in an attempt to get him to leavewhich Beni refuses to do.  Fogi then begins to literally treat Beni like a doghaving him crawl around the apartment naked wear a dog collar eat like a dog sleep curled up on the floor like a dog being washed like a dog.  When this doesn't get rid of the kid Fogi figures he might as well make money off of him and starts pimping him out to old gay men in the neighborhood which Beni gladly does since after all he's in love.All of this of course leads to an appropriately tragic ending for Fogi but on a hopeful note for Beni.  The real power of this film lies in the last bit of dialog where Beni actually believes he didn't love this jerk enough to save him from the inevitable and literally apologizes for not doing enough to save him!  Fogi is a Bastard is one of the most truthful and appropriate titles to a film I have ever seen. And I can't say enough about the actors especially Vincent Branchet who is so brave an actor he puts his young American counterparts to shame.  This is a role in which he could easily look foolish yet he pulls it offyou understand what he does because he shows the depth of his irrational love. And Frederic Andrau also shines as Fogiwho really is a bastard.  Kudos to director Marcel Gisler who films all this in an ultrarealistic manner and manages to make a nearly oneset film unclaustrophobic.  Ironically I watched this film the day after watching Attack of the Clones which was one of the most joyless and mindless mishmashes I have ever seen.  There may not be much joy in Fogi but at least it will make you think and may scare a few teens into thinking twice about getting involved in inappropriate relationships with adults.   out of ".

	schema:headline " Beautiful tender brilliantly conceived and executed. Stunning performance by Vincent Branchet.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a gem of a movie. It is very very good in so many ways that I don't know where to start so I'll start with the performances.Oh my what delights! Vincent Branchet as the teen Beni who is in love with a minor local rock star named Fgi is perfect in every moment in every scene in this movie. The balance of innocence shyness and determination in his very first encounters with Fgi is totally real and totally convincing. His devotion to Fgi through his steady decline is so touching and so true that you believe absolutely that he could not have done anything else. And unlike 99.9 of movie characters Beni is not a caricaturehe's a complex character a living human being who changes significantly in response to what happens to him in the course of the movie. Beni goes from wideeyed enthusiastic innocence through great joy great humiliation cynicism toughness maturity despair and ultimate survivaland Branchet hits every single note absolutely perfectly. He is never predictable never artificial never acting and never ever wrong. I've never seen a better performance by any actor in any movie ever.Frdric Andrau has a less complex role in Fgi but he carries it off just as expertly. Fgi is somewhat like Lou Reed one of his idols but less talented less pretentious and much more attractive. Fgi has Reed's nihilism without his survival instincts and Andrau plays him raw without any veneer of civility. But despite the movie's strange title Fgi is not a bastard he's not a monster. He's a pure hedonist he lives for pleasure alone but he shares his pleasure freely with those around him especially with Beni. But pleasure alone is not enough to make a life and so Fgi's life runs out early.What's most remarkable in both lead actors is their ability to embody conflicting traits simultaneously. As Beni is both sweetly innocent and fiercely determined Fgi is both destructive and heartbreakingly tender. Whatever cruelty he occasionally shows Beni is just a shadow of what he's doing to himself and his genuine love for Beni never really falters.All the supporting performers are good too particularly Urs Peter Halter as Fgi's sweet longsuffering bandmate Tbe who may be in love with Fgi too although it's never said.But as great as the two lead performances are what shines most brightly in this movie is the relationship between the two men. It joins the two performances together into something even greater than either is on its own. I realized about halfway through that I was watching one of the greatest love stories ever filmed.The relationships between Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind and between Heathcliff and Cathy in Wuthering Heights take place on a grander scale and over a longer period but in emotional power they both pale next to this modest little story of Fgi and Beni. Where both those earlier stories are high melodrama with grand passions on a grand scale Fgi and Beni are little people living in a little world a real world a world that's right here with us right now.They live in the same mostly dark mostly petty mostly messy but sometimes glorious world all of us live in. We're not all failing rock stars or lovelorn teenagers but most of us have loved somebody more than we should have most of us have been deeply hurt and humiliated most of us know what it feels like to hold onto somebody who is pushing us away and most of us have known at least a few moments of passion so great and so transcendent that it swept us away and made everything worthwhile. That's what this movie is about.Until today I was grateful that gay romance in the movies even existed at all. The fact that those romances were mostly not quite believableand never so powerful that they blew me awaywas okay because it was better than nothing. Just to see two men willing to kiss or touch each other in front of a camera was good enough. Now this movie comes along and blows the doors off that tired old barn.There do not exist in any movie ever made love scenes like the ones in this movie as touching as powerful as wildly tenderly profoundly erotic without ever being pornographic as the love scenes between Fgi and Beni. No man and woman ever did on screen what these two men do and I don't mean graphic sex acts. I mean touching each other like they're on fire kissing like they want to swallow each other holding each other like they've got hold of the greatest treasure in the universe joy and pleasure dancing back and forth between them like lightning. It's electrifying but it's also very tender very gentle and exquisitely beautiful.There's a lot of nudity a lot of bed sex and every bit of it is absolutely essential. But the best scene in the movie isn't in bed isn't even overtly sexual and both men are fully clothed the cover pic is from that scene. They're outside walking together on a hill enjoying a beautiful afternoon just sharing their delight in being together. But their joy is drugenhanced and you know it can't last Lou Reed's marvelous song Heroin is playing on the soundtrack but it's lovely while it lasts.I've never seen anything like this movie and I never expect to again. I recommend it very very enthusiastically.".

	schema:reviewBody "An addicted relationship between a minor and a adult is still a controversial topic and from time to time I am intrigued to see how such a liaison is depicted. As F. est un salaud includes a gay theme as well there are mandatory topics of prostitution mental issues and drugs visible through a 25y.o. and a 15y.o. males while the latter is performed by a 20y.o. actor not looking younger... There are some brave scenes and good camerawork but the film is primarily a record of young affection and obedience rather than a versatile depiction of characters evolving. Moreover it leaves some issues unclear as well was gay life in the 1970ies Switzerland really as open and easy? What about Beni's family when he began to live with Fgi? The ending was also hasty and without any surprise. As I was referred to this film from a film I really liked I had apparently higher hopes but I have to recognise that F. est un salaud did not fully conform to my type of nature and values. But those fond of unconditional love and artistic lifestyle might squeeze more out of it.".

As F. est un salaud includes a gay theme as well there are mandatory topics of prostitution mental issues and drugs visible through a 25y.o. and a 15y.o. males while the latter is performed by a 20y.o. actor not looking younger... There are some brave scenes and good camerawork but the film is primarily a record of young affection and obedience rather than a versatile depiction of characters evolving. Moreover it leaves some issues unclear as well was gay life in the 1970ies Switzerland really as open and easy? What about Beni's family when he began to live with Fgi? The ending was also hasty and without any surprise. As I was referred to this film from a film I really liked I had apparently higher hopes but I have to recognise that F. est un salaud did not fully conform to my type of nature and values. But those fond of unconditional love and artistic lifestyle might squeeze more out of it.";

Of course there is the usual film drugaddicts stuff Velvet Underground music Andy Wharhol posters etc. The positive thing about this movie is that it's just a love drama with two men and not one of those films where this is made into something special without any stereotype stuff like drag queens strange bars etc.".

	schema:headline " James J. Braddock Gladiator of the Great Depression";
	schema:reviewBody "Cinderella Man deserves to be placed alongside other great biographical films dealing with the lives and times of great boxers. Such films include Raging Bull The Joe Louis Story Ali The Hurricane and Ring of Fire The Emile Griffith Story. These films share in common not just a documentarylike approach to boxing or a superficial biopic. They also portray the human side of a modern gladiator and the culture that produced him. In the case of Cinderella Man we are given a detailed and heartrending portrait of the Great Depression in American. The story of the gentleman pugilist James J. Braddock is the backdrop to the larger drama of Americans' struggle in the 1930s.Russell Crowe provides a brilliant interpretation of Braddock capturing the decency of a man whose career as a boxer would appear to have peaked at just the wrong time prior to the Crash of 1929. After that momentous event Braddock's boxing went into decline just like the lives of millions of Americans. The scenes of Braddock and his family living in squalid conditions and with uncertainty about such basics as heat and electricity were carefully developed in the film. Rene Zellweger was outstanding as Mae the caring but feisty wife of Braddock. Paul Giamatti was also excellent as Braddock's handlermanager Joe Gould. Joe tries to keep up appearances by sporting fancy clothes. But in one revealing scene in the film when we see the interior of Joe's ostensibly swanky apartment there is no fancy furniture other than a dowdy table and some flimsy deck chairs. Everyone is reeling from the Depression. In the depiction of the massive unemployment the Hoovervilles of the homeless residing in Central Park and the desperate need for Americans for an optimistic icon like Braddock to raise their spirits the film truly captured the tragedy of the Great American Depression.The film's director Ron Howard emphasized closeups throughout the film with uneven results. In many of the boxing sequences the closeups and rapid editing made it difficult tell the fighters apart. The closeups continued even into the domestic scenes and the outdoor sequences depicting Braddock working as a longshoreman. The film's dark cinematography conveyed the bleakness of the Depression years but it worked against bringing out the buoyant spirit of Braddock himself and the optimism that he instilled in others. As a director Howard's strength is not in film artistry or technique. As apparent in this and other films his gift lies in narrative storytelling and the development of dramatic character.Indeed the characters and the story were the strong points of Cinderella Man. Much credit should go to Cliff Hollingsworth for a screenplay that included thoughtful dialogue humor and multidimensional characters. Daniel Orlandi also merits praise for the brilliant costumes that helped to recreate the period of the early 1930s.But the heart of this film experience is Russell Crowe's screen portrayal of Braddock. It was the colorful sportswriter and raconteur Damon Runyan who coined the nickname of Cinderella Man for Braddock. However the real James J. Braddock was more than lucky. It was his strength of character in and out of the ring that captivated America. One of the most moving scenes of the film was a heated argument between Braddock and his wife Mae where Braddock insists that even in the most difficult of times he would refuse to be separated from his children. As a boxer he was fearless. But he demonstrated even more courage in fighting for family valuesa lesson from which we can learn a great deal today in reflecting on this sensitive film.".

I've already seen Million Dollar Baby and Raging Bull this year and accidentally watched part of one of the son of Rocky serial movies on a Saturday afternoon. I feel like I am being punched as Renee' Zellwegger's character Mae Braddock says and I'm not as tough as these prize fighters.But this one has Russell Crowe in it. And that makes all the difference. It is not that Renee Zellwegger and Paul Giamatti Paddy Considine Bruce McGill and Craig Bierko among others give less than stellar performances they all live up to their justifiably great reputations. You have to believe they are at the top of their game. But for all of Russell Crowe's reputation for being difficult it is hard to think of actors who can equal his personal force on the screen. He is brilliant. Ron Howard has made of the real life of Depressionera prizefighter James J. Braddock a work of art. The camera work is phenomenal. Without using violins or clich' pullback shots showing the numbers of people homeless and in soup lines Howard makes the Depression a visceral reality with scenes of nearhopeless men at the docks pleading for a day's work a stolen salami Crowe's giving his daughter his breakfast piece of bologna telling her he dreamed he was full. The bleakness of the times is the graininess and the sepiagreyness of the camera shots the images are stark but completely descriptive. Crowe as Braddock with hat in hand and tears in his eyes begging for twenty dollars so he can get his children back into his home is the personification of pride sacrificed to desperation. But when Braddock is later asked at a press conference why he is fighting at his age and after so many poor showings all he has to say is milk to be supremely eloquent.Doubtless many people know the history of James Braddock and know the outcome of his fights including the championship bout with Max Baer who had already killed two men in the ring. If you don't know DON'T look it up before you see the movie and if you DO KNOW DON'T TELL but go. Analogous to watching Howard's film Apollo 13 you may know the outcome but there's wonderful suspense in the details. These were among the most exciting last twenty minutes I've seen on film. I didn't expect to be able to watch but like Braddock's terrified wife Mae I was unable to tear myself away.The audience was like a prize fight audience cheering booing gasping groaning during the fights. We applauded Braddock's wins suffered his defeats. It is a great movie with authentic heart. Solid A.".

Gould is that brave manager if not literally in spirit. He pits Braddock out of shape and with one day notice against the number two heavy weight contender. Regardless of the risk it's a pay day needed by both Gould and Braddock.The story while familiar is executed brilliantly. The camera work is both subtle and in turn spectacular.

While all three films have boxing and love of the underdog as a common theme this movie is much more. The backdrop of the movie is Depressionera America around NYC. And you are taken back to this depressing and hopeless time of willing hardworking idle discouraged poor people.The threesome of Russell Crowe as the fighter Braddock and Renee Zellweger as his wife and Paul Giamatti as his manager were AcademyAward worthy. They professionally played their parts and let the story be the real star.Braddock is a downonhisluck aging and hurt boxer who can no longer box and can no longer find enough work to support his wife and three kids. By a twist of fate he is given another chance to fight and his career begins again.Braddock and his wife display lowkey dignity and honor that we wish we all had. They are good spouses parents neighbors and citizens without showing off. While this is a serious drama it has a lot of light humor throughout the picture that is entertaining and appropriate. Director Ron Howard does a wonderful storytelling job and has kept directorial tricks to a minimum. The fight scenes were the most real I have seen in any movie.This is filmmaking at its best.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.".

	schema:reviewBody "If the great depression of the 1930s is a mystery to you then Cinderella Man can fix that. The story about the ups and downs in the career of a boxer is uplifting and entertaining. However what makes this film more than that is its believable depiction of the great depression.The sets look similar to pictures I have seen in books I read about the depression and the costumes are correct. But this is not just a period piece. The behavior of everyone in the cast and every extra shows dedication to reproducing the gestures and attitudes I have observed in people I have personally known who lived through the depression.Take for example the scene at the dock where Braddock the boxer waits with dozens of other men for the chance to work a stevedore job for the day. We need ten shouts the boss. Then he points and counts. Every eye is trying to meet his trying to be picked. Not a gesture is out of place.This kind of verisimilitude comes only from fanatics for accuracy. Look at drector Ron Howard and male lead Russell Crowe. Ron Howard also directed Cocoon Willow and  for the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Picture  A Beautiful Mind which also starred Crowe. He drove the set designers the costumers the cast and the extras with telling effect. Nothing is overacted.Crowe trained for the film using the same lowtech methods used in boxing in the 1930s. He also studied film footage of Braddock to master the real fighter's characteristic gestures. In the ring said one of Crowe's trainers he successfully duplicated Braddock's moves his footwork and his style.The boxing drives the story along. It is bloody fierce boxing. Some people may find the fight scenes objectionably violent. Crowe broke his hand in training. Real fighters played most of his opponents. Sometimes they forgot they were supposed to fake punches leading to the spilling of real blood which was left in the final version. Crowe also landed a few real punches by mistake.The boxing however is overshadowed by life during the depression. Millions were out of work. Milk was delivered in bottles by a milk man. People left their empty milk bottles out at night so the milk man could collect them early the next morning and replace them with full bottles. When the dairy could no longer extend a family's credit the empty bottles were still there in the morning with a note of apology stuck in the mouth of one of them.During the depression there was no unemployment insurance no Medicaid and no Social Security. There was the dole but it was new humiliating and under funded. You cold not get enough to keep your family fed and clothed.Braddock is shown waiting for and getting his dole another moving scene in which everyone is stoically in character. The film also accurately depicts the huge gap that opened between the masses of the poor and the few fabulously wealthy.This is a very entertaining film. However if you are just beginning to study the great depression it can be a a great head start.".

They are very reminiscent of the boxing sequences in Raging Bull. They are so well executed however that I quickly forgot about this small nitpick.The script works on so many levels it's not even funny. There is plenty of time devoted to character development and it pays off handsomely in the long run as we really care about Jim Braddock every time he steps in the ring.All in all Cinderella Man is a rousing classy film that utterly satisfies.".

It provides a more visceral view of the Great Depression era than did another fine film Seabiscuit. Call it Seabiscuit with even more heart! Ron Howard teams with Russell Crowe James J. Braddock again and shows they can repeat with a winner. Like him as a person or not Crowe puts forth another finely tuned very convincing performance. Unlike in real life he can be quite humble and sympathetic while beating the heck out of people. Really his character is affecting especially in his scenes with Braddock's children and may be fairly reflective of the actual person of Braddock. The fight game at that time or any time was not for saints but whatever. Renee Zellweger who is not my favorite except for a brilliant portrayal in Cold Mountain plays the wife effectively and mirrors the emotions for the females in the audience. If my observations at the showing are typical women fans will spend time alternately heading their eyes and virtually cheering out loud for BraddockCrowe. There are a number of good supporting actors but Paul Giamatti strikes again! He plays the manager who supports Braddock through thick and thin and his character recalls the era better than anyone in the film. I don't know what kind of research he did for this role but his Joe Gould is the archetypal boxing manager of the time or at least our cinema image of one. Here's hoping he pulled some big bucks for a role for once.You will certainly recognize Bruce McGill as the seemingly hardhearted fight promoter who could care less about Braddock but really doesn't want to see him get killed in the ring from many movie and TV appearances where he is always reliable and who may be remembered from an early exposure as DDay in Animal House.".

It starts a bit slow but it gives you background into the life of Jimmy Braddock a once great boxer who fell into hard times because of the great depression. Him and his family experienced all the heartaches that everyone else did at that time.Even though he retired from boxing he was viewed as a joke his manager Giamatti got him one fight against a 1 contender to the belt. Everyone expected Jimmy to lose....I'll leave you to see the movie from here on out! Everyone was SUPERB in their roles and there's no reason that Crowe Giamatti Zellweger and Howard shouldn't be up for nominations. It was an outstanding movie my heart was POUNDING during the last 15 minutes. After the movie everyone stood up and cheered...EVERYONE!

It was fabulous and plan on seeing it again when it comes out Nationwide. Go see this movie!!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "Cinderella Man is the story of a Depressionera boxer and American hero Jim Braddock but it contains enough love interest family interest and greatchampionofthepeople interest to satisfy most Saturday night out filmgoers. It's a total nobrainer beautifully served up and all the clichs delivered with such accurate emotional punch that you forgive it for being a tad unoriginal.Gladiator and barbrawl man Russell Crowe plays the lead role and Rene Zellweger puts in a good performance as the ideal and very loving wife that supports her husband through thick and thin. The story starts in 1928 when Braddock is doing quite well but the depression hits and with an injured hand he is forced to work in the shipyard. He and his family live in fairly abject poverty until a lucky break enables him to make a comeback.This is the working man's hero who never says a bad word teaches his kids never to steal for food even when they are starving and nobly gives back his social security money the minute he can afford to. Zellwegger is similarly faultless of course striking the right balance between supportiveness and concern that her man could get his brains knocked out permanently. The last fight generates quite a lot of genuine excitement due largely to neat editing and intense cinematography  you can almost feel your nose bleed just watching it.This is classic Americanstyle hero creation and worship and on the face of it healthy enough. So why the doubts? Sure you can sit back and just enjoy it it's the type of story the U.S. has done well for a long time but compare it with European cinema and it all seems very full of absolutes. The heroes don't have any failings. The choice is between total success and total failure no half measures. Much as I admire the use of role models I somehow wonder if more human heroes aren't sometimes called for people who do quite well who sincerely better themselves and others but without becoming the most applauded individual on the continent. In watching the big picture we sometimes miss the detail that makes life real to everyone not just the lucky few.".

I don't want to tell the story and spoil the spirit. It was never boring the entire movie.Russell Crowe once again lived up to the expectations and did a very good job.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow this was an involving story and the best boxing movie I think I've ever seen and I've seen most of them. It's an oldfashioned underdog ragstoriches sports story about a very likable hero heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock played fantastically by Russell Crowe. This is another Seabiscuit meaning a truelife tale of longshot going up against extraordinary odds. More than the boxing however this is a great family story of a devoted husband and father and a loving supporting wife and mother. That's the crux of this biography more than the boxing angle. Nothing but the highest of morals and ethics are espoused by our hero here who would starve himself rather see his children miss a meal while teaching his kids honesty and unselfishness and doing whatever it took to take care of his family. Renee Zellweger also shines as Braddock's wife. After a string of some sleazy roles it's nice to see Zellweger play this type of character. The two make an inspiring couple which is refreshing to see in this age of cynical filmmaking. This is another reason why I label this an oldfashioned story. The primary subject's strengths not flaws are emphasized.Is it exaggerated? Probably but I have no complaints seeing a good guy look better instead of worse. One gets tired of the modernday age of the antihero. It's nice once again to see a good man propped up instead of shot down.The third major character in the film is Joe Gould Paul Giamatti Braddock's trainer and loyal friend. Unfortunately he spits out the Lord's name in vain so many times I lost count the only objectionable aspect of this film. But Gould was the kind of friend every guy would want.Craig Bierko gets fourth billing as Max Baer the reigning heavyweight champ whom Braddock has to beat to get the title. Now here is where I would not be surprised if his movie character was nothing like real life because Hollywood has to have a bad guy to counteract the good guy so here it is Baer the last obstacle in the way of Braddock's quest to be heavyweight champion. Whatever the real Baer was like I don''t know but I know Bierko does a great job in this role.The boxing scenes supervised by reallife Hall Of Fame trainer Angelo Dundee are lifelike and welldone. Crowe did a wonderful job of imitating Braddock's ring style.The story isn't the only thing that is entertaining. Visually this is a wonderful treat for your eyes. It's simply beautiful and director Ron Howard really excelled in capturing the 1930s Depression era with some beautifully muted colors. The sets are fantastic and the clothing cars buildings etc put you smack in the middle of the 1930s. There are great production values in this film and the DVD does it all justice with a fabulous transfer on widescreen DVD.".

But even when taken out of context Cinderella Man is a fine elaborately and accurately produced if minimalistic Depressionera boxingpic love story that simply doesn't go where no great movie hasn't gone before.Crowe as always gave a studied performance that reflected his involved physical and mental preparation not to mention his accent! Zellweger I thought was the most underrated of the bunch because she really held her own opposite Crowe stealing many of his scenes as the hearttugging emotional core of the story. Giamatti's supporting perf should earn him his first and overdue Oscar nomination since it was a fun snarky kind of role infused with vigor and heart  great for a character actor. Otherwise though Ron Howard's direction might have made an already unoriginal subject matter more predictable. Still it was without a doubt a good movie if not a great one  a film that was wellmade if neither innovative nor emotionally sweeping.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I get to whether or not I liked this film the history teacher in me thinks it's very important to set the record straight. Although the film is pretty accurate when it comes to the career of James Braddock it's very inaccurate in portraying his opponent Max Baer. The champion Baer is shown as a sadistic jerk who killed two men while boxingand really delighted in taunting Braddock about this. In the film the evil and filthymouthed Baer tells Braddock to bow out of the fight as he could be the next to die in the ringand he really seems to LIKE tormenting Braddock's wife about this. In reality Baer killed one man in the ring. It was a horrible accident which occasionally happens in boxingone which apparently haunted Baer for the rest of his life. In fact he helped pay for his dead opponents to get educations and looked after this familyhardly the act of a sadist. I understand why the folks who made Cinderella Man changed this in an attempt to create tension but the story would have STILL worked great if it had just stuck to the truth. Plus think of how this film affected Baer's relatives when they saw it. Max Baer Jr. 'Jethro' from The Beverly Hillbillies knew his father was not like this and I am sure it pained him to see him so badly misrepresented.As for the NONBaer parts of the film they are great. The look of the 1930s is exceptionalmuch more realistic than you often see in films. Also the acting is terrific the film VERY engaging and the story of Braddock very compelling. Without the misrepresentation of Baer's in the story I would have given this one a 10. Really....it's that compelling and they did a great job. The acting direction designs...everything but the writing was perfect.By the way this isn't so much a complaint as an observation. In this movie like practically EVERY other boxing movie there is hardly any defense such as blocked shots in the boxing matchespunch after punch that lands on the opponent. If fights REALLY were like this they'd rarely go beyond the first round!".

He has clearly lost weight he seemingly effortlessly picked up an accent and his attitude is flawlessly proud browbeaten and unendingly strong. When he first loses his license to box at the beginning of the film he conveys without shoving anything in our face his sense of disappointment that he cannot provide for his family. He works furiously on the docks with a broken hand and still cannot keep his house heated. So at last in one of the most moving moments of the film he does what he would almost rather die than do goes to his old friends and asks them for money. I do not want to give away too many details of the film. But I can say it is the best in years and although i doubt it will because of A Beautiful Mind it should win more than a few Oscars.".

	schema:reviewBody "In all the history of the boxing game you find no human interest story to compare with the life narrative of J J. Braddock.Damon Runyan.Rags to riches films are notoriously divisive amongst critics and fans alike often tagged derogative wise as Awards Baiters one could be forgiven for thinking that uplifting pictures have no place in cinema society. On the surface Cinderella Man was always going to struggle to totally capture the movie loving world. It's directed by Ron Howard who seems to forever be charged with the crime of lacing his puddings with too much sugar and it's written by the person who brought us Batman  Robin! So not a good start there for many. Add into the equation that Russell Crowe stars as Braddock at a time when Crowe was gaining unfavourable press for anger issues and a love of poetry And also that it's yet another boxing movie this film was disliked before it had even been released. Which is a mighty shame as the finished product is a triumph of acting and story telling nous in fact inspiring probably isn't the word to do it total justice.Much like with Apollo 13 Howard has managed to grab a story with a known ending and mold it into a heavyweight champion of a picture. Set as it is in the Great Depression the amount of sentiment and heart tugging is naturally very high but what would you have Howard do? Forgo the feeling of the time and Braddock's real life situation? Perhaps in favour of filler scenes that have no actual worth? Cinderella Man has no agenda other than to tell this incredible story of a good honest family man struggling to make ends meet. With a heart of a lion and a chin quarried from granite Braddock brilliantly realised by the irrepressible Crowe went from top to bottom and rose like a phoenix to defy the odds and stun the boxing world at a time when morale was particularly low for many. This is no Rocky Balboa bunting strewn fanfare picture this is a real story from a real period expertly told by all involved.This is not to say that Cinderella Man is a perfect piece it most definitely isn't. My personal complaint rests with not fully fleshing out the friendship between Braddock and Mike Wilson with the almost unforgivable crime of underusing the talent of Paddy Considine Wilson entered on to the charge sheet. Craig Bierko as the murderously ruthless champion boxer Max Baer has obviously studied the character getting the movements of the champ down pat but he just never fully convinces as a real life boxer of note something that Crowe most assuredly manages to do. But they are minor quibbles to me and offset by the wonderful Paul Giamatti as Braddock's trainer Joe Gould every sequence featuring just him and Crowe are real cinema high points an acting tour de force from two very talented men. A special mention has to go to Renee Zellweger who as Braddock's devoted wife gets arguably the toughest role in the picture that she leaves a firm and emotionally enlightening impression is with much credit to the pretty and undervalued Texan.Rags to riches films are here to serve a purpose they exist and will continue to be made because the world sometimes needs reminders that love hope and respect can reign supreme especially in trying and troubled times. Cinema is actually a form of medicine especially when grounded in facts. Is it right to deny yourself a tonic when the need arises? Of course not thankfully those involved with Cinderella Man knew exactly what to prescribe for the story of J J. Braddock. 910".

But I particularly like that scene when Braddock is to fight Max and they meet in the hotel and later Mae is shown cleaning the dishes. Very true depiction of the era. Money's worth by all means though some scenes are very graphic and could have been avoided but I guess Crowe or his directors like gore just as in gladiator.

I felt so much empathy of Lemmon who's character Jack Godell only wanted people to listen to his warning.But what impresses me most about this film is the lack of a score and this is also what makes it beautiful to me. Apart from the opening titles there are no background music to increase the tension because none is needed. And while the credits run white on black in silence it drives the point home.I use the movie as an example to anyone who says music makes the movie. I think the movie should make the movie and the music should only amplify that. But for The China Syndrome music is not necessary to get across the realism and the urgency depicted here. The characters portray all of this far better than the music ever could.I highly recommend this movie it is one of my favorites. If you like movies you won't be disappointed.

The network brass doesn't think so and soon both Fonda and Douglas are entangled in a web of legalities concerning the tape.The crux of the film is Lemmon's character. A man torn between loyalty to his company and telling the truth  even in the face of grave consequences. What makes this horror scenario so compelling is that these are true fleshandblood people stuck in the most extraordinary of circumstances faced with both a threat of cosmic proportions as well as a human one.This is a remarkably chilling thriller and I'm disappointed that it's not taken more seriously as both art and tract.".

The network brass doesn't think so and soon both Fonda and Douglas are entangled in a web of legalities concerning the tape.The crux of the film is Lemmon's character. A man torn between loyalty to his company and telling the truth  even in the face of grave consequences. What makes this horror scenario so compelling is that these are true fleshandblood people stuck in the most extraordinary of circumstances faced with both a threat of cosmic proportions as well as a human one.This is a remarkably chilling thriller and I'm disappointed that it's not taken more seriously as both art and tract.";

What if contractors driven by profit omit to xray all the welded joints in a power station's water pumps?  What if contaminated water leaches into the environment?  What if faulty instruments indicate that reactor rods are being cooled when in fact they are exposed and generating uncontainable heat?The film is also a dissertation on the power of the media to shape our awareness.  In the opening sequence we see images of Kimberly Wells the Channel 3 news presenter but we hear the disembodied voices of directors controlling the newscast.  Powerful unseen people decide what we can see. There are also mishearings and broken links  TV is an imperfect medium and the wrong information can easily be conveyed.  Hey! Hey! Is anybody listening to me? asks Kimberly.  It is a metaphor for the whole film.Kimberly and a freelance cameraman Richard Adams drive out to the Ventana power plant to shoot some routine feature footage.  During their visit an earth tremor causes a 'scram' an emergency alert in the plant's control room.  Flouting regulations Adams surreptitiously films the panic.Kimberly and Richard Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas make a harmonious team.  As they head along the freeway to the accompaniment of the opening music we see them sharing a soft drink nodding in agreement and mirroring each other's hand gestures.  Later when events force them in divergent directions the issues will seem clearer for us because we have seen the team cooperating closely.For the first threequarters of this film I was rejoicing that for once a Hollywood project was dealing with a real issue rather than relying on guns and police cars.  The China Syndrome shows that social and political conflict can be gripping on the big screen even more gripping than the action genre.  Imagine my disappointment then when in the final stretch the movie lost its nerve and turned to guns and police cars.  For all that the thing was worth doing.  Michael Douglas an actorproducer in the tradition of his father had the courage to make a feature film about the seemingly unpromising subject of the hazards of nuclear energy.  he is to be commended for that.Jack Lemon is wonderful as Jack Godell the middlemanager with a conscience.  He is introduced into the story during the earth tremor and he alone notices the secondary shudder which spells potential disaster.  We see in his thoughtful careworn face a gradual realisation that something is terribly wrong.  It is this growing awareness and Godell's honest desire to do something about it which provide the engine of the plot.  Godell is torn between his innate sense of fairness and a sincere loyalty to his industry. I love that plant he says and he means it.  During the tremor crisis the camera's focus is thrown from Kimberly and Richard in the observation gallery to Godell on the control room floor.  It is he not the media who will be the battleground on which this conflict will be fought.The secondary strand of the plot concerns Kimberly's place in the TV news industry.  Don Jacovich the channel boss wants to steer her away from hard news and restrict her to anodyne stories about animals and children. You're better off doing the softer stuff he tells her.  She was hired for her looks not for her analytical powers.  When she raises the subject of the clandestine filming of the 'scram' she is told not to worry her pretty little head about it.  She is a performer says Jacovich Peter Donat strongly implying that thinking forms no part of her duties.When Kimberly tries to follow up the Ventana story her very celebrity gets in the way.  Autograph hunters in the local bar make it impossible for her to interview Godell properly.  At the end her dual role as a participant in and reporter of events culminates in an emotional broadcast during which she concedes I'm sorry  I'm not very objective.When a news station acquires 'hot' footage should it screen the material regardless of consequences on the basis of public interest? Richard provokes this debate by letting his camera roll inside the plant. Jacovich is worried about broadcasting an unconfirmed story because to do so is irresponsible use of media power not to mention the lawsuits it would attract.  Richard sees this as cowardice.Weaknesses in the film centre on the credibility of the story.  When Hector needs rescuing Richard ousts the medics and takes personal control even though he is only a cameraman.  Kimberly and Richard nurse the stricken Godell while everyone else ignores him  even though he has just made international headlines.However the film contains plenty that is excellent.  In a morality tale about the artifice of TV we are shown how even the anchor man's adlibs are read from the autocue.  Fittingly TV literally moves into the plant's control room for the climax of the story.  The phrase 'no accident' keeps recurring with semantic syncopations.  The SWAT team is careful to avoid the cameras a nice touch which suggests that the police's work is somehow dirty.  In a memorable shot McCormack the flinthearted chairman of the board looks down on the seemingly tiny Kimberly and Godell the representatives of the little guy.  As the plant emergency grows complicated the TV director cuts to a commercial for microwave ovens  frivolous radiation jarring ironically with the deadly stuff.  Kimberly's slip of the tongue selfish sufficiency for selfsufficiency is a clever comment on the attitude of the power company.  The tense climax of the 'scram' is made more excruciating by being entirely wordless.  In an awful moment we get to learn what the 'China Syndrome' actually is.  This is powerful cinema.".

Don't let this mislead you the film is not about a female reporter a woman struggling to succeed in a maledominated profession. That is merely a leadin a way of starting the filmthough it's used later. The actual point to this production is revealed gradually and the first we see of it is in a deliberately long scene early on. The entire film has that pace not slow or drawnout but deliberate. It's never really fast even in the few sequences that one would normally expect to be so. This pacingespecially because it seems to slow down further as the plot is revealed as the disturbing unsettling nature of the film is unraveled is strong almost painful to the viewer. It inspires you to if it had been possible jump into the screen grab the people responsible by the collar and yell at them to do something about it to remedy the situation. Never once did I feel like getting up or even taking my eyes off the screen for a moment. The subject is extremely important to be aware of and it's handled perfectly here. No overdramatizationwell... very little anyway just an accurate presentation of the issue. The direction is astounding. The empathy felt for Lemmon's character is profound. The editing is masterful... one scene near the very end illustrates that perfectly. The editor judging from his filmography is vastly underrated. The writing was excellent. The acting was great in particular by Lemmon Fonda and Douglaswho also produced it. The lack of a score is perfect no music is needed to enhance. The ending is sublime and effective. The movie does have a few negative points... among them some of the dialog is obviously and undeniably mainly exposition one particular part of the film whilst dramatic doesn't seem to mesh with something that follows it. Not everyone will watch the film because of two features of it which are commonly and rightfully so attributed to bad movies the pacingwhich can be mistaken as being slow and the lack of score. One could argue that to be a negative thing as everyone ought to consider the points it presents but maybe it's better this way handling the heavy subject with the intelligence and respectfor the topic as well as the viewer... something like this maybe it shouldn't be spoonfed.

The decades since the release of the film have demonstrated that the willingness to cut costs at the expense of public safety is definitely not just something imagined by a screenwriter.However I think the most impressive element of this film is Jack Lemmon's performance. It is absolutely astonishing to watch him at work. He has the gift to be able to communicate so much at times without saying a word. Next time you watch this film check out Jack's face at the times he is not saying anything. He does not need to speak or worse yet to mug to let you know what's going through his mind.I am calling this a spoiler because of the impression it made on me when I first saw the film in Lemmon's last scene in the film as he is lying on the floor he feels a slight vibration. The terror in his eyes is one of the most frightening images I have seen in any film. It is perfect acting because it conveys instantly the threat about to occurif Jack's character is so terrified there is certainly something awful about to happen. And it does.".

No one is taking the time to provide the care in that software that is continually being 'improved' and building like a house of cards.

And of course they wouldn't examine the Xrays or know what they were looking for if they did.  The fox is guarding the henhouse in many areas in which we foolishly think we are protected.  This movie attempts to unveil that danger something movies are no longer allowed to do since they are made by the same Big Business conglomerates that give you the nuclear plants the Keystone tires the Ford rollovers.Jane Fonda does a fantastic job of playing the innocent ingenue something that hardbrained tough lady isn't in real life.  And of course Jack Lennon dear departed did one fantastic job as the illfated conscience of the nuclear plant.  Check this one out of the video store....before all the copies are ordered destroyed.

	schema:reviewBody "The China Syndrome truly is a landmark film. What helps the most in making it so successful is its docudrama approach giving it a sense of immediacy that you might not ordinarily get in a Hollywood production. For example there is no music score on the soundtrack manipulating us to feel a certain way at specific moments. The story screenplay credited to Mike Gray T.S. Cook and director James Bridges is compelling enough without additional accompaniment. Also you also feel as if you're really learning something about the machinations of television news as well as the nuclear power industry. And the film turned out to be awfully prophetic the real life notorious Three Mile Island incident occurred not long after.A small time news station is doing a series of stories on nuclear power and while they are present at the Ventana power plant an accident takes place. The powers that be are convinced that nothing serious has happened but the truth of the matter is far different. There are problems with the plant that only surface after loyal plant executive Jack Godell Jack Lemmon is concerned enough to do his own sleuthing. Meanwhile a TV reporter Kimberly Wells Jane Fonda and a radical camera man Richard Adams Michael Douglas realize that they're really on to something big.Bridges does an expert job at reeling in his viewers and holding their attention for approximately two hours without injecting his film with unnecessary stylistics. The material is downright fascinating which helps since Bridges goes for a careful measured pace. There is action to be sure as powerful people do everything they can  like running others off the road and calling in SWAT teams  to ensure that nothing hurts their business. But at least the ending leaves you with a feeling of hope that it won't be so easy anymore to cover things up.The cast is impeccable right down the line Fonda as the beauty who yearns to get out of fluff pieces and do more substantial news Douglas as the pesky independent operator and especially Lemmon. Lots of familiar faces supporting them too Scott Brady James Hampton Peter Donat Richard Herd James Karen Donald Hotton Lewis Arquette Rita Taggart et al. It's particularly nice to see Wilford Brimley in his first substantial film role as Godells' co worker and friend.Definitely catch this one. It's a real gem.10 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Three Underlying Threads";
	schema:reviewBody "No need to recap the plot nor echo consensus points on the excellence of the production. Instead I want to single out three topical threads that drive much of the drama and remain relevant in our own day.One thread is the shaping of public consciousness by mainstream media. The conflict here is between a breaking crisis at a nuclear power plant and how that gets reported if at all. Understandably Godell Lemmon and allies feel that ordinary cautions about lawsuits and bureaucratic procedures must be overridden in order to prevent the plant from starting up again and risking apocalypse. On other hand Well's Fonda TV station must concern itself with risking major liability if Godell turns out to be a crank which the power company is insisting upon. So where does the station's responsibility lie. In the movie there's little time to sort out these concerns so the station's honchos must make snap decisions.Another thread is the conflict between personal conscience and practical concerns. Godell is a central figure here along with reporter Wells. Godell loves the plant and the services it provides. On other hand he must wrestle with growing realization that the plant's safety features are fatally flawed. Thus he moves through stages of personal involvement until finally engaging wholeheartedly in exposing the dangers to a TV audience. Similarly Wells moves through stages from cushy denial to putting her job and life on the line in support of Godell going on TV. But can Godell be so certain of his conclusion. There's no time to verify since the power company insists on starting up again.And lastly is the question of power itself both literally and figuratively. Power considered literally amounts to electricity to run our many modern conveniences the movie's microwave oven generated here by the nuclear power plant. Shutting it down would also mean shutting down an entire community including the TV station. Figuratively the leverage amounts to who ultimately wields power within the society itself. We see elements of this crucial question revealed by the basic conflict over whether the plant is shut down or not. To me the contest here is between an element of the 70's counterculture the bearded Richard Douglas along with inbetweeners like Wells and Spindler Brimley and the suits concerned foremost with company investments especially the planned new plant up the coast. Note how the imperious boardchairman Herd peers down from above into the control room where the action is. Note too how he commands an armed security attack force a lethal arm of corporate power where the power really is. Thus I can't help but see elements of 60's counterculture helping to shape this 1978 production. However these echoes shouldn't be allowed to consign the perennial threads to a bygone time. Fashions may have changed along with a new digital age that's loosened MSM's grip on public information. Still these underlying threads so powerfully dramatized in the film remain among the underlying conflicts of our own age. For example apocalyptic climate change is controversial emerging as both an individual and collective issue. All in all the movie amounts to a harrowing interweaving of such basic themes thanks to a stellar cast screenplay and production crew. So don't miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "James Bridges' The China Syndrome is a first rate thriller a model for those who want to make a genuinely terrifying thriller but don't know how.Most thrillers end with the standard shootemup and chase that ends with the villain getting what heshe deserves. But Bridges understands that such a standard finale isn't the case in some scenarios. The China Syndrome is thrilling in a way no one would expect. It has the type of ending that's so unexpected but yet so logical.The film stars three then current Oscar winners Jack Lemmon Best Actor 1973 for Save the Tiger Jane Fonda Best Actress 1971 and 1978 for Klute and Coming Home respectively and Michael Douglas Best Picture 1975 for producing One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. This isn't your standard spot the star flick that became so popular in the 70s. The acting is so solid and strong that we forget who's playing the roles and believe that the characters are real people. That's a testament to the collective ablities of all three actors. They may be stars but they're actors first.There is no music score in the film. Asides from a few background songs from jukeboxes or TV shows there is nothing. Bridges doesn't allow any directorial style to come through on screen. He is simply presenting the material straightforward. With a strong dramatic story like this we don't need a score to distract us. It kind of strikes me as a predecessor to the Dogma 95 filmseries started by Lars Von Trier in 1997. It focuses on the characters and story rather than style.The story is about a nuclear power plant located in Southern California. SPOILER An accident appears to have happened and basically the film is about LemmonFonda and Douglas try to expose the truth. In a way this is not a spoiler since the trailer TV spots video boxes and reviews all give this away. But from this seemingly simple premise a surprisingly complex morality play springs and the suspense comes from human nature and the actions of people rather than a villain framing another guy although this is an element in the film. That's what makes The China Syndrome so good. out of 4 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "It was harrowingly close but The China Syndrome received the worst kind of publicity when as it was going into theatrical release the accident at Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant happened. I still remember the whole country's attention was glued onto hourly bulletins coming out of Harrisburg Pennsylvania. And wouldn't you know it a scientist in The China Syndrome describes the worst case scenario as rendering an area as large as the state of Pennsylvania uninhabitable.Less than a decade later in the Ukraine at Chernobyl the Soviet Union in its last days dealt with such a crisis that didn't get righted in the nick of time. The China Syndrome once again became a relevant movie.The film is more about cutting corners for safety than it is about being antinuclear. Jack Lemmon is a man who lived with nuclear power all his life as the captain of an atomic power submarine. What angers him and sets him off to create the confrontation that climaxes the film is the stupidity and greed of the power company managers. Stupidity and greed though are commodities found every day. The problem with them is that there are places where it can be tolerated less in human society.Lemmon shares star billing with a couple of famous Hollywood offspring Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. Jane is a TV News reporter who is constantly being assigned to puff feature stories and just happens to be at a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs. The coverup by her own station and her later meeting with Lemmon set off the chain of events depicted in The China Syndrome.Fonda's best scene I thought however was with Peter Donat a news executive with her station. Take a look at her facial expressions as Donat fluffs off the importance of the story and patronizingly tells her that her very beauty demands she stick to puff pieces. Fonda knows she's got something and sticks with it.Michael Douglas plays her iconoclastic cameraman this was a typical part for him back in the day. In his TCM tribute to his father Kirk Douglas Michael said he opted for roles showing sensitivity. Still I could have seen a young Kirk Douglas in this part.What to do about energy for industrial and post industrial nations a vexing problem that will bedevil our government for a couple of generations to come. This film shows what can happen with a dependence on nuclear power. Our current problems geopolitically in the world stem in part from a dependence on fossil fuel specifically oil. Everything we use brings consequence some unforeseen. The real hero of the film in my opinion is Wilford Brimley Lemmon's colleague at the nuclear power plant. In the end Brimley really steps up to the plate.See The China Syndrome to know what I'm talking about.".

One of the central characters Michael Douglas IS a crank who drives me up the wall by mispronouncing nuclear' why DO people do that? and it's annoying that he should coincidentally turn out to be right but the heroes are the saner people Jane Fonda and in particular Jack Lemmon.Mind you I don't want to make great claims about this film.  Qua film it's no more than ordinary.  It dates itself partly because the Three Mile Island accident was worse than anything it depicts and Chernobyl was MUCH worse  although being overtaken by reality isn't the movie's fault  and partly because the ending is so carefully tailored to address the America of 1979.

Of course everyone will know about the coincidence of the Three Mile Island incident which occurred within days of the film's original release which gave it instant topicality and of course gave it a commercial boost but subsequent nuclearrelated disasters at Chernobyl and Fukishama mean that the movie's relevance doesn't diminish as time goes by.All of that would be of no matter unless it wasn't a cracking good film which it certainly is. It's superbly cast for one thing not only with a dreamteam of Lemmon Fonda and Douglas in the main roles all garnered deserved Oscar nominations for their work but it's also well cast in the supporting roles too. The plot is convincingly believable at almost every stage with only the somewhat contrived melodramatic climax slightly at odds with what had gone before. The film makes telling points about corporate greed over safety considerations still relevant in every walk of business today but also confronts the limits of free speech and obviously the debate on the use of nuclear power as an energy source in today's society but at a more basic level it's just a topclass thriller which ratchets up the tension throughout. The acting just couldn't be better Fonda is convincing as the lightweight feelgood spot TV reporter who scents a real story for the first time Douglas as the rulebending maverick cameraman desperate to get the story out there and Lemmon in one of his last great roles as the company man whose loyalty is tested by his own conscience when he becomes aware of the coverups at the plant.Sure the fashions and depicted technology to name but two elements are dated as only a film set in the 70's can be but the message of the movie combined with its entertainment value easily transcends these to deliver a taut exciting and thoughtprovoking film which was one of the best of in my opinion a great decade for Hollywood moviemaking.".

	schema:headline " Media and nuclear energy two powers both necessary ... both dangerous ...";
	schema:reviewBody "The 'China' Syndrome refers to a worst case scenario resulting from the meltdown of a nuclear power plant when the components melt through underlying earth until the other side of the earth hence China. In practice the contact with groundwater would provoke enough radiation steam to render a whole state totally uninhabitable. If the 'China' syndrome is not to be taken literally the nuclear danger surely is.And the subject is even more relevant today after the infamous Three Miles Island accident which by an irony of fate happened a few days after the film's release after Chernobyl and more lately Fukushima any normal person of the 21st century would regard nuclear energy with a certain distance. The China Syndrome exploits legitimate fears less to stand as a pamphlet against nuclear energy but to awaken people about an industry that still relies on human factor and business lobbying no matter how advanced sophisticated and safe the technology is supposed to be. Our environmental conscience and selfpreservation instinct are inevitably challenged during The China Syndrome one of the most suspenseful and harrowing thrillers of the 70's.And 'thriller' in an understatement what the film portrays is the clash between two worlds and not the least powerful. The nuclear industry is forwardlooking it's still considered as one of the most profitable and powerful sources of energy which implies lots of bucks for industrialists the country and building companies. For The Simpsons fan the plant owners' cynicism would immediately remind of the evil Mr. Burns' contempt for safety this time without the laughs. The second power is media TV at the peak of its capacity to touch people news reports journalists hegemony of TV has pinnacled in the late 70's and early 80's and beyond their neutrality and vocation they too are governed by lobbies money and 'priorities'.What makes The China Syndrome so gripping is that the clash between these two powers is portrayed from the perspective of people who believe in their jobs. Jack Lemmon is the namesake Godell the chief engineer in charge of the control room. The nuclear is all his life and when the first incident occurs he's as distraught as we are. And Jane Fonda is Kimberley Wells the news reporter who cover 'special' news and Richard is her rebel cameraman played by a bearded and young Michael Douglas. After filming the incident it's Richard first who flairs something fishy but his attempts to convince Kimberley are first undermined by her boss' pressure not to show the news. Similarly Godell and his coworkers are cleared and the Public Relations manager minimize the incident. The case is closed.But Richard keeps the footage and shows it to two nuclear experts in Kimberley's presence. They reveal that the incident was very serious and California came close to what they call the 'China Syndrome' the revelation in itself is absolutely chilling. At the same time Lemmon pursues his personal investigation and finds out that the Xrays pictures of the welds indicating the good functioning of the plant were falsified and deliberately signed by the employee of the building company. Godell reassembles the pieces of the puzzle and leaves the site under thinly disguised threats accepting to cooperate with the press making him an outcast in his own company everyone turning his back on him notably his coworker and friend Ted played by Wilford Brimley. The movie then turns into one of these gripping paranoid thrillers one of the 70's best trademarks.To maintain a realistic documentarylike format the film uses a lot of technical material whether it's nuclear or journalistic jargon and makes it accessible to us viewers. It's thrilling because it feels real. The other strength is undoubtedly the acting the trio that fills the film's poster is made of real persons not characters. Fonda is a journalist who starts compromising herself to satisfy her personal ambitions until Richard and Godell open her eyes on the true meaning of her profession. Lemmon delivers one of his greatest performances as a brave worker realizing that the most meaningful thing in his life is undermined by corrupted minds. When he tries to stop ongoing scheme it's not just for people but because he cares too much for his job not to unveil the truth. And in an admirable coincidence that confirms the intelligence of the script the same goes for Kimberley.There are indeed two kinds of professionals in The China Syndrome those who care so much they hide everything and those who tell people what they must know because they respect their jobs. The China Syndrome is a harrowing quest for truth as the duty of both the nuclear industry and the media even more vital because it directly touches the public's safety. Indeed when the shutdowns start when mugs of coffee vibrate when lights are turned off and a pump starts shaking we're all on the edge of our seat our hearts pounding to at the ongoing battle between the media and the plant and their climactic race against the clock.And while a conventional ending could have damaged the whole experience the conclusion was perfect because it didn't deprive the film from the cynicism it was trying to denounce but didn't make Godell and Kimberley's battle a vain effort. Journalism can bring awareness when it's accomplished in a professional and respectable way. However it's worth wondering within the continuous flows of images poured out by TV when a nuclear flash report is followed by an advertising clip whether people would still be aware of all the dangers that surround them.TV is a medium of many effects that can unfortunately cancel each other. And I guess one of the reasons The China Syndrome stood the test of time is to show how prophetic the film was in its realistic and honest portrayal of two powers that prove both their necessity  and dangerousness.".

If the 'China' syndrome is not to be taken literally the nuclear danger surely is.And the subject is even more relevant today after the infamous Three Miles Island accident which by an irony of fate happened a few days after the film's release after Chernobyl and more lately Fukushima any normal person of the 21st century would regard nuclear energy with a certain distance. The China Syndrome exploits legitimate fears less to stand as a pamphlet against nuclear energy but to awaken people about an industry that still relies on human factor and business lobbying no matter how advanced sophisticated and safe the technology is supposed to be. Our environmental conscience and selfpreservation instinct are inevitably challenged during The China Syndrome one of the most suspenseful and harrowing thrillers of the 70's.And 'thriller' in an understatement what the film portrays is the clash between two worlds and not the least powerful. The nuclear industry is forwardlooking it's still considered as one of the most profitable and powerful sources of energy which implies lots of bucks for industrialists the country and building companies. For The Simpsons fan the plant owners' cynicism would immediately remind of the evil Mr. Burns' contempt for safety this time without the laughs. The second power is media TV at the peak of its capacity to touch people news reports journalists hegemony of TV has pinnacled in the late 70's and early 80's and beyond their neutrality and vocation they too are governed by lobbies money and 'priorities'.What makes The China Syndrome so gripping is that the clash between these two powers is portrayed from the perspective of people who believe in their jobs. Jack Lemmon is the namesake Godell the chief engineer in charge of the control room. The nuclear is all his life and when the first incident occurs he's as distraught as we are. And Jane Fonda is Kimberley Wells the news reporter who cover 'special' news and Richard is her rebel cameraman played by a bearded and young Michael Douglas. After filming the incident it's Richard first who flairs something fishy but his attempts to convince Kimberley are first undermined by her boss' pressure not to show the news. Similarly Godell and his coworkers are cleared and the Public Relations manager minimize the incident. The case is closed.But Richard keeps the footage and shows it to two nuclear experts in Kimberley's presence. They reveal that the incident was very serious and California came close to what they call the 'China Syndrome' the revelation in itself is absolutely chilling. At the same time Lemmon pursues his personal investigation and finds out that the Xrays pictures of the welds indicating the good functioning of the plant were falsified and deliberately signed by the employee of the building company. Godell reassembles the pieces of the puzzle and leaves the site under thinly disguised threats accepting to cooperate with the press making him an outcast in his own company everyone turning his back on him notably his coworker and friend Ted played by Wilford Brimley. The movie then turns into one of these gripping paranoid thrillers one of the 70's best trademarks.To maintain a realistic documentarylike format the film uses a lot of technical material whether it's nuclear or journalistic jargon and makes it accessible to us viewers. It's thrilling because it feels real. The other strength is undoubtedly the acting the trio that fills the film's poster is made of real persons not characters. Fonda is a journalist who starts compromising herself to satisfy her personal ambitions until Richard and Godell open her eyes on the true meaning of her profession. Lemmon delivers one of his greatest performances as a brave worker realizing that the most meaningful thing in his life is undermined by corrupted minds. When he tries to stop ongoing scheme it's not just for people but because he cares too much for his job not to unveil the truth. And in an admirable coincidence that confirms the intelligence of the script the same goes for Kimberley.There are indeed two kinds of professionals in The China Syndrome those who care so much they hide everything and those who tell people what they must know because they respect their jobs. The China Syndrome is a harrowing quest for truth as the duty of both the nuclear industry and the media even more vital because it directly touches the public's safety. Indeed when the shutdowns start when mugs of coffee vibrate when lights are turned off and a pump starts shaking we're all on the edge of our seat our hearts pounding to at the ongoing battle between the media and the plant and their climactic race against the clock.And while a conventional ending could have damaged the whole experience the conclusion was perfect because it didn't deprive the film from the cynicism it was trying to denounce but didn't make Godell and Kimberley's battle a vain effort. Journalism can bring awareness when it's accomplished in a professional and respectable way. However it's worth wondering within the continuous flows of images poured out by TV when a nuclear flash report is followed by an advertising clip whether people would still be aware of all the dangers that surround them.TV is a medium of many effects that can unfortunately cancel each other. And I guess one of the reasons The China Syndrome stood the test of time is to show how prophetic the film was in its realistic and honest portrayal of two powers that prove both their necessity  and dangerousness.";

	schema:reviewBody "Wow talk about a slow burn. The China Syndrome takes a little while to get moving but once it does it takes off like a bullet and doesn't let up until it's devastating finale. I was in a state of awe for the last fifteen minutes at least as this tale of a reporter trying to expose the unsafe conditions at a nuclear power plant comes to it's close. Jane Fonda plays Kimberly Wells a TV journalist who has been stuck doing fluff pieces and never getting the hard journalism that she desperately craves. When the opportunity to go into a nuclear facility comes to her she jumps right on it and together with Michael Douglas' cameraman Richard Adams begins to uncover a dangerous operation that could have potentially national consequences. The film splits it's time between the investigative efforts of Wells and Adams and the internal struggle of Jack Godell portrayed by the always magnificent Jack Lemmon.Lemmon turns in yet another phenomenal performance here as Godell a head worker at the nuclear plant who finds deep conflict within himself when he begins to understand the gravity of his superiors' negligence. Godell is a man who loves his job and has always defended it against crusaders like Wells and Adams but when he tries to lodge a complaint and gets rejected he finds himself a man without a country stuck on the line of what he believes in and knows is right. It's a compelling character and Lemmon plays the internal conflict as only he could exposing an anguish that is heartbreaking sincere and entirely sympathetic. I found myself feeling so deeply for this man and as everyone begins to fight against him I wanted so desperately for him to come out the victor. Fonda is appropriately fierce and combative and it's a lot of fun watching Douglas in such a charismatic explosive role but the film belongs to Lemmon in every way.As I said earlier it takes a little while to really get going but once Godell's conflict forces him to make a move everything picks up and the intensity gets higher and higher until the end. The final act features some practically heart stopping suspense with life and death circumstances that will change the fate of everyone. It's a topical thriller but an intimate one as well. I miss the days where big stars like Fonda and Lemmon would lead these kind of serious thrillers because their immense talent makes everything so much stronger. It's a great script and the direction from James Bridges is solid if not overly impressive but the real treat of The China Syndrome is watching these superb actors do what they do best.".

	schema:headline " The critics must be crazy";
	schema:reviewBody "I've probably seen this film five or six times over the years from its initial U.S. arthouse run in the late 1980s I can still vividly remember my experience seeing it in the Coconut Grove theater near where I was going to university to last night. It's been one of my most consistent 10s. Although my ratings tend to fluctuate on multiple viewings for many films I don't believe that I've ever thought The Gods Must be Crazy was lower than a 10.The film works so well because of its odd confluence of styles which gradually merge. You could almost say the structure is Hegelian with a thesis two antitheses and something of a synthesis at the end. The common thread throughout is a very tongueincheek critique in the mode of a parable of both culturesocietycivilization and views about culturesocietycivilization including politics religion mores and so on.The film begins with the story of Xixo or just Xi N!xau in one of the many spellings of this actor's name and his fellow bushmen who live in the Kalahari Desert. A narrator Paddy O'Byrne tells us about their lifestyle. Before long this is contrasted with footage of life in the big city in Johannesburg. The narration continues with the same tone as if we're unfamiliar with modern western culture. We meet Kate Thompson Sandra Prinsloo who is getting fed up with her whitecollar existence. We move back to the bushmen. A man in a passing small aircraft nonchalantly tosses a Coke bottle out the window. It lands close to Xi who has never seen anything like it before. Eventually it causes all kinds of problems and Xi tries to get rid of it. We are also introduced to a thread about Sam Boga Louw Verwey who is leading rebels in Burundi. We see them try to assassinate the President. After this they're pursued by the Burundian military. Meanwhile Kate has decided to go to Botswana to be a teacher and there she meets Andrew Styne Marius Weyers. Eventually all of these threads come together.The plot may sound like a mess and it probably would be under lesser hands but producerwritereditordirector Jamie Uys keeps the disparate threads remarkably focused and coherent. His timing for each and for the transitions between threads is impeccable and the way they move together is nothing short of ingenious.There has been no shortage of ink spilled in oftennegative criticism of The Gods Must be Crazy. Unfortunately a lot of the criticism is ridiculous and profoundly misconceived. Many see the film as racist. A lot of people who can't comprehend the factfiction distinction have criticized the film for inaccurate portrayals of bushmen and other characters. Uys' humor and social critiques are frequently misunderstood.It's significant that O'Byrne's narrative tone is very similar to Peter Jones' narrative tone for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Whether this was a direct influence on Uys is not as important as the contextual clues it provides the Hitchhiker's Guide miniseries featuring Jones was not completed until 1981 but the BBC radio show which was the original format for Hitchhiker's Guide and which also featured Jones' narration aired in 1978. The narration is extremely tongueincheek and sarcastic. Uys is spoofing bushmen civilization and also some of the misconceptions about bushmen. The narration is also meant as a kind of distancing technique. Modern western civilization is explained to us as if we're aliens learning about this world.This is all in service of a much more serious different kind of point. The bushmen are shown as they are to enable a Lord of the Flies 1963  1990 based on William Golding's 1954 booklike examination of civilization. The bushmen are the schoolboys of Lord of the Flies in their initial shipwrecked state. The Coke bottle symbolizes the entrance of civilization in that virgin culture and we see the havoc the new concepts cause. The Johannesburg and Burundi material both exist in the film to give us a flash forward to what that introduction of civilization can lead to. In the case of Burundi it's a direct extension of the fighting over possessions including land. In the case of Johannesburg it's a spiraling web of miserableness. It's not a coincidence that the bushmen learn both violence and unhappiness when civilization appears and it's not an accident that we initially examine these things from an alien perspective. Uys wants us to look at where we stand as a civilization and reassess itan especially poignant message coming from a South African in the late 1970searly 1980s. Don't forget that Xi is a hero herehe's the most authentic character in the film and he's the one who enables the resolution of the dilemma in the climax.The material in Botswana especially as the threads merge suggests a kind of solution a kind of balance although it's significant that the solution is far from perfect and to an extent parties go their separate ways again. Uys seems to be saying that even if there is a solution to civilization's woes it's going to be complex and probably less than perfect.Easing up on the analysis for a minute all you may need to know is that The Gods Must be Crazy is a very funny but poignant film. The humor ranges from subtle and intellectual to crazy slapstick especially whenever Weyers is aroundhe's very gifted at slapstick. Uys delivers beautifully filmed exotic locations a maybe surprising amount of violence in the Sam Boga segments although somewhat cartoonish and funny violencethese segments often resemble Woody Allen's 1971 film Bananas a lot of adventure a fair amount of suspense and even a charming romance.Do not let the ridiculous negative ideological criticism dissuade you. This is a classica masterpiecethat presents both surface entertainment and complex deep themes and subtexts. If you haven't seen it yet you must.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not a great movie but it uses the differences between the civilized white man against the uncivilized Bushman and with that simple tool it becomes hilarious. Civilized in the white man's eyes I must add to that. This is one of those movies where every gag works no matter how simple and silly it is. Most of the time the movie is slapstick comedy the way we see it in Chaplin or Laurel  Hardyshorts. We even have the fast forward sequence where people are running away from something.The movie opens with a look on the Bushmen and a narrator Paddy O'Byrne tells us what kind of people they are friendly and without any knowledge about the world not that far from their Kalahari desert. When they see a plane they think it is a strange bird or even a god. One day a pilot throws a glass bottle out of his airplane and the thing is found by the Bushmen. They have never seen anything that is a smooth and hard as this object and they find it very useful. They think it is a gift from the gods. The problem is that the gods have given only one object and for the first time they have to share something that is very hard to share. For the first time they feel emotions such as anger and jealousy. It is decided that the thing is an Evil Thing and must be thrown of the earth and Xixo N!xau a real Bushman is the one to do that. These early scenes give a very funny view on how the civilized white man has become what he is today.In the meanwhile we have met Andrew Steyn Marius Weyers who does field research not far from the Bushman and Kate Thompson Sandra Prinsloo who was tired of her job and now wants to do something with children in Botswana. Steyn must pick up Kate and bring her to the village and this is where the slapstick begins. Steyn is a man who gets very nervous when is around women and with Kate he must be the most clumsy guy there is. We have also met Sam Boga Louw Verwey who wants to do a coup but fails and he is now running for the police. We know how all these stories will come together but that is not  a bad thing. It only uses the story to show us differences between people to show that the white man is not necessarily the civilized man and it does this with great comedy. The Gods Must Be Crazy' with its simple humor works a lot better then most of the modern comedies. The way the Bushmen talk is funny enough to like this movie. Fortunately there is so much more including a little message.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crazy goofy and silly are the three most operative words to describe The Gods Must Be Crazy. But the movie is also very original. It's appropriate that the word crazy is in the title because this is the craziest movie I've ever seen. The Gods Must Be Crazy is a South African made comedy that was made back in the early 1980s but didn't get released until 34 years after shooting was completed. It became a surprise hit in the U.S. after it was released in 1984 and it did very well in other countries too. The Gods Must Be Crazy features three separate stories that get tied together towards the end. One story is about a bushman who goes on a journey to return a Coke bottle that he found to the Gods after the bottle starts causing harm to some of his family members. Another story revolves around a war that breaks out in Central Africa. And the other story centers around a clumsy scientist who tries to take a pretty South African woman to her new job as a schoolteacher in a small African village and does everything wrong. This is my favorite part of the movie. The scientist is played by Marius Weyers and he gives an inspired slapstick comedy performance. Some of the things that he does in the film had me exploding in laughter. The scenes with the jeep that he drives are priceless. Sandra Prinsloo is a good foil as the schoolteacher who unfortuneitly has no choice but to put up with his clumsiness. When Weyers and Prinsloo are on screen The Gods Must Be Crazy is at its funniest. The other two stories are good but not great. Nevertheless there are some unusual scenes in these parts of the movie too. But the scenes involving the scientist and the schoolteacher are the best parts of The Gods Must Be Crazy. It's too bad that they didn't turn up in the dull sequel. I think these parts of the movie alone is enough for me to recommend The Gods Must Be Crazy.  out of four".

Although filled with actors no one has ever heard of and being low budgeted it's still one of the best films I've ever seen.The movie starts out in the bush of the Kalahari a documentary on the bushmen of the desert.  Suddenly the main character Xixo is nearly hit by a gift from the gods a Coke bottle thrown from a passing airplane.  He brings it back to the community where they use it for many things.  But soon jealousy comes over members of the tribe and they fight and bicker for this special tool.  Xi soon disposes of it only to have a hyena find it again.  Children find it and fight over it again and Xi soon decides to throw the Evil Thing off the edge of the world.Meanwhile a slapstick biologist is trying to take a future teacher to her destination.  He gets weak in the knees many a time and screws up grandly. And at the same time the terrorist Sam Boja attempts to assassinate the President and runs out of options in the thick brush.  And Xixo still treks for the ends of the earth.Our lives are revealed in this wonderful foreign film.  The gods aren't crazy for letting this movie be finished.".

Along the way there is some slapstick reminiscent to me of some of the Laurel  Hardy sight gags maybe with a touch of the 3 Stooges?.Of most interest to me is the view it gives us of the Bushmen they're also known as the Dobe San the Dobe !Kung andor the !Kung. This is a romantic idealized somewhat fairy tale view of these great people more true probably in the first 23rds of the 20th century than later. No !Kung now live without contact with the outside world and few or none now live as was depicted. But although it's a caricature nevertheless it's still a useful somewhat truthful one which captures much of this people's former beauty and essence.The ! in the name !Kung comes because these people speak in a click dialect and the movie gives us many samples of its unusual sounds.The !Kung are a people who were driven into the Kalahari about 500 years ago by the encroachment of other tribes. Much like Pygmies the !Kung are short in stature but not quite as much and rather than black they're usually considered Negrito and somewhat yellowish skinned if I remember correctly.I'd seen this film years ago and enjoyed it particularly for its view of the !Kung. I recently rented it to loan to a couple of university students going to South Africa on a concert tour since they may get a glimpse of the Kalahari.Very enjoyable.".

There really is no story to tell as such an African pagan bushman unknown to glass finds a CocaCola bottle and tries to deal with it within the limits of his environment and his known world. I think it does very well in making us realise the effect the developed world and its 'civilisation' has on the 'third' world esp. if we are not really aware of the differences between 'our' world and 'their' world. It is not a film about violence segregation or prejudice but a film that will make you understand why shipping fridgestrucks to any country without proper supply channels for electricityfuel is pointless. If the socalled third world is now living in 'our' middle ages Dark Ages for some then we need to start to bring them up one century further not 5 centuries.

But this doesn't effect the enjoyment I receive every time I put this DVD on and watch it again. In fact the story grows more intriguing with every viewing. If you are a Chuck Norris fan this is an especially fantastic find since he is at rare form from start to finish. The plot has Norris race around the western US trying to stop an assassin gunning for members of his former CIA Vietnam unit. This may be one of the first films to feature truly extreme stunts including snowmobiling jumping thru a windshield of a moving car along with other motorcycle race car and skiing related action. Luckily now you can find the DVD in discount stores easily and I believe it's worth picking up.".

Here you have Chuck Norris a real karate champion plays John Booker a war vet who is trying to find out why his comrades are being bumped off. Whoever's doing it is in big trouble. You don't mess with BOOKER! NO NOT EVER!! Many made a big mistake and it cost their own lives in the process. First one person gets shot during skiing and Booker did the flying side kick to the Booker's assailant's wife. The major assailant put a bomb on the plane that killed his girlfriend after takeoff. And he used that ski pole to attack Booker which was no use to stop him. Then my favorite scene of all is where the same guy whose wife was taken out gets into the Toyota Celica and tried to run over Booker. In which he returns delivers the awesome flying dropkick to the windshield killing him. I later found out that the stunt was done by his brother Aaron. Doesn't really matter I enjoyed it all the away. Chuck Norris is the reason I got into the martial arts and I would like to thank him all the way. He is my idol! 3.5 out of 5 stars.".

First one person gets shot during skiing and Booker did the flying side kick to the Booker's assailant's wife. The major assailant put a bomb on the plane that killed his girlfriend after takeoff. And he used that ski pole to attack Booker which was no use to stop him. Then my favorite scene of all is where the same guy whose wife was taken out gets into the Toyota Celica and tried to run over Booker. In which he returns delivers the awesome flying dropkick to the windshield killing him. I later found out that the stunt was done by his brother Aaron. Doesn't really matter I enjoyed it all the away. Chuck Norris is the reason I got into the martial arts and I would like to thank him all the way. He is my idol! 3.5 out of 5 stars.";

It is Chuck Norris!Good Guys Wear Black opens in Paris France in 1973 where U.S. Senator Conrad Morgan is negotiating terms on a deal with a delegate from North Vietnam to release American P.O.W.'s still imprisoned in Vietnam. Major John T. Booker and his elite army unit the Black Tigers are chosen to be the sacrificial lambs so to speak. The 12 men are sent into the jungle under orders that they are to free American prisoners held in a camp but when things go horribly wrong Booker starts to suspect that they have been set up.The plot in Good Guys Wear Black is quite good and I won't go further into it here. You'll have to watch the movie to find out more! It's a well written one directed by Ted Post who's also done Hang 'Em High and Magnum Force. The cast is actually not that bad. Anne Archer James Franciscus are all good actors and Chuck Norris is Chuck Norris so it all evens out in the end. No all kidding aside even Mr Norris is good here..If there's one gripe I have with this movie it's the fact that as far as it being an action flick it's a bit talky you know? I would have liked a little more actionI really wanted to like the movie more and all it had to do was have Chuck fight more people and have more scenes like the action set piece in the middle. That's ALL it had to do to win us over but it's just a little too much talkingSo if you have the patience and you like 70's type action movies then you should like this.Overall worth watching.. 7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "It might not have been Norris' breakout film but he was on its way and a good stepping stone for things to come. Well he had appeared in a few films before hand but not so much as a leading role and this was an attempt to create a new Bruce Lee for the American market. It's quite a routine vehicle for Norris which while captivating it never truly capitalizes on the martial art skills that he bestows. Sure he gets time to hand out a beating or two but in the end there's just not enough to go around. Most of the time Norris as excommando John T. Booker is racing around the clock trying to figure out a political conspiracy involving the extermination of his specialop team the Black Tigers and then maybe  that's when angry or tested he decides to beat the pulp out of someone. Sadly when that happens the sock 'em activity doesn't last all that long by building up a punishing rhythm to only be over in a matter of seconds. Might be impressive to watch when in action although the camera at times gets a little too close not allowing the space but you feel shortchanged hoping for more or at least some competition. The material could've seen any actor take the lead role as it seems to ask more from as an establish actor but then we probably wouldn't have seen the trademark stunt of Norris' stirring jumpkick through car windshield. This one sequence alone along with a three on one car park showdown shows what he could bring to the table.So far I guess it sounds like I didn't get much from it but that's not particularly true. What surprised more than anything was that his earlier features had somewhat heavily written plots despite the forced dialogues. Good Guys Wear Black had quite a pessimistically knotty narrative where it builds upon the mystery and strangely it's devious plotting of political corruption and lingering suspicion of things are not quite what they seem was compellingly fleshed out. Also the ending has nice touch of irony to it. Norris continuing to hand out justice Norris justice.Ted Post who helm Eastwood in Hang 'Em High and Magnum Force has a competent steadiness to his serviceable direction but does lack the flair and excitement in the favour of grinding out the tough dramatics and lean action caught behind raw but scenic locations. This is obvious and it does seem to hold Norris back. He tries his best but while his delivery might not always be the greatest acting that is he does have likability and certain charisma not just the goldenblonde hair and moustache that eventually shines through. The rest of performances do fair up a lot better. Anne Archer is bitingly good across Norris and James Franciscus likewise with his smarmy portrayal. Lloyd Haynes and Dana Andrews chime in with solid offerings. Jim Backus has a neat cameo too. Craig Safan's distinguishable jazz score crackles along.Simply middle ground as Norris would go onto better things.".

But a few years after the war ended people in his group are starting to get killed in strange and exotic ways.It all has to do with the ambitions of career diplomat James Franciscus who is playing a role far from idealistic teacher Mr. Novak. Franciscus certainly would have had the proper attitudes to go far in the Nixon administration. He's got a loyal career subordinate in Dana Andrews who is getting good and stewed as his way of coping. Andrews who had a career tainted by alcoholism certainly had this late career role down pat.Chuck Norris with a bit of help from Lloyd Haynes of the CIA and reporter Anne Archer who on the Washington cocktail circuit gets the story of a lifetime give him some help. That and his own martial arts skills dispatch a number of bad guys.Norris fans will approve.".

But a few years after the war ended people in his group are starting to get killed in strange and exotic ways.It all has to do with the ambitions of career diplomat James Franciscus who is playing a role far from idealistic teacher Mr. Novak. Franciscus certainly would have had the proper attitudes to go far in the Nixon administration. He's got a loyal career subordinate in Dana Andrews who is getting good and stewed as his way of coping. Andrews who had a career tainted by alcoholism certainly had this late career role down pat.Chuck Norris with a bit of help from Lloyd Haynes of the CIA and reporter Anne Archer who on the Washington cocktail circuit gets the story of a lifetime give him some help. That and his own martial arts skills dispatch a number of bad guys.Norris fans will approve.";

	schema:reviewBody "This serviceable action flick from karate man Norris has a better plot than usual for his films once which draws in politics and hidden agendas and a government conspiracy going right to the top. This makes a refreshing change from the typical gang of bad guys out hunting the heroes in these kind of films but sadly there is also a drawback with this movie it's one of the most actionfree action movies out there. There are only three or four major action scenes in this movie ones which are quite well done it has to be said but the majority of the film consists of talking or people going from location to location in search of the truth.The slightlyaboveaverage running time for a Norris flick also drags this film down too although it just avoids becoming too boring thanks to a number of supporting characters and a range of locations from a car racing track to snowy ski slopes. The cast is also pretty good too. Norris here is very younglooking and has odd blond hair however he is as wooden as ever and has no cause to do any kind of acting aside from the straightlaced hard man routine of most of his films. Archer makes for a forthright love interest while Lloyd Haynes seems to be left over from the blaxploitation days and his role is a good supporting one. The chief villain is a miscast James Franciscus who fails to be threatening or scary. Also a surprise is the appearance of an aged Dana Andrews in a minor supporting role and he puts in another fun turn.The action scenes when they do come are stylish yet brief. A highlight sees Norris kicking a baddie off his motorbike as he drives past a trick which John Woo would later steal for the Van Damme epic HARD TARGET. There are a couple of shootouts and some fun martial arts fights but one scene in particular stays in the mind long after the credits have run. This jawdropping moment sees Norris leap feetfirst into the windscreen of an oncoming car thus crushing the driver inside and saving himself. It may be farfetched but it makes for great cinema. While not a great film at all GOOD GUYS WEAR BLACK is entertainment that passes the time and is pretty good for a Norris flick.".

Will good guys wear black or will good guys be DEAD? Find out today Good Guys Wear Black is a pretty early Chuck movie and has an oldfashioned staid vibe to it more suited to the TV movies of the day. We found it boring talky and it looks its age and not in a good way. There isn't even any Martial Arts until an HOUR into the movie. All that being said there is a standout action setpiece around that point.Chuck is a guy you can't help but like and despite the annoyingly minimal character development what else is new in the world of Chuck his mustache is looking especially walrusy this time around. Plus the opening credits sequence sets things up to be a lot cooler than what follows with snazzy 70'sera computer graphics and nice music. But then it goes into a 'Nam sequence the viewer has trouble seeing and interest starts to slip. From there it goes to some government yaketyyak and interest slips even more. If not for Chuck's superstache this first half would have been a total waste.Interestingly though Seagal ripped off Chuck once again  Chuck was first when playing the silentbutintellectual professor decades before Professor Robert Burns. Another thing going against the movie is the unusually fuzzy presentation from Vestron. This seems to be a rare lapse for the normally fine company. The visuals are dull and washed out. Maybe other presentations on other formats are better we're not sure. If you have another version write in to let us know. But it all kind of cumulatively adds up against the viewer's enjoyment. It made us aloof to most of the proceedings and the slow overlong nature of it all certainly didn't help either.We really wanted to like the movie more and all it had to do was have Chuck fight more people and have more scenes like the big action setpiece in the middle. That's ALL it had to do to win us over. But no there was too much mush clogging things up. So it's all very middleoftheroad as way too many Chuck movies are as things didn't start to pick up for him until later in his career.".

All the characters are only so so and a lot of the actors looked bored plus even Chuck is boring to watch in this one!. It had one cool moment where Chuck Norris kicks a guy through the front window however the rest is just plain dull plus I appreciated then it went more on plot but damn it at least make it interesting!. Anne Archer is totally wasted here and had no chemistry with Norris plus James Franciscus is terrible as the main villain and looked rather bored. I am a fan of Chuck Norris but have seen quite a few terrible films from him and this is one of his absolute worst! plus the twists are predictable as well. Please leave this one where it belongs collecting dust on the shelves as even die hard Norris fans will probably be disappointed in this plus the ending was quite lame as well. This is a pretty boring Chuck Norris flick that's quite boring to watch with hardly any martial arts action and a dull story Pass on this one. The Direction is lackluster. Ted Post does a lackluster job here with OK camera work and keeping the film at a very dull pace. The Acting isn't much better. Chuck Norris is not at his best here he is just going with the motions and was pretty wooden in some scenes there were a couple scenes when he was exciting to watch and did his best with what he was given which was simply crap Norris Rules!!. Anne Archer is absolutely wasted here she looks good but her character wasn't that interesting and she had no chemistry with Norris. James Franciscus is terrible as the main villain he looked rather bored and wasn't menacing at all in fact he hardly has any screen time. Lloyd Haynes is OK here as Murray but acts with his cigar he was adequate. Rest of the cast are not that good. Overall Pass. 12 out of 5".

Deathrace 2000 is the 20th anniversary of the murderous transcontinental road race or in the words of the US president what you all want. You could lose this film in the repertoire of John Carpenter. If you're a Carpenter fan you really need to see this. Much is made of Corman's production of this film but this is really not a Corman film in any sense  except for its very obviously low budget. Paul Bartel of Eating Raoul fame deserves the directorial credit here and he really did well given the mediocrity of the material he had to work with. Ostensibly the film is about a race involving five participants  Frankenstein Carradine Machine Gun Joe Viterbo Stallone Calamity Jane Woronov Mathilda the Hunn and Nero the Hero  all of comic book stature. They are joined by navigators who double as concubines which I suppose illustrates the trust and intimacy a driver must have with any partner involved in a high speed transcontinental race where the goal is to kill as many pedestrians as possible along the way. About a quarter of the way through the film it becomes clear that the real story is about the connection between the US government religion massproduced violence and a resistance movement all focused on either promoting or ending the race once and for all. As despicable as the empowered elite may be in this film the critique of the media is even more scathing.Carradine is race hero Frankenstein. Sly Stallone plays his archrival Machine Gun Joe Viterbo and an ensemble cast of fellow racers media mavens politicos and willing and unwilling victims of the great race lend strong support. The acting is predictably campy and sometimes just a little too B grade. But the occasional pacing disaster just enhances the humorvalue of the film. Stallone is particularly amusing and gets great support from his sidekick. Carradine is typically bizarre and even parodies himself with a few poorly choreographed kung fu techniques during his absurd fight scene with Stallone. As short as he is Stallone is still a much larger and more fit man than Carradine but gets handily whooped. The cinematographer makes no effort to hide the absurdity of this scene.The script for this film is a series of welldelivered clichs strung together with cleverly choreographed racing action sequences. As such it parodies toughguy talk in films and in real life. The photography is excellent and on par with John Carpenter's straightforward visual subtlety.This film appears at first blush as a comedic celebration of violence. But it's really a very campy comment on the use of violence in sport and entertainment as a way to distract and desensitize the public from serious issues such as economic stress collectivist totalitarianism the enshrinement of mediocrity and minority privilege a euphemism for rule by an entrenched powerful elite. The film is dated and does not need to be seen ten times to get it though I just completed about my 12th viewing.The political messages are worth hearing the humor is worth paying attention to and if it's your first time you will likely find this movie quite entertaining.".

	schema:headline " A superb demonstration of why we need to keep independent cinema alive";
	schema:reviewBody "The Bfilm industry was once a thriving staple of Hollywood with directors of all walks and ideals being able to make a film as long as they could raise the cash. Roger Corman a producer and director among many other things is one embodiment of the independent spirit. Producing over three hundred films in his career his name is virtually synonymous with Blevel schlock and it is his productions that have given many of today's major stars their start. In fact you will find three very familiar faces gracing Death Race 2000. Death Race 2000 is one of his more extravagant productions but do not let that fool you. Even in 1975 the three hundred thousand dollars he spent on Death Race 2000 would have equaled lunch money on The Godfather Part II released the previous year on a comparatively lavish budget of thirteen million dollars. While I like both films equally Death Race 2000 impresses me more simply because it manages to entertain me from start to finish without spending enough money to fund an emergency ward for a month.Death Race 2000's plot is simple enough. Five drivers in customised cars drive across a repressive American dictatorship starting on the East Coast before making their way to New Los Angeles. Along the way they may run over any pedestrians for certain scores. Rather than simply being the first to cross the finish line the winner is he who can accumulate more points than the others. It is this critical difference compared to other racing films from which much of the comedy is derived. Those who have seen the film before will remember Euthanasia Day with a lot of fondness and the utter incompetence of the resistance movement is hilarious in itself. But the real comedy derives from the individual drivers and their personalities. By far the most normal driver in the competition is Calamity Jane a woman with a cowgirl fetish and metallic bullhorns on the front of her car. Coming next is Nero The Hero who will look very familiar to viewers of The Karate Kid. His whole shtick revolves around being a Roman Gladiator but the film does not really give him enough time to develop it.Things get really interesting with racer number three Matilda The Hun. Sporting Nazi symbolism and screaming Blitzkrieg whenever she scores a pedestrian she is the least subtle indication that the makers had their tongues firmly in their cheeks during the creation of the film. Next are the two big rivals in the competition. Sylvester Stallone plays Machine Gun Joe Viterbo like a cranky adolescent who has snorted too much cocaine. There is literally nothing on the road he will not kill and Stallone's trademark slurred speech suits the character to a T. But the real star of the story is Frankenstein the other previous race winner and a friend of the President. David Carradine plays Frankenstein like a Cgrade Darth Vader delivering much of the comedy. His diversion on Euthanasia Day and the moment where he kicks Stallone's butt are worth watching the film for by themselves. Learning about why he wants to win the race and what he will do in order to accomplish it are hilarious in and of themselves. You can sort of see why Carradine and Stallone went on to become headlining stars whilst Kove enjoyed a brief career as the lead villain.Death Race 2000 is as dated as hell let's not kid ourselves. The matte painting of the starting race track is more obvious than an undone bluescreen effect. The blood is so fake that it looks pink at times. The editing makes it very confusing to see how one is getting run over or who is punching whom during the aforementioned CarradineStallone altercation. On the other hand its story of a dictatorship America that uses sport as an opiate for the masses its portrayal of the media and its depiction of blind obedience are timeless. They are even more relevant thirty years on than when the film first premiered. I like to think of the incompetent resistance movement as an indictment of the fact that we would have a better government if we had a credible or even opposing opposition. Seventynine minutes is too short a time to go into these political subplots at all but that Death Race 2000 touches on them at all when far more serious and lengthy films made years later cannot even consider them is a credit to Corman and his company. Death Race 2000 is one of those films that should be preserved in a time capsule for the edification of future generations.I gave Death Race 2000 a seven out of ten. Were I making it today there are a few things I would do differently. The television segments would have been filmed using video or line removal rather than a camera at a television screen for instance. Balancing this out however is the fact that so many of the shots are so effectively composed that it is no wonder Tak Fujimoto went on to become a multiawardwinning Hollywood cinematographer. In short if you have not seen Death Race 2000 yet then grab the new Roger Corman Classics DVD. It will be the best Bfilm in fact one of the best films period you will see all year.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a dystopian future a cross country automobile race requires contestants to run down innocent pedestrians to gain points that are tallied based on each kills brutality. Starring David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone.When I was younger and my family would go for a drive my father would often make the remark that if he swerved and hit someone it would be worth twenty points. In my youth I never really understood where he picked it up from but now I think it is safe to say that Death Race 2000 was his source.While this movie is fairly cheesy it is fun in a way most other films simply are not. I would not even call it a dark comedy because the violence is not dark it is just campy. Beverly Gray calls it comically macabre.There is some strong underlying message about American values that could be interpreted differently by different people is America an inherently violent nation? Or are we a nation trying to maximize our freedoms? This dispute comes into play when rebels show up who wish to end the race and restore the old America. What is interesting is that Corman was known to be antiauthority so he should be saying that this race is barbaric. Yet he clearly understands that the viewer enjoys the death scenes... without them the film would be nothing. What does this say about us or about him?Stallone has a surprisingly small role despite being the secondary character. He does not speak much and seems to be in the movie for no other reason than to use violence against women. In the vernacular he keeps his pimp hand strong.David Carradine who never busts out many a karate move in this film is the real hero. He plays the race's most popular character Frankenstein who has allegedly been pieced back together year after year. His bondage gear outfit and smooth Carradine attitude make him a clear favorite for movie viewers as well.All in all this film is a cult classic and deserves to be. Corman wanted to compete with Rollerball 1975 for a fraction of the cost so he purchased Ib Melchoir's The Racer and went from there. I think he succeeded. I do not know how much money each film made but I know of nobody today who is out there calling Rollerball the better film.".

What is interesting is that Corman was known to be antiauthority so he should be saying that this race is barbaric. Yet he clearly understands that the viewer enjoys the death scenes... without them the film would be nothing. What does this say about us or about him?Stallone has a surprisingly small role despite being the secondary character. He does not speak much and seems to be in the movie for no other reason than to use violence against women. In the vernacular he keeps his pimp hand strong.David Carradine who never busts out many a karate move in this film is the real hero. He plays the race's most popular character Frankenstein who has allegedly been pieced back together year after year. His bondage gear outfit and smooth Carradine attitude make him a clear favorite for movie viewers as well.All in all this film is a cult classic and deserves to be. Corman wanted to compete with Rollerball 1975 for a fraction of the cost so he purchased Ib Melchoir's The Racer and went from there. I think he succeeded. I do not know how much money each film made but I know of nobody today who is out there calling Rollerball the better film.";

Honestly anyone could have invented an outrageously exaggerated premise like this but the fact that it was actually Roger Corman who dealt with it just proves how eminently he ruled the Bmovie circuit back then. Death Race 2000 is one of the most entertaining films ever made and I for one can't imagine someone not loving the severely ridicule story of a coasttocoast car race where the contesters score points by wiping pedestrians off the road. Silly yesbut even more ingenious flamboyant and offensive. Pure cult in other words and fundamental viewing for every soul who ever showed interest in extravagant filmmaking! The script is stuffed with imaginative findings euthanasia day at the hospital! and downright UNsubtle protest towards the American way of life a factor that determines Death Race 2000 as cult even more. Considering it's a Corman production the film also contains explicit violence provoking messages and a truckload of sleaze! All the elements that guarantee untamed cult success! Of course it has to be said that it could have been an even better film if Corman and director Paul Bartel focused on a more proper elaboration of the versatile idea. The rivalry between Carradine and Stallone for example should have resulted in a more intriguing sub plot and even though DR 2000 already contains much absurdity as it is the premise surely had potential enough to add even more sick jokes and cynical situations. David Carradine acts deliciously as always and Stallone is excellent as well. Death Race 2000 is cinema that separates the men from the boys people! Stop exploring the cult genre in case you didn't had the time of your life watching this film.".

	schema:headline " A Great Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I avoided DEATH RACE 2000 for a long time because I thought it would be too violent and sadistic just like the remake with Jason Statham. But I figured that since it was made in the 70s it couldn't be that bad. And it isn't. Special effects have gotten much better. The blood in the remake looks real. Anybody can tell that the blood here is fake. The violence is also quite minimal. I mean there's a scene where a guy's head gets crushed under a car tire but trust me it really isn't as gory as it sounds. The movie is only around 75 minutes long which is as long as it needed to be. There really aren't any scenes that I thought were unnecessary. I really liked the story and the political commentary. The action scenes were pretty good for a movie that cost just 300000 around 1.5 million in today's money to make. I still can't get over the fact that this spectacular and I promise I'm not using that word sarcastically movie was made for only that much money. By the way I didn't give this movie 10 stars for being good AND inexpensive just for being good. I'm just saying that the fact that it was inexpensive is amazing given how good it is.Anyway another thing that I really liked about this movie is that it is really funny. I don't want to give any specific examples since DR2K is so short and it's best if you watch it without knowing much about it but there are some scenes that might seem sadistic at first but really aren't. This isn't a movie that takes itself too seriously which I really liked. Here's the thing. Every dystopian movie has an absurd premise. I can't think of a single one that doesn't. So why are they so serious? There are maybe a few exceptions like LOGAN'S RUN which is somewhat serious but not excessively so. Take THE HUNGER GAMES for example. It's so serious but ultimately the premise is quite ridiculous. The makers of DEATH RACE 2000 knew they were making a movie with a droll premise and apparently didn't hesitate to make it lighthearted and humorous. I thought it was hilarious how Matilda the Hun the Nazi driver yelled Blitzkrieg! every time she ran someone over. Sylvester Stallone as Machine Gun Joe Viterbo has some really great lines such as You lousy stinking dirtball. You've got two seconds to live!I can't believe that the late Roger Ebert gave this movie 04 stars. That was another reason why I avoided this movie for quite a long time. Now don't get me wrong I really liked reading his reviews and I agreed with his opinions on many of the movies that he reviewed. But go read his short review of DR2Khttpwww.rogerebert.comreviewsdeathrace2000It's really not a review of the film itself. It's more of a criticism of movie theaters that don't enforce MPAA ratings.DEATH RACE 2000 is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. You might think it's a movie that's so bad it's good but it's not. It's just good.".

	onyx:emotionText "I avoided DEATH RACE 2000 for a long time because I thought it would be too violent and sadistic just like the remake with Jason Statham. But I figured that since it was made in the 70s it couldn't be that bad. And it isn't. Special effects have gotten much better. The blood in the remake looks real. Anybody can tell that the blood here is fake. The violence is also quite minimal. I mean there's a scene where a guy's head gets crushed under a car tire but trust me it really isn't as gory as it sounds. The movie is only around 75 minutes long which is as long as it needed to be. There really aren't any scenes that I thought were unnecessary. I really liked the story and the political commentary. The action scenes were pretty good for a movie that cost just 300000 around 1.5 million in today's money to make. I still can't get over the fact that this spectacular and I promise I'm not using that word sarcastically movie was made for only that much money. By the way I didn't give this movie 10 stars for being good AND inexpensive just for being good. I'm just saying that the fact that it was inexpensive is amazing given how good it is.Anyway another thing that I really liked about this movie is that it is really funny. I don't want to give any specific examples since DR2K is so short and it's best if you watch it without knowing much about it but there are some scenes that might seem sadistic at first but really aren't. This isn't a movie that takes itself too seriously which I really liked. Here's the thing. Every dystopian movie has an absurd premise. I can't think of a single one that doesn't. So why are they so serious? There are maybe a few exceptions like LOGAN'S RUN which is somewhat serious but not excessively so. Take THE HUNGER GAMES for example. It's so serious but ultimately the premise is quite ridiculous. The makers of DEATH RACE 2000 knew they were making a movie with a droll premise and apparently didn't hesitate to make it lighthearted and humorous. I thought it was hilarious how Matilda the Hun the Nazi driver yelled Blitzkrieg! every time she ran someone over. Sylvester Stallone as Machine Gun Joe Viterbo has some really great lines such as You lousy stinking dirtball. You've got two seconds to live!I can't believe that the late Roger Ebert gave this movie 04 stars. That was another reason why I avoided this movie for quite a long time. Now don't get me wrong I really liked reading his reviews and I agreed with his opinions on many of the movies that he reviewed. But go read his short review of DR2Khttpwww.rogerebert.comreviewsdeathrace2000It's really not a review of the film itself. It's more of a criticism of movie theaters that don't enforce MPAA ratings.DEATH RACE 2000 is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. You might think it's a movie that's so bad it's good but it's not. It's just good.";

The phenomenal cast turns in spirited performances all around with the top prize taken by the exquisite Mary Woronov as sexy cowgirl Calamity Jane Kelly. Whether gyrating on a dance floor or going after a matador in her Bull car she effortlessly steals every scene she's in. The only flaw in the movie and it's a minor one is the resistance with so many colorful characters and hilarious dialogue and situations you really don't care one way or the other about Thomasina Paine and her opposition forces. Still this lowbudget about 300000 New World opus is an audacious wildly funny gorgeously garish delight and an essential classic. Go for the baby the baby!".

	schema:reviewBody "Deathrace 2000 is one of the best films ever released by the Roger Corman organization and in fact it's one of the best films ever released on the exploitationdrivein circuit period. The film is not great because it presents us with interesting realistic characters or a complex welldeveloped story. Although it's often spoken of in terms of its brilliant political satire for the most part its political ideas are on a very basic level. What makes it a great film is its total lack of shame and pretension  in contrast to those who seem to see the film as a kind of veiled political statement I think the film was pretty obvious about what it is. And I think its great strength lies in the fact that director Bartel was able to give us a movie that fulfills all our demands for an exploitation film and not only that but is in fact a decent action film while at the same time overflowing with sadistic humor and no apologies. I don't see the film as a satire masquerading as an exploitation film  I see it as the ultimate exploitation film free to be what it wants to be telling us that it's OK to laugh at the darker things in life. We can enjoy watching a guy's head splattered on the road by a Nazi supermodel type. We can laugh at ourselves and our ridiculous cultural obsession with violence and we can rise above and be conscious of just how ridiculous it is without sinking to the kind of pedantic moralism lampooned in the film in the person of Grace Pander Joyce Jameson and her morosely selfserious rebel clan.The pacing of the movie is another of its strengths  never let the audience stop and think about whether they should be offended. It doesn't take long for the film to introduce the major characters and the central story concept. Frankenstein David Carradine is the alltime champion of the Death Race a crosscountry motor race in which contestants score points for killing pedestrians. Each racer has a partner of the opposite sex whose job is equally navigation and sexual satisfaction Frankenstein's new partner Annie Smith Simone Griffeth has a third job working as a fighter in Pader's resistance movement on a special mission to assassinate Frankenstein.The cars look very primitive today and my friend who is a mechanic could easily identify the exact model of Volkswagen that was modified for the futuristic cars. But no matter. Each has been modified to fit a colorful persona for the racer like WWF stars in the 1980sMartin Kove's Nero the Hero with his Roman gladiator trappings is memorable Sylvester Stallone makes a good early appearance as the poseur Machine Gun Joe a character I would guess is loosely modeled on Charles Bronson's early Roger Corman character Machine Gun Kelly  this Machine Gun business might be good luck for aspiring action stars! but Mary Woronov blows everyone away with her noholdsbarred uberfeminist Calamity Jane best line nobody scores my copilot!.Carradine knows what he's doing  he doesn't take the film any more seriously than it takes itself but instead plays the character as twodimensional par excellence. His best moment comes when he removes the scarred and disfigured mask that provides the persona of Frankenstein  what did you expect another pretty face?. Carradine's laconic screen presence matches the character and the sterile futuristic world perfectly.Griffith's script is one of his best and that's saying a lot because the guy was seriously funny see his original Little Shop of Horrors and his masterpiece Bucket of Blood. It's based on a story by scifi writer Ib Melchior who didn't like the movie it didn't take itself as seriously as he wanted it to as I recall. I can't say enough about how much I adore Paul Bartel's films and this is one of his best along with Eating Raoul. Paul Bartels doesn't feel like he needs to dumb down his films so that people will realize they are a joke  he thinks that a joke SHOULD be potentially dangerous and has no fear of offending the audience. It's not that he's a provocateur in my opinion but rather he's a classic satirist  he wants to show us how ridiculous our society is without wallowing in selfrighteousness. His movies are always fun and for that reason they'll never be fully embraced by the majority of critics who think that you have to throw a wet towel over your film in order to send a serious message.This is brave filmmaking of the highest order  fast fun funny sexy uncompromising and intelligent.".

Based on a 1956 short story it's a highly satiric scifi actioner that uses ironic and downright sadistic touches to examine America's abhorrent fascination with violence.The ridiculously contrived and outlandish futuristic setting was put into heavy rotation during the mid70's in several other films Westworld Soylent Green Logan's Run as a means to tell downbeat and cynical stories that allowed the audience to escape their own reality but still experience a certain catharsis.In the case of Death Race 2000 the results are a mixed bag as the over the top material races from dark comedy to Sleeperlike scifi to undercooked romance and back again. It works because of the tongueincheek direction of Paul Bartel who would go on to helm the brilliant dark comedy Eating Raoul. The whole thing is great fun and has a surprising innocence underneath all of the mostly cartoonish violence.This said the main gripe would have to be the inconsistent pacing as the race and the story took breaks between laps which leaves the viewer peeking at their watch.".

It's backed up with a theme tune that sounds as if the tape's chewed and cuts to a poorly superimposed futuristic setting.The rest of the film is like this. Cheap somewhat curiously directed poorly acted and shouldn't work. Yet somehow it does. Is this the most subversive American movie ever made? There's occasional digs at other races The Nazi driver Herman the German for one but in the main it's U.S. culture that is being constantly lambasted. A future America where the Stars and Stripes are red and gold and the President Sandy McCallum says things like I have made the United Provinces of America the greatest power in the known universe. Even when slating other races the finger points back to gungho xenophobia as when the President hilariously states It is no coincidence my dear children that the word 'sabotage' was invented by the French.Not only is this open season on it's country of origin's own culture it also has some of the sickest humour ever seen in a mainstream movie. The central concept is of a car race where killing pedestrians gains the drivers points in the contest. And toddlers under twelve now rate a big 70 points explains a TV announcer. There's also a specially arranged Euthanasia Day at the local geriatrics' hospital and the supreme sickness of the title quote.What adds to the film is its sense of unmitigated cheese. David Carradine is lame in the lead role while many of the other  equally lacklustre  performers struggle with a thirdrate script. Sample line? You know Myra some people might think you're cute. But me I think you're just one large baked potato. This combines with pit stop scenes which involve little else other than gratuitous nudity. Violence in the movie is shot and edited as if it thinks it matches the gore of Cronenberg or Tom Savini. However it's merely tame and almost comical as badly staged red paint explodes everywhere. Some of the car racing is also sped up which resembles less fast cars more Keystone Kops. However as much of this is overlaid with incongruous classical music there's every possibility that this is intentional. It's also fun seeing Sylvester Stallone beaten senseless by a skinny Carradine in a poorly choreographed fight. Imagine Mad Max involved in a fight between Wacky Races and Benny Hill and you're part way there to imagining what this unique film is like.Stallone is Machine Gun Joe described as being loved by thousands hated by millions which is quite apt. While I'm a Stallone fan apologist? it's worth noting that this is less a Stallone acting appearance Rocky Copland... more a Stallone bythenumbers performance Rocky IV Judge Dredd...Of course while all this is thrown together at such a force and with such a delightfully hammy velocity that it makes it great amusement there is evidence that it's onejoke satire isn't enough to fill it's paltry 78 minutes running time. Like the cars that are supposedly driving fast but are really puttering along at a snail's pace the final quarter of the movie runs the risk of grinding to a halt. A final satirical barb by a racing commentator The race is the symbol of everything we hold dear our American way of life. Sure it's violent but that's the way we love it... violent violent violent! seems to overstate the matter and falls flat.The ending is resolved with yet more poorly animated titles and a narration that talks about man's need for violence. One of the best bad movies I've ever seen Death Race 2000 is within reach of absolute greatness though doesn't  quite  manage it. 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed Georgy Girl at the time of its original release but hadn't thought about it until I recently viewed the DVD version. This revisit was well worth it Georgy Girl is a delightful film.Charlotte Rampling's Meredith is my favorite of the four main characters. Rampling has always been physically stunning but it's her moody intellect within that keeps Meredith modern rather than a 60s icon who looks sensational in Mary Quant minidresses a darker version of Julie Christie in Darling a character who didn't have too much of a light side herself. Meredith is cool in control selfserving brutal and surprisingly honest about who she is. You take me as me she tells Jos Alan Bates as she cajoles him into marrying her not so much because she's pregnant but because she's bored. It seems in Meredith's view you can easily get rid of a pregnancy but boredom requires more skill and is potentially a worse situation in which to find yourself. Other actresses could have successfully made Meredith a bitch but Rampling makes her fascinating and thus strangely likable. When she exits the film things go a bit limp but then there's little left than to move the story to its inevitable conclusion.Alan Bates plays Jos with such high physical and verbal energy he seems to be all the Marx Brothers rolled into one. His facial expression at the culmination of his strip during the 'I Love You' sequence suggested to me a nod to the great Harpo.Lynn Redgrave made the role of Georgy so much her own it's difficult to believe the story that Vanessa Redgrave had been originally intended for it  and even more difficult to imagine Vanessa playing scenes with Rampling.The title song became a big hit at the time. In the film the lyrics vary somewhat from the pop version serving to set up the plot during the opening credits and then comment on its resolution at the end. In between the song politely vanishes leaving the classically influenced score by Alexander Faris to take over with its harpsichord riffs and its subtle playfulness. I especially liked the violin solo that accompanies the transition from orgasm to morning sickness.The dialogue is often fast overlapping thrown away or contains obscure to me cultural references so it's worth enabling the English subtitles for DVD viewing. You wouldn't want to miss Moss Bros or Alan Bates' rapidfire disrobing monologue or Meredith's contempt for the concert at which she has just played violin Beethoven night. They're like animals.".

Unfortunately as a male it seems that the principal characters in films addressing this theme with sensitivity are invariably women. Perhaps in our society men are expected not to have such uncertainties about themselves or to suppress them so no films are made.

Redgrave's roommate is a coldhearted and embittered woman who banks on her good looks to get her what she wants out of life. Although the roommate becomes pregnant by her fiancee the young man soon realizes that he fancys the homely but sweet Georgy over the constantly complaining woman about to give birth to his child. The baby is born and is instantly rejected by the mother. Georgy is determined to protect the innocent child and to bring her up by herself if she had to. The ending is one of my favorite film conclusions ever. You will not be disappointed!This film was ahead of its time in 1966 England and the world. Despite the progressive themes both the film and its infectious theme song became enormous successes. If you know the song look for a much more elaborate rendition in the film featuring many extra lines. The same was done with the legendary Song From Moulin Rouge 1952.  Georgy Girl receives my highest recommendation!".

She shares a flat with a selfish cold bitch Charlotte Rampling who gets pregnant of Jos Alan Bates and the three of them eventually move together but things get complicated as Georgy is courted by Jos and James James Mason a much older man at the same time.Bates is it just me or does he look like JeanPaul Belmondo  one of the greatest Nouvelle Vague icons because of Godard's Breathless  in this? Rampling and Mason are all great in their respective parts but this is Redgrave's show all the way. Her antiheroine is sweet and memorable somewhat similar to Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop from Muriel's Wedding some sort of a British less patient and clumsier Amlie Poulain Audrey Tautou. Georgy singing Whole Lotta Woman is a classic scene. Lynn's performance alone would make this movie worth seeing but she's not the only good thing about it just the core. 1010.".

She gets back at James by some cheeky comments in front of two proper elderly ladies. Watch her interactions with both suitors... she can demonstrate wit and charm...Tho the Georgy Girl film theme song by the Seekers sneers at Georgy ...a little bit I suspect this film was big because it struck a chord with so many girls  women.

But Georgy Girl is surprisingly engaging and tugs at far more profound emotions than those tapped by say Bridget Jones' Diary which might be seen as a modern equivalent.The song  or actually two different version of the same song  is essential to understanding the movie which makes one wonder which came first. Was the song inspired by the novel or was it written for the movie? The opening like a music video introduces us to Georgina or Georgy and to her plight as a terribly unchic 60s chick. But what makes Georgy interesting is that she clearly doesn't care that she's out of sync with Swinging London circa 1966.The timing of the film is also critical just as it was with The Graduate. The London youth scene we are introduced to  in black and white no less  is one in which conventional morals and values are being shed yet there is still an innocence about it. The decadence that would taint the later '60s is hinted at in the troubles Georgy's roommate the seemingly hip and carefree Meredith faces in the latter half of the film. And the character of Jos Meredith's boyfriend and then husband also embodies the joie de vivre spirit of the day but then crashes into the dead end that inevitably comes when a man lives like a child even one of the flower variety.Georgy's relationship with her father's employer James played by James Mason is troubling in its incestuous overtones but maybe the discomfort the viewer feels is intended.My only gripe is that the conclusion of the film  when we learn what Georgy is really all about what she wants out of life  is explained in the song and not as clearly revealed in the plot or character exposition. But I suppose that lends a certain charm to the story as if Georgy is indeed living inside a pop tune.Georgy Girl though very much of its time is not dated and explores choices we all make within a unique context that of a moment in time when culture and values began tilting off their axis.".

	schema:reviewBody "Georgy Girl 1966This is kind of a great movie. With some quirks that look like weaknesses. It's a serious funny drama. At times downright goofy othertimes clever even while horrible things are happening. As a look into the life and times of London early 1960s it's quite frank and playful.The Georgy played by Lynn Redgrave is really amazing. She's a slightly plain girl a tad overweight at least according to those around her and completely talented and fun. But she can't get a date and this has worn her down into a despondency that she fights to overcome. Her roommate is the impossibly thin and attractive Charlotte Rampling with a crazy hairdo in just her second significant role in the movies. They support each other as great friends do but there's no getting past the difference in how men see them.One man in particular Jos played by Alan Bates a British actor who never quite made a dent in the American scene puts on a bravado performance. Which is both good and bad. He's so comic and hammy which is a lovable part of his nature he pushes credibility. There must be people so manic but maybe he needs some other counterbalance rather than ongoing comic relief. And yet what a relief. He's quite fun and the serious strains of the movie balance out well.This serious strain is what makes Georgy Girl significant somehow. Because here is an actual insight into how a plain young girl tries to cope. And she does cope somehow making mistakes and feeling terrible about them and then cheering up because she knows somehow she needs to survive. And survive she does. It's really great.The style of the film is still the British New Wave coming at the tail end of the movement. It's black and white and filmed loosely. It tells a middle class story overall and from a hand camera point of view. It's rather lovely filming in fact and if it ever gets a proper crystal clear release that will be newly appreciated.The final aspect of the film I have put off here and it's where George Mason comes in. He plays the owner of the mansion where Georgy's parents work as servants. And he has had a lifelong appreciation infatuation with Georgy. Of course he's an old fuddy if handsome and the idea that this is the type of man a kind of girl like Georgy should have and can have is the deepest sad pathos of the whole story. And it is punctuated with surprising sad drama at the end. I don't think this is the best film of the era but like Alfie and Darling from the same time and place it's revealing and wonderful in its own ways. Contemporary music issues like abortion and the sexual revolution and the true generation gap are all central. The script is snappy and at times cynical. The score is a hootfilled with symphonic sound tricks like the tympani changing pitch to cue the viewer. And there is the title song a hit and if you listen to the lyrics a commentary of it's own quite funny.An underappreciated film for sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best films of all time. The story is heartbreaking an 11 yearold girl has been forced into prostitution by her mother. When the police arrest the mother Rosetta and her little brother Luciano who is 9 must be taken to a children's home in the south of Italy. A young Carabiniere named Antonio is assigned the task of taking them from Milan to Sicilly even though he's barely more than a child himself. The journey takes this mismatched threesome to Antonio's home province where he reunites briefly with his sister and his old granny before Rosetta is recognized from a magazine cover and shunned. The growing tenderness among the three young people is the essence of the story. The girl although only 11 conveys the bitterness of adulthood through her ineffably sad eyes.

Luciano is a beautiful child whose adoration of the soldiercop is delicately and warmly depicted. Only The 400 Blows and Forbidden Games have captured the ache of childhood as well. The director has used stunning compositions and lingering takes of the Italian countryside that make the story resonate beyond its intimate canvas. The acting is brilliant. I suppose the only reason this film has not been released on DVD is it's controversial subject matter which is a shame because that shunning is what the film is about.

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of the best films of all time. The story is heartbreaking an 11 yearold girl has been forced into prostitution by her mother. When the police arrest the mother Rosetta and her little brother Luciano who is 9 must be taken to a children's home in the south of Italy. A young Carabiniere named Antonio is assigned the task of taking them from Milan to Sicilly even though he's barely more than a child himself. The journey takes this mismatched threesome to Antonio's home province where he reunites briefly with his sister and his old granny before Rosetta is recognized from a magazine cover and shunned. The growing tenderness among the three young people is the essence of the story. The girl although only 11 conveys the bitterness of adulthood through her ineffably sad eyes. She knows so much more about life than her 19 yearold policeman yet without any seedy sexual implications he comes to teach her through his tender care that there's more to life than sorrow.

	schema:reviewBody "This marvelous film deals with a topic exploitation of children euphimism that is difficult on viewers. All over the world bad things are happening to young people who can not control their own lives because they are children. The innocents tainted in this world will become saints and dwell in Heaven with Our Father. No this film isn't about religion per se. But it is about the struggle and the triumph of humans over their sometimes miserable but always radiant terrible difficulties. The adult who has to deal with the two abandoned children is marvelously played and his growth as a human being in the sense of doing the right thing rather than just following orders is a great performance. The leading character is an 1112 year old girl who I understand was not an actress before performing in this film. I could open a floodgate of positive adjectives and remarks about her performance but let's just say that she play her role so authentically and underplays which is necessary the plight of her character where the underplaying is simply the character being herself in a world she enduresand must accept but is one no one would choose. I hope that viewers will remember and if they don't watch the movie again the final scene where she tries to give her brother hope and show the viewer that even the worst world can be inhabited and experienced with at least some joysometimes only a tiny measure of happiness is all we can get in our lives but still we must savor it.Many people complain that so and so movie is not on DVD etc. but this film was released on VHS for a short time in the early 90's and only a few copies are on the market at a fairly high pricethe film should be transferred to DVD by Criterion or someone I wish I knew how. Buy the VHS and watch a movie that points the way as almost no movie really does to the real complex harmful and sometimes wonderful world that exists beyond the movie.".

To shine a bit of light on an otherwise dismal existence as it may.Loach's characters are never overly redemptive they don't hit the lottery aren't left millions by a dead aunt or marry a rich suitor. And the ending here is a bit short trite. But they usually come through the film a little stronger having weathered their travails feeling a little better about themselves. I dare say we come through feeling a little better about ourselves as well.".

To shine a bit of light on an otherwise dismal existence as it may.Loach's characters are never overly redemptive they don't hit the lottery aren't left millions by a dead aunt or marry a rich suitor. And the ending here is a bit short trite. But they usually come through the film a little stronger having weathered their travails feeling a little better about themselves. I dare say we come through feeling a little better about ourselves as well.";

Go to any site and you will see at least one character who you could say directly related to a charater in this film. The safety aspect has been cleaned up a lot now but back then sites were a dangerous place to work. Accidents were common and the end scenes were not in any way unrealistic.The thing that did it for me was the portrayal of the working class of Britain. The sentiments were all there the humour the desparation the sense of wanting to rise above the rest and the shattered dreams. They are all here. I would say that if anyone from abroad wanted to study the character of the British working class then they MUST see this film. It is tough gritty and full of humour...a truly remarkable piece of film that is sadly neglected.Buy it Rent it Steal it Borrow it...whatever you do SEE IT!".

I apologise is your job is searching for serial killers or on your way to becoming a world sporting champion after overcoming cancer but what we have here is a little bit of UK working class reality. Trust me I was there and so was the late writer Bill Jess.Jess died shortly before this film came out.I worked on a building sites at weekends as a 15 year old and although I have no pictures or film to remind  at least I have this and the buildings that I helped construct.I have met all of the people under the loop here not always on building sites though and to be quite frank it is all a bit frightening. However I lived in a predominantly white district so I had no experience of onthejob multiculturalism and that is the only part I cannot really comment upon or relate to.Robert Carlyle is a genius at portraying the British workingclass. Maybe he is the real thing in part but he seems able to transform himself physically as well as mentally. I have never seen him overact in anything and he has had plenty of opportunities. He even takes on impossible parts like Hitler!Here he is a Glasgow jailbird squatting in London and hoping to make a few quid on the black economy. He hooks up with a girl that claims to be a singer and poet but is actually only in to hard drugs. He deals with the situation the best he can using the only language he can.London is the 1980's was one of the cheapest places in the world to live. You wanted a flat?  get a crowbar  here's your flat! Well for a short while before the heavy mob show up. That is how the rock group The Police first got to live in our capital city!Today building sites are full of foreign workers  some legal some not  that don't squat but live in the back of vans parked on or near the site.Strangely Ricky Tomlinson became a actor after being banned from building sites due to his political activities. In 1973 he sent to jail see his IMDb bio in an episode that shows British justice at its worst Charging someone with a serious offence and then trying to get a guilty plea in return for a lesser charge. Ricky  being a man not a mouse  didn't fall for it. Others did making it look extra bad for him.He later went to be a popular man on TV and British film and will earn over a million dollars from his autobiography Ricky!What makes this film even more frightening is the dramatic conclusion. Something similar although not quite as serious happened where I worked  although not while I was there. In a coincidence that would make a TV script writer blush I was with the boss of the said firm in a van and we passed the subject in the street. He got very lucky said Mr Bossman waving from the van he landed on his head and that is what saved him. It was pure Ken Loach moment so I hope he is reading this.".

Mr. Klein in excellent performance by Alain Delon if anybody ever tells you that Delon is nothing but a pretty face NEVER believe it. Delon is a great actor with amazing screen presence who happened to be one of the most beautiful people ever lived is a French Catholic antique dealer successful with his business and adored by the ladies. At first he does not care much about the occupation and the fate of Jews who had to sell their pricey pieces of Art and personal belongings for a song just to be able to leave France and to save their lives. On the contrary he only becomes richer but everything changes when he is confused with another Robert Klein his namesake a wanted by the authorities' member of the underground resistance and a Jew. In the atmosphere of the total fear bigotry hatred and paranoia the presumption of innocence ceases to exist and Mr. Klein must prove that he is not a Jew or to face the fate of millions whose fault was to belong to the inferior race. While trying to claim his comfortable life back Mr. Klein begins looking for the man he never met but who by the bitter irony of fate had played such a significant role in his life. The desire to look him in the eye becomes so overwhelming that it will take Robert to where he may not be able to ever come back.Mr. Klein is a complex subtle scary and nightmarish film made by a very talented director who had to leave his country the USA in the beginning of the 50s and who knew a thing or two about paranoia and hatred multiplied by the power and turned into indifferent killing machine. Once you are inside this machine Abandon hope all ye who enter here. Losey's film is often described as a blend of Hitchcock's thrillers where the heroes must deal with the mistaken identity and Kafka's nightmares of The Trial and I agree with the description. I only want to add that the film brings to mind Edgar Poe's short story William Wilson which was adapted to the screen by Luis Malle as a part of the trilogy Histoires extraordinaires 1968 and Alain Delon played both William Wilson and the mysterious man his double his conscience his dark and hidden side. Mr. Klein also reminds another underrated rarely seen but very interesting Ingmar Bergman's film The Serpent's Egg 1977 as well as Bob Fosse's masterpiece Cabaret. The themes of the Feast during the Time of Plague the helplessness and distress of the terrorized members of society that face the merciless and inevitable force of history and would perish without a trace are similar in all three movies. Despite these similarities Mr. Klein is an outstanding film on its own merits. What saddens me is the fact that is little known rarely seen and almost never mentioned even among the film buffs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Klein is one of the few movies I've watched because of the person that wrote it. After enjoying The Battle of Algiers State of Siege and Queimada I had to continue watching the movies written by the spectacular politicallyminded Franco Solinas. The fact that one of my favourite directors CostaGavras did uncredited work on the script was a major draw too. I'd never heard of Joseph Losey and although I've recently discovered the beautiful icecold Alain Delon through JeanPierre Melville's movies I wouldn't watch a movie just because of his good looks.So thank you Mr. Franco Solinas for a new good movie and a unique take on the Holocaust theme.Alain Delon plays Mr. Robert Klein a normal man who deals in art. In Nazioccupied France his business blooms as he buys merchandise at low cost from Jews trying to escape. Since they're at a disadvantage Mr. Klein only profits from their business relationships. He's not too concerned with what's going on. After all he's not Jewish.Then one day a Jewish newspaper appears at his door it seems Mr. Klein is on the subscribers' list. That can't be since he's not Jewish. It seems there's another Robert Klein that got mixed up with him. He tries to sort out the misunderstanding with the police but the other Klein has disappeared and our protagonist unwittingly becomes victim of an investigation and police harassment.Continuing to believe that everything will be sorted out  he's a good Frenchman he claims and believes in his country's institutions  he decides to look for the other Klein. But wherever he goes he only finds mysteries and dead ends. Why is this happening to Mr. Klein? Why is the other Klein doing this to him? Who is he? These are just some of the questions our protagonist desperately wants to answer.On the surface this is a metaphysical thriller much in the tradition of European thrillers like Antonioni's L'Avventure BlowUp or The Passenger in which facts answers and clarity are less important than the philosophical questions that the mysteries open. Owing more to Kafka than Raymond Chandler this is the story of how an ordinary man is caught in the bureaucratic machinery of the institutions he believes in that replace truth with their inexorable authority. It's a prison made without walls and bars but perhaps more oppressive since it can steal even one man's identity.The ending is truly inspired one of the finest examples of fatalism I've ever seen in a movie. Looking back one can't help thinking the movie couldn't end in any other way. And yet it'll come as a surprise to any viewer.Franco Solinas Joseph Losey and Alain Delon are all to commend for a heartbreaking movie.".

The plot seems to be ordinary and straight forward but in the background we have many clues that what seems to be is not what there is. Joseph Losey made here a genious work of directingcreating a mysterious movie with even more mysterious double character of Mr. Klein  one in the shade and one very well performed by Alain Delon.".

The plot seems to be ordinary and straight forward but in the background we have many clues that what seems to be is not what there is. Joseph Losey made here a genious work of directingcreating a mysterious movie with even more mysterious double character of Mr. Klein  one in the shade and one very well performed by Alain Delon.";

	schema:reviewBody "The French don't like talking about what happened in France in the Second World War when they are blamed of collaborating with the Nazis. This particular movie does not try to make history seem nicer than it was. Hats off to the producers one of them Alain Delon himself for bringing this serious topic to the screen.Apart from the historical background this is also a very suspenseful wellwritten thriller with barely any lost minutes or boring scenes. There's no need to go through the content exactly again now but it sure is an unusual and interesting one. The fight for your own identity. Mr Klein an antiques seller who profits from sales of Jews who are in danger and want of money finds out there's someone in Paris who's also called Robert Klein. As this Mr Klein is as he suspects a Jew he tries everything to find the one who steals his safe identity.The director Joseph Losey presents us a very atmospheric picture of Paris 1942. The actors are all good but the star is of course Alain Delon. Delon gives what is probably among his greatest character roles ever and he completely disappears into the demanding role. The screenplay is consistently fine and never has any missteps including a dramatic and very touching final. A French film gem from the Seventies watch it now!".

	schema:reviewBody "As part of the Istanbul Film Festival I just saw Monsieur Klein a tale of a man whose story I slept through a large part of. This is not meant as disrespect to Losey or the film's star Alain Delon. It's not easy to watch three films in one day and the middle film often bears the brunt of my sleepiness. Here's what I didn't miss.The film starts with an exquisite scene of a French vet we find out later who is examining a naked dark haired woman measuring the length of her nostrils whether her earlobes are attached or not the size of her hips and other humiliating minutiae in a cold and clinical office. The woman is then dismissed and to top it off has to pay for the test that will prove whether or not she is a Jew. We then see her commiserate with her husband who also had the same test. This clinically frightening scene is somewhat different than the rest of the film which is less about the process of France's occupation and collaboration and more about Delon's character's inner workings. He plays a gentile art dealer named Mr. Klein who in 1942 profits off Jews who have to unload precious goods in order to make it out of the country. He buys their works cheaply and then sells them at a high profit.Alas he is mistaken for a Jewish man also named Mr. Klein who has mysteriously disappeared. Klein's life then begins to unravel as he tries to get to the bottom of what has happened. The other Klein is all that he is not poor Jewish and politically active. We expect a sea change in his character but by the end we have to wonder if he really realizes and acknowledges the irony of the situation and the karmic retribution that is being exacted. Now that I think about it the last scene does acknowledge that somewhat. As Klein is being swept by a crowd boarding a train headed for the concentration camps he turns and yells at his friend who can potentially help him get out saying I'll be back. If he wanted could he have turned back? Did he want to punish himself for the role he played in others' suffering? Is he symbolic of the nation of France as a whole with the exception of Resistance fighters willing to turn a blind eye and thus worthy of punishment? To top it all off the last scene in the train shows a Jew who came to Klein at the very beginning of the film and sold a valuable painting which he collected a couple of gold coins for. The Jew is not alone in front of him stands the blankfaced Mr. Klein.I wasn't surprised to see that Delon was the producer and even less surprised that this film was being shown while giving him a lifetime achievement award because the film is all about HIM. After all one still of the film features Delon within the David's Star how megalomaniac is that?I'm a Delon lover not hater though and I don't know which is better Delon in a bowler hat or a silk robe. He sports both. I'll choose the hat because it's more meaningful to the post at hand. The hat was reminiscent of Magritte's existential man in a bowler hat his face obscured by a series of objects. That is the essence of the film not the Holocaust or the occupation but rather the existential crisis of one man. By being confused for a Jewish man Delon is forced to question his own existence and the choices he has made. We however are never totally privy to that process.cococravescinema.blogspot.com".

Harder to follow than any Hitchcock or Christie probably on purpose as if to say Life is not always so clear cut.Lady Moreau and Francine Berg could have had more character development while beautiful leggy Juliet Berto's long figure and erratic behaviour is all we can see from Bob's fianc.

Lonsdale from many Buuel films gives us the eerie feeling so necessary for this film to succeed. Jugnot and Aumont deliver in their smaller roles.

C. Tashiro adds that the Nazi horrors are taken for granted making them more real. Like J. L. Borges usually quipped There are no camels in the 1001 nights meaning those involved don't notice what we the viewers probably would.Franco Solinas's script conveys paranoia as faced by somebody who seems never to have suffered for anything nor anybody for that matter.

It's a brutal revenge story we know that Klein is being punished for making money off the deaths of others from the beginning but also an allegory for the selfloathing Jew who in this case runs toward his death aware that it's coming and trying to avoid it but actually walking right into it a nasty bit of determinism.The beginning of the film has a title that suggests this film is about not a person but a phenomenon  a composite of various people  but just what phenomenon are they talking about? Art dealers during the Nazi occupation? That could be but how many of them had their identity essentially stolen from them? I think the phenomenon they're referring to has more to do with that allegory than it does with the literal happenings of the film. But what's so impressive about the film is that the literal happenings are taken very seriously.Delon's performance here as per usual in his later years is very good and very subtle. He's not a ruthless man and there's a very interesting balance he pulls off between being annoyed at his police troubles and trying not to offend anyone especially the Jews as he tries desperately to get off their newspaper mailing list. Of course there is no grandstanding and his aging beauty gives him a perpetually overtired face a pretty boy whose looks are slowly deteriorating. He must have been aware of that as his worn face matches the dull rainy Paris landscape in the film. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Losey's early Hollywood work included The Dividing Line and The Boy With Green Hair and Mr Klein contains elements of both inasmuch as he is still saying that if you're 'different' you'll wind up paying the price. He seems to have taken a leaf out of JeanPierre Melville's book and shot the film in muted autumnal color which lends an ironic touch of austerity to the story of a man who deals in fine Art and lives a sumptuous lifestyle. Other posters have dealt both with the plot and its Kafkaesque overtones so it would be superfluous to repeat that here. Like the majority I found it an excellent effort and for a French film buff like me the pleasure was enhanced by a glimpse of Gerard Jugnot a great cameo by Louis Seigner a telling appearance by Michel Aumont an alltoo brief couple of appearances by the wonderful Suzanne Flon and Michael Lonsdale in fine form as Klein's lawyer. The Biter Bit element MAY be a tad obvious and overdone true but Delon's central performance plus the contributions already mentioned help take the edge of this whilst the startlingly effective opening of a naked woman submitting to an examination in order to prove her nonJewishness is somewhat wasted by not being effectively linked to the main story but these are minor quibbles from one who has always found Losey somewhat overrated but who thoroughly enjoyed this late offering.".

Not a pretty picture rather a blandly terrifying or terrifyingly bland one. The film is frequently and aptly described as Kafkaesque. It raises questions that it deliberately does not answer. Another reviewer pointed out thematic similarities to Bergman's 'The Serpent's Egg'. I agree and both are very good. To be honest I need to see 'Mr. Klein' again but it is upsetting enough that I have to defer that awhile. And probably after another viewing I'll still be confused.

	schema:reviewBody "First I'm not part of the cast or crew. I'm not affiliated with the film in any manner. I watched it at the 2011 Down Syndrome Congress National Convention and I thought it was well worth the time.Interestingly enough I wouldn't classify it as a Down Syndrome film. I believe it will be just as entertaining and worthwhile to people who have no affiliation with Down as it is to those who do. It's a solid story that highlights some very believable situations.The situations related to Down are very poignant despite not being the focus of the movie  Evan's ability to care for himself barely scrapes minimal. He doesn't have the acumen to deal with an antagonistic boss he makes some very poor financial choices and at times he simply wanders off in a childlike manner. However when his mother dies he's left without any kind of caretaker. Unfortunately his situation is anything but a flight of movie fancy it happens every day.Still Evan Down Syndrome and Evan's uncertain future aren't the focus of the film. Candy brings in another very realistic element a single mother struggling financially stuck in an abusive relationship after making some poor relationship choices.I thought the acting was quite good. In particular Candy's reaction to Evan's infatuation and the depth of his infatuation was superb. Jackson Rathbone did well as Russ too  with Russ being such a jerk it would have been easy to make him a caricature bad guy. Real people are never that onedimensional though and Rathbone added to the realism of the movie by showing some real internal conflict. Yes Russ is a jerk but part of that personality is the result of some internal vulnerability and real world events.And Evan Sneider was excellent. Another reviewer complained that Evan was obviously coached. Well yes that's what director do. They coached Katherine Hepburn they coach Tom Cruise they coach William H. Macy and I'm sure Justin Lerner coached Evan. Both Justin and Evan did a fine job.The filming itself was great. I was really impressed by how well the choice of shots emphasized the characters' personalities or relationship with the world.I'm pretty surprised at the snide comments from some of the other reviewers particularly intimations that this subject matter is somehow overdone. One reviewer mentions Life Goes On  news flash folks that series wrapped up 17 years ago. And the idea that Girlfriends is exploitive is ludicrous. The fact that Evan's character is mentally challenged is essential to the plot.Overall this was an excellent film and certainly worth taking the time to watch.".

	schema:headline " This is NOT a Down's Syndrome movie  it's a powerful love story";
	schema:reviewBody "Girlfriend is the first fulllength film from writerdirector Justin Lerner. I first met him and reviewed his impressive short The Replacement Child at the 2008 Santa Barbara Film Festival so I was eagerly awaiting his first feature. It's an auspicious debut for this talented young director and it far exceeded my expectations.The film stars Evan Sneider The Replacement Child Shannon Woodward The Haunting of Molly Hartley Jackson Rathbone The Twilight Saga and Amanda Plummer Pulp Fiction.Evan Sneider plays Evan a young man with Down's Syndrome who longs for a girlfriend and the kind of rich life he believes he's always been entitled to. He never sees himself as a victim or as someone with an affliction in need of pity or special treatment. Evan has a big heart and just wants someone to share it with besides his doting mother Celeste Amanda Plummer. She lives for him and he lives for her. The object of his affection is Candy Shannon Woodward who still harbors feelings for her abusive exboyfriend Russ Jackson Rathbone as she searches for someone to provide for her young son.Unexpected circumstances send Evan down an unimaginable road one which keeps the viewer twisting and turning never knowing whether his next encounter will provide comfort or danger. Empathy for him plants the seeds of discomfort and the ensuing suspense builds throughout the film.Girlfriend truly has the sparse look and gritty feel of the sweet little American indie that I search for at festivals. Natural lighting is used where possible and flashy visual effects are kept to a minimum. The viewer simply observes as the story unfolds. Quyen Tran's skillful cinematography takes full advantage of the film's claustrophobic settings by shooting through windows and doorways  the technique known as frame within a frame  rather than crowding the characters. To provide depth Lerner and Tran devised a plan whereby each actor would be filmed a certain way  Evan with closeups Rathbone with a long lens  and it's strikingly effective in its elegance.The use of long takes without dialogue is one of the most powerful elements of this film. Periods of silence can often say more than words on a script as the viewer is forced to create the conversation in his own head. Actors who can communicate through facial expressions and simple gestures don't need lines to have an impact on the audience. It's one of the most impactful and dramatic techniques used in Girlfriend and left me with a sense of wonder.If you could hear a gem it would have the poignant music scored by lead actor Rathbone's band 100 Monkeys. The members of the band  Rathbone Jerad Anderson M. Lawrence Abrams Ben Johnson and Ben Graupner  scored and wrote original songs for the film. The bond between the writers and the project is apparent  Rathbone stars and serves as coproducer Anderson also acts and produces  and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.It's always hard to single anyone out in such a brilliant ensemble cast but this is clearly Evan Sneider's film. It was written for him and with much love and it shows. There's no discerning whether or not the plot is based on experiences he's had in real life. Far from being exploitative Lerner's narrative never uses Evan's condition as a crutch and neither does Evan. The story would work even if the character didn't have Down's Syndrome and that's a testament to Lerner's knowledge of and sensitivity about the issue.Shannon Woodward puts her heart and soul into the role of Candy. One can almost feel her emotional pain as she struggles to put food on the table and keep a roof over her son's head. The viewer is equally spiteful toward Russ a first class villain who never shows a tender side except in deception. Rathbone's spiteful portrayal is in stark contrast to the goodness surrounding most of the characters. He is evil personified. Amanda Plummer's star turn as Evan's mother Celeste is simply heartwrenching. It's clear that Lerner gave his actors free reign to improvise. It works because they clearly have developed working relationships based on trust  with the filmmaker as well as castmates. The unscripted dialogue sounds authentic because it's real.This movie about and starring a young man with Down's Syndrome has some scenes which may make audiences uncomfortable but to me that's one of the definitions of true art  it moves you makes you happy sad angry  it affects you emotionally on a deeply personal level. Girlfriend can be hard to watch at times but is one of those films that deserves the label important.".

	schema:headline " A beautiful and important film";
	schema:reviewBody "Girlfriend is a dark film a very heavy film weighing down on you as you watch it. There is so much going on beneath the surface of the artfully simplistic filming techniques. The viewer is forced to pay close attention to the cues within a wide shot the secrets behind a dialogue and the tragedies behind a profile.The core cast is small and we get to know each character in depth. To me this adds to the small town feel provided by the setting of Girlfriend Wayland Massachusetts.Evan is a kind and pure heart and everything from the way he is filmed to the lines he says presents him as such. We simply see him in his small world reaching out to and caring about the people around him. This is exemplified when he decides to give a large sum of money to the woman he has crushed on since high school Candy.Candy has a difficult time believing that Evan's gift is from the kindness of his heart and not a means to an end. It is here that we get a glimpse into what her life has been like. Her past experiences and relationships have left her jaded. She's lost held together only by her love for her son.Russ Russ took me by surprise at how vile he was even being prepared by the synopsis and the movie trailer. He is Candy's exboyfriend violent alcoholic and just as lost as she. He still involves himself in her life as does she with his and the interaction is never healthy.Kenny is a key pressure point in the story helping to create conflict in an already volatile situation. His presence on screen is brief but his impact on the story remains throughout.During a question and answer bit after the second showing at the Toronto International Film Festival someone asked the cast and crew about the filming techniques used in the film. I found the cinematographer's response to be very intriguing. She explained that each main character was filmed in a unique way that exaggerates the nature of their situation and personality.Evan was filmed in wide steady angles so that we could see him in the middle of his world. Long takes allow the viewer to experience the passing of time in his overwhelmingly lonely reality.Candy was always filmed lost in a tight frame between other people or objects to demonstrate how suffocated her character was. This certainly came across to me often times feeling stifled just watching it.Russ is a dark and mysterious character and the camera got this across by shooting him from a distance and obstructing the view. Russ is always lurking in the back of your mind from the moment you meet him. My first time seeing the film I was often left with a knot in my stomach after his scenes just from the feeling of dread that his persona left with me.I wholeheartedly believe that the cast chosen for this movie was beyond perfect. My congratulations go out to the production team for putting together such a successful band of talent. Evan Sneider is without a doubt the star and his portrayal of everything from kindness innocence longing hurt and anger left me breathless. He masterfully delivered some of the most impacting lines in the film.Shannon Woodward seems to be worn beyond her years as Candy. She presents the character as so lost and hopeless tired of life in general with little to cling to. There was a moment of having to return my mind to reality after the film when I had the pleasure of meeting Shannon sweet and vibrant and humble.Jackson Rathbone as Russ was absolutely haunting. From the moment you meet his character in the movie the hair on the back of your neck stands up and you just know he's nothing but trouble. All through the film he demonstrates time and time again that he is in a dark dark place. It is a testament to Jackson's talent as an actor that there are moments when you find yourself hurting for Russ and you feel conflicted about it. Jackson's mastery of Russ' facial expressions was what impressed me the most. In any scene you can see and hear what Russ is putting out there but see another emotion cross his face doubt revulsion with himself shame hurt. It is in these moments that you see the man behind the hard exterior the man that knows when he is doing wrong the man that feels emotions like anyone else.So much went into making this film as beautiful as it was and my review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the original score and soundtrack. The score was composed by the band 100 Monkeys whose members include Jerad Anderson and Jackson Rathbone both Girlfriend actors and producers M. Lawrence Abrams Ben Johnson and Ben Graupner. Its sound is raw and often times dark much like the story with subtle drones and dramatic crescendos that aided the suspense and anticipation prevalent throughout the movie. The soundtrack features well placed songs by talents such as Daniel Johnston and Spencer Bell. It is clear that everything from the cast the camera angles the dialogue and the music was chosen with the utmost care and attention and was to me a total success.I came away from the movie feeling that it was a very bold and very important film. It touches on so many themes prejudice necessity humanity abuse love. Seeing it twice wasn't enough and I feel such a strong desire for everyone in the world to get to see it now.I congratulate everyone involved on an amazing and touching film. It has important statements to make and I know that it will continue to make them as it wins the hearts of everyone that sees it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Girlfriend wasn't fully all that I had expected it to be. That being said don't get me wrong because it is not a bad movie far from it. Girlfriend is a beautifully told drama I had just initially expected a little bit more from it. Though it was good entertainment.The story in the movie is about Evan who has Down Syndrome living with his mom in a small town where he helps her out at a diner. One day his mom doesn't wake up in the morning as she usually does and Evan is left alone in a world where he is coming to terms with life around him and being in love with Candy a single mom who he went to high school with  but she is having issues with a former boyfriend and he is violent.Girlfriend is a beautifully told story about life and relationships that transcends beyond the usual shallow approach many of us actually have towards these matters whether we acknowledge it or not. It tells the story of an innocent youth with a heartfelt crush on a woman. And it tells the story of not being normal in the terms of what we as a society has branded as normal. It was a very moving story and it was nicely executed on the screen.The cinematography was just brilliant. Lots of great camera work here it was subtle but still so beautiful and there was some very emotional and symbolic images throughout the movie that was really brought to life by the great visionary eye of the camera crew.As for the acting well then I think they had some nice people on the list and newcomer to the movie industry Evan Sneider playing Evan really did a great job. Thumbs up on that. His performance was very natural and believable and it was charismatic and right on the money. But also the performance by Shannon Woodward playing Candy was quite good having good chemistry with Evan on the screen. Cast as the violent exboyfriend Russ was Jackson Rathbone and he was really well cast for that role he was very charismatic and acted out that role to perfection. Playing Evan's mom Celeste was Amanda Plummer who despite just having a supporting minor role in the movie really left a great impact on the rest of the movie even after her character died.If you like dramas that very well could have been taken straight out of our ordinary every day lives then you definitely should check out Girlfriend. It is a beautiful movie with a great story and a big heart. It is the type of movie that will stick with you for some time because it was just that beautiful.".

	schema:headline " Very Powerful";
	schema:reviewBody "Girlfriend is a film that I think really has a subtle power to it. The main character Evan has Downs Syndrome and yet this is never overtly a point of the film. It's his obstacle to love and one he has to deal with alone. SPOILER ALERTAdding to this loneliness is the fact that his mother passes away unexpectedly. Atmospheric and very well shot this small town story allows you in on Evan's story and his motivations for his actions. Unlike a lot of big budget films that leave you wondering nothing this movie stays with you and begs discussion. The film surprises you with the heart and warmth of the main character and how his struggle paints the struggles of other characters in the film. If you are at all jaundiced by current big budget fare and needing a jolt of real filmmaking check this film out. Justin Lerner is a director to watch and I'll be very interested to see the next film he makes.".

	onyx:emotionText "Girlfriend is a film that I think really has a subtle power to it. The main character Evan has Downs Syndrome and yet this is never overtly a point of the film. It's his obstacle to love and one he has to deal with alone. SPOILER ALERTAdding to this loneliness is the fact that his mother passes away unexpectedly. Atmospheric and very well shot this small town story allows you in on Evan's story and his motivations for his actions.

Which leads me to believe someone has a problem wthe film makers. It is insane this movie has such a low rating and pretty sad that IMDb would allow something so obvious to go on unnoticed.Now on to the movie. I won't go into specifics because it is sort of difficult to go that far into the details without spoiling  since part of the allure is in the flow of the movie. On the movie box it says mesmerizing. I felt the same way  I was waiting for it to happen  it being quite a few things. Some I guessed right some I guessed wrong some I didn't see coming at all. Some that I saw coming that did didn't come at the time. It's an unpredictable movie which I find appealing. The plot is pretty straight forward it's more about the direction. Where is this movie going  like waiting for a train wreck you KNOW is coming.The acting was great for the most part. I thought the diner manager was awful I could have read better lines and I have zero experience acting! He had like 2 lines in the movie and they stick out because they were so insincere. Maybe that was by design but I doubt it. The female lead does well she is conflicted and it shows and it is believable. All of the characters in this movie are flawed save for the child who from what I took away from the movie played a bigger role than it would seem. The lead actor with Down Syndrome does a fantastic job. I wouldn't say he had to act much. He was obviously very believable never did I feel he was being coached. It was a sincere performance one he clearly understood and at times his sincerity was touching. His reaction to situations no matter how tragic or good were very even  as a parent of a high functioning autistic it was dead on. Character development was acceptable. Not enough to where you care so deeply about one or two characters  I was more interested in seeing what was going to happen. Who is going to get what they deserve etc. I didn't get emotional at all and maybe that was the intention of the film maker. He could have easily gone that route. In the end there is a moral to the story certainly there is an innocence to it and it explores the vulnerabilities and imperfections in all of us  disabled or 'typical' we all have them. It also leaves you hopeful that beneath those flaws there is a natural good in all of us just as well.".

	schema:headline " Highly watchable WW2 drama";
	schema:reviewBody "If you have an interest in WW2 and especially movies related to that conflict this might make an interesting change from the usual Hollywood epics from the 60's. I had to see this having been impressed with 'The Battle on the River Neretva' another entertaining and well produced 70's film from the former Yugoslavia. I've also seen some poor Italian efforts that generally lack decent direction and are halfbaked cashins on the Hollywood epics they attempt to imitate there are a few decent ones. Like 'Neretva' you can tell this was made in a former communist country with an emphasis on the common struggle with sentiment sometimes contrived and also overbearing a little too much a few scenes are genuinely moving. However this is a story told with much truth and the braveness and courage of the Yugoslavian resistance to the Nazi's is nothing to mock. As a story it's a little too episodic but is nevertheless a gripping watch. What's impressive also is the budget involved you'd seriously struggle to find any WW2 movie with as many extras as this and 'Neretva' and the props vehicles weaponry etc are all excellent for this era. The direction is fine not exceptional the scenery is fantastic. Burton as Tito is pretty stiff he plays the man as if he were being portrayed in a propaganda description probably exactly what was required and the other actors are generally all good. Overall this is a highly entertaining film and deserves a better fate as it portrays one of the lesser known struggles of WW2. Not that easy to find here in the UK it was released on tape in the early 80's The fairly rare Videomedia label same as 'Neretva' with a bright decent quality slightly letterboxed print. Maybe a DVD will surface that's not just a rip from tape!! One fault with this UK release was the fact the subtitles are missing from the German speaking scenes a shame but it doesn't spoil the film too much.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw THE FIFTH OFFENSIVE recently weekend in Italian without subtitles I speak English cut to some 100 minutes to the review will be short but ought to give you an idea of what the film is like. Richard Burton plays Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito who leads the Yugoslav Partisans on a trek to safety culminating in a huge battle at the Sutjeska River. The film features a ton of familiar faces from familiar Hollywood actors to Yugoslav commoners. Bata Zivojinovic BATTLE OF THE EAGLES is one of the main partisans Milena Dravic THE BATTLE OF NERETVA is his love Ljubisa Samardzic THE BATTLE OF NERETVA commands an artillery gun Stole Arandjelovic blasts away with a machinegun in the final battle Relja Basic THE FIFTH DAY OF PEACE is one of the British commandos Gunter Meisner THE BRIDGE AT REMAGEN is the German General and Anton Diffring KILL ROMMEL! is his executive officer. Familiar names of Boris Dvornik Rade Markovic Kole Angelovski Petar Banicevic Marinko Sebez and Dusan Tadic are all credited but I have no idea who they play. The Partisan commander from BATTLE OF THE EAGLES features prominently in the second half of the film but I can't quite put my finger on which character he is.The film features a number of big battle scenes with a good number of extras a few Russian tanks plenty of explosions and some vintage aircraft. It's all set to a great rousing musical score made up of actual Partisan chants one of which was used for HELL RIVER a year later. One great combat scene has the partisans rushing up one side of a hill not knowing that on the other side the Germans are charging as well racing to capture the high ground first. A great handtohand battle ensues. There are also some rather graphic attackdog maulings thrown in for good measure. The scenery as with all Yugoslav war films is breathtaking. I saw this on a rip from an Italian video titled LA QUINTA OFFENSIVA. It was in Italian with no subtitles cut from 130 minutes to about 100 minutes. It was hard enough for me to follow in Italian even harder with so much footage cut. The colors are washed out and there is plenty of print damage ranging from flurries of speckles to scratches and many holes in the print. The panandscanning is bad in some very important dialog scenes too.Overall this looks to be a pretty good Yugoslav war picture better than usual. It's probably as good as THE BATTLE OF NERETVA but I'll have to see it in English before I can write a really strong review.RATING 710".

The battle scenes are pretty well made  although it's clearly the same 5 or 6 fighter planes that keep attacking the partisans throughout the whole movie. The movie's weakness is the characters !  the partisans are all heroes who die in the arms of their friends and lovers and the Germans are all Germans as we know them from so many Hollywood films  speaking german with an evil nazi accent and only thinking about vengeance and destruction they might as well be zombies or vampires!. We never really get to know anybody apart from general Tito who is portrayed as a saint he was still alive when the film was being made by Richard Burton the only star in the film. It is refreshing to see a WWII film where it's not american G.I's slaugtering nazi's. The heroes in this movie are communists with red stars on their caps fighting for their country. Too bad it's such a poor script there is a lot of goodwill here and it could have been a very exciting and different film about the dark years of Europe.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Axis gathered 127000 soldiers and over 300 airplanes against 18000 soldiers of Yugoslav National Liberation Armypartisans with only one goal to destroy partisan HQ and kill or capture the partisan leader Tito. I live in Bosnia that was part of Yugoslavia and here we used to take some things granted when it comes to WWII movies that were made in former Yugoslavia. Most of us who are now age 30 and above remember the history lessons from our schools when we had to learn all about the Axis offensives against partisans. Regarding Sutjeska the movie the first choice for director of this movie was Veljko Bulajic who directed the Battle of Neretva however he gave up on the project since he disagreed with the producers and even with Tito. Veljko Bulajic did not want to make a movie that would varnish the history and turn a partisan defeatboth moral and tactical into a total victory. Director of Sutjeska Stipe Delic acted as a craftsman and directed the movie as ordered by the regime. The photography in this movie is outstanding and most of scenes were shot at authentic locations. Characters are well played by at the time standard A class Yugoslav actors. Richard Burton plays Tito just for the sake of the foreign audiences. The battle scenes are very realistic and even up to modern standards and together with amazing scenery and already mentioned photography make this movie worth watching .The movie does show critical moments from the actual battle and is fair enough to show that escape of the partisan HQ was possible only if certain units whole partisan brigades were sacrificed to the Axis.It is true that breakthrough was made easier because certain partisan commanders disobeyed direct orders and kept antitank guns and mortars symbolically presented in this movie by characters played by Ljubisa Samardzic and his sidekick. Regarding the portrayal of the Axis soldiers in this movie it is realistic they are showed as the cold blooded sadistic killers and they actually got orders to behave like that before the battle. Again too bad that this movie lacks certain amount historical integrity and it could have been shot by more inspired director. Hence if you are to watch this movie consult Wikipedia search for Fifth enemy offensive or Sutjeska offensive get informed about real historical events and then press play on your remote control unit.".

As usual the story base upon the not to original good guybad guy idea. In this story the good thing is that it is not the US or English army that act as good guys  but the partisan army.

	schema:reviewBody "Good but not great sequel to the much slicker and more entertaining Battle of Neretva. This one has fewer international stars just Richard Burton as Tito ! Irene Papas in a throwaway role and a few recognizable German actors like Gunter Meissner and Anton Diffring. The bulk of the cast are Yugoslavian actors many of whom were also in Neretva but I assume played different characters one guy got shot at least 5 times by a Chetnik in Neretva but here he seems just fine. It's not exactly a sequel but presents the logical next big event after the Neretva battle and the cinematographer and military supervisors are the same.The Pro's Lots of breathtaking scenery in the highaltitude national parks of the Balkans which are historically where a lot of the battle really took place. The music by Mikis Theodorakis Serpico is excellent. There are numerous battle scenes with lots of pyrotechnics... around a dozen German planes flying in formation the air attacks are the high points and 3 mockup Tiger tanks though obviously T34s underneath. Good sincere performances on the part of most of the actors.The Con's Burton seems to sleepwalk through his performance it's so congratulatory to the glory of Tito who was still alive at the time this movie was made that it's dullasdishwater to watch. He has no personality or character beyond an obsession for taking care of the wounded. The directing is barely adequate with a lot of the dialog flatly staged and uninteresting. The scope is a lot less comprehensive the Italians and NDH are barely alluded to. The final battle is a ridiculous steamroll over the evil but inept Germans.Here comes to one of my pet peeves in war movies idiotic portrayal of the German army. They are more like zombies than soldiers marching forward firing 'Revolutionary War'style with no semblance of tactics involved. And when their comrades die the other soldiers continue walking like nothing happened and their strong points don't seem too terribly well or enthusiastically defended. Although the officers are played by Germans the bulk of the enlistees look very Slavic and it's hard to forget that you're watching Yugoslavians play Germans.The English version curiously has the Germans speaking dubbed German but not subtitled... which nearly spoils possibly the best scene in the movie where the Germans kill a Partisan's son he lost all 4 of his others previously in the fighting. One soldier raises his MP40 to kill the father but then his slylooking NCO holds him back and says something to the fact like let him live it's worse punishment for him. That scene for me made it all worthwhile. However the English version is missing the scene where the Germans massacre the 6000 mostly wounded Partisans that Tito left behind.Would be a nice DVD to pick up but only if uncut and widescreen.".

Primarily he is moving between three general time periods and locations. The first is his stint as a GI during WWII when as a pacifist he was acting as a Chaplain's assistant for his unit. This time is largely as a POW where he was in Dresden the day of the bombing spending it with among others an older compassionate GI named Edgar Derby and a brash loudmouth GI named Paul Lazzaro. The second is his life as an optometrist in Ilium in upstate New York eventually married to the wealthy and overbearing Valencia Merble and having two offspring Robert who would spend his teenaged years as a semidelinquent and Barbara who would end up much like her mother.

	schema:reviewBody "I give this film a 7 out of 10.It makes an eloquent statement about how traumatic moments in our life stay with us as if it just happened yesterday'.   What makes this film so appealing is how it depicts what would happen if you could jump around your entire life.  When the future influences the past  it takes on a great significance.   Billy Pilgrim is a humdrum Optometrist who nevertheless has an exciting life  surviving the bombing of Dresden in WW2  living through a plane crash and being transported to another planet.   Yet he maintains to be humble.   As we follow Billy's life  the portrait of mediocre America is a touching contrast to the other moments that are frightening.   He knows how he will die  and in the process becomes unafraid to live life to it's fullest.   The inhabitants of the planet Tralfamador ?? say it is best to concentrate on the good moments in your life  and not so much on the bad. But they are still there  and you cannot erase that moment of your life. In essence  the true moral of this film is to accept all that has happened in your life.  For if you don't  you deny the validity of your existence. When Billy finally writes about his adventures  others have a chance to learn about the world and themselves that would've otherwise been denied.Technically  the film uses the moments where Billy jumps in time as meaningful transitions.   It interweaves lessons learned from one part of his life and applies it to the present moment whenever that is.   The film's real treasures are the supporting characters that surround Billy. It also vividly transports you to WW2  a semiautobiographical account of Kurt Vonnegut's real life experiences in Dresden.   The film is filled with anecdotes that present the film's other main theme  that life is indeed ironic.I was deeply touched by this film  with it's ability to whisk you from scenes of horror to amusing Kodak moments'.     The music poignantly represents these transitions  and helps to carry the film.    In the end you can accept his death  by having lived his life.".

	schema:reviewBody "The realization of this glimpse into the mind's eye of a man unstuck in time is brilliant to behold.  Yes the book is a brilliant work in its own right and open to interpretation as a truly complex work must be.  The movie is not the book.  It is Hill's interpretation of the book and a brilliant and viable one it is.  Hill won the best Director Oscar the next year with The Sting.  He later filmed the similarly unfilmable World According To Garp and also did a brilliant job with it partially by letting go of John Irving's more depressing side.  Other notable credits include Butch Cassidy... and The Great Waldo Pepper.  Michael Sacks in his first movie and only starring role at the tender age of 24 is completely convincing and natural.  He is equally effective compelling and believable at the six distinct stages of Pilgrim's life memorialized herein.  If he weren't up to the sixinone role the film wouldn't work but he is and it does.  I wonder why he has no other major credits and ceased acting altogether in 1984.  If anyone knows please email me.Valerie Perrine is fine as Montana Wildhack.  The other characters are all played for maximum irony and effect and the cast delivers beautifully without exception.  Eugene Roche is the epitome of kindness as Edgar Derby the yin to Ron Liebman's yang a twisted ball of anger named Paul Lazaro. John Dehner is brilliant as a warhawk professor upset at the Vietnam protesters.  His character would be as appropriate amidst today's global conflagration as it was in 1966.  Lucille Benson Kevin Conway Sorrell Booke Holly Near Richard Schaal and Perry King are the more familiar names in a uniformly excellent cast including the German actors.The musical score is also perfect both in tone and substance.  Vonnegut is a master of superimposing satire over irony over futility.  The movie does a marvelous job of blending these contrasts and making its audience feel enriched.  The music underscores all of these contrasts.  The cinematography also is magnificent.Searching desperately for something to say to show that the movie cannot be 100 perfect the only thing I can come up with is that the pacing of the movie drags slightly when the soldiers leave the first camp for Dresdner until their new Kommandant gives his welcoming speech.  It might have played better with about three minutes cut from that sequence.  So what?I recently saw Slaughterhouse Five for the fifth time in 27 years since I originally saw it at my college campus  this time on DVD.  I never fail to catch something new and I never fail to enjoy it all the more.Given how many 70's movies have failed miserably to withstand the test of time Slaughterhouse Five is a true treat to be savored.".

The actor who played Billy Pilgrim captured Billy's passive calm and vaguely antisocial demeanor. Lazarro Montana and Billy's wife are also well played. George Roy Hill had a knack for directing movies made from great books  e.g. The World According to Garp  and in the end I was pleasantly surprised how well this movie turned out. As far as the Vonnegut adaptations go I know of four  this one Mother Night Breakfast of Champions and the godawful Slapstick this one is the best of the bunch. I've always wanted to see a movie version of Sirens of Titan but it'll probably never happen  so Slaughterhouse Five is my only chance to see Trafalmadore. Recommended to any true Vonnegut fans.

This is probably the only Vonnegut novel to make the transition to the screen as a movie that more than a handful of people are willing to watch. And they watch it again and again. I am reminded of Voltaire lovers who enjoy Leonard Bernstein's Candide. This seems to be the best of all possible Vonnegut movies.There is a wealth of trivia associated with the cast. Michael Sacks disappeared into obscurity. Sharon Gans joined a community theater company that seemed more like a cult. Holly Near became a feminist folksinger. Valerie Perrine would later give a great performance as Honey Bruce in Bob Fosse's Lenny. Perry King and Ron Liebman became minor stars.The story is largely allegorical. It is not sciencefiction. Vonnegut is coping with the trauma of World War II particularly the horrors he witnessed during the firebombing of Dresden. Billy Pilgrim's emotional numbness and alientation are characteristic of combat fatigue or post traumatic stress. Despite the lack of a chronological plot Billy Pilgrim's arc is linear. To the uninitiated being unstuck in time can be confusing. It's sort of like one's first encounter with hypertext. Perhaps that's why the movie is better on the second or third viewing. The key to enjoying Slaughterhouse Five is to focus on the best scenes and performances  much like Billy Pilgrim's advice on living.".

There always seems to be an element of tragic waste in his characters' lives and never is the feeling more evident than in the book and film of SlaugherhouseFive.  It's not surprising to learn that Vonnegut really did live through the firebombing of Dresden during World War II.If there's a weak element of the film it's the bombing itself.  By never letting the audience see outside the bomb shelter Pilgrim was in and if so not making it vivid enough for me to remember it the horror and sheer magnitude of the event is downplayed.  Two hundred thousand people died in the destruction of one of the greatest most majestic cities in all of Europe and all we're given is a shaking camera.  Those who've read the book know that the trajedy was conveyed all to well by Vonnegut's skillful nearphotographic descriptions of the event and its aftermath.  Very little of it made it to the screen.Aside from that George Roy Hill does an excellent job of communicating the existential dread of what must have been thought to be an unfilmable novel. The fate of Pilgrim's wife through her reckless driving could have come off as tasteless black comedy but any cheap laughs are thankfully avoided and the sequence is as shocking as it is heartbreaking.  The really farout parts of the novel the fourdimensional aliens Vonnegut's conception of the future and the end of the universe are done with complete seriousness another director might have had a condescending approach to the material and killed the magic.  The novel by itself is one of the best I've ever read  it gleefully trashes the rules of standard novelmaking narration and continuity and manages to tell a real whale of a tale there's a lot of weird stuff to swallow in it.  When I saw Hill credited as director I moaned in agony recalling the headaches that were induced by his smug syrupy box office smashes Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting.  After those two I gave up all hope in Hill the same way I did with Richard Lester after Petulia and Help!  By the end of the movie however I ate my words.  It's a beautiful thoughtprovoking and enchanting film and does justice to a fine novel.".

	schema:headline " Vonnegut's Classic Through Roy Hill's Lens";
	schema:reviewBody "The film Slaughterhouse 5 is a brilliantly portrayed interpretation of a great but typically multilinear novel by science fiction author Kurt Vonnegut. With all due respect to the literary critics sci fi really is what Vonnegut most often wrote  whether or not it is viewed as allegory or even 'serious literature'. As such it was not really made to convey the same messagesnor even the aesthetics of the book but rather to convey the director's and others on the creative team impressions of the book.The book is also brilliant but none of Vonnegut's work is easily adapted to the medium of film. Not quite the task Cronenberg took on when he directed Burrough's Naked Lunch but very similar in method.S5 exposes us to the life of Billy Pilgrim Michael Sacks and his many loves his dog spot his wife played by Holly Near and an actress played by Valerie Perrine as he either blacks out and travels into the deep recesses of his memory experiencing the delusion of time travel or as indicated by his occasional leaps forward in time he actually has become 'unstuck in time.' Between trips back to Dresden during its WWII bombing and trips forward to the planet Tralfamador it seems that Billy is constantly tripping. Yet he manages to build a successful and very normal American life despite his bizarre and uncontrollable timetravel habit. The film illustrates the nonlinear manner in which the book is written by skipping from time to time in a seemingly random manner but it manages to do so without losing focus on Pilgrim who is in fact always living in the present regardless of what time he happens to be experiencing. Fantastic directoral method!The film makes a lot of subtle simple and very good points by making Billy  a quiet simple guy with an extraordinary set of circumstances in his life  a true hero simply because he is relatively nice somewhat aloof happy and quite normal. Sacks' performance is spoton.This film is beautifully photographed very well paced perfectly directed and edited. The acting is all quite good and comes from a well appointed cast mostly consisting of character actors. I was particularly impressed with Eugene Roche's excellent portrayal of Edgar Derby.Highly recommended for the arthouse crowd and friends of intelligent sci fi.".

As such I strongly urge people to READ THE BOOK before you see this movie. A great many points are left unexplained to the viewer assuming they have read Vonneguts version. As I read it beforehand the movie didn't insult my intelligence by putting Vonneguts ideas in plain view. Instead it relies faithfully on the viewers interpretations not unlike the book.

As of this writing I've never actually read the book but this movie seems to capture the gist of things. It's a very strange surrealist story that chronicles a man's life and death through a series of random timejumps. The man was a prisoner in WWII and the actual slaughterhouse was his residence before raising a dysfunctional family afterwards and then being abducted by aliens. Yep strange stuff indeed.The film will be most memorable for the rough and dirty war scenes the sporadic family outbursts and the scenes on Tralfamadore. Parts of it drag a little but there's enough interesting scenes to pull the film together and maintain interest especially for fans of scifi war movies or bizarre cinema in general.I have no idea how close of an adaptation this movie is to the book but on its own merits the film does an interesting job of using its random narrative structure to show the character at the different phases of his life really it shows somewhere between three to five different narrative strings at once. Some scenes run into each other with characters in one timeline finishing off dialogue from another or scenes mirroring each other so that they're intercut together. It makes the film run as one long and smooth stream of consciousness while exploring the character's life memories and psyche in full. In a way you probably could interpret this whole film as the memories memoirs and dreams of a man who's either mentally insane or dead.If there's anything to complain about it's just the sheer randomness of the story for even with its constant focus on the main character it never settles on any specific plot structure or tangible form.The film has quality photography and really excellent editing. Acting is a bit overthetop but it gets the job done really well and the writing is not bad. This production has finelooking sets props and costumes. Music is not bad either.For bringing a literary classic to life the film is worthwhile seeing. As random and strange as it is I'd recommended some caution rent it and see what you think for yourself.45 Entertainment Pretty Good  Story Good  Film Good".

There is nothing allegorical it. The parts set in WWII are realistic and are directly based on Kurt Vonnegut's wartime experiences as a prisoner of war in Nazi Germany's Dresden safe deep below ground while the city was firebombed at the end of the war resulting in more damage and casualties than Hiroshima and arguably with a lot less purpose.Being unstuck in time is a great description for the way our brains really work most of the time  at any one moment reflecting on a particular childhood afternoon during 6th grade or reliving an argument or love scene from the night before or fantasizing an imagined future. Then the street light changes and for that instant at least you're back on Second Avenue looking both ways for traffic...This movie's great achievement is to mix up stories from WWII the present and an imagined or if you prefer extraterrestrial and mildly pornographic future in an amusing and bittersweet way and in way that makes psychological and dramatic sense. The most awful things cannot be confronted directly think about Sauron in the Lord of the Rings who is all the more horrible because we never hear him directly  his voice is issues only from proxies. For Vonnegut the horrors of Dresden were impossible to write about in a completely direct way which makes the movie's structure not only fun but also deeply right. As to the acting Michael Sacks is great as Billy Pilgrim and Eugene Roche great as Edgar Derby but Valerie Perrine despite having less screen time as Montana Wildhack practically steals the show. Gorgeous charming luscious perfect! What Tramfalmadorian for hubba! hubba!?Charles".

Vonnegut shaped and molded Billy from nothing and Hill and Geller do the same with Sacks. He's such a perfect blank slate. That's not saying he gives a bad performance. On the contrary he's excellent and extremely believable. The film is harrowing yet funny tragic yet comic. Eugene Roche Sharon Gans as Billy's high strung and inept wife and Rob Liebman costar and they're terrific. Valerie Perrine is undeniably sexy as Montana Wildhack and Lucille Benson has a funny cameo as Billy's clueless mother.

	schema:headline " A problem film for those unfamiliar with the book";
	schema:reviewBody "Kurt Vonnegut has had little luck with the translation of his vision to the wide screen.  His style and subjects rarely lend themselves easily to linear filmmaking and this adaptation of his bestknown novel points up the problems inherent with that fact.  A viewer who has never read the book will be hopelessly lost almost from the beginning as the story line is told from the point of view of a man who has come unstuck in time.  This conceit where the hero has no control over the order in which he experiences his life while used to stunning effect in the book can make for a very muddled FILM and here sadly the final product can't be excused for its fidelity to the spirit of the novel. Technically this film has some high points.  The cinematography and designs are excellent capturing the desolation of Europe engaged in WWII and the isolation of the foot soldier fighting that war as well as recreating the feel of a bygone time and place.  The casting of this film is an eclectic mix with Michael Sacks giving a convincing if not memorable performance in the role of Billy Pilgrim.  Sharon Gans is wonderful as his overweight and overwrought wife.  Ron Liebman provides manic talent here as the hero's main antagonist and Valerie Perrine demonstrates her lack of acting talent beautifully ironically playing a talentless actresscenterfold model and the object of Pilgrim's more prurient desires. Having seen this film on both the big and small screens I can say that little is lost in the shrinkage.Rating 6.510".

I equate Pilgrim's good fortune to Vonnegut's mildly sarcastic view that there is more good than bad in the world.Good is on trial here as well.  The goodness of the Allies is questioned when Billy endures the firebombing of Dresden.  He suffers for it throughout his life as did Vonnegut.However despite its weirdness this film elevates man.  This film triumphs the human condition and picques our minds to think.  Billy Pilgrim's kindness and thoughtfulness is reminiscent of Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird.".

	schema:headline " Turgid adaptation of the Vonnegut classic drains the story of its creativity wit and dynamism";
	schema:reviewBody "SlaughterhouseFive begins with a man Billy Pilgrim Michael Sacks typing on a sheet of paper that he has become unstuck in time. He's caught in a time warp causing him to shift back and forth without warning to different points in his life. This premise sounds a lot more interesting than what the movie delivers. Is he calling out for help? We can't tell. The movie never lets us in on Pilgrim's reaction to what's happening. We don't know if he's upset scared perplexed happy bemused or anything. We are simply shown various points in life connected in odd ways. One moment he's a POW in World War II threatened by German soldiers who are about to shoot him the next he's at his wedding and people are shooting him with a camera.The problem is this looks more like a narrative device and not a particularly original one at that than evidence of time travel. It's more like a story told out of order than a story about a man caught in a time warp. Sure something weird is going on whenever he appears to remember the future like when his younger self starts addressing his future wife and a fellow soldier standing there thinks Pilgrim is propositioning him. But the film has relatively few such moments and we can't help thinking that what we're seeing is simply the perspective of an older man experiencing flashbacks a distinct possibility considering that we later learn that the older Pilgrim had a nervous breakdown.I tend to enjoy movies with fractured storylines of this sort because the task is not merely to see events unfold but to piece together what has already happened. Unfortunately this movie lacks a narrative focus. Pilgrim seems a very ordinary fellow and the movie never explains what makes his life story worth telling. Nothing about him is particularly attractive or particularly repulsive either. He's just bland. We see him as a POW where one soldier has an inexplicably passionate grudge against him while another befriends him. There will be some tragedy some bombings and some killings along the way. By flipping forwards and backwards in time the movie struggles to make all this engaging because it all comes off rather tame for a war movie. An account of the bombing of Dresden is filmed with surprisingly little emotional power. There's a lack of thematic focus in these scenes they seem to be there only to provide biographical information about this character without actually contributing to the movie's larger purpose.The later scenes are all over the map. There is even a Hollywoodstyle car wreckage sequence that probably cost more to film than anything else in the movie including the scenes on Planet Tralfamadore. This bit of broad comedy feels out of place in the mostly contemplative story and brings the movie to a grinding halt.The movie's messagethat time is static that everything which happens is inevitable and that one's task in life should be to cherish the good moments rather than try to control what happensis provocative enough. But the film lacks the grace and elegance that allowed Vonnegut's book to bring this message alive. Take for example the book's description of an attractive woman as a sensational invitation to make babies. The book abounds with playful wry prose of this sort that reinforces Vonnegut's mechanistic outlook on life. The story at its core is a philosophical argument but Vonnegut prevents it from becoming dry and academic which I cannot quite say about the film.In the book the timetripping never feels like a mere narrative device it feels like it's really happening. Even though there's still a distinct possibility that the experience is occurring only in Pilgrim's mind it at least comes off as an actual experience. Pilgrim in the book is oddly calm and resigned to what's occurring but not emotionless. He cries at one point. He's anxious about the situation. He's unsure about how to define himself. In the movie we get none of the sense of Pilgrim struggling to adapt to the situation of being forced to grow as a result.I found when reading the book that the disparate sections of the story connected a lot better. The war scenes were there not only because they allowed Vonnegut to insert semiautobiographical material into the novel but because they tied into the story's questions about human existence dwelling as they did on the moral dilemma underlying the bombing of Dresden. Being caught in an eternal time warp Pilgrim doesn't fear death. But he doesn't really value life either. He shows no love for his rich wife described in the book as fat and plain though played in the movie by an actress who was neither of those things but who still utters the lines about thinking nobody would marry her and promising her husband she'd go on a diet. He shows no love for anyone indeed even himself. So we're left to ponder whether his liberation from the human time scale is really desirable.The movie unfortunately can't seem to portray his apathy without also making us feel apathetic. When I watched the movie I was repeatedly tempted to turn it off in the middle because I simply didn't find the story engaging. The book on the other hand I could not put down. I suppose the difference with the book besides its witty prose is that I found myself able to show concern even for a character who had lost sight of that very concept. Vonnegut understood better than the movie did that the glimpse we get of life on a cosmic scale does not take away our essential humanity.".

Still I think George Roy Hill and Stephen Geller did a good job. They included the most important conclusions of the novel and got the feel right with indications of humor and cynicism. Of course the movie can in no way substitute the book which is an essential read anyway but it's helping you visualize Vonnegut's story. The director gloriously avoided relying on special effects that would have looked dated by now. There's a plane crash aliens and the destruction of a whole city but we never actually see any of it. The mayhem of Dresden is shown through a comparison of the beautiful city before and after the bombing and not by having buildings collapse or people die so it goes. I think war captivity in Germany was portrayed as an almost innocent carefree time which it definitely wasn't but maybe Hill felt that this was necessary to show how unnecessary and brutally exaggerated this attack was.

The fact that Billy Pilgrim is unhinged in time is integral to the plot as well as the concept. Valerie Perrine's nudity is merely a plus.".

	schema:reviewBody "On December 22 1944 during the sixth day of the Battle of the Bulge Kurt Vonnegut Jr. a 22yearold battalion scout with the 423rd Regiment 106th Infantry Division was captured along with 7000 of his comrades by advancing German panzer forces. As a P.O.W. he was subsequently sent to Dresden the Florence on the Elbe. Though the city an ancient cultural center had no military installations or air defenses the Allied High Command decided to firebomb it presumably as payback for the German bombing of Coventry earlier in the war. In three separate air raids on February 1314 1945 ironically Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday hundreds of RAF and USAAF bombers dropped more than 700000 phosphorous bombs on Dresden's 1.2 million defenseless civilians its population nearly doubled by refugees fleeing Breslau just ahead of the Russians. The resulting firestorm reaching temperatures nearing 3000 degrees Fahrenheit obliterated 1600 acres in the center of the city and incinerated more than 135000 people. One of only seven Allied POWs in Dresden to survive the bombing Vonnegut was assigned to corpse recovery and burial detail. The overwhelming horror he experienced in Dresden would haunt him for the rest of his life indelibly coloring his view of life and all his work as a fiction writer. Indeed the trauma of Dresden was so great that Vonnegut could not write about it directly for more than twenty years. After returning to Dresden on a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967 Vonnegut finally wrote 'SlaughterhouseFive Or The Children's Crusade A DutyDance with Death' Delacorte 1969 a powerful fatalistic antiwar novel that blends fact fiction and science fiction in inimitable Vonnegut fashion. Though a critically acclaimed National Book Award winner and a bestseller 'SlaughterhouseFive' also garnered considerable controversy allegedly for its frank language and sexual references but more probably because it contradicted the established mythology of WWII as The Good War by focusing on an irrefutable Allied war crime of truly monstrous proportions. Three years after the novel's publication director George Roy Hill 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' brought out a film version scripted by novelistscreenwriter Stephen Geller 'Pretty Poison' that is remarkably faithful to the literary text. The movie stars Michael Sacks as Billy Pilgrim a passive mildmannered optometrist of Illium Ithaca NYVonnegut attended Cornell New York who somehow becomes unstuck in time i.e. he spontaneously finds himself bouncing between past present and future moments of his life. The signal event of his past is of course the Dresden firebombing. In some other moment Billy is abducted by a race of space aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore where he is studied and then compelled to mate and have a child with Montana Wildhack Valerie Perrine another kidnapped earthling who just happens to be a voluptuous movie star. Absurd as it sounds the abrupt jumping between these three scenariosDresden postwar suburban America and another planetallows book and film to evocatively represent the Dresden atrocity satirize the emptiness of postwar American consumer culture and philosophize about war human nature and the meaning of life in general. A moderate hit at the box officedespite going headtohead with 'The Godfather''SlaughterhouseFive' won the Jury Prize at Cannes but received no Oscar nominations. Usually disappointed with film adaptations of his work Kurt Vonnegut judged George Roy Hill's film an artistic success. VHS 1998 and DVD 2004.".

What is curious about Pilgrim is that he is aware of his Past and future as they happen and before. In his most prevalent episode he is a prisoner during World War Two where a most ardent antagonist Paul Lazzaro Ron Leibman takes an instant dislike to Pilgrim and wrongly believes he caused an American G.I.'s death. Another prisoner Edgar Derby Eugene Roche tries to explain why and offers Pilgrim a great deal of life's philosophies which Pilgrim already knows but can't stop the progression. While his past is in progress Pilgrim is content to spend time in his future where a beautiful woman named Montana Wildhack Valerie Perrine and he have been brought together for the purpose of mating.

I have actually lost all hope of people choosing wisely and making good suggestions on films...Hollywood has made a science out of aiming for the lowest common denominator anyway and making trillions.It would be great if we could comment comment on an existing review at imd such as the one by some licensed clinical psychologist which has been been chosen as spotlight review. Now this fella in all his psychotherapeutic wisdom acts like a 5 year old and takes this film literally and passes judgment on Gere's character's psychiatric practices. Is he nuts? It's a damn film for Christ's sake and a neo noir!!! Of course the shrink will cross the boundaries with his patients and act unprofessionally and needily he's supposed to be setting up a drama. Let alone that these things ALSO happen in real life. Drama's are not set up by shrinks who act according to AMA rules and psychiatric ethics. To pass judgment on the film on such grounds is like saying that Dumbo is not supposed to fly because elephants don't. PLEASE IMDb take this review off the front pageit's insulting.OK. on with the review THIS IS A GREAT NEO NOIR FILM ACTUALLY IT'S PROBABLY THE BEST NEO NOIR AND ONE OF THE BEST CRIMESUSPENSELOVE DRAMA FILMS I VE WATCHED. Why? The plot is intelligent it has plenty of twists and surprisingly very few holes in it that ANY neo noir or crime thriller for that matter even David Mammet is going to have. Even the more clever viewers are going to miss some of the twists and they won't see them coming. But anyway most here complained that it went to fast for them...may I suggest they use a staple of the modern DVDblue rayVCR the pause button and reflect in the interim pause...The script is also highly emotionally charged. Of course that's happening within the confines of its genre it's not a film heavy on realism but provided you abide by the codes of the noir there's plenty of pain here shame longing distrust antagonism hate love friendship not only involving the main characters but every single minor character too. It's also very NUANCED which I suspect is why the film warrants the this film sucks comment gracing the boards.All characters are very conflicted very human you can't pin them down to a simpleton archetype the good doc the manipulative patient say because they all have their blind spots and conflicts. I am sure a lot of people will hate this why's the script writer messing about he or she should be acting in this a to b to c predictable way. Yet this is what makes the film so great far better than the Hitchkokian bore it alludes to.THE CAST IS ALSO GREAT EVERYONE. They all nail down their roles to the tee. And then you have the main trio Richard Gere and Kim Basinger in their prime and Uma Thurman in one of her budding roles. What else does one want from the lead roles in film? First of all they are all stunning. Now that might not mean much to most in and it doesn't mean anything to me either most of the time but these three are not just good looking they are gifted. They all have a once in thirty years in film charm to them. Seriously folks has their been a more charming lead than the good Buddhist Richard Gere after Brando and maybe coming close to him Mickey Roorke and Johny Depp. Who? Mat f. Damon? Gere has such a tender yet tough face I won't do him justice describing his charisma here in a small review. Anyone who's got eyes can see. And so is Kim I rewatched the film recently and after all the Scarlett Johansens and Kate Hudsons we 've seen recently you can tell that Hollywood has dropped the ball big time... look at the nineties they had Kim and Madeleine Stowe and Jessica Lange and and and...this are dirt poor times wrt to actresses' talent.Kimmie is just fantastic here the tone of her voice the understated performance she oozes charm with a mere glance. He chemistry with Mr. Gere is like hand and glove too. And she's a way way underrated actress. This girl is up there with the top stars of the 40s 50s and 60s she's a Marilyn. She plays a very complex character here and there's not a single scene where she's not mesmerizing...An all too brief nod for no other reason than brevity for this review to Uma and the rest of the cast I ll just say that the scenes with Uma on the couch have such a suspenseful and seductive mood the way she phrases her dream and looks at the shrink Uma another natural talent.I also really liked the directing here but the 1000 word limit calls. I loved the motifs the lighthouse the promise of love the chance that love and truth above all can undo the damage the remorseless nature of damage being done and perpetuated. Those who've watched the film will know what I mean and I am not giving anything away to those who haven't. Last but not least I find George Fenton's score excellent a really intricate part of the whole film. Maybe it could have been a bit more risky and less classic but I think this austerity and measured portions of predictability and inventiveness only add to this very classy and elegant film which to me is a lost gem.".

Dr Barr goes off the rails spectacularly when he gets involved with Heather and breaches the rules of his profession without any apparent concern.Kim Basinger and Uma Thurman are both good as the treacherous and devious sisters and Eric Roberts is especially effective as the vicious and fiercely jealous victim.This glamorous thriller is well written with some very quotable lines and is extremely easy of the eye. It's thoroughly absorbing great fun to watch and should be regarded as essential viewing for all neonoir fans.".

I have already stated and I will again say that if this movie is a rehash it was a very good and effective one. I will not give away much about the plot because the less you know the better . Basically a psychiatrist called Isaac Bahr Richard Gere is treating an enigmatic girl called Diana Uma Thurman . Meanwhile he meets her beautiful sister Heather Kim Basinger to talk about the family history but due to mutual attraction it is inevitable that they soon hit the sheets . Unfortunately their affair puts them both in jeopardy since Heather is married to a dangerous gangster called Jimmy Eric Roberts . You can never guess what is going to happen next since the script has many plot twists marvellously executed and not for impression like in Wild Things  . Just when you think that the movie is over something happens and here we go again . I will have to tell you that I have seen the film 6 or so times and even I know the plot 's surprises I am still enthrilled . Why ? Because of the powerful characters and the noirish direction . Eric Roberts and Kim Basinger are beyond adequate and memorable . Richard Gere is a very underrated actor and here he gives one of his best performance . Do not listen to cynical comments that he will never convince you as a psychiatrist and his choise is utterly unrealistic . Baywatch appears only thin and well shaped bodies as swimmers on the beaches but the truth is that 50  of USA people are fat so I believe that there has to be at least one shrink with good looks somewhere  I also read comments from a prof who says that a REAL shrink would never do this ...or that ... etc . If this is accurate and if everyone worked as a prof we would live in a perfect society . It is so stupid saying that a prof would never sleep with a patient or discuss his sessions with others . Then no doctor would commit abortions  right ? Anyway it is probably Uma Thurman who steals the show as the mysterious Diana . She was a right choice for a disordered person since she has the blurr disorientated look on her eyes . Beyond the acting the characters are well written . The script has good lines . The cinematography and the music play a crucial part for the film noir atmosphere . It is a very good try and definately worths a look from thriller fans .FINAL ANALYSIS           8.5  10".

You ought to see them rutting around like two sea lions in heat. If that isn't disgusting I don't know what is. The scene's only redeeming feature is that Kim Basinger isn't particularly modest. The two were my supporting players in the tasteful and artistic No Mercy and I had to practically carry them through the movie. Basinger lamentably is married to one of those narcissistic madly possessive CircumMediterranean gangsters who has muscles all over his body as well as inside his head. This is Eric Roberts in his perfect evil greaseball mode. He dominates Basinger and makes her do humiliating sexual things which is perhaps his one good idea before she bashes his head in with one of his own dumb bells. It seems she suffers from pathological intoxication. One sip of alcohol and she becomes violently psychotic and she had innocently sipped some alcoholbased cough medicine just before the homicide. Gere helps her shape her defense brings in his friend Paul Guilfoyle to serve as her lawyer and she gets off with a not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Thereafter it gets twisted.A little too twisted if you ask me. By the end I could hardly tell who was who or what was what.It's pretty thrilling all the way through. It's just that it doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense. Thurman's character begins in cahoots with her sister then betrays her then helps her escape from the funny farm then takes over her identity and murderous quirks. Why? It would take more than a shrink to determine that. It would require a mind reader or maybe a rabidly commercial screenwriter.It's nicely acted and the location photography is picturesque  San Francisco at its most glorious the Golden Gate Bridge is in every other shot.But it's cheap too. The director uses every clich in the book regardless of whether they fit together. The climax at the top of a light house has the railing collapsing and Gere dangling over the crashing breakers  in a howling electrical storm the likes of which Point Reyes has never seen. The fulsome orchestral score belongs to the genus Slasher.And as I say the plot is dizzying and at times makes no sense. Okay. Basinger is accused of murder which she has in fact committed. The only question is whether a condition called pathological intoxication exists or not. The prosecution calls an expert witness a haughty woman psychiatrist with a bony face and a foreign accent. She declares that the condition does not exist except in the minds of defense counsels. Why doesn't she believe there is any such thing? Because there is no physical evidence. It doesn't show up in brain scans or blood tests she points out. An experienced defense attorney would have jumped all over her and asked if there were any physical evidence that schizophrenia exists. There isn't but nobody can deny that the condition is real.Anyway in a sense it's an exciting movie and soothing too watching clich follow clich while common sense flies out the window. Kind of a ritualistic experience like listening to a meaningless but reassuringly familiar pop tune.".

The way the story is told you do not even highly suspect that anything is wrong until it comes out. The plot twists and turns are enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. This is the kind of movie Alfred Hichcock would have made had he still been living in 1992. At one point the background looks like it is straight out of Vertigo. The music score even sounds like Bernard Herrmann. This is a very entertaning suspense thriller that The Master would have been proud of and I'm shure many will find entertaning.

	schema:headline " Some promising elements but sinks under character and story flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie has some promising elements. There is a premeditated murder plot with some intricacy twists and atmosphere. Kim Basinger is good playing a beautiful mystery woman with a troubled past and an exotic violent illness pathological intoxication. She conveys soft placid if overly simple beauty one minute and psychotic rage the next rivaling Catherine ZetaJones' in Traffic in her ability to turn memorably driven tough and hardhearted on a dime.Uma Thurman looks and acts her slight part adequately enough as Basinger's delicate spacedout sister a patient of Richard Gere. Paul Guilfoyle hams it up as a boorish criminal defense lawyer pal of Gere's. A police detective is tough crude and menacing on cue barking at Gere Don't yank my dick.But the film collapses under the weight of its many flaws. Gere is completely unconvincing as an eminent psychiatrist. This has less to do with how he looks than how the movie presents him. He never says or does anything to credibly establish such a character. His attempts seem limited to occasionally speaking in jargon or hushed tones. He appears gullible and ignorant as when it takes someone else's lecture to tip him off by chance to a colorful passage in Freud's work that is key to the criminal's scheme even one of the plotters had expected Gere to be familiar with it. His supposedly joking answer to Basinger that as a psychiatrist he simply repeats as a question whichever last two words his patient speaks  'Your mother?'  hits a little too close to home. It is a truer description of how Gere comes across here than he thinks. Nor does the film give any background that might help explain the personal vulnerability that makes him such a dupe. The character is little more than a dim steady facial expression and a resume.Thurman's character amounts to no more than a stagey plot gimmick. She never comes alive as a real person with a real relationship to anyone. The prosecutor is played with gruff style and no substance by Harris Yulin. He is given so little to say and do and the character accomplishes so little if anything that I could not even find him listed in the credits.Even worse is the Eric Roberts character Basinger's intense husband with mob ties. It is a tired superficial trying caricature that drags the movie down to the level of countless lowbudget ripoff romantic thrillers. The unoriginal character and portrayal recall cinematic gems like Play Murder for Me and Dead On both with Tracy Scoggins Tryst with Barbara Carrera and probably dozens of other abusive husband exploitation flicks and TV show episodes ala Silk Stalkings.The weaknesses in the characters are only compounded by the weaknesses in the story. The plot flaws become so damaging and distracting that they sap entertainment value right out of the film. Watching the movie becomes like trying to drive a stickshift down a road full of sinkholes the film does feature a ditch. The abrupt midstream shift in tone and pacing does not help.No explanation is ever offered for how the killer was able in real time to hide the murder weapon from the police  don't they search a crime scene? don't they have search warrants for other hiding places? And this is a plot point that drives most of the movie.We are supposed to believe that the prosecutor would proceed with a first degree murder trial not only without a murder weapon but without establishing the accused's motive not even bothering to investigate until afterward exactly who was in line to receive a 4 million payout.We are supposed to believe that Gere can install himself on the psychiatric board responsible for evaluating the fitness for release from an institution of his own indefinitely confined lover.We are supposed to believe  and cheer  that two outside professionals would arrive for an interview without introducing themselves or their reason for being there and that another character would suddenly switch a lifelong allegiance all so that Gere can stage an elaborate trick on someone he later acknowledges is mentally ill from childhood abuse only apparently to arrange an even more haphazard convoluted and contrived manipulation later by behaving cavalierly and roughly to a patient.We are supposed to believe that murderers can walk out of mental institutions simply by switching clothes with someone else in a bathroom.We are supposed to believe that Gere would enlist a psychiatric patient to steal for him without giving any warnings or taking any precautions to protect the young man from the vicious homicidal maniac with whom this puts him at odds to compensate for this colossal error the movie prematurely discloses the man's fate creating a witness and another potential crime to prosecute and thus undercutting the suspense of whether the killer of the earlier victim will escape unpunished.We are supposed to believe for the sake of a quick shockeffect touch at the end that after two court trials had thoroughly publicized the events of the case a character at its heart would appear to be recycling the exact same modus operandi for future use. And so on.The movie suffers badly under the relentless battering of these accumulated character and plot problems. Simply dismissing them with an air of glib pseudosophistication allknowing cynicism empty flippancy or lazy unintelligent flicking of the not helpful button on any review honest enough to point them out is not a serious response. Nor do they simply disappear because the movie inserts some attractive visuals such as of bridges and lighthouses or ramps up dramatic music somewhat frantically and mechanically starting about halfway through. Any meaningful review has to come to terms not only with the elements of the movie that are promising and likable but with the substantial flaws that prevent it from being satisfying.".

Ms. Bassinger has one of her best roles and turns in a powerhouse performance as a deeply disturbed woman whose diabolical scheme is unimaginable. She uses psychiatric data to justify murdering her husband and if things don't go her way she can always blame her sister's psychiatrist played by Gere who gives a restrained but compelling performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Final Analysis is a film that really puts a spin on psychological thrillers and it's a spin I love. Re teaming here is Gere and Basinger after that forgettable No Mercy back in 87 and Basinger here shows no mercy when killing her rich and abusive gangster husband Roberts. Rightly so he deserved to die as he's a real bastard to her even in restaurants where he gives Gere the bad eye for ogling her. We then meet em' in the toilet it's a bit of an tense and unnerving moment. Gere plays a psychiatrist and he isn't bad as is Basinger as the murderess where I like Thurman's enigmatic and twisted performance more. FA does take a while to move along. Be patient. Stretching out to a two hour running time he does beautifully flow as did Jennifer 8. We more so want Robert's to die where too there's layers to Basinger's motives besides ridding him of his abuse. And I really liked where this went. When Gere really finds out what happened he himself is cornered on the account of a missing attachment to a dumbbell which has his prints on it a no finer moment for Basinger who says threateningly to Gere Don't f with me Issac. I liked the fact too that Keith David was in this as a hardened detective who doesn't approve of Gere's prognosis's even suggesting David should have a session after letting a young mentally ill Latino kid free. Gere later uses him and I'm glad the kid didn't die to retrieve that missing piece of dumbbell. Basinger is bloody hot in this too where she could almost smoke up a scene anywhere. The ending is one of the most suspenseful ones I've seen in a thriller at that light house. The photography shots are awesome where this film is pretty awesome but I don't want to press it. One of the best best psychological dramas of 1992.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film presents something of a dilemma on the one hand it is an original psychologically clever and rather twisted with a rather intriguing climax and on the other it is presented as a typical early 90s generic Hollywoodized BasingerGere clich. It could be considered really good Basinger's performance is actually quite brilliant and if she wasn't who she is but a serious character actress and wasn't so damn gorgeous and her character wasn't so clearly a temptress she'd had probably got some plaudits for it. Uma Thurman equally did rather well although with a little more detachment but Richard Gere seemed remote and rather emotionless despite all the things that happened to him like he was in a trance the whole way through.Again the plot the actual idea is very clever. A woman which of the two sisters you aren't really sure or both is either a brilliant premeditated killer product of a nightmare upbringing and abusive marriage to a callous and rather selfcentred misogynist in the form of the dark and horrible well performed although somewhat typecast Eric Roberts or she's just a sociopathic manipulative doanythingtosurvive chameleon... and this is played out well throughout the story. Kim Basinger is perfectly cast although playing very much characters she's played before  the blonde beauty wearing red the light catching her hair and babydoll features flateringly etc etc. There's a brilliant bit where a colleague of Gere's is chastising him by saying that no woman is so beautiful as to make a man forget all reason and go against everything he stands for and then he sees Basinger standing in the doorway looking incredible and he just stops talking. Uma Thurman though a beautiful woman in her own right is perfectly cast as the younger you presume sister who is constantly the ugly duckling the caterpillar compared to her butterfly sisters and even when she turns into a butterfly she is still a pale imitation of the original.It's difficult to review without giving anything away. There are aspects of this film which I found I predicted could see coming but I had no idea how the film would play out what Gere playing psychologist would do I mean of course the court outcome is to be expected but that was almost a given in order to set up the totally unpredictable sequence of events and almost gave a false sense of security that you would know how the rest concludes. Typical early 90s fare including the obligatory sex scene so scripted and paint by numbers bare behind bare nipple dim lighting sound effects etc yet nonemotive or engaging and fairly unnecessary for the plot the film is clichd in most regards but there's also a dark aggressive and unusual aspect in that it deals with some issues a lot less palatable than most. Take away the clichs and some of the average madeforTV male performances and step back a bit and this is actually quite a good film Basinger giving one of the performances of her life stepping out of her usual totally innocent and just eyecandy comfort zone and the which sister did what aspect you are left which is rather clever.".

	schema:headline " Do Yourself A Favor... Rent This Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever tried to figure out what something is when your eyes are closed?  You grab something round its cool and smooth to the touch.  It feels solid so it's not some kind of Nerf ball or anything.  Here you are standing in the middle of a room clutching something and you can't quite tell what it is.  The object was an apple but that's not the point.MAY the new film by first time director Lucky McKee is just that kind of movie.  At first maybe it's a romance then again maybe it's a thriller hmm.. Maybe it's some kind of comedy light hearted or dark. At first glance you might just think it's a horror film.  But May doesn't aspire to labels it lives in that world beyond them and that's what works and doesn't work for a film like this.MAY is one of those movies like Mullholland Drive From Dusk 'Til Dawn or Femme Fatale.  There is a moment in the film that will either grab you and pull you in or turn you off and produces nothing but loathing.  For me that moment came as the blind kids are well.. I don't think I want to share that sequence with you but for me it worked.MAY tells the story of a young women named May Angela Bettis Girl Interrupted who seems really sweet on the outside with just a touch of crazy attached.  She had an overbearing mother Merle Kennedy Bubble Boy who wanted her little girl to be perfect.  It's just too bad she needed to wear an eye patch to correct a lazy eye.  The kids in school all laughed and called her a pirate.  To comfort the girl or make her crazy the film doesn't really say May's mother gives her a prized possession a freaky looking doll that has to stay in pristine condition in a glass box.Somehow May survives this weird childhood and grows up to be stable but a little nuts.  She falls for a guy with perfect hands Jeremy Sisto Wrong Turn and a girl she works with Anna Faris Scary Movie falls for her. Everything is perfect until these people turn their back on May and well that's when the fun begins..Angela Bettis is excellent she is really beautiful really vulnerable and really expressive without doing much.  She gives May this quality that is understated and yet still intense.  I like how she says more with one look than lots of silly dialogue.  She very much reminded me of a female Travis Bickle. She has a longing for what she can not have and is dealing with it the only way she know how.Like in TAXI DRIVER there is a moment when May is on the phone with Adam the Sisto character and he wants nothing to do with her anymore.  Anyone else would have gotten the point.  But not May and so when the realization comes just as when Travis Bickle was dumped by Betsey something inside both of them snaps.Another bright spot is Anna Faris.  Why she pigeonholed herself in those stupid comedies is beyond me.  She is excellent as May's lesbian workmate. She is bright and spunky and really funny.  I'd love to see her do some more legitimate acting work.  Hopefully this is the kind of film that she could use to get better roles.  Who knows!!!Director McKee makes it look easy.  He has crafted a fascinating look into the eyes of a crazy person by doing what few films can.   He allows us to see that part of ourselves that is manifested in May.  We've all at one time or another been treated like crap made fun of been ridiculed and maybe some of us have tried to go over the deep end.  I felt pity for May even if I shouldn't have.  This is a powerful movie and one of the best I've seen all year.If Hollywood ever got off its rear end and decided that a film like MAY deserved to be shown at the same multiplex as FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY maybe their would be better quality films out there that the general market could consume.  Until then it will probably only be discovered by lovers of film. I guess that's not so bad.There are probably others out there that could find fault in a film like MAY.  It's that kind of cinema either you love it or your hate it.  There is not much middle ground.  But do yourself a favor go and rent this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Have you ever tried to figure out what something is when your eyes are closed?  You grab something round its cool and smooth to the touch.  It feels solid so it's not some kind of Nerf ball or anything.  Here you are standing in the middle of a room clutching something and you can't quite tell what it is.  The object was an apple but that's not the point.MAY the new film by first time director Lucky McKee is just that kind of movie.  At first maybe it's a romance then again maybe it's a thriller hmm.. Maybe it's some kind of comedy light hearted or dark. At first glance you might just think it's a horror film.  But May doesn't aspire to labels it lives in that world beyond them and that's what works and doesn't work for a film like this.MAY is one of those movies like Mullholland Drive From Dusk 'Til Dawn or Femme Fatale.  There is a moment in the film that will either grab you and pull you in or turn you off and produces nothing but loathing.  For me that moment came as the blind kids are well.. I don't think I want to share that sequence with you but for me it worked.MAY tells the story of a young women named May Angela Bettis Girl Interrupted who seems really sweet on the outside with just a touch of crazy attached.  She had an overbearing mother Merle Kennedy Bubble Boy who wanted her little girl to be perfect.  It's just too bad she needed to wear an eye patch to correct a lazy eye.  The kids in school all laughed and called her a pirate.  To comfort the girl or make her crazy the film doesn't really say May's mother gives her a prized possession a freaky looking doll that has to stay in pristine condition in a glass box.Somehow May survives this weird childhood and grows up to be stable but a little nuts.  She falls for a guy with perfect hands Jeremy Sisto Wrong Turn and a girl she works with Anna Faris Scary Movie falls for her. Everything is perfect until these people turn their back on May and well that's when the fun begins..Angela Bettis is excellent she is really beautiful really vulnerable and really expressive without doing much.  She gives May this quality that is understated and yet still intense.  I like how she says more with one look than lots of silly dialogue.  She very much reminded me of a female Travis Bickle. She has a longing for what she can not have and is dealing with it the only way she know how.Like in TAXI DRIVER there is a moment when May is on the phone with Adam the Sisto character and he wants nothing to do with her anymore.  Anyone else would have gotten the point.  But not May and so when the realization comes just as when Travis Bickle was dumped by Betsey something inside both of them snaps.Another bright spot is Anna Faris.  Why she pigeonholed herself in those stupid comedies is beyond me.  She is excellent as May's lesbian workmate. She is bright and spunky and really funny.  I'd love to see her do some more legitimate acting work.  Hopefully this is the kind of film that she could use to get better roles.  Who knows!!!Director McKee makes it look easy.

THE OTHERS THE SIXTH SENSE and SIGNS are those kinds of films.And then you get those rarities...those exceptional films that are not for everyone that manage to be both creepy and gory at the same time in a way that's not quite easily classifiable and so they are never considered mainstream by mass audiences in the multiplexes or critics into selling soundbites rather than writing decent reviews. Films like TOURIST TRAP THE FUNHOUSE George Romero's MARTIN ALICE SWEET ALICE SISTERS and SILENT SCREAM are some prime examples. To this list we can now add MAY.The less you know about this film going in the more shocking the denoument is. And even those who have heard quite a bit about it shouldn't be too quick to make assumptions. MAY goes in a direction that most films of this genre hint at but never commit to. The result is a tale alternating between twisted tenderness and tremendous terror like nothing you've seen in a long while. And in the true tradition of creepygoryblackly comic films there's no middle of the road with this one. You will love it or absolutely hate it but either way you will not walk away from it unaffected.  Firsttime writerdirector McKee has seen to that and then some.Angela Bettis may need some serious therapy following up her role in the CARRIE TV remake with this one. I'd be tempted to call it a pattern since May does share a lot of similarities with Carrie White the overprotective overbearing mothers the role of societal outcast set at an early age. But that's where the similarities end. Where Carrie's weapon of choice was her soontobenotsolatent telekinetic powers May's power lies in her very deceptive talent to appear shy docile reclusive and weird but supposedly harmless.  Obviously lacking in the social interaction department she still has a quality about her that elicits our empathy and sympathy.  The characters she meets in the story feel the same way and...well you have to see what happens to belive it.Indie faves Jeremy Sisto SIX FEET UNDER Anna Faris the SCARY MOVIE series and James Duval A RIVER MADE TO DROWN IN round out the principal cast. Not to mention May's first 'friend' that serves as a catalyst for the story...a doll given her by her mother which may have you swearing off dolls for the rest of your life!I'm not going to give away the main plot leaving that to other reviewers and their assessments. I will say this if your horror movies usually have to be series sequels with a number plastered in front of them MAY might be too much imaginative derangement for you to handle. But if you're in the mood for something completely different then rent it NOW by all means. Just make sure you have a good stupid comedy to take your mind off of it afterward. Trust me on this even if it's DUDE WHERE'S MY CAR? for the fifteenth time TAKE IT. You'll feel...well maybe a little better after watching this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whoa! I'm speechless! May is one weird fun funny sad and disturbing film. It's just so many things. It's a strangely beautiful character study about a lonely girl who just wants a friend. I couldn't help but feel for her. She's weird and shy but in a cute sweet way. I was intrigued by her and wanted her to find happiness. No matter how pathetic her character would become I just couldn't stop caring. I wanted to reach out to her and be her friend. Nobody deserves to be so lonely. All she needed was a friend. But things just don't exactly work out that way. Once she began to crack and take the plunge into madness it was understandable how it could happen. That doesn't mean that the events that unfolded weren't shocking because they definitely were. But we see why our heroine does what she does. We can't help but want things to be different though and for her to go down a different path but when she doesn't we come along for the ride anyway following her wherever she takes us.Angela Bettis gives an amazing performance as May. So far this is the best female performance of the year and when the end of the year comes if it's still not THE best it will be one of THE best. She makes us care about her character from the beginning and we never really stop even when she goes psychotic. Bettis shows so many emotions and makes us feel all kinds of things. She was very natural and sometimes her body language spoke to us more than her words. We just knew what she was feeling and could feel her cracking more and more as the movie went on. She was sweet sad scary pathetic and yet strangely attractive. It's too bad the Academy are such prudes because this girl is so deserving of an Oscar nomination that it's not even funny. Unfortunately it's obvious her performance will be overlooked by them. May just isn't Oscar material. Plus the movie didn't make enough money and isn't well known enough for them to even consider honoring anything to do with May. But even if they don't honor it the fans will always remember it. I've seen Bettis in other movies but after seeing this I will always remember her as May... I've always been a fan of the underrated Anna Faris. She's a great comedic actress. I found her to be a lot of fun as Polly. She's funny and sexy. This is sure to be one of my favorite supporting performances of the year. Faris was a welcome addition to this twisted little film.WriterDirector Lucky McKee proves to be a great new talent. It's hard to believe this is his first feature film. Very impressive if you ask me. I'm looking forward to whatever he does next. If it's anything as wonderful as May then it should be great... Also deserving of a mention is composer Jaye BarnesLuckett. She does a terrific job here always providing the right music at the right moment. If she keeps this up she'll have a bright future ahead of her.I'm still blown away by this film. There's so many praises I have for it that I doubt I could remember to mention them all. It's original well acted well written well directed etc... It's just twistedly wonderful. It's too bad it wasn't given a better release in theaters but it's not exactly a mainstream movie either. It still deserved better than what it got. At least I can find comfort in knowing that it's sure to become a cult classic. Word of mouth will help it a lot. It's definitely not for everyone though. It's weird morbid quirky wicked and gutsy. It doesn't shy away from much. In fact it has one of the best and most realistic slit throats I've ever witnessed on screen. But don't let that scare you it's definitely worth a look for any horror fan or any film fan in general. I'm proud to have this haunting film as a part of my collection. It's simply AMAYZING!Grade 910 A".

And I commend the director for being unapologetic about this sick demented material. The film is wellmade and wellacted. Just don't expect the feelgood movie of the year. I can watch Jason Voorhies slice a victim's head off with a machete while eating a 3course meal but watching a room full of blind children crawl all over a floor and cut themselves with broken glass is pretty damn disgusting to me. Fans of the horror genre definitely won't be disappointed. 7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "A native of Austin Texas Angela Bettis has carved out her niche as an actress in small independent horror movies. She started out with bit parts in bigger Hollywood movies in the late 90s but really turned heads as the creepy and unhinged loner in Lucky McKee's 2002 film May. Over the next four review we'll take a closer look at some of her best roles.Made for only a half million bucks May tells the story of a twenty something girl who is searching for friend and can't seem to find that perfect person. She was shunned as a little girl because of her lazy eye that required her to wear an eye patch. Her mother made her a very special doll but she couldn't play with it because its a collectible. It is kept locked in a case never able to be free just like May. May is very creative and makes all of her own clothes on her trusty sewing machine which adds to her quirkiness. She works in a veterinarian's office with Polly played by a then unknown sadly maybe still Anna Faris as the receptionist. Faris steals every scene she is in with a wild and sexy energy. May develops a crush on Adam played by Jeremy Sisto who works at the Auto repair shop across the street. She loves his beautiful hands most of all. Adam likes May but its like he really just feels sorry for her. May is extremely nervous around him and tries a little too hard for his attention.May is very reminiscent of Roman Polanski's Repulsion about a young girls loneliness and eventual decent into madness. May does have a bunch of comedic moments though that even out the horrific ones. Adam admits he likes weird but when May crosses the line and takes it a bit to far Adam starts to push away from May and want her out of his life. Its not that easy for May as she finally snaps and goes on mission to create the perfect person see Frankenstein.May is a movie for weird people and about weird people. If you ever felt like you just don't fit in anywhere you'll love this movie. Every actor is perfectly cast and Director Lucky Mckee who is a bit weird himself gets great performances from all. The DVD also has a few commentary tracks which are always fun. So take a look at May today!".

	schema:reviewBody "May is an extremely fresh unique horror movie. The film centers around May Kennedy a complete loneroutcast who has been that way since childhood. She grew up with a lazy eye which she still has as an adult which was partly the reason for her not having many friends. Her only friend in the entire world is a doll named Suzy that her mother gave her as a small child. Encased in a glass case the inanimate object is poor May's only friend. But things start to change when May meets Adam whom she begins to form a relationship with. But when May begins to seem a little too weird for Adam he calls off the relationship leaving May heartbroken. Now May has began to realize that there are only certain things that she likes about people but has yet to find the perfect person who holds all of the same physical features. So she begins to kill those who have the perfect characteristics with the intention of building a perfect friend.The entire plot of this movie is strangely morbid killing people to make the perfect person. It's almost Frankensteinlike except May's creation doesn't come back to haunt her. It is almost like a twisted fairytale the entire movie seems to be set in an unreal city which is in reality Los Angeles and each of the characters are pretty interesting. Angela Bettis who also starred in Tobe Hooper's Toolbox Murders remake is an extremely underrated actress she was excellent in this movie and delivered a topnotch performance. Some may also recognize Anna Faris from the Scary Movie series as a coworkerlove interest of May. The film's ending made the movie all the more weird but in a good way and what May does in order to make her perfect friend is quite squeamish.Bottom line  May is a unique blend of horror and sometimes even comedy and had some very similar characteristics of a Tim Burtonstyle movie which ultimately worked for it. If you want to see a unique horror movie see May. Very well done. 910.".

It moves slowly but it holds your attention well with brilliant performances by Angela Bettis Jeremy Sisto and the supporting cast.Not much more I can think to say about this my mum and brother are arguing in the next room and distracting my train of thought. It's a crazy life.Basically a very good film. Horror fans would love this as would people who just appreciate good lower budget films.

One day things take a turn for the better when May meets a guy named Adam Jeremy Sisto  begins a relationship with him unfortunately May has no experience with boyfriends  scares Adam off with her freaky ways. May then turns to a friend at work named Polly Anna Faris  starts a lesbian relationship with her but Polly cheats on her which sends May over the edge  she decides if you can't find a friend make one in a rather more literal sense than one would like...Written  directed by Lucky McKee who also has a small cameo in the film May is a strange little indie film that almost defies description but the overall impression I got while watching it was that for the most part it's a dour somewhat dull drama. The script which takes itself deadly seriously plays like a drama it tells the troubled story of May  it's watchable I suppose as there's always a sinister undercurrent bubbling under the surface  it's this that kept me watching  the possibility that it could burst into life but to be honest I never felt that it did. I found it rather predictable as well especially the apparent twist ending which is the only time it veers into complete fantasy. It's rather slow going at times  it never gripped or engaged me although it has a certain something that kept me watching but only just. It's an OK watch it passes the time  it has some merits but overall I thought it was average at best.Director McKee does alright there's nothing here that really stands out  considering that May is regarded as a horror film it isn't scary  isn't that gory either. There's a slit throat a few body parts a needle in someone's head scissors in someone's eye  some blood splatter but it's not that graphic. The film has nice clean cinematography but it's forgettable  there's no style or flair here.With a supposed budget of about 500000 May is technically very good for a low budget film but thats the best thing you can say about it as it's a touch forgettable. The acting is very good by all involved.May is a strange film for sure I'm not sure quite what the filmmakers were aiming for but at the end of the day it comes across as some dull drama for over an hour of it's running time  once it starts to venture into proper horror territory it's nothing special. Lots of people seem to like it but I can't say I do  therefore I would find it very difficult to recommend.".

Jeremy Sisto and Anna Faris are also perfect though in lesser roles but crucial to the plot development. May will from the laughter of a typical romantic comedy to drama and horror but in any time loses its tone and its logic.

	schema:reviewBody "May is a modern masterpiece of horror. It's engaging and eventually horrifically disturbing leaving you wishing that it could've just been a little bit longer but nevertheless it's extremely creepy and unforgettable material that should not be missed by and slow burner horror fan because the payoff is definitely worth it. I almost wish that I didn't know anything about the ending because the payoff would've been quite a shocking revelation so I'd recommend that if you know nothing about May don't read any reviews or synopsis and definitely do not watch the trailer because it gives just about the whole film away! May is a slow burner which may put some people off a bit but the build up is very absorbing as it's not the plot itself that is complex but the character May who is an extremely messed up person and also a very interesting one who is able to carry the film brilliantly. May can often be confusing sometimes she seems likable and just an incredibly shy person but at times she can seem like a full blown psychopath who has no grasp of reality. It's very clever and interesting to see how May's character gradually changes into someone who is actually really confident sometimes dangerously.The first film I saw by Lucky Mckee was The Woods which left much to be desired. May is a giant leap forward and that fact that he wrote it as well makes Lucky a name to definitely look out for because his talent in writing and directing is clearly apparent here. The directing is very focused and also quite stylish at times especially when May turns crazy. There is also some really good use of sound with the retractable knife and the cracking of the glass which are all symbolic to May's mindstate which is what makes the writing so clever. The film can be so well analysed and dissected like Citizen Kane only so much more interesting.May also gets quite gory towards the end and even had me flinching in my seat. It's just such an engaging and well told story about a lonely girl who just wants a friend. There are so many themes that can be explored as well as a fantastic moral which the viewer can take away with them. Like a said at the start May is a modern masterpiece of horror it's directing screenplay and sound are all nearperfect and in the end creates a memorable horror film with a clever and haunting ending. It's really weird but I like weird.".

	schema:reviewBody "At film's beginning we are introduced to a little girl named May who  was born with a lazy eye. Her appearance obsessed mother insist that  May cover it with a piratelike patch and then hide the patch with her  hair. Naturally this doesn't work and years later May is still  friendless ostracized by the other children because of her defect. So  May's mother gives her a doll in a glass case telling her that if you  can't find a friend you can make one. May is not allowed to remove  the doll from it's enclosure and her uptight mother is upset when May  rips the gift wrap disgusted that May has ruined it and so May's  only friend remains forever out of reach untouchable and unable to  provide much love or comfort.  Fast forward about a decade and a half and May is now a girl in her  early 20s working in a veterinary clinic and still as shy and  friendless as she ever has been. There's nothing wrong with her per  se she's pretty and smart but much like her predecessor Carrie White  she has no selfesteem and no understanding of what love and friendship  really is. She meets a boy who likes to make gruesome art films which  feature people in love eating each other...but when she bites him and  draws blood during an intimate moment he rejects her as being too  weird even though a confused May insists that it's just like his  movie. She's seduced by a lesbian who is at first disgusted by May's  penchant for selfmutilation referring to her as a crazy bitch...but  then asks May to do the same to her. She is picked up by a tattooed  mohawked punk rocker who wants to get into her pants...until he finds  the remains of May's murdered pet cat stuffed in her freezer at which  point he calls her a freak and refuses to be her friend. May is  surrounded by people who WANT to be considered weird but only May  really IS weird. As the rejections pile up the glass case around her  doll begins to crack and the doll within  emotionless emptyeyed and  cold  threatens to take over.   This film is almost as obsessed with eyehorror as Lucio Fulci was.  May like her mother is obsessed with appearances but perhaps not in  the way that her neatasapin mother might have hoped. May wants to be  seen to be accepted as a whole and yet she herself can only see  parts...hands legs throats whatever a person's best feature happens  to be. When she is rejected by her boyfriend she turns to a group of  blind children perhaps thinking that it is better not to be seen at  all and accepted anyway  but the blind children reject her too  throwing May over for her doll and releasing it from it's glass case in  a scene that finally sends May over the edge.  May finally takes her mother's advice  If you can't find a friend  make one  a tad too literally. May becomes the doll the only  friend she ever had and one by one she hunts down everyone who has  ever rejected her collecting their lovely body parts intent on  making her own friend with the pieces she drags back home.  May is a tale of incredible loneliness and sorrow. May is no boogeyman  butchering shallow teens and beautiful twentysomethings for no real  reason.  She is simply a damaged person who has never been touched or known love  and friendship and in turn has never experienced heartbreak or  betrayal at the hands of said same. She has lived her entire life in a  glass case looking out and being looked in at and when she finally  realizes how painful friendship and love can be she simply cannot  handle it. Angela Bettis turns in a very believable and near flawless  performance as May playing her as a clumsy twitchy and sometimes  downright dumpy young woman who is totally devoid of social skills  through no real fault of her own. I couldn't help but feel terribly  sorry for May yet at the same time I cringed along with her friends  who grew more uncomfortable with her the more she showed them her true  self.   May isn't perfect. There's a few loose strings dangling in the film  that are not successfully tied up by the time the end credits began to  roll but it's a damn good effort. The gore is minimal despite the  subject matter most of the violence happening offcamera and what is  shown is not unbearably graphic. All in all May succeeds. It is well  acted and has some very good points to make without ramming those  points down your throat. I give it an 8 on a scale of 10...but if  you're easily influenced by mood watch something funny after this one  is over. May  though powerful startling and innovative  can also be  terribly depressing.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very unusual movie. It may appeal to some and be a complete waste of time to others because while it incorporates elements of horror it also plays out in subtle tones of a gawky comedy of manners and even a smattering of French New Wave cinema complete with flashcuts to the future and past and anyone who has seen CLEO DE CINQ A SEPT knows where the reference lies and for those who haven't it's the black and white silent movie within this movie even when this film is vastly different from the aforementioned one.Movies about maladjusted individuals have been made with different results and wellknown titles such as TAXI DRIVER REPULSION and CARRIE will undoubtedly find their way into comparison with this relatively obscure little cult film. MAY also tells the story of the main character devolving into madness and murder but its approach is like nothing I've ever seen in a horror film. No murky colors are used  much of the scenes take place in clear daylight  there are no sudden jolts and crashing violins and even when the inevitably horrifying resolution begins to reveal itself there's an awkward sadness and on occasion MAY feels like an animated art film about quirky Goth angst made by a college student. Anyone looking for a CARRIEesquire denouement as seen from the movie's sleeve and given the fact that Bettis was in a CARRIE remake that same year should look elsewhere this is also one of the quietest horror films I've seen in ages scenes involving violence coming forth from May's hand happen as this were a natural progression of events and not a frightening involution of a human being incapable of functioning in society. And in a nice ode to Giallo and silent films one of the most quietest murder sequences include one of the people who vie for her affections getting her neck slashed until we see her look of horror or ecstasy and her open gape framed by her hands coming to her neck we're only partially sure for about a second about what has happened and then horrified.This isn't a movie with great acting and much less a great script. On occasions it's too eccentric it looks like the original concept must have been a sketch that here is stretched to a 90 minute film the dialog is at times painful to hear but overall what it is is an honest film that has Bettis become unglued without sacrificing credibility for shock value even when she commits horrific acts. MAY is horror that is extremely lowkey down to its last very disturbing scene.".

MAY also tells the story of the main character devolving into madness and murder but its approach is like nothing I've ever seen in a horror film. No murky colors are used  much of the scenes take place in clear daylight  there are no sudden jolts and crashing violins and even when the inevitably horrifying resolution begins to reveal itself there's an awkward sadness and on occasion MAY feels like an animated art film about quirky Goth angst made by a college student. Anyone looking for a CARRIEesquire denouement as seen from the movie's sleeve and given the fact that Bettis was in a CARRIE remake that same year should look elsewhere this is also one of the quietest horror films I've seen in ages scenes involving violence coming forth from May's hand happen as this were a natural progression of events and not a frightening involution of a human being incapable of functioning in society. And in a nice ode to Giallo and silent films one of the most quietest murder sequences include one of the people who vie for her affections getting her neck slashed until we see her look of horror or ecstasy and her open gape framed by her hands coming to her neck we're only partially sure for about a second about what has happened and then horrified.This isn't a movie with great acting and much less a great script. On occasions it's too eccentric it looks like the original concept must have been a sketch that here is stretched to a 90 minute film the dialog is at times painful to hear but overall what it is is an honest film that has Bettis become unglued without sacrificing credibility for shock value even when she commits horrific acts. MAY is horror that is extremely lowkey down to its last very disturbing scene.";

	schema:reviewBody "Nineteen ninetynine was an outstanding year for adaptations of major literary works but of all the great books that came to the screen last year this is my favorite.  John Irving's novel and adaptation is one of the most complete stories I can remember in many years.  It is poignant exhilarating and astutely human in its scope presenting a myriad of human emotions and experiences.Often when a story attempts to cross genres so broadly it fails from lack of depth or insufficiency of the writer or director to meet the variable demands of such a wideranging treatment.  This film was a comedy a tragedy a romance a humaninterest story a character study and a period piece and each element was excellently done.This was all accomplished without sacrificing the philosophical and emotional depth Irving imbues in all his works.  Irving weaves a strong moral into this story that rules need to be questioned and that being human is not so easily codified.  He revisits this theme repeatedly with each character facing dilemmas regarding societal and personal rules that are difficult to reconcile in the given situations.If there is one thing that stands out about this story it is its human realism.  These are ordinary people struggling with problems we all face. We come to have affection for almost all of them and can identify with their tribulations.  Although the story is excessively sentimental and fatalistic it reminds us that life is complicated and doesn't always turn out the way we plan or hope. From a filmmaking perspective we could not have asked more from Lasse Hallstrom.  Known most in the U.S. for his direction of What's Eating Gilbert Grape' Hallstrom has been making wonderful films in Europe for almost twenty years.  However this film will certainly go down as his finest work.  In the featurette on the DVD he said that when he goes to Blockbuster with his daughter and sees it on the shelf he will have a feeling of pride and well he should.This motion picture was beautifully filmed with rich cinematography breathtaking locations and precise period props and costumes.  However the greatest achievement for Hallstrom working in concert with Irving was to orchestrate a large cast in such a way that no character seemed insignificant.  Hallstrom took great care to do enough development of each character often just visually without any dialogue that he made us care for each of them.  He gave the film an emotional depth and breadth that is difficult to achieve in two hours.  His work with the children in the orphanage was superb bringing forth their innocence and enthusiasm without minimizing their plight.The acting was uniformly outstanding.  Tobey Maguire infused Homer with the right combination of idealism naivet and inner strength to make him an unassuming but powerful lead.  Charlize Theron continues to impress me with her acting ability.  Besides her enchanting girlnextdoor attractiveness she showed terrific range in a character that at first seemed shallow but later proved to be quite complex.Michael Caine has had a legendary career spanning close to half a century. He has long been one of my favorite actors.  His performance here was powerful and well deserving of the acclaim he received.  Dr. Larch was an extremely complex character egotistical selfabusive manipulative and recalcitrant yet a saintly selfsacrificing and loving crusader for the good of the children.  Caine's ability to span that range was remarkable.Finally I have the highest praise for Delroy Lindo as Mr. Rose the orchard foreman.  Lindo's bright smile and enthusiasm created a rock solid character with charm strength and simple wisdom.  He captures our admiration immediately and despite his despicable act we cannot help but pity him in the end.After having seen all the films that were nominated by the Academy for best picture last year I have to say that this was my personal favorite.  It wasn't as flashy as the rest in fact this was downright old fashioned in its approach.  They just don't write stories like this anymore and that's a shame.  I rated it a 1010.  In its quiet way it captured my heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cider House Rules is the best translation of a novel to film that I've ever seen. It must help that the novelist adapts his own work and writes the screenplay. This novel is a large complex work with many characters and subplots. It would have been easy for the screenwriter to become bogged down in details and losing their way. Irving doesn't.

He's been trained to deliver babies at the orphanage by the benevolent Dr. Wilbur Larch Michael Caine.        Notably this boy's passage into manhood necessitates him accepting the responsibility of also performing illegal abortions! Now there's a twist. John Irving also wrote the books The World According To Garp and The Hotel New Hampshiire made into films of the same name as well as A Prayer For Owen Meany which was made into the puzzling Simon Birch a film Irving vigourously disowns. Irving subsequently in the case of Cider House has also written the screenplay.        The actual cider house rules are a minor element of a rambling film that is full of such minor events.They are a nonconsequential ignored set of laws meant to govern the behaviour of the workers who bunk in the cider house on an apple farm.        But life's like that or so John Irving and his film would have you believe. It's just that usually films concentrate a little more on life's more tumultuous moments.        Young Homer Wells our budding unlicensed doctor is played delightfully by Tobey Maguire Pleasantvillewith a sweet smile and sleepy eyes. Those of you who prefer your actors to be more dynamic might find Maguire to be too even but in this film his style  was just the ticket.        He's one of the boys who were never chosen to be adopted at the orphanage. There are some touching scenes centred around the children in particular not being selected hovering with their bags packed.        Homer sets off to see the world with new friends Candy Charlize Theron and Wally Paul Rudd. They had attended the orphanage for an abortion.        Homer sees the sea for the first time. He learns how to pick apples and to get on with his work mates. He has a romance. And he learns how to accept responsibility for his and other's actions away from the shelter of the orphanage. And that's about it. And that's just enough.        The mood of the film accentuates a dreamy continuance years and seasons merge. Life goes on. The apples grow. Relationships develop. The scenery is beautiful. The black labourers accept their lot.        This is life and death seen from the personal a snapshot of middle rural America a land where you're meant to just get on with it and accept your lot.        The Cider House Rules is sensitively directed and written with an emphasis on people caring for each other. It's a bit of a weepy. Even villains are given their good sides.".

	schema:headline " a film of many strengths and weaknesses";
	schema:reviewBody "When a film takes place in two entirely different settings  involving almost two entirely different sets of characters  it inevitably runs the risk that one of the two sides will generate more interest than the other and that the movie itself will appear to break into halves of unequal quality.  The end result is that such a film may seem to be disjointed and lacking in the cohesive unity necessary for any work of genuine art.The Cider House Rules' runs the risk and falls into the trap.  The first section set in a Maine orphanage in 1943 fascinates us not merely with the sheer novelty of the setting but with the central figure of the piece the doctor and caregiver who becomes the focus of our attention.  Brilliantly portrayed by Michael Caine Dr. Larch is a man who provides love to a collection of children otherwise ignored and abandoned by an uncaring world. The most controversial aspect of the character involves the fact that Dr. Larch also provides abortions for women who want them at a time when the operation was still illegal and the only other alternative for many of these women was to suffer at the hands of inept practitioners of the operation. The Cider House Rules' is certainly to be commended for tackling a subject that is virtually taboo in commercial moviemaking  albeit it must be stated for those who do not adhere to abortion advocacy that the slant here is decidedly prochoice despite the script's making a few gestures to the antiabortion viewpoint early on in the film.The center of the film is occupied by a young man named Homer Wells a twicerejected orphan who grows up at the orphanage almost as Dr. Larch's medical protge and whom Dr. Larch appears to be grooming to take over his practice from him in the future.  The pseudo fatherson relationships between Dr. Larch and Homer and between Homer and the boys who are in his charge are conveyed with genuine emotional power and heartwarming believability.   As prospective parents visit the facility we feel deeply the desperation these children have to be adopted and to find a place where they will fit in.  Conversely we empathize keenly with the sense of sadness and personal inadequacy that inevitably accompanies each of their many rejections.  Even more fascinating is the social context in which the drama plays itself out.  Because of his willingness to perform the abortions Dr. Larch's position at the orphanage has come under attack from the board of trustees that runs the institution.  Thus we are all primed for a gripping showdown between these two opposing forces and wonder how Homer will fit into the proceedings.Unfortunately the author John Irving pulls the rug out from under us as he decides to take his story off into an almost entirely different direction. Feeling that he is missing out on a whole vast world waiting for him beyond the confines of this remote isolated community Homer rather understandably for a sheltered young man decides to abruptly leave the orphanage and to start life anew as an apple picker when he meets a soldier whose beautiful wife has come to the doctor for an abortion and whose family is in the cider making business.  Although Homer's sudden farewell results in a scene of great emotional power as a whole torrent of conflicting emotions come flooding out of both Homer and the people he is leaving behind the fact is that we sorely miss the orphanage once we are ripped away from it.  Somehow the scenes on the farm  and they constitute well more than half of the film's running time  never match in intensity and interest those that have come before.  In fact the least original and impressive aspect of the film is the predictable and conventional adulterous affair that Homer and the soldier's wife Candy Charlize Theron indulge in when her fighterbomber husband returns to the war.   Has there ever in the movies been a case of a beautiful young wife who did not cheat on her husband the minute he went on a mission overseas?  The theme of the story  as represented by the posted list of  cider house rules' that we are told by one of the characters are not too be followed because whoever wrote them didn't live in the cider house  seems to be that rules are made to be broken although in some cases  such as incest  the violation goes so far over the edge that such an act will always result in disastrous consequences for the perpetrator.  Throughout the film the characters always seem to be abandoning the rules set out for them by society.  Dr. Lance performs illegal operations creates a phony resume and a set of counterfeit documents in an attempt to get the board to hire Homer as his assistant and even deceives Homer into believing he suffers from a serious heart ailment to keep him out of the service.  Homer himself seems to suffer little guilt as he pursues a love affair with the wife of the man who has kindly entrusted him with a job when he most needs it.More interesting than this theme however is the more subtle one of parents  whether real or ersatz  learning to let go of the child in whom one has invested all one's dreams and hopes for the future.  The genuine heartbreak Dr. Lance suffers as Homer leaves to find a new place in the world becomes almost palpable as written on Caine's beautifully expressive craggy face. Unfortunately this aspect of the film is understandably I suppose played out almost entirely in scenes in which letters are exchanged back and forth between the two principals and in which their feelings are conveyed in the rather undramatic form of voiceover narration.  In fact after Homer leaves Dr. Lance becomes virtually a minor character in the story and with his withdrawal from the scene of action much of the emotional energy of the earlier portions drains out of the film.Director Lasse Hallstrom deserves high praise for the fine performances he has drawn from a uniformly excellent cast.  As Homer Tobey Maguire brings a quiet understated niceness to the pivotal role. Particularly noteworthy are the young boys who fill the early sections of the film with so much infectious life and emotion.  They are cute without being adorable touching without being cloying.  Hallstrom has also captured the alternately lush alternately bleak Maine landscape to striking effect.The Cider House Rules' is more a thing of bits and pieces than a fully integrated wholly satisfying work of cinematic art.  But much of it is so powerful and extraordinary that it is a film that despite its missed potential still manages to stay with one long after it is over.".

	onyx:emotionText "When a film takes place in two entirely different settings  involving almost two entirely different sets of characters  it inevitably runs the risk that one of the two sides will generate more interest than the other and that the movie itself will appear to break into halves of unequal quality.  The end result is that such a film may seem to be disjointed and lacking in the cohesive unity necessary for any work of genuine art.The Cider House Rules' runs the risk and falls into the trap.  The first section set in a Maine orphanage in 1943 fascinates us not merely with the sheer novelty of the setting but with the central figure of the piece the doctor and caregiver who becomes the focus of our attention.  Brilliantly portrayed by Michael Caine Dr. Larch is a man who provides love to a collection of children otherwise ignored and abandoned by an uncaring world. The most controversial aspect of the character involves the fact that Dr. Larch also provides abortions for women who want them at a time when the operation was still illegal and the only other alternative for many of these women was to suffer at the hands of inept practitioners of the operation. The Cider House Rules' is certainly to be commended for tackling a subject that is virtually taboo in commercial moviemaking  albeit it must be stated for those who do not adhere to abortion advocacy that the slant here is decidedly prochoice despite the script's making a few gestures to the antiabortion viewpoint early on in the film.The center of the film is occupied by a young man named Homer Wells a twicerejected orphan who grows up at the orphanage almost as Dr. Larch's medical protge and whom Dr. Larch appears to be grooming to take over his practice from him in the future.  The pseudo fatherson relationships between Dr. Larch and Homer and between Homer and the boys who are in his charge are conveyed with genuine emotional power and heartwarming believability.   As prospective parents visit the facility we feel deeply the desperation these children have to be adopted and to find a place where they will fit in.  Conversely we empathize keenly with the sense of sadness and personal inadequacy that inevitably accompanies each of their many rejections.  Even more fascinating is the social context in which the drama plays itself out.  Because of his willingness to perform the abortions Dr. Larch's position at the orphanage has come under attack from the board of trustees that runs the institution.  Thus we are all primed for a gripping showdown between these two opposing forces and wonder how Homer will fit into the proceedings.Unfortunately the author John Irving pulls the rug out from under us as he decides to take his story off into an almost entirely different direction. Feeling that he is missing out on a whole vast world waiting for him beyond the confines of this remote isolated community Homer rather understandably for a sheltered young man decides to abruptly leave the orphanage and to start life anew as an apple picker when he meets a soldier whose beautiful wife has come to the doctor for an abortion and whose family is in the cider making business.  Although Homer's sudden farewell results in a scene of great emotional power as a whole torrent of conflicting emotions come flooding out of both Homer and the people he is leaving behind the fact is that we sorely miss the orphanage once we are ripped away from it.  Somehow the scenes on the farm  and they constitute well more than half of the film's running time  never match in intensity and interest those that have come before.  In fact the least original and impressive aspect of the film is the predictable and conventional adulterous affair that Homer and the soldier's wife Candy Charlize Theron indulge in when her fighterbomber husband returns to the war.   Has there ever in the movies been a case of a beautiful young wife who did not cheat on her husband the minute he went on a mission overseas?  The theme of the story  as represented by the posted list of  cider house rules' that we are told by one of the characters are not too be followed because whoever wrote them didn't live in the cider house  seems to be that rules are made to be broken although in some cases  such as incest  the violation goes so far over the edge that such an act will always result in disastrous consequences for the perpetrator.  Throughout the film the characters always seem to be abandoning the rules set out for them by society.  Dr. Lance performs illegal operations creates a phony resume and a set of counterfeit documents in an attempt to get the board to hire Homer as his assistant and even deceives Homer into believing he suffers from a serious heart ailment to keep him out of the service.  Homer himself seems to suffer little guilt as he pursues a love affair with the wife of the man who has kindly entrusted him with a job when he most needs it.More interesting than this theme however is the more subtle one of parents  whether real or ersatz  learning to let go of the child in whom one has invested all one's dreams and hopes for the future.  The genuine heartbreak Dr. Lance suffers as Homer leaves to find a new place in the world becomes almost palpable as written on Caine's beautifully expressive craggy face. Unfortunately this aspect of the film is understandably I suppose played out almost entirely in scenes in which letters are exchanged back and forth between the two principals and in which their feelings are conveyed in the rather undramatic form of voiceover narration.  In fact after Homer leaves Dr. Lance becomes virtually a minor character in the story and with his withdrawal from the scene of action much of the emotional energy of the earlier portions drains out of the film.Director Lasse Hallstrom deserves high praise for the fine performances he has drawn from a uniformly excellent cast.  As Homer Tobey Maguire brings a quiet understated niceness to the pivotal role. Particularly noteworthy are the young boys who fill the early sections of the film with so much infectious life and emotion.  They are cute without being adorable touching without being cloying.  Hallstrom has also captured the alternately lush alternately bleak Maine landscape to striking effect.The Cider House Rules' is more a thing of bits and pieces than a fully integrated wholly satisfying work of cinematic art.  But much of it is so powerful and extraordinary that it is a film that despite its missed potential still manages to stay with one long after it is over.";

It is definitely a very rich story. I think it is difficult to separate both notions presented by the movie morality is abortion a good or a bad thing and from which point of view as both are present and equality between Men in terms of the racial issue. The movie takes place in the 40's just before the US declared war to Japan. The work on how AfroAmericans should be treated had not yet really started and they were still not very much considered as real equals to the whites. The rules which are part of the movie title in the first place are imposed on the AfroAmericans who work in the Cider House assuming they are stupid and unable to behave responsibly and with common sense. It is about the laws imposed on Men by other Men who do not necessarily understand the implications and the situations of those who have to comply with those rules. That leads naturally to the question of the Law  is the Law only a list of rules that we must obey without questioning at any time or might it sometimes be a more blurry notion that sensible individuals might have to work out for themselves according to the circumstances? Or can we take into account that Life itself  and chance sometimes lead to another form of Justice as it eventually happens at the end? To me it is a real must see. I would recommend parents to offer it to their teenagers as a means to let them build their own vision of the world.... Yes! it goes that far!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Fairly dripping with heartrending melodrama this comingofage story set in Maine during the 1940s centers on a boy named Homer Wells Tobey Maguire who grows up in an orphanage and then learns about adulthood in the outside world. Various contrived conflicts keep the plot moving along in an episodic way. And thusly the film could easily have been transferred to TV as a weekly miniseries. Mercifully it wasn't.The film's theme I suppose is that amid life's conflicts and problems we all need rules to live by. But this lesson rather selfevident to any fiveyear old child and taught implicitly in kindergarten and Sunday School is presented here in a way that reeks of sap and sentimentality.The story's adult characters are stereotyped. The little boys and girls at the orphanage really tug at your heartstrings. The manipulative score heavy with orchestral strings is annoyingly drippy. My impression therefore is that the film is aimed at viewers who can easily lose themselves in the emotions of the various pitiful characters. Further the script's plot is awkwardly contrived. And the story's ending is so predictable you can see it coming the proverbial mile away.Casting and acting are marginally acceptable. But if Tobey Maguire had been any more somnolent he would have been comatose. The film's direction and color cinematography are bland and mediocre totally unremarkable.The Cider House Rules is the kind of film that Hollywood insiders dearly love sweet and uplifting a real feelgood movie heavy on manipulative emotionalism.

	onyx:emotionText "Fairly dripping with heartrending melodrama this comingofage story set in Maine during the 1940s centers on a boy named Homer Wells Tobey Maguire who grows up in an orphanage and then learns about adulthood in the outside world. Various contrived conflicts keep the plot moving along in an episodic way. And thusly the film could easily have been transferred to TV as a weekly miniseries. Mercifully it wasn't.The film's theme I suppose is that amid life's conflicts and problems we all need rules to live by. But this lesson rather selfevident to any fiveyear old child and taught implicitly in kindergarten and Sunday School is presented here in a way that reeks of sap and sentimentality.The story's adult characters are stereotyped. The little boys and girls at the orphanage really tug at your heartstrings. The manipulative score heavy with orchestral strings is annoyingly drippy. My impression therefore is that the film is aimed at viewers who can easily lose themselves in the emotions of the various pitiful characters. Further the script's plot is awkwardly contrived. And the story's ending is so predictable you can see it coming the proverbial mile away.Casting and acting are marginally acceptable. But if Tobey Maguire had been any more somnolent he would have been comatose. The film's direction and color cinematography are bland and mediocre totally unremarkable.The Cider House Rules is the kind of film that Hollywood insiders dearly love sweet and uplifting a real feelgood movie heavy on manipulative emotionalism. I call it mush for the masses.";

Under the circumstances of Being John Malkovich a wonderfully hilarious presentation of an incomprehensible idea I find myself using every one of those phrases and then some more being deserved. Everything about it is labyrinthine intriguing and very funny. It is one of the years best films and should be well presented come Academy Award time.Being John Malkovich details the relationship between Craig and Lotte Schwartz. They basically live an old fashioned life in a small apartment with a miniature zoo of pets and a puppet factory inside. Lotte is a typical unattractive homemaker while Craig holds that unusual occupation of being a professional puppeteer. Desperately searching for employment Craig soon visits a business for an interview as a filer when he discovers for some odd reason the construction of the office floor is all but several feet tall forcing all employees to bend over backwards just to walk around.One of those employees is named Maxine a highly seductive coworker of Craig's. When he asks her out for a beer one night Craig experiences lustful thoughts about her and nearly begins an affair as his seemingly loving wife wonders around her happy little apartment all by herself.As you can see the household isn't exactly a joyful situation. All things change from blossoming sexual confusion to inner selfesteem when Craig uncovers a small door behind a filing cabinet in his office. It is tucked away hidden acutely well in a dark corner which is found mysteriously by accident when Craig droops a paper behind the cabinet. After Craig explores this deep miniature seemingly endless hallway he discovers this secret door leads to the brain of actor John Malkovich for fifteen minutes then spits you out along the roadside afterwards.Wow sounds like Alice in Wonderland doesn't it...well sort of.  Craig first tells his coworker about his discovery who continues to think he's nuts. Then after explaining and showing this portal to his wife who is hysterical Maxine begins to believe Craig and concoct a devilish idea. To sell tickets allowing a pedestrian to enter the mind of a famous celebrity. The tagline Ever wanted to be someone else? Now you can.It is very intriguing how the narrative point of view is juggled between Craig and then Lotte after the problem is introduced and then solved the couples deadend lives are lifted in glory. This creates a second conflict moving us smoothly into the second act. Perfect internal problems are created with the two female leads Lotte and Maxine find themselves physically attracted to each other in unbelievable character twists. The two end up having a femininity sexual relationship while one is entrapped in the mind of Malkovich and the other experiences the actual Malkovich. It is a beautifully crafted structure with act breaks so clear and complications so faultless it is no wonder while this is such an effective picture.Also first rate here are the performances. Although the film offers strange types of roles for these actors to indulge themselves in they do a wonderfully energetic job. Cameron Diaz is flawlessly cast as Craig's sexually and mentally uncoordinated wife and delivers us a comically riotous character. John Cusack as Craig himself is superior and believable as a down on his luck puppeteer and possesses a perfect blend of humor and unpredictable qualities with his character. Also quite good here John Malkovich who has much more of a difficult role than one would think. He has some hard scenes where Craig controls him while inside his mind which requires great skill to perform.However better than any performance and more amazing then any flawless characters or plot is the concept of a human being thinking up such an absurd idea as the imagination behind the beauty of Being John Malkovich. With such a penetrating magical atmosphere to it it is kind of a shame that the filmmakers created this film in the form of a black comedy instead of something more harrowing. Although comedy is simply the most logical choice to categorize this type of film wouldn't it have been interesting to see this movie as a drama or perhaps as a spiritual awakening picture.Regardless the film still has an oddly powerful message to it which I will not nor do I ever directly reveal in any of my reviews. You see since different individuals come from different backgrounds and thus see things differently. It is because of this that I do not allow my personal take on a message persuade another filmgoer whose idea of a moral may be much different than my own. But I will say that Being John Malkovich might not overtake the box office but for appreciative movie patrons this one is sure to be treasured for a long time to come.Brought to you by Gramercy Pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "What does it feel like to be inside someone else's skin?  Some people find out in the highly imaginative Being John Malkovich' directed with style by Spike Jonze and starring John Cusack Cameron Diaz Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.  When out of work puppeteer Craig Schwartz Cusack gets a job as a file clerk on the 7 12' floor of an office building it's the beginning of a bizarre interlude that will ultimately take him and a few others as well into a realm beyond the known.  One day he discovers a small doorway hidden behind a filing cabinet curious he ventures into the dark beyond and is suddenly sucked into the mind of actor John Malkovich.  After fifteen minutes of seeing through Malkovich's eyes and experiencing what the actor is experiencing Craig is just as suddenly and inexplicably dropped into a ditch beside the New Jersey Turnpike.  Unable to contain himself he confides what has happened to him to Maxine Catherine Keener a woman who also works on 7 12.  Immediately she sees money in the prospect of having a portal into the mind of John Malkovich and she convinces Craig that they should start a business  J.M. Inc.'  For two hundred dollars a pop people can have the experience of a lifetime.Jonze has taken a unique screenplay that is clever witty humorous and totally engrossing and turned it into one of the most ingenious films to come our way in a long long time.  In fact there's never been anything quite like it.  It is distinct and filled with nuance and subtle shades of humor sometimes dark sometimes hilarious but riveting throughout.  And the performances are absolutely first rate all around.  Keener deservedly got the Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress but Cusack Diaz and Bean are also exemplary here.  Cusack comes through with one of the best characters he's ever done there's an edgy quiet intelligence to Craig a Bohemian at heart with a wife Lotte Diaz and an apartment full of pets snakes birds and a chimp.  He's reserved generally takes things as they come and exudes a certain boyish charm when he becomes smitten with Maxine.  Diaz taking on a decidedly unglamorous role is terrific as Lotte the somewhat unremarkable pet shop clerk who comes alive after experiencing the portal.' It's a great character part and Diaz plays it for all it's worth connecting with the audience while ably conveying Lotte's sense of confusion and repressed yearnings.  And Orson Bean nearly steals the show as Dr. Lester Craig's boss the hundredandfive year old man with a secret that holds the key to the portal.  It's a memorable performance filled with nuance and subtle humor the scene in which he interviews jobapplicant Craig is classic.  Malkovich as himself is the icing on the cake he plays it straight with a finesse and distinction that makes the unbelievable somehow credible while lending an easy natural flow to the innate humor of the story.  The Malkovich Malkovich' sequence and his rendition of the puppet's dance are unforgettable scenes.The supporting cast includes Mary Kay Place Floris Charlie Sheen Charlie Carlos Jacott Larry Willie Garson Guy in restaurant and Byrne Piven Captain Mertin.  Written by Charlie kaufman Being John Malkovich' is a movie that is an experience in itself.  And Jonze and his entire cast should be given a standing ovation for bringing this one to life for making it breathe.  It's the kind of film you wait for to come along but rarely does and it demands to be seen more than once.  Like Lotte once you've been through the portal you have to do it again once you've tasted the nectar there's no turning back.   1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Originality is one thing that I very much admire in cinema and it's also the reason I rate Being John Malkovich so highly. Charlie Kaufman has taken an amazingly weird premise and twisted round a suitably offbeat story to create a movie that is as bizarre as it is as it is compelling and it's definitely a major highlight of American cinema in the 1990's. Charlie Kaufman may have scripted his most acclaimed film in 2004 with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but if you want to see his best work  you need look no further than his first feature. Quite how anyone could have thought of this premise remains a mystery but I'm certainly glad that Kaufman did. The story revolves around a portal that leads directly into the head of the actor John Malkovich. After discovering this portal puppeteer Craig Schwartz shares it with his colleague and crush the beautiful Maxine Lund. Things start to get complicated when Craig's wife Lottie becomes involved and it turns out that Craig's not the only one with a crush on Maxine.The usually presentable John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are completely unrecognisable as this film's leading couple and both give career highlight performances. Catherine Keener fleshes out a threesome of leads. She is seductively sexy and delivers a performance that reflects the quality of this film on the whole. And of course John Malkovich stars also. The fact that it's John Malkovich who is the title actor is what really makes this film. Had the film have been say 'Being Tom Cruise' it wouldn't have had nearly the same impact. Malkovich is a big actor but he's not THAT big and the fact that it's him takes the film away from the mainstream and allows it's offbeat indie roots to stay intact. Kaufman ensures that the story works by constantly adding new and weird events into the plot and this in turn ensures that we never know what's coming next. Of course this is exactly what you want from any film. The elements of the story aren't bound tightly enough to really make a lasting impression where substance is concerned but it hardly matters as there's enough offbeat invention in this film to more than adequately mask that fact It's easy to call this movie pretentious or silly but it's also pointless. Being John Malkovich is a modern classic.".

	schema:headline " Weird and original does not make for a great film";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one film that has me completely torn.  On the one hand there is so much to admire about Being John Malkovich.  The film is rich with great performances it is directed very well by a new comer it is a wonderfully original idea and seeing John Malcovich have the guts to portray himself or to parody himself is quite amazing.  But on the other hand there is much to critisize about this movie.  It is slow it doesn't really have a point and the only metaphors that I can get from the film are not clear or really that mind blowing and the last half an hour of the film is plain and simplybad.  I really think that this is the type of film that cannot fail critically critics are too afraid to tell it like it is when it comes to an arty film like this one.  It is safe and obvious to critisize a film like Armageddon or Bone Collector but admitting that you didn't really enjoy a film such as this is tricky as a critic because you may look foolish to your cronies so naturally all of them come out and tell you how wonderful and amazing and great and ya da ya da ya da this film is.  But the one thing that I noticed when I read all of the reviews before I saw the film is that not one review really told me why this film is all that they say it is and that is because it isn't.  As I said there is much to admire about Being John Malkovich just not a lot to like.  But I will tell you what is good before I tell you what isn't.The performances are incredible.  John Cusack Cameron Diaz Katherine Keener and John Malkovich turn in stellar portrayals of who they are. Cusack is the eccentric puppeteer that can't seem to get a break in life Diaz is his repressed wife that perhaps only a few years ago would have been not just smart but down right gorgeous.  Now she doesn't care about herself only her animals that she cares for which includes a repressed monkey.  She goes through one of the biggest awakenings.  Keener plays Maxine a sexy bitch that Cusack falls in lust for and then love.  She is a bit of an enigma yet she is very self assured.  And of course Malkovich plays a version of himself perhaps a version that we the public think he is.  All four of these performances are rich and deeply layered.  The story is also good in the sense that it is different than anything I have seen.  It is fresh and nice at times to see a movie that is different than anything you have seen before.  This is one of those movies and I enjoyed it for that reason.  But that is where my praise ends.  That is all that I can really say is good about the film.  While the film has it's moments of comedy and of interesting observations about life  the big one being not to live vicariously through someone else or you may lose your identity  it just didn't keep me interested or entertained for the majority of the film and especially for the last half hour.  And for me to really enjoy a film and to think it is worth recommending to others there has to be something to keep my interest.  This film just moves along and seems to go nowhere.  It doesn't have anything really great to say and it doesn't really take you anywhere.  As I said sure it is different but that does not make it good. I do have a feeling that this film is going to get a rediculous amount of mention at Oscar time but that is not fair.  There are at least five films that I think are worthy of Oscar mention before this one and other bound to be great films haven't even come out yet  The Green Mile just to name one .I think perhaps this is a film that should be seen once because maybe what I get or didn't get out of it is completely different than what someone else will.  After all there are many positive reviews in this very forum and perhaps that is saying something but I personally don't like the film all that much and I think there are many films at the theater that are worth your time more than this one is.  If you see it don't say you haven't been warned.  This is one film that I think the general public is wrong about and the longer it stays out the more people will have a chance to see it and then people will realize that weird and original does make it great.  It deserves kudos for being like that but not praise.  There is a difference.".

The story is also good in the sense that it is different than anything I have seen.  It is fresh and nice at times to see a movie that is different than anything you have seen before.  This is one of those movies and I enjoyed it for that reason.  But that is where my praise ends.  That is all that I can really say is good about the film.  While the film has it's moments of comedy and of interesting observations about life  the big one being not to live vicariously through someone else or you may lose your identity  it just didn't keep me interested or entertained for the majority of the film and especially for the last half hour.  And for me to really enjoy a film and to think it is worth recommending to others there has to be something to keep my interest.  This film just moves along and seems to go nowhere.  It doesn't have anything really great to say and it doesn't really take you anywhere.  As I said sure it is different but that does not make it good. I do have a feeling that this film is going to get a rediculous amount of mention at Oscar time but that is not fair.  There are at least five films that I think are worthy of Oscar mention before this one and other bound to be great films haven't even come out yet  The Green Mile just to name one .I think perhaps this is a film that should be seen once because maybe what I get or didn't get out of it is completely different than what someone else will.  After all there are many positive reviews in this very forum and perhaps that is saying something but I personally don't like the film all that much and I think there are many films at the theater that are worth your time more than this one is.  If you see it don't say you haven't been warned.  This is one film that I think the general public is wrong about and the longer it stays out the more people will have a chance to see it and then people will realize that weird and original does make it great.  It deserves kudos for being like that but not praise.  There is a difference.";

Sure there is a portal that leads into John Malkovich's head. But what they do with it is the least imaginable thing. And why even John Malkovich? The writer Charlie Kaufman has said that Malkovich was always his first and only choice but I just don't see why. He certainly stands out because of his looks and he has the acting skills to play the different people inhabiting his head but aside from that there's nothing interesting about him shown in this film. He lives in an apartment tries out for roles and that's it.Plus the fact that the main character is a puppeteer. Okay at first that's interesting. It's out there not something we see in every movie and jives well with the whole bizarre first third the movie has. But then it is stretched way out of proportion with much of the running length dedicated to odes to puppetry. Why? Sure there's the joke about the ultimate puppet but there needs to be more than that. Now it barely connects with anything.Then there are the romance subplots which are passable though boring and mainly there to move the plot along. The final truth about the portal is also pretty lame. It's pretty much what you would guess if you sat and thought for a minute.All in all Being John Malkovich was a huge disappointment for me. If you have a story about a portal that allows you to control a real life Hollywood star go all out. Don't give us this halfway there balderdash. Be Terry Gilliam. Make it as weird as possible. Attempting to put logic and cohesive narrative into it only waters it down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being John Malkovich. This is one of those odd little films that is near impossible to critique. A fantasy of sorts about a struggling puppeteer John Cusack who takes a job at a strange office where he starts to work with an odd 105yearold boss Orson Bean and a beautiful but heartless coworker Oscarnominee Catherine Keener. The office itself has sixfoot ceilings and is located on the seven and a half floor. The weirdness does not stop when Cusack goes home as his wife an almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz is struggling working with her animals as a type of researcher and questions her own sexuality and dreams of perhaps having a sex change one day. Still with me? Cusack becomes disenchanted with Diaz and falls for the cold Keener. Meanwhile he finds a passageway which leads to the mind of John Malkovich through the office. He tells Diaz and Keener and more confusion ensues. Diaz now is even more sexually confused and Keener comes up with a plan to make money off the discovery by charging admission to all comers who wish to see what Malkovich sees for 15 minutes. Keener falls in love with the body of Malkovich Diaz falls in love with the possibility of being Malkovich all the time and Cusack wants Keener at all costs. Malkovich learns of what is going on but what can he do? Cusack discovers how he can get Keener go into Malkovich and stay there forever. This will also launch the career in puppeteering that he so desperately wants. However boss Orson Bean and some of his other ridiculously elderly friends have had plans the whole time to take over Malkovich's body and live forever but Cusack's plans have gotten in the way. Now they will do whatever possible to jump into Malkovich to keep from dying. There are so many oddball situations that the viewer's head may be spinning trying to keep it all straight. There are undertones aplenty in this film. Medical cloning lesbianism sexual obsession sexchange operations sexual threesomes the question of mindcontrol physical attractions mental deficiencies the rights of individuals the mad world of media the exploration of quick moneymaking schemes the exploration of relationships in the workplace and the general disdain of individuals in the workplace are all somewhat explored subjects in Being John Malkovich. Some subjects are subtle while others slap you in the face. In all the film is a fantasy for the 1999 crowd. The only difference is that it deals with subjects that have been or could be more prevalent to the real world. Spike Jonze shows real potential here with his direction. This was far from a easy film to put together. Charlie Kaufman must also be given kudos for a creative screenplay. It is not quite a great script but it is definitely interesting and unique. The performers are also good. John Malkovich does well with a strange role. John Cusack continues to show real versatility. Cameron Diaz does her best but seems a bit outofplace in a film like this at times. Catherine Keener is the bolt of lightning that keeps everyone on their toes. Her Oscar nomination was welldeserved. There are also cameos galore big surprise. Sean Penn and Charlie Sheen are among those who make token appearances throughout the film. Many have said that Being John Malkovich is a film that will mean more in the future. I am not sure about this. I doubt that it will be as trailblazing as say 2001 A Space Odyssey. This is a unique experience that is a curiosity. The fact that it will have so many tireless imitations will not help its case either. 4 stars out of 5.".

A fantasy of sorts about a struggling puppeteer John Cusack who takes a job at a strange office where he starts to work with an odd 105yearold boss Orson Bean and a beautiful but heartless coworker Oscarnominee Catherine Keener. The office itself has sixfoot ceilings and is located on the seven and a half floor. The weirdness does not stop when Cusack goes home as his wife an almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz is struggling working with her animals as a type of researcher and questions her own sexuality and dreams of perhaps having a sex change one day.

	schema:reviewBody "Well first of I want to make clear that I am a person who is not put off by out there concepts nor am I intellectually devoid. I only point this out as many people seem to think they could be the only reasons why a person could not enjoy this 'masterpiece'. I'm not going to say this film's awful but I will say it's over rated. All the cast put in a good performance and I particularly enjoyed John Cusack as I usually do yet I felt cheated by this film. Firstly the concept of delving into someone elses mind in some kind of voyeuristic power trip is nothing new it has been explored in novels before today and even video games i.e. Body Rides by Richard Laymon and the game Psychic Detective. I state this to show that the idea behind this film isn't so revolutionary as some may think. In Laymon's Body Rides a bracelet is used to go in the mind of others and coincidentally the main character in the story ultimately uses the bracelet to jump into somebody elses mind to escape death. And in Psychic Detective the main character can do the same merely by though. I'm not saying the stories are identical but they do share common ideas. Secondly I just couldn't relate to the characters I know they were supposed to be obnoxious but I ended up almost not giving a damn about them as a result of this. However at this point I must point out something that did touch me in this film it was Cusack's character Craig who's fate was somewhat undeserved and I felt sympathy for him his act showing that he did indeed love Maxine and I also found the thought of Malkovich's daughter becoming the next vessel disturbing as in essence LesterMalkovichetc was stealing somebody's life. To sum up as a whole the film did have points where I chuckled or felt something but I ultimately felt denied and I think people should allow other people to think that this film isn't as good as it has been made out to be. In my opinion if a friend has it borrow it and see for yourself but don't waste your money on a rental or a DVD it's just not worth it. Even if you enjoy fringe cinema as I do you will find no substance in this film to satisfy you only a huge hollow space around which there is a thinly woven plot.".

It's incredibly strange and surreal and some people like that but even if one does I can't imagine how one would not be bored out of one's skull by this intellectimpoverished movie.The story starts out with a struggling puppeteer who gets an office job. But the office is located on floor 7 12 which is between floors 7 and 8 in an office building. Although there is a bit in the movie that gives a pseudoexplanation for it the characters don't really believe what they are told and neither did I. We never find out where floor 7 12 came from which I might have found mildly annoying if I were interested enough to care which I wasn't.While working the puppeteer finds a small doorway that leads him into John Malkovich's brain. The story if it weren't strange already just gets stranger from there. They charge people money to be John Malkovich for 15 minutes and when you're done you end up on the New Jersey Turnpike how you get there is never explained. I don't mind a bit of the surreal in a film but to have the whole entire movie be stranger than your oddest dreams is just unpleasant.But it's not just the weird goingson in the movie that made me dislike it. The movie was utterly boring. I did not care a fig about any of the characters in it. I fell asleep twice watching the DVD and had to rewind and watch the parts I'd slept through the second time I almost just shut it off instead. If I hadn't paid my hardearned money for it I probably wouldn't have finished it to be honest. There's very little reason to keep watching and I spent most of the time eyeballing the clock and hoping for it to be over.If you like strange weird movies with no plot not much character development and no explanation of what is happening or why and where almost nothing happens through the whole movie then you'd probably like Being John Malkovich. If you don't like those things then you probably won't. I don't like them so I did not like this movie.My score 110 and that's only because IMDB doesn't let you give zeros.".

Set in a house in 5 brief acts Half of all onscreen time is spent in the bathroom of all places!

Getting home a day early wifeMeg Ryan catches hubbyTimothy Hutton sneaking out in Stealth Mode. This apparently transports wife to The Twilight Zone because from that moment on she exhibits the most unattorneylike comportment imaginable! Losing touch with reality she decides to kidnap husband until he has retuned to his senses and abandons the idea of abandoning her. Despite some genuinely funny moments SERIOUS fumbles the execution. Novice Director Cheryl HinesWAITRESS introduced the film. She seems like a sweet wonderful person a rather competent actor and a totally unimaginative inexperienced and lackluster director.One sequence midway into the film is particularly annoying Husband and wife tied up in the bathroom begin a prolonged argument. For what seems like an endless loop the only shotsedits we get are pingpong talking heads. That's it! Ms. Hines if you somehow get another shot at directing and the result is not noticeably superior I suggest you hangup your director's cap permanently! Timothy Hutton and a rejuvenated Meg Ryan both turn in commendable but somewhat strained performances Overdirection Perhaps? Two things saved SERIOUS A fair share of laughprovoking moments and acts 3 and 4.Far superior to rest of film So instead of 5IT GETS 6.....ENJOYDISFRUTELA!".

Losing touch with reality she decides to kidnap husband until he has retuned to his senses and abandons the idea of abandoning her. Despite some genuinely funny moments SERIOUS fumbles the execution. Novice Director Cheryl HinesWAITRESS introduced the film. She seems like a sweet wonderful person a rather competent actor and a totally unimaginative inexperienced and lackluster director.One sequence midway into the film is particularly annoying Husband and wife tied up in the bathroom begin a prolonged argument. For what seems like an endless loop the only shotsedits we get are pingpong talking heads. That's it! Ms. Hines if you somehow get another shot at directing and the result is not noticeably superior I suggest you hangup your director's cap permanently! Timothy Hutton and a rejuvenated Meg Ryan both turn in commendable but somewhat strained performances Overdirection Perhaps? Two things saved SERIOUS A fair share of laughprovoking moments and acts 3 and 4.Far superior to rest of film So instead of 5IT GETS 6.....ENJOYDISFRUTELA!";

	schema:reviewBody "If you enjoy films like War of the Roses you should like this one.Basically this is a lovetriangle story about a man Tim Hutton whose planning on leaving his wife Meg Ryan of 14 years for a much younger woman Kristin Bell. The wife doesn't respond well and much inappropriate behavior follows.Not much depth is written into these people but Ryan and Hutton do a rather spectacular job with their roles anyway. Special notice should be given to Justin Long's cameo as a thug. He seems to relish his small 'against typecast' role. Unfortunately Kristin Bell bores us with her very twodimensional performance.The plot tidies itself up rather too quickly from this twisted story but at least we're not left with an overly long film. And the first hour is one of the darkest hours of film I've ever seenin a good way.If you've seen Adrienne Shelly's the writer other film Waitress you'll be familiar with the style of this film. Waitress is a more complete movie with much more depth. However Cheryl Hineswho took over for Shelly after her untimely deathdoes a commendable job.I'm saddened to realize this will be the last work we see from the mind of Adrienne Shelly. As it stands it's not a bad way to be remembered. A writerdirector who had a flair for gracefully exploring people's darkest emotions and desires.And no I'm not just saying this because I'm strapped to a toilet!P.S. This film is not a date flick".

	schema:reviewBody "Based solely on its trailers this movie is already getting a bad rap online with many lambasting it as some 'chick' flick revamp of 'French Kiss'. Don't believe that hooey. This is a dark comedy worthy of Hitchcock and it's far far removed from Meg Ryan's past 'sweetheart' roles.'Serious Moonlight' is a simple characterdriven story of what happens when highpowered lawyer Louise Meg Ryan finds out her husband Ian Timothy Hutton plans to leave her for his younger mistress Sara Kristen Bell. Louise holds Ian hostage the better to make him explain what happened to their marriage. Eventually an unexpected visit by Todd Justin Long forces husband wife and mistress to confront their situation in an unexpected manner.As director Cheryl Hines suggested at the Austin Film Festival QA before and after the movie the film's plot really centers on Ian's character development. I have to agree and I also think Hines was right when she said that Timothy Hutton was perfect for this role.And while some might take Louise's decision to tie her husband up as pathetically desperate I found it entirely believable that such drastic action would be necessary to make a man talk about his real feelings  especially when he's doing something as unoriginally asinine as finding 'real love' with a younger woman. It's no accident that Sara looks conspicuously like young Louise I think and much of the movie's subtext is about the difference between early passion and longterm commitment.This movie often feels like a play in the best sense focusing on small moments and realistic conversation. Its short length stops it from feeling stagey however and the actors all convey their lines with wonderful subtlety.Hines also described the meticulous process of reading through the script with the actors to determine what was funny and what wasn't. I think this was nothing short of genius so many nontraditional comedies lose the distinction so you're not sure what the intent of any given scene is. Perhaps because of her strong background in comedy Hines wisely avoids this pitfall making the movie's laughs razorsharp but balancing them with genuinely tense moments.I won't tell you how the movie ends because there's a bit of a twist. But I will be very curious to see what happens when it's released. I suspect that there will be some controversy about the how the film treats the battle of the sexes and I fear some men might cower in the face of Louise's character  Ian certainly does at least at first. But that's almost the point and I'm glad to see a womanauthored womandirected view of male infidelity for once.This darkly comic movie is definitely worth seeing in my opinion and given how seriously funnylady Hines takes her job as director I sincerely hope to see more of her work soon.".

	schema:headline " Unconventional Marriage AutoCounselling With Duct Tape";
	schema:reviewBody "I feel that 'Serious Moonlight' is a misunderstood movie. People seem to be under the impression that it's just another 'French Kiss' mostly because of the misleading trailer. The similarities are minimal. The references perhaps unintentional are quite amusing but it must be said that 'Serious Moonlight' is no romantic comedy. It's more of a black comedy about a couple going through a stale marriage that is on the brink of breaking point. When the husband announces that he's leaving his wife for a twinkie in a final desperate attempt the wife tries to win him back. However she doesn't follow him all the way to Paris which is what happened in 'French Kiss'.

	onyx:emotionText "I feel that 'Serious Moonlight' is a misunderstood movie. People seem to be under the impression that it's just another 'French Kiss' mostly because of the misleading trailer. The similarities are minimal. The references perhaps unintentional are quite amusing but it must be said that 'Serious Moonlight' is no romantic comedy. It's more of a black comedy about a couple going through a stale marriage that is on the brink of breaking point. When the husband announces that he's leaving his wife for a twinkie in a final desperate attempt the wife tries to win him back. However she doesn't follow him all the way to Paris which is what happened in 'French Kiss'.

	schema:reviewBody "Louise Because my love you are going to stay there until we work things out. And so begins this drama between a married couple with no children he a corporate office employee she a successful lawyer.I agree with most all previous posters mentioned. To pull off a story that will keep you interested until the very end with just 3 major players is quite a feat. The strength lies of course in the powerful dialogue between them. But more than that this story is not just a flick on failed relationships but on WHY they fail. Luoise Meg Ryan cannot and will not accept the fact that Ian Timothy Hutton her husband wishes to leave her. She cannot accept he has fallen in love with a lovely younger woman. But the truth is not so simple. If you listen carefully past the hurt locker you will hear reasons good ones as to why these things happen. The fault is not entirely the wife's but it is not entirely the husband's either. What happens is that in most cases problems never get talked about and discussed. In this story events unfolded in such a way they were forced to.But then again we have the usual guiltblame game. It took both of them quite some time to accept where they had failed Louise much longer than Ian. In the middle you have Sara Kristen Bell who obviously loved Ian and went to lengths to fight for him. In the end as they say may the best man or woman win but if you notice carefully there was something lacking in Ian when these scenes were being played out something which makes you think  Ok now seriously are you gonna be a man about this or what? I couldn't help feeling sorry for the girl  she was obviously sincere and showed it without compunction.However just when you think you've got it all figured out and you see the pieces falling into place well here comes the final scene where you say What? what just happened...hello? what was that? run that by me again? and you feel like I did like the wind had just been knocked out of me and I sat staring at the screen wondering what I saw. Ingenious! I'm sitting here writing this and still turning this scene over and over in my mind contemplating the different possible meanings.I don't agree the movie is a waste of time or disappointing. Don't think this is another exercise at flogging the dead horse of marital whathaveyou problems. No this is an ingenious and wellwritten story a bit off the regular path yes and bizarre in some ways but well done. I don't think anyone's acting was poor either. The humorous parts made me laugh and the sad ones made me shake my head in sorrow.Watch it and enjoy yourself! Well worth it!!".

Early on I began to sense all was not as it seemed. And it's not.Everything in the movie points to it being a set up by Louise. Let's count the ways  From the moment she arrived at the house her whole attitude is fake innocent. Any other woman would be suspicious that her husband had strewn rose petals all over the place but wasn't expecting his wife.Lawn boy shows up oh so conveniently just after Louise goes into town for food.Lawn boy is listening to music on his riding mower and cannot hear hubby's screams for help or banging on the bathroom window. Where does he decide to shut off the mower and remove his head set? Directly beneath the bathroom window.When Louise returns to the house her confrontation with lawn boy is entirely off camera. We just see the fishbowl smash and hear her screams and see the alarm on hubby's face. It's all an act by Louise and lawn boy.When lawn boy drags Louise into the bathroom apparently unconscious and tapes her up the husband begins his long tearful confession that he really loves her. Supposedly she is knocked out and not hearing it but the camera shows close ups of her face. She does not look unconscious. It is strongly hinted she is hearing this.Lawn boy acts all lustful over Louise even feeling her up when unconscious. Then he turns to hubby and says something like How could you not want this?If you really want to immobilize someone with duct tape you tape their hands behind their back not in front.Louise has her hands duct taped in front of her. There are broken mirror shards on the floor. Hello?When husband said he hoped the crooks would not take the heirloom silver set a red flag went up and I said they won't. They didn't. What kind of crooks leave behind a chest of silver sitting in plain sight? And what kind of crooks clean the house of loot then stick around all night to drink and party? Could it be to give Louise more time with her husband? The only question is how did Louise find out about the affair? And how did she know hubby was going to be at the house a day early preparing to fly to Paris in the morning with his girlfriend? I guess we just have to go along.As to the final scene it could have been better. As Louise her husband and Lawn Boy pass on the street what if they exchanged knowing glances but the husband doesn't see and remains clueless. Way cooler I think.".

Someone said here that Hines only started to direct it after Shelley was killed. I don't know whether that's true but if so I'm guessing there was also a production deadline she had to meet. The directing emphasis as in a play was 100 on getting the best performances from the characters. Anything beyond that was for making each scene work and flow into the next.

Except for the last brilliant scene in town there is no motion no design and no visual artistry in the direction. I'm guessing that there was no time or budget for that. Since i tend to be storyactingand dialog oriented that did not bother me as much as some but if you are looking for visual satisfaction from a film and seeing Timothy Hutton ducttaped to a toilet does not turn you on you should probably look elsewhere.On the otherhand it you are looking for wellacted and offbeat characterdriven entertainment as a way to spend 90 minutes of your day watch the DVD of Serious Moonlight.".

	schema:headline " Genuinely repulsive and execrable";
	schema:reviewBody "Serious Moonlight is an incredibly execrable movie which should be used in film schools as an example of how NOT to make a movie. I can assure you I am not pleased to say this because I generally like the work of Cheryl Hines as a comedian and I would have liked to find some positive elements in her debut as a director. Besides this movie was written by Adrienne Shelly 19662006 a young filmmaker who was tragically murdered 5 years ago and it seems unfair to posthumously speak against a screenplay which may needed various better said a lot of revisions. Having said all that I need to go back to the point Serious Moonlight is an unbearable and repulsive disaster.I still remember the days in which Meg Ryan was considered the queen of the chickflicks. Her presence used to be the the indicator that an insipid romantic story was waiting for us but her natural geniality could make some films from her filmography to be worthy of an at least slight recommendation such as When a Man Loves a Woman and Kate  Leopold. What happened to her career? Sure I perfectly understand that the time went by and that she has now been replaced by younger actresses such as Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway. However I think Ryan is a competent actress so it would not be impossible to see her in adult romances. Or better yet she could accept substantial and mature dramatic characters like for example the one she interpreted in Courage Under Fire. So...how did she end up in such an atrocious and cheap movie like Serious Moonlight? So in conclusion Serious Moonlight is a horrible movie which fails in every aspect from its pathetic screenplay to its atrocious direction. I hope Hines will not direct a movie anymore and that she will only keep working as an actress. As for Shelly...well I will try to remember her only for the entertaining Waitress which she had written and directed.".

I can assure you I am not pleased to say this because I generally like the work of Cheryl Hines as a comedian and I would have liked to find some positive elements in her debut as a director. Besides this movie was written by Adrienne Shelly 19662006 a young filmmaker who was tragically murdered 5 years ago and it seems unfair to posthumously speak against a screenplay which may needed various better said a lot of revisions.

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I knew the basic premise but wondered if they could pull it off. In my opinion they did very well. I also found this to be a unique story. A woman who just learns her husband has decided to leave her absolutely refuses to accept this even though he is very clear that he is not only not in love with her anymore but has a girlfriend who he is planning a new life with. He is very specific about his reasons and the only thing left for him to do is leave. Not so simple when your wife decides that she's NOT going to let you leave her and holds you captive until she convinces you that you are wrong and that despite what you think you DO actually still love her.Ryan plays this role to perfection and she vacillates between heartbroken wife to complete sociopath and is remarkably convincing at portraying both. This movie is a bit similar to Misery. Knowing Ryans movies for many years where she's the good sweet girl love interest adorable girlfriend.....it's fun to see her in such a dark role and in my opinion perfectly cast because she's still cute as a button but juxtaposed against the diabolical nature of her character was brilliant. There's lots more I could say but don't wanna spoil anything.".

	schema:headline " OffKilter Elements Keeps Things Afloat in Adrienne Shelly's Swan Song as a Screenwriter";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been a full two decades since Meg Ryan emerged from a series of background girlfriend roles to become America's Sweetheart in 1989's When Harry Met Sally but in this strangely conceived 2009 comedy she still has that undeniable twinkle in spite of all the agedefying cosmetic alterations to her face. The screenplay is the last work of the late actress Adrienne Shelly who wrote directed and costarred in 2007's agreeably idiosyncratic Waitress and what they have in common is her supple dexterity in balancing the offkilter elements of her stories into something deeper. This time she takes a darker less whimsical path in exposing the insidious nature of a marriage that has dissipated from a lack of communication. Her Waitress costar Cheryl Hines Curb Your Enthusiasm takes the helm in her directorial debut and her lack of experience may attribute to the fact that it feels more like a filmed stage play despite Nancy Schreiber's expert cinematography.The brief story focuses on married couple Louise and Ian on a day when they unexpectedly cross paths at their bucolic vacation home. A highpowered fortyish attorney she comes home to find her house showered romantically with rose petals and Ian writing a Dear Jane letter to her. He has decided after thirteen years of marriage that he wants a divorce so he can rendezvous with his 24yearold girlfriend Sarah in Paris. Unwilling to accept that her marriage has gone kaput Louise inadvertently knocks him out with a flower pot and takes advantage of his unconsciousness in order to duct tape him to a chair until he relents. This is the beginning of a roundelay in which they spar about the merits of their marriage. Ian spends most of the 84minute running time stuck on the toilet as he faces one humiliation after another. Even though Louise exhibits vaguely sociopathic behavior she does not represent the only threat to Ian.There is a nasty twist to the story in the form of an interloper that turns their vituperative catandmouse game into a game of survival. The open ending doesn't quite satisfy although the implications that it raises lends texture to what has gone on before. Ryan acquits herself well as Louise and although it's not remarkable work it shows that the actress could thrive into middleage with her fizzy spirit intact. She manages to give heart to the tenacious hold her character has on her flailing marriage. In a welcome bigscreen return as Ian Timothy Hutton does what he can under a lot of duct tape in a mostly passive role with moments of vented exasperation while Kristin Bell Forgetting Sarah Marshall shows surprising grit as Sarah especially toward the end when the women grapple on the bathroom floor. Justin Long provides a menacing edge to the smallish role of the lawnmowing lowlife. More than Hines' workmanlike direction Shelly's somewhat uneven screenplay offers enough dark elements to make the contrived setup worth accepting for the sake of the unfolding story she wanted to tell.".

She was more annoying than Kristen Bell and that's saying something. The plot line and filming are atrocious. The interactions of all the parties involved are insincere or just plain weird The fake cat fight. There is little or no continuity in any of the initial setups of the movie Ryan is initially presented as a hardworking romantic woman. She quickly transcends into a head case that ties her husband to the toilet and feeds him cookies. Oh then she returns to being the romantic stable woman who tries to salvage her relationship with the husband. Out of the two people I saw this movie with one of them actually enjoyed it and one of them slept through the whole thing.

	schema:reviewBody "Far from being an 'easy' film even difficult at times I thought that Song of Songs was a pretty visionary piece for a first time director. Visually it's almost stunning intellectually it's challenging. The images are very striking. The way in which the camera focuses on the backs of the characters' heads makes it very intimate in its emphasis. In fact I found it almost reminiscent of Bergman's Persona at some points. It is this intimacy which the director explores through image rather than speech which makes the film something a little special in comparison to other British films around at the moment.I thought that this investment in the characters was pretty well balanced out by the more existential questions that the film throws up. These questions are to an extent left unanswered but isn't part of the beauty of cinema that the audience is left still pondering those questions after the credits go up? It does deal with some tricky issues to link sexuality and its repression to faith and orthodoxy is in the present climate an ambitious task. And even if the answers the film does give are shocking and difficult I think the contradictions that the audience is left with are ultimately not due to any incoherence in the film itself but reflect the difficulties of the issues the film confronts. An ambitious piece but well worth seeing for this ambition alone. And if ambition doesn't tempt you then it's worth seeing to see Nathalie Press  her performance demonstrates her chameleon abilities. Chalfen does a good job too. Finally a new director who has made something a little different inside the British Film Industry! I hope it gets a general release beyond the ICA.".

	schema:headline " Image is everything";
	schema:reviewBody "Goodbye Lover is a quite good dark comedy about  as Jake Dunmore says quoting his brother Ben  Image is everything. Everything in this movie is about image and yet nothing is at it appears. And in this respect the very context of the movie sustains the content exceedingly well it's a beautifully shot movie  too pretty in fact. So pretty it's easy to miss the fetidness just beneath the surface.Almost every shot is too shiny too glossy too seamless too meticulously composed. Many scenes are suffused with those ubiquitous cinematic blues and oranges contemporary DPs and directors like so much but raised to such a degree that it almost enters the realm of the fanciful. Many other scenes are done in hitech blacks whites and grays. Everything is window dressing  reality is nothing more than appearance beautifully symbolized by mirrors everywhere. Lots of mirrors shiny surfaces glass  windows all reflecting everyone to everyone else a world of appearances without substance without soul. And when people aren't being reflected in mirrors they're being framed behind glass a diorama for display. The world is just one big department store window.Yet just as a structurally crumbling termiteridden house can be painted to look pristine and beautiful so does this shiny veneer hide the most vicious rapacious cynical behavior. Indeed the world in which this takes place may look beautiful but it is very very empty and ugly. And as such this is a kind of morality tale that shows the dangers to a society that lives strictly for appearance.There are few movies I can think of which so excellently explore this tense boundary between the shiny packaging and the rancid stuff it hides. As Ben Dunmore says People worry that it's a dangerous and shtty world. And it is our job to make it look safe and clean. Thus our hero works at a PR firm packaging a morally bankrupt politician as a wholesome devout family man the president of the PR firm pretends to be a holy man  a rather inherent contradiction our two principals work in a church that obviously serves Mammon over anything else religion is just another accoutrement something to accessorize the soul and then there's the wedding chapel in Las Vegas where an unctuous smile sells ersatz sincerity. Sorry. Etc. In fact it's surprising how many such examples of this there are in the movie  the writers were very inventive and consistent in coming up with such a profusion of image vs substance motifs.The only person in this world of appearances who doesn't belong Detective Rollins is a Fcking Mook  as his partner Sergeant Rita Pompano Ellen Degeneres calls him. For him appearance is reality. His sincerity is regarded with mocking disbelief by everybody he obviously doesn't understand the rules of the game that everyone else is playing. Even we the audience take sides against him  that's how subtly subversive and well presented  even seductive  this world is.And speaking of Ellen Degeneres she is great in this movie. Others complain that she isn't funny or witty merely insulting. But in one of those delightful twists where the line between fiction and reality dissolves this is her payback for the flack she took from the forces of christian oppression after she came out of the closet. Ellen obviously relishes this role  she mercilessly mocks her Mormon partner gets to be a guy and for an attractive woman she is laudably unattractive in this role and at the end of the movie looks ridiculous when she dresses in drag.This may also be Don Johnson's best movie. For once he gets to play the kind of character he seems uniquely equipped to play a highend used car salesman all style all flash sexy in his way but empty and sleazy. It's very fitting that when he says he's trying to get something real in his life he unknowingly gets quite the opposite.  And since he wants to leave the game he no longer belongs in this world  and is appropriately removed from the game.Sometimes the symbolism is a bit heavyhanded Go For It billboard as is the writing You need to go down on your knees for her. Well someone obviously did.. But it's all in good spirits and I'm willing to accept its blemishes as it were 'cause it succeeds admirably in most other respects. And the acting in general is uniformly solid  in fact it's very well cast even the curiously unfatale femme fatale Patricia Arquette.The movie ends on a wonderfully humorous note to the tune of Climb Every Mountain as image thoroughly triumphs over substance much as it does in real life  which may be the reason this movie doesn't sit well with many people.The filmmakers obviously had fun making this movie and it shows. All in all it's a very wellmade fun movie  if you scratch its surface. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "Goodbye Lover is a quite good dark comedy about  as Jake Dunmore says quoting his brother Ben  Image is everything. Everything in this movie is about image and yet nothing is at it appears. And in this respect the very context of the movie sustains the content exceedingly well it's a beautifully shot movie  too pretty in fact. So pretty it's easy to miss the fetidness just beneath the surface.Almost every shot is too shiny too glossy too seamless too meticulously composed. Many scenes are suffused with those ubiquitous cinematic blues and oranges contemporary DPs and directors like so much but raised to such a degree that it almost enters the realm of the fanciful. Many other scenes are done in hitech blacks whites and grays. Everything is window dressing  reality is nothing more than appearance beautifully symbolized by mirrors everywhere. Lots of mirrors shiny surfaces glass  windows all reflecting everyone to everyone else a world of appearances without substance without soul. And when people aren't being reflected in mirrors they're being framed behind glass a diorama for display. The world is just one big department store window.Yet just as a structurally crumbling termiteridden house can be painted to look pristine and beautiful so does this shiny veneer hide the most vicious rapacious cynical behavior. Indeed the world in which this takes place may look beautiful but it is very very empty and ugly. And as such this is a kind of morality tale that shows the dangers to a society that lives strictly for appearance.There are few movies I can think of which so excellently explore this tense boundary between the shiny packaging and the rancid stuff it hides. As Ben Dunmore says People worry that it's a dangerous and shtty world. And it is our job to make it look safe and clean. Thus our hero works at a PR firm packaging a morally bankrupt politician as a wholesome devout family man the president of the PR firm pretends to be a holy man  a rather inherent contradiction our two principals work in a church that obviously serves Mammon over anything else religion is just another accoutrement something to accessorize the soul and then there's the wedding chapel in Las Vegas where an unctuous smile sells ersatz sincerity. Sorry. Etc. In fact it's surprising how many such examples of this there are in the movie  the writers were very inventive and consistent in coming up with such a profusion of image vs substance motifs.The only person in this world of appearances who doesn't belong Detective Rollins is a Fcking Mook  as his partner Sergeant Rita Pompano Ellen Degeneres calls him. For him appearance is reality. His sincerity is regarded with mocking disbelief by everybody he obviously doesn't understand the rules of the game that everyone else is playing. Even we the audience take sides against him  that's how subtly subversive and well presented  even seductive  this world is.And speaking of Ellen Degeneres she is great in this movie. Others complain that she isn't funny or witty merely insulting. But in one of those delightful twists where the line between fiction and reality dissolves this is her payback for the flack she took from the forces of christian oppression after she came out of the closet. Ellen obviously relishes this role  she mercilessly mocks her Mormon partner gets to be a guy and for an attractive woman she is laudably unattractive in this role and at the end of the movie looks ridiculous when she dresses in drag.This may also be Don Johnson's best movie. For once he gets to play the kind of character he seems uniquely equipped to play a highend used car salesman all style all flash sexy in his way but empty and sleazy. It's very fitting that when he says he's trying to get something real in his life he unknowingly gets quite the opposite.  And since he wants to leave the game he no longer belongs in this world  and is appropriately removed from the game.Sometimes the symbolism is a bit heavyhanded Go For It billboard as is the writing You need to go down on your knees for her. Well someone obviously did.. But it's all in good spirits and I'm willing to accept its blemishes as it were 'cause it succeeds admirably in most other respects. And the acting in general is uniformly solid  in fact it's very well cast even the curiously unfatale femme fatale Patricia Arquette.The movie ends on a wonderfully humorous note to the tune of Climb Every Mountain as image thoroughly triumphs over substance much as it does in real life  which may be the reason this movie doesn't sit well with many people.The filmmakers obviously had fun making this movie and it shows.

It was not the least bit boring the second time even though the film relies heavily on its plot twists and the suspense they produce. I think many people just don't come to terms with crossovers they want either a suspense film that takes itself dead serious or a clear cut comedy. I liked the humor in the film and its outrageous characters well played by a perfectly assembled cast. Patricia Arquette is just great a pleasure to watch! She deserves the price for the funniest sociopath femme fatale ever seen on the silver screen. Vincent Gallo in his tiny role as contract killer is the icing on the cake! The film is superbly shot and directed and features a brilliant soundtrack. I voted it a 9.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening scene of Goodbye Lover is perhaps the most subtle part of the whole film Patricia Arquette as Sandra an LA realtor is shown driving down a busy LA freeway while listening intently to a selfmotivational tape. With this as evidence we just know this chick's nuts. And as the movie goes on our suspicions are proved correct we watch as Sandra schemes to kill her husband Jake Dermot Mulroney along with her lover who also happens to be Jake's brother Ben Don Johnson in a particularly solid performance. But after Sandra's plan succeeds we learn that things aren't nearly as simple as they seem.Rather as we meet more and more characters we find that each one is secretly screwing the other In both senses of the word. A good girl played by MaryLouise Parker and a cynical LA cop played by Ellen DeGeneres become embroiled in Sandra's web of deceit and as each person succumbs to hisher avarice the script gets funnier and funnier. In the end it's a close tie between Arquette and Ellen for the most memorable moments in the film but both characters have certain qualities that make them enjoyable to watch. Arquette's Sandra is a seductive and especially shrewd femme fatale who hums choruses from the Sound of Music while prancing about other people's homes Arquette is the perfect Real Estate Agent From Hell. Meanwhile DeGeneres' Rita Pompano is hilariously aloof to the lives of the people around her casually dropping offhand And almost always crude and sarcastic comments that demonstrate just how wise she is to Sandra's lusty motivations.Sorry to say I can't divulge too much of the film without spoiling it but Goodbye Lover is something like a cross between The Last Seduction and Wild Things. However unlike the ridiculous series of plot twists that just about ruined Wild Things Goodbye Lover manages to avoid being too obvious in order to fulfill one's desire for a satisfying conclusion. Overall I'd have to rate this sexy noirish thriller with a welldeserved A.".

Don Johnson's character is the only interesting one in the entire movie but he's not in it for long and things just go downhill from there. Not that I have anything against this kind of movie one of my favorite movies last year was Wild Things but that movie was smart funny and interesting and had fun characters. This loser of a movie has none of those things the jokes are totally unfunny and the plot developments are not the least bit interesting. Patricia Arquette is not the least bit convincing or all that attractive really as a femme fatale wannabe and Ellen DeGeneres a great actress who could have made this character smart and funny instead makes a character who is boring annoying and rather depressing to watch. Take for example the way she makes fun of her Mormon partner there is no cleverness in her jokes only rudeness and so they all fall flat. The main reason that I was interested in this movie was because I kept hearing about all the great plot twists. Beware there aren't really all that many and none of them are the least bit believable. If you want a good neonoir with fun plot twists go rent Wild Things or The Usual Suspects but leave this loser alone it's not worth the film it's printed on.".

Take for example the way she makes fun of her Mormon partner there is no cleverness in her jokes only rudeness and so they all fall flat. The main reason that I was interested in this movie was because I kept hearing about all the great plot twists. Beware there aren't really all that many and none of them are the least bit believable. If you want a good neonoir with fun plot twists go rent Wild Things or The Usual Suspects but leave this loser alone it's not worth the film it's printed on.";

The characters live in a very sad world where they can never really trust one another. On the same account though they are all so greedy and selfabsorbed that it is hard to truly care for them this is one of those awkward films where it is difficult to find a character to root for. The only ostensibly honorable person is a born again Christian detective played by Roy McKinnon but the way he weaves spirituality into every conversation actually renders him least likable. Ellen DeGeneres also gets on the nerves as McKinnon's wisecracking partner but she does admittedly have her amusing moments. By all accounts this is quite a divisive film with not everyone appreciating what director Roland Joff has opted for by blending neonoir thriller elements with lighthearted humour. As one would expect from a Joff film though it is a well crafted piece of cinema. John Ottman's music score varies effectively between being enchanting and atmospheric and Dante Spinotti's frequently angular cinematography and mobile camerawork ensures that the film is visually arresting. The twists and turns also happen with enough frequency that the film rarely bores even if it is occasionally hard to care for the despicable characters at hand.".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this movie last night on television. It is quite entertaining actually. Ellen DeGeneres plays a Los Angeles homicide detective who arrive after Ben's tragic death. Don Johnson is good at playing Ben. Dermot Mulroney plays his younger brother Jake. Ben is having an affair with his sister in law Sondra played by new Oscar winner Patricia Arquette.

Extremely well acted I loved Joseph Fiennes James Gregory and Dennis Haysbert Nelson Mandela in their roles and Diane Kruger Gloria Gregory did well too. The movie has the slow a bit mysterious charm in it as August's movies usually do. The color scheme was like African dust diluted sometimes almost raw in the scorching sun. Music supported various scenes very well without being too prominent.The movie starts when a young prison warden James Gregory arrives to Robben Island 1968 and is addressed to keep an eye on Nelson Mandela who is being imprisoned there for his political views. Gregory gets this mission because he speaks xhosa the local language and therefore is able to read and censor the correspondence in and out of the prison as well as understand what the prisoners talk to each other.James Gregory is a faithful supporter of apartheid. He believes these black men are behind bars for a good reason and he supports the government politics. After he and his family witness a raid in a busy street where black people are randomly harassed Gregory has to answer the questions of his children  and his explanations sounded shallow even in his own ears. Very slowly over the years he became to see through the apartheid and change his views.Dennis Haysbert was chosen to the role of Mandela because of his quiet distinctive charm and mental power. He did a great job. Joseph Fiennes was chosen because Bille August wanted an actor who was tough and yet sensitive someone who would be able to portray the change in the character in a period of almost thirty years. It was a very challenging role but Joe did a marvelous job.There has been a lot of talk about his South African accent and mostly it has been praised. I followed it very closely and I think Joe did fine in that area too. In some scenes the British accent is more or less audible but most of the time he does a wonderful job.Diane Kruger did a good job as James's wife a mother of two who was also raising their kids to support the apartheid. She opposed her husband being a warden for Nelson Mandela because she could see that the close contact with the inmate made cracks to James's shield and his racistic opinions were vanishing rapidly. She tried to hold onto the apartheid views for much longer than her husband.The movie ends to a year 1990 when Nelson Mandela is released from prison after being incarcerated for 27 years. The era of the new South Africa was to begin.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nelson Mandela plays an important part in Goodbye Bafana but it is not a biography of Mandela. There is potentially a great film to be made on that subject. Rather it is an example of history seen through the eyes of an ordinary man who unexpectedly finds himself playing a significant role. James Gregory is a white South African prison guard. He grew up on a remote farm where his only companions of his own age were African boys and as a result he learnt to speak fluent Xhosa. The Bafana of the title was a friend of Gregory's during his childhood. This ability has made him useful to his superiors. He is transferred to Robben Island the government's highsecurity prison for black political prisoners where he is put in charge of censoring the prisoners' mail and monitoring their conversations with visitors to ensure that they do not discuss forbidden i.e. political topics. The film follows Gregory's career and his political development from the sixties to the end of apartheid in the early nineties. At the beginning of the film he is portrayed as an enthusiastic supporter of the apartheid regime who believes in the superiority of the white race and who accepts racial discrimination as part of the natural order of things. As time goes on however his views start to change partly as a result of the violence he sees directed by the South African police and security forces against the black population partly because he has come to admire Mandela and the other Black political leaders. Whereas he once despised them as Communist terrorists he now sees them as men fighting to right the injustices which their people have suffered. This shift in his political outlook makes Gregory unpopular with other white South Africans especially his colleagues who regard him as a kaffir lover and even leads to strains in his marriage. Gregory's wife Gloria is more conservative than him in her unthinking support for apartheid. Her main concerns however are not with politics but rather with furthering her husband's career and cannot understand why he is putting his prospects at risk with his political stance. There is little in the way of action in this film we hear about the liberation struggle but for the most part we do not see it. It is rather a film of ideas with the most important drama being the one taking place inside Gregory's head. The problem is that Gregory's transformation from reactionary racist to enlightened liberal seems perhaps too predictable. There doubtless were white South Africans including members of the prison service who continued to hold unreconstructed white supremacist views up until the end of apartheid and in some cases even beyond but it is unlikely that a feature film would ever be made these days chronicling the life and opinions of such individuals so we know from the outset that Gregory's views will undergo a complete change in the course of the film. Dennis Haysbert was very good in Far from Heaven but here as Mandela he seems less a living individual than an iconic symbol of dignity and nobility. The German actress Diane Kruger seemed miscast as Gloria. Although she seemed more at home with the English language than she did in Troy her accent often sounded more British than South African. Joseph Fiennes's accent by contrast sounded very convincing to my nonSouth African ears. She also seemed too young in the latter part of the film when Gloria is supposed to have aged nearly thirty years since the opening scenes. Despite these reservations I enjoyed the film mostly because of Fiennes's excellent performance as Gregory. He is a basically decent man trying to come to terms with the fact that the ideology to which he has committed himself is morally bankrupt and the political system which it supports is in the long term unsustainable. Although the apartheid government had always stigmatised its opponents as Communists it is one of the ironies of history that in the eighties and early nineties the South African Nationalists and the Soviet Communists began to find themselves in similar positions. There must have been many basically decent Russians during the Gorbachev years who faced precisely the same dilemma as Gregory. The film's political stance may be a predictable one and it may be telling a familiar story but its message is one of hope and humanity. 710".

Finally exempted from having to play the sex symbol Ralph's little brother could finally concentrate on actually challenging himself with a complex role. In a movie based upon a true story Fiennes plays James Gregory a racist South African guard whose certainties are nonetheless shaken to the core over the span of twenty years  the time he spends as Nelson Mandela's prison warden. The movie's merit lies largely in showing us the daily application of a major historic abomination  Apartheid  through the lives of little people those ordinary men and women of South Africa thanks to whom it was perpetuated. These are ordinary white people who are neither heroes nor villains but obtuse conformists. The violence of the system on its white citizens was considerably more hidden than on its black ones but it was violence all the same it was the obligation to remain as ignorant as possible. The alternative was to be persecuted by the status quo.Dennis Haysbert as Nelson Mandela was suitably stoic and charismatic a positive counterpart to Forest Whitaker's villainous Idi Amin from The Last King of Scotland. Diane Kruger was definitely better cast as an ordinarily racist suburban hairdresser wife and mother of two than as Helen of Troy. By the end of Goodbye Bafana I was also somewhat moved. My major complaint with the movie was that like the vast majority of Africanset historical movies made recently Nelson Mandela and all the black African characters were largely viewed from the outside through the whiteys' eyes.

	schema:reviewBody "While many books and films about South Africa's Apartheid have attempted to convey the tension and the eventual dissolution of that sociopolitical scheme few histories bring us as close to the core of the schism as does Bille August's excellent film THE COLOR OF FREEDOM. Based on the book GOODBYE BAFANA by James Gregory with Bob Graham the story details the relationship between Nelson Mandela and prison warden James Gregory during Mandela's long imprisonment on Robben Island off the coast of South Africa and the gradual friendship that occurred between these disparate men. Studying this development of a friendship provides an opportunity to better understand the concept of Apartheid and of the evils of racism in general. Nelson Mandela Dennis Haysbert was convicted of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment on the desolate Robben Island for his nonviolent attempts to end racism in South Africa attempts that eventually resulted in work stoppages and resistance movements that moved the articulate welleducated lawyer Mandela into the realm of activism. While on Robben Island he was guarded by one James Gregory Joseph Fiennes a proapartheid cruel prison employee who was assigned to Mandela as a spy and censor because of Gregory's knowledge of the local language Xhosa learned from his childhood when his best friend was a black boy named Bafana. Gregory lives on the island with this wife Diane Kruger and children and his commitment to his family provides a stark contrast to his hatred of his black 'Kaffir' prisoners his involvement with the proapartheid status is strengthened by his direct communication with Intelligence in the cities of South Africa where his censored information from the prisoners leads to definitive capture and 'disposal' of the blacks. On a trip ashore Gregory and his wife and children witness first hand the beatings and cruelties of the whites against the blacks and Gregory returns to his duties on Robben Island with a gradually changing point of view for the model prisoner Mandela. They begin communicating in Xhosa and Gregory allows Mandela's wife Winnie Faith Ndukwana to spend more committed time with her husband on her restricted visits to Robben island. One particular misstep  Gregory passes Mandela's Christmas gift of a piece of chocolate to Winnie  threatens Gregory's status on the island while at the same time bonding Mandela and Gregory like brothers. Gregory's life and philosophy have been changed by Mandela's powerful personality and spirit and his eventual release from prison into the new freed South Africa has been aided in a small but meaningful way by Gregory  a reflection of Gregory's childhood bond with his friend Bafana. August captures the tension and the atmosphere of South Africa in this visually stunning film. Fiennes is superb as James Gregory as is Diane Kruger as his wife. Dennis Haysbert conveys the spiritual essence of Mandela despite the fact that his physical appearance is not at all like the Mandela known so well from the still constant photographs of the diminutive freedom fighter we see frequently. But the film does convey the tenor of the changing times during the 27year confinement of Nelson Mandela. The featurettes on the DVD offer lengthy history lessons about the real events referenced in the film and add immeasurably to the film's overall success. There is much to learn from this film in addition to the fact that it is a solid work of cinematic artistry. Grady Harp".

South Africa achieved sovereignty in 1934 and became a republic in 1961. The government of the country was dominated until 1994 by the Afrikaner community a majority amongst white South Africans who as most people would presumably know were certainly not of 'British' origin. One might expect someone from the Netherlands to know that they are comprised chiefly of Dutch settlers...Britain may be the former colonial power in SA but was not the initiator of the postwar apartheid policy still less the force which actually brought it about. Britain gave up its African colonies in the 1960s so has not ruled anywhere on the continent in a direct sense since then and has not ruled SA since considerably earlier than that. The particular nature of the problems which South Africa has faced are based primarily on the relatively significant size of its white population and their attendant rule dominated as it has been by Afrikaners not on 'British rule'.I enjoyed the film by the way. A thoughtful and satisfying treatment of the subject on the whole I thought.".

	schema:headline " Detailed as well as interesting chronicle of an agreeable relationship between a prison warden and his prisoner  Nelson Mandela";
	schema:reviewBody "The picture was well based on real events and actual characters  regarding the true story of a white South African racist  a prison warden Joseph Fiennes whose life was profoundly altered by the black prisoner named Nelson Mandela Dennis Haysbert he guarded for twenty years . Although Mandela initially committed to nonviolent protest in association with the SACP he cofounded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe MK in 1961 leading a sabotage campaign against the apartheid government . In 1962 he was arrested  convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the state  and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial . Mandela served 27 years in prison initially on Robben Island and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. An international campaign lobbied for his release which was granted in 1990 amid escalating civil strife . Dismissed President Bota  Mandela joined negotiations with Nationalist President F. W. De Klerk to abolish apartheid and establish multiracial elections in 1994 in which he led the ANC to victory and became South Africa's first black president .This is an enjoyable as well as thoughtprovoking story about a warden and his relationship with Mandela  an emotive flick revolving around imprisonment Nelson until his freedom and inauguration as the first democratically elected president of South Africa . This story about prison and apartheid is very compelling made and deserving a fine treatment with poignant moments . It's completely convincing and makes a moving and powerful statement about the evil of the racism. It's an intelligent movie that shows the nature of racial policy and political events in South Africa . The picture has some strong moments as police cruelty on civilians as well security officers' brutality against prisoners and other people  including women  and infants . There's enough background information to give the spectator a taste of what South African life was like under apartheid  detailing hard confrontations  violent environment  fear and tension . The flick describes perfectly a great man who could have lived in bitterness and anger all his existence  seeking vengeance when he ultimately achieved power  but who instead chose to devote himself to democracy and peaceful reconciliation between blacks and whites in South Africa . The main actors  Joseph Fiennes  Dennis Haysbert and Diane Kruger give awesome interpretations and the story was professionally directed by Billie August . Twice winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Pelle the conqueror 1987 and The best intentions 1992  Billie August is an expert on literary adaptations such as Les Miserables Smilla's Sense of Snow  House of the spirits Marie Kroyer Jerusalem and Night Train to Lisbon . Any yarn regarding Nelson Mandela is a flick worth seeing in my opinion and this one seems to be one of the best . Rating  Better than average  worthwhile watching for historical characters buffs . Other films based on this historical figure are the followings  Mandela 1987 by Philip Saville with Danny Glover  Alfre Woodward  Warren Clarke  Julian Glover  Mandela and De Clerk 1997 by Joseph Sargent with Sidney Poitier and Michael Caine  Winnie by Darrel Root with Jennifer Hudson  Terrence Howard  Elias Koteas  Mandela Long Walk to Freedom 2013 by Justin Chadwick with Idris Elba and Naomi Harris .The film was correctly based on historical facts  these are the followings  Nelson Mandela who was a South African antiapartheid revolutionary politician and philanthropist . He was leader of the African National Congress who has been imprisoned since 1963 for allegedly inciting riots against the government. As he spend long time in prison amidst tight economic sanctions by the international community and growing unrest by the natives who continue their fight for equality and freedom for Nelson Mandela . Amongst mounting international pressure to free Nelson as well as imposition of crippling economic sanctions the South African government representative meets with Nelson and agrees to free him . One time freed Mandela served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was South Africa's first black chief executive and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid through tackling institutionalised racism poverty and inequality and fostering racial reconciliation. Politically an African nationalist and democratic socialist he served as President of the African National Congress ANC from 1991 to 1997.".

	schema:headline " Any Movie Dealing With Mandela Must Be Watched!";
	schema:reviewBody "Any movie that deals with Nelson Mandela is a movie worth watching in my opinion. He is perhaps the only person in the world I can think of to whom I would apply the adjective great. He was a man who could have lived in bitterness and anger all his life seeking revenge when he finally achieved power but who instead chose to devote himself to democracy and peaceful reconciliation between blacks and whites in South Africa. This movie which I saw under the title The Color Of Freedom is interesting because although it deals extensively with Mandela doesn't actually look at events from his perspective. The story is actually told from the perspective of James Gregory played convincingly by Joseph Fiennes  who as a prison guard slowly advancing up the ranks  met Mandela played by Dennis Haysbert in 1968 and gradually developed a relationship of trust and respect with him.There's enough background information to give the viewer a taste of what South African life was like under apartheid but the story isn't really about that. It's more a story of Mandela's impact on Gregory. At the start of the movie Gregory came across as basically just another white South African committed to apartheid and devoted to maintaining the white hold on their country. But slowly as Gregory comes to know Mandela he changes. Mandela's graciousness as well as his fierce devotion to his cause impacts Gregory who suddenly begins to see Mandela not as a black terrorist out to kill whites but as a human being seeking basic dignity and equality.Fiennes performance was very strong. Haysbert had a tough challenge. It surely isn't easy playing a man who is literally a living legend. He did well with the part but it was difficult to accept him as Mandela. The portrayal of the racism that was so deeply ingrained in South African society was at times almost painful to watch. I suppose the biggest weakness of the story is that it's been denied by many people  apparently including Mandela. He did develop a strong relationship with one of his white guards but it wasn't Gregory who seems to have taken some liberty in the account he shares in his book from which the movie was made. He is unfortunately dead and unable to answer to those criticisms. Still this is a moving story and there is truth behind it apparently and it clearly established the qualities that made Mandela the great man he is who accomplished the great things he managed.".

This movie which I saw under the title The Color Of Freedom is interesting because although it deals extensively with Mandela doesn't actually look at events from his perspective. The story is actually told from the perspective of James Gregory played convincingly by Joseph Fiennes  who as a prison guard slowly advancing up the ranks  met Mandela played by Dennis Haysbert in 1968 and gradually developed a relationship of trust and respect with him.There's enough background information to give the viewer a taste of what South African life was like under apartheid but the story isn't really about that. It's more a story of Mandela's impact on Gregory. At the start of the movie Gregory came across as basically just another white South African committed to apartheid and devoted to maintaining the white hold on their country. But slowly as Gregory comes to know Mandela he changes. Mandela's graciousness as well as his fierce devotion to his cause impacts Gregory who suddenly begins to see Mandela not as a black terrorist out to kill whites but as a human being seeking basic dignity and equality.Fiennes performance was very strong. Haysbert had a tough challenge. It surely isn't easy playing a man who is literally a living legend. He did well with the part but it was difficult to accept him as Mandela. The portrayal of the racism that was so deeply ingrained in South African society was at times almost painful to watch. I suppose the biggest weakness of the story is that it's been denied by many people  apparently including Mandela. He did develop a strong relationship with one of his white guards but it wasn't Gregory who seems to have taken some liberty in the account he shares in his book from which the movie was made. He is unfortunately dead and unable to answer to those criticisms. Still this is a moving story and there is truth behind it apparently and it clearly established the qualities that made Mandela the great man he is who accomplished the great things he managed.";

He is transferred because he shows a soft corner for Mandela but due to international pressure is reappointed in 1983 till the release of Mandela from prison.While seeing the movie one feels that what a great honor to have  serving contemporary history's most respected leaders as prison guard.

Dennis Haysbert portrays the role of his life time with gut gutsy and tremendous respect and dignity  in being Nelson Mandela  an honor for an actor.The movie as rightly said by some critics is a history lesson of sorts. But please do not be mistaken by this comment. When I read that comment I had two thoughts  whether I should go and see a history lesson? YES everyone who has a golden heart should see this movie. Every person who is by default has white skin should see this movie. It is simple honest and displays hidden prejudices of apartheid world that are prevalent even today in forms of class.As Mahatma Gandhi was called terrorist so was Nelson Mandela was labeled a terrorist. He used arms struggle for making his point. He wanted the ruling British to talk with nationalist fighters  for peace. But British and their allied countries never agreed for a onetoone dialogue and the mayhem of anarchy atrocity and violence continued for more than half a century in peaceful and beautiful South African country. The local inhabitants were brutally killed by invaders who occupied most part of resources land claiming it to be their own mother land.My salute to Denmark Director Bille August who shows the apathy of human mind with everyday talks against terrorist  the same we talk today.I was fortunate to be part of the audience seeing this movie.Stars 7.5 out of 10".

Not everybody agrees with the changing attitude of James Gregory. Because of this change he gets into a lot of trouble. The main characters are played by Dennis Haysbert Nelson Mandela Joseph Fiennes James Gregory and Diane Kruger Gloria Gregory. The actors are very convincing in their roles. So it is easier for the viewer to identify with them.In our opinion the film is a good film to inform the viewers about apartheid and the events around Nelson Mandela. In the film there were many long dialogues and less action which sometimes made it a bit boring. But there are also some scenes which were very emotional for us. To sum it up we can recommend this film because it is easy to understand. If we were asked to rate the film from zero to ten we would give it seven points.".

The 140minutelong film clearly represents the brutality and discrimination against black Africans.

This makes them prohibit AntiApartheidorganizations and banish their leaders to the prisonisland Robben Island near Kapstadt. One of the jailed men is Nelson Mandela.

	schema:reviewBody "Goodbye Bafana is a compelling film which is worth watching. If you want to learn more about the past of South Africa and about Nelson Mandela you should have a look at Goodbye Bafana. This film was directed by Bille August and shows the everyday life of Mandela and Gregory a prison guard on Robben Island where Mandela was in arrest.The main character James Gregory is presented as a serious and irritable man but when he meets Nelson Mandela he becomes a warmhearted guy. In the beginning he is a supporter of Apartheid but when working with Nelson Mandela for a long time he changes his opinion and begins to doubt his habits. In contrast to that Nelson Mandela is a quiet and peaceful person. Furthermore he is clever because he has a good legal education and is not fooled by anyone. The scene in which Mandela is released from prison is the best scene because it's a peaceful and happy moment in this film. Mandela's timeconsuming and hard work paid off. In the end you can say that it is a great film about the story and life of Nelson Mandela and it's based on a true story.".

	schema:reviewBody "The BBC recently referred to Nelson Mandela as 'the most revered man on planet Earth.' That is not an exaggeration and it is that reputation that permeates Goodbye Bafana and provokes an emotional response. I went on the journey with the film and was moved but I suspect more by the evocation of Mandela himself than by the craft of the filmmakers.Fiennes is James Gregory an unreformed bigot whose life is turned around by close proximity to Mandela. Fiennes handles the role comfortably if unspectacularly. The less recognisable Diane Kruger is more convincing as a venal apologist for apartheid. The major question mark is Dennis Haysbert. He is never more than a competent actor playing Mandela. He never inhabits the role the way Will Smith does Ali or Jamie Foxx Ray. Indeed Mandela deserves to be portrayed the way Ben Kingsley portrayed Ghandi. No doubt such a film will come and with it the eclipsing of Goodbye Bafana.The film is not a failure but neither is it a success. It is a decent attempt at telling a remarkable story. However given that story I expected so much more.".

	schema:headline " Not without merit in this fanciful retelling of mutual respect between a prison guard and Mandela but 'Apartheid for Dummies' is what it annoyingly all too often resembles.";
	schema:reviewBody "Seems quite sad that the truetolife character of Nelson Mandela would be reduced to a supporting character in a film about him his stay on the Robben Island prison and his consequent release in the 1990s. Truth is Bille August's 2007 film has a head and a heart in two different places his film more closely resembling the sort of thing your bogstandard GCSE teacher might slap on for the students in class before nipping out for a quick cigarette during the week that sees the school syllabus demand South African Apartheid era be studied. But despite all this it didn't bother me as much the film observing the changing attitudes of a prison guard on the aforementioned island jail and using him as an example of which the greater changing attitudes of a nation at that time are templated. Yes it resembles a TV movie of the week and yes at about the half way mark you can envisage the film's final few moments consisting of a little white text caption coming into focus on the black background detailing what the lead character's current state is but above all this is a film wanting to tackle a white individual's guilt rather than a black individual's plight and with this established pretty early on in the film I did not have a problem with the direction the film took.Goodbye Bafana revolves around a prowhite proApartheid guard with the South African prison service named James Gregory played by Joseph Fiennes who moves to Robben island with his family of wife Gloria Kruger young son Brent and daughter Natasha in the 1960s. James is a censor officer cutting out words and sentences from inmates' letters and having the authority to listen in on conversations inmates have with their visitors cruelly cutting them off if he deems it fit to do so in that they break the house rules. The very first scene is the family shipping themselves off to the island a sense of life beginning at this point. James is the focus here his family relegated to mere items of viewership with the children playing roles that see them ask the questions that illinformed on Apartheid audience members will be asking Diane Kruger the relatively talented actress not given anything to do bar be relegated into playing the role of the token fascist whose racial tidbits sum up an entire mindset of an era. Why are the blacks prisoners on the island? asks Brent Because they're terrorists who want our land. replies Gloria in a fabricated and false manner. Then we remember this is playing to GCSE students whom are unfamiliar with the subject and it is they who are asking with the programmed response kicking in.James is the bridge between a shallow vacuous existence in his wife'splusher friends' empty existence on the island and the gruelling grotty prison set life of a number of imprisoned blacks whom it is deemed are enemies of the state. One of these is the aforementioned Nelson Mandela played here by Dennis Haysbert who does a reasonable job shuffling from scene to scene and keeping a stern and expressionless face in playing the man although the level of the performance cannot be understated when we recall what it is Haysbert is exactly required to do essentially playing a dispirited prisoner throughout and given little room to play the equality driven saviour of a nation and its beliefs.Interestingly the moment that encapsulates the very sentiment that the film is more interested in Gregory's tale than Mandela and his struggle and the manner in which he went about doing what he did actually occurs very late on but it's telling all the same in a sequence that sees Mandela and his assistants sit around a large table about to indulge in the sorts of discussions that saw them do what they did but sees James leave the room with the film following him just as those at the table appear to get started so as to cover his moving house and his family problems. Akin to this is James' gradual arc of realisation something that's satisfying in its very basic observation the man's past life experience in knowing a young black boy in his youth proof he was once able to connect with blacks in a friendly manner with moments such as the reading of some kind of Mandela written equality charter just foreshadowing the obvious. As the years roll on and everyone grows older the Gregory's shift around and Mandela himself is kept on the sidelines as he changes prisons looking at the main strand of the film from a distanced perspective. It's a situation akin to John Boorman's 2005 film Country of My Skull In My Country to Americans when the plight and strife of oppressed South Africans and their justice is given the odd glance in tangent to a Caucasian individual or individuals and their relationships with other Caucasians around them plus whatever hardships they suffer with their employers. It isn't reason enough to hate the film but it's reason enough to get a little flustered provided you can identify the niggling frustrations and work around them so as to enjoy the film as it stands. The film tries to provide some dramatic tension to proceedings the arrival of a new and more brutal Robben Island chief of staff later on in life supposed to instill a sense of what might happen if Gregory were to be caught by this new chief as his attitudes begin to change. Goodbye Bafana was made with the best of intentions achieving what it sets out to do with relative dramatic and respectful aplomb but one cannot argue that it all too often feels like a lowkey retelling of events for those naive to the subject matter.".

This long and faintly boring film never really sparkles or initiates nor engages. Fiennes however is believable as the racist Afrikaner who along with his materialistic wife gets a posting to Robben Island. She wants him promoted he soon sees his job as a challenge and find that he mellows toward Mandela and then tries to help him. Diane Kruger as Gregory's wife is even more racist than he is and she often tries to shape her husband's career into what she sees as traditional white superiority.Unfortunately Dennis Haysbert who plays Mandela neither looks the part nor radiates the personality that he's now renowned for. True much of the story though does involve him being under the strict conditions where communication is difficult. The film then progresses onto Mandela's transfer to Pollsmoor Prison then to Victor Verser prison and then onto freedom. What is undoubted is that this story will be remade. With a bigger budget better script and a more carefully chosen cast. Robben Island seemingly located within sight of Table Top Mountain is akin to Alcatraz and we well know how Hollywood has eked screenplays out of that. As a film lover rather than a apartheid historian but a respecter of Mandela I look forward to that and would suggest that the majority do the same.".

His great honor and all that bluster is so irrelevant when you are fomenting complicicit in and responsible for the murder of thousands. His fat ass wife was even worse.

Difficult at the beginning just seems shallow and bitchy but stick with it and watch Beryl Reid's character disintegrate....the final scene reminded me of The Blue Angel or The Entertainer in its shattering degradation...congrats to Aldrich for having the guts to make this movie I think it stands the test of time rather well. Coral Browne is also magnificent and York holds her own. The lesbian bar scene is worth waiting for.".

Ridiculously versatile he made the fascinating Film Noir 'Kiss Me Deadly' the gothic black comedy 'Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?' and the macho tough guys on a mission action classic 'The Dirty Dozen' to name just three in a long career. Just to emphasize that he could do just about anything one of the first movies he made after 'The Dirty Dozen' was 'The Killing Of Sister George'. It's hard to imagine two more different movies! George is a very English picture about a much loved soap opera star played by Beryl Reid who has to juggle a career crisis with a complex lesbian relationship her lover being played by Susanna York. Reid was well known to British audiences through her TV work especially a couple of highly popular John Le Carre adaptations. Reid originated the Sister George role on the stage and she really makes the most of it in this movie. Her performance is terrific hilariously bitchy and also very sad and pathetic. York is also good and the lesbian subject matter must have been very shocking for the time. It may look a little dated now but in context it is quite sensitively handled. There are some great actors in the supporting cast most notably Coral Browne 'Theatre Of Blood' who plays a TV producer who has her eye on York. 'The Killing Of Sister George' deserves a bigger audience. I highly recommend it and hope that anyone who enjoys it looks further into the career of the Robert Aldrich a seriously underrated film maker!".

The combination of comedy with personal tragedy poses difficult problems both for the writer  director here they both succeed brilliantly.The three principals' performances are riveting. I particularly liked the ambiguity of Coral Brown's portrayal of Mercy Croft watch her carefully in the tight closeups in the gay club and notice how the downturned mouth at times hides a hint of a selfsatisfied smile.The cinematography deserves special mention. The use of colour is beautiful I was reminded of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg but it never steps over the line into unreality. On the contrary the alleys of London the TV studio and above all the stairs and corridor of the flat are supremely realistic. Most unusual is the use of chiaroscuro the interplay of lightandshadow seldom seen outside of black  white films. In so many colour films the light appears to come from some amorphous omnidirectional source out of science fiction great for lighting everything and everybody evenly but unrealistic and DULL. Look at the shadows as Beryl Reid 'George' enters the apartment building and climbs the stairs or in some of the bedroom scenes. Apart from its other many virtues this movie held my attention as a fine piece of filmmaking.All in all a masterpiece my one regret is that it was shown on TV in panandscan.

In its day SISTER GEORGE was considered the ne plus ultra in coarse homophobia critics saw the sweaty thumbprints of the Aldrich Touch on every girlongirl scene. Does anyone now lambaste THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT for not being hardhitting docudrama? In retrospect the movie seems to me one of Aldrich's most affecting with Coral Browne December and a teeny teenaged Susannah York May grandslamming this folie a deux to a faretheewell.";

	schema:reviewBody "Beryl Reid gives the performance of a lifetime in this film about lesbian roommates one of which is an actress. The main plot revolves around the possibility of Beryl Reid's character on a TV show being written off the show. Her relationship with roommate Susannah York is very interesting. But suffice it to say Beryl is very dominating possessive and demanding. She wants to know where she's been all the time and likes to throw her weight around. At middle age and with extra weight she is no longer the beauty she once was and as someone points out to her late in the film she is not the ideal desired sex object for young women. To describe this film with mere words really doesn't do the film justice. Granted Beryl's performance is the whole show. But the movie is an experience you're not likely to forget especially with a love scene between two ladies near the end of it. Coral Browne is quite good and memorable in her role as well. But The Killing of Sister George belongs to Beryl Reid and this film's hardtofind status is only hurting people's chances at seeing Ms. Reid at her best.".

She is also a lesbian and her relationship with her lover Susannah York is falling apart. Network executive Mercy Croft Coral Browne tries to help her...or does she?This movie has problemsit's way too long almost 2 12 hours has unlikable characters and is pretty depressing. Still it's very welldirected I love the way the opening credits are done and has three great performances. Reid had already been in the play on stage so she pretty much knew what she was doing. She's just greatyou see her anger but also sympathize with her. York is very good as her lover. Browne is just superb as Mercy Croft. SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH!!!! This was for its time pretty extreme. It was seen as a lesbian movie. In my opinion it really isn't. It's about an older woman whose behavior and attitude ends up destroying her. She just happens to be a lesbian. Still this was pretty raw for 1968. They shot the bar scenes in an actual lesbian bar in England and there was a sexual seduction in the movie that wasn't in the play. It's when Browne and York get together. York hated doing that scene and it shows. This got slapped with an X rating originally just for the subject matter alone. Director Robert Aldrich fought against that rating for yearshe thought it deserved an R. It was re rated to an R in 1972. I remember it played here in Boston for months on end. Lines were around the block every night despite the rating. Still it was only a modest hit and quickly was forgotten. The stigma of the X rating still haunts this film which is too bad. No great masterpiece but worth seeing for the great acting by the three leads.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the earliest British gaythemed films ever made this tells the tale of June 'George' Buckridge the soon to be eclipsed star on the TV soap opera Applehurst. We see her relationship with the Baby Dolllike Childie and also the interventions of television executive Mrs Crofts. But does Crofts have her own agenda?This lesbian drama has the amazing tagline 'The story of three consenting adults in the privacy of their own home' which obviously mimics the mantra of liberals and homophobes alike regarding 'the gays'. It's also a reference to the wording of The Sexual Offences Act of 1967 decriminalising homosexuality. There's something aesthetically pleasing about Beryl Reid in all of the films and TV programmes I've seen her in. This film is no exception. She plays George and she dominates proceedings whenever she is on screen. Her character is irreverent rambunctious and a sheer delight. She's 'punk' years before the punk movement actually erupted. Also notice how she plays her rebellious character to perfection and got under the skin of George. This is very evident in her body language. No unconscious crossing of the legs or keeping them together when she sits down. She can manspread with the best of them. This is a headstrong woman who lives life on her own terms rather than conforming to societal norms regarding how a 'lady' should act.Part of the film takes place in the real life lesbian bar The Gateways Club which was then in Chelsea just off The Kings Road. The film used the real patrons as extras and it feels so natural it's as if the crew just went in and filmed without warning. The wide range of cast extras show that the uneducated myth about lesbians being either 'butch' or 'femme' is a fallacy and the locale provides a fascinating peek inside not just 1960's Gay London but specifically Lesbian London. George and Childie are also dressed as Laurel and Hardy in this scene which makes it even more joyous surreal and brilliant.A primary theme of the film is the power play within the character's relationships. This is nicely shown in the 'contrition game' scene in which rather than being degraded by George's task Childie makes herself enjoy it thus taking away the power from George and being in control herself. The film depicts it's characters like human beings with all of their foibles rather than as freaks in a sideshow to be leered at and grimaced at by 'them there normal folks'. The film prompts a new discussion on our perceptions of gay people in a Britain in which homosexuality had just been decriminalised this was carried out in 1967 the year before this film was released. The tagline for the film also references the wording used in The Sexual Offences Act.The Killing of Sister George was unsurprisingly very contentious with the unenlightened British Board of Film Classification when it was due to be released. The main bone of contention was with the scene between Childie and Mrs Crofts Crofts kisses and caresses Childie. There is nothing gratuitous about this scene and it is dealt with respectfully and mostly takes place offscreen. From the BBFC Case Study regarding the film''But the BBFC was adamant that the scene be removed in its entirety. Trevelyan stated that the BBFC was not prepared as yet to accept lesbian sex to this point.''It's unbelieveable today that the BBFC saw to not include this scene not because it may corrupt or adversely influence but because they thought the Great British public would have it's collective minds blown by such a scene.The BBFC Case Study on the film notes''The BBFC classified The Killing of Sister George as 'X' in February 1969 with the encounter between Mrs Crofts and Childie deleted. Nevertheless a number of local authorities across the UK banned the film even in this version. The Greater London Council allowed the film to be shown within its authority area with minor edits. The increase in the age bar for 'X' films from 16 to 18 in 1970 saw some local authorities relent on their previous decision and allow the film to be shown under this higher age restriction.''Today the film is thankfully uncut. This movie is an amazing time capsule a perceptive and all too revealing glimpse into human relationships and a groundbreaking slice of LGBT history a history that generally erases lesbians altogether. This film noisily and joyously bucks this trend. And audiences should be truly thankful for that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly it's not about lesbians per se it's about these two particular lesbians and the final days of their long twisted relationship. More importantly it's about one woman's slow sad selfdestruction. 'TKoSG' was based on a stage play but rest assured the movie is a satisfyingly 'cinematic' experience realised with skillful editing and excellent direction. Amazing that director Robert Aldritch went from macho WW2 caper 'The Dirty Dozen' to this femaledominated characterdriven 'smallscale' movie. 'TKoSG' bears repeated watching to catch the subtler portents. George is monstrous but not a monster though petty and selfobsessed to the point of becoming oblivious to the spiraling degeneration of her personal and professional life. The most complex enigmatic character is George's TV boss Mercy Croft who a first seems disconcertingly snooty condescending and unpleasant. In fact it is the widowed Mrs Croft who arguably acts with the most genuine humanity instantly recognising an abusive relationship and making moves to rescue Alice from it. She constantly endeavours until finally pushed too far to break bad news with sensitivity and treat George with due respect including lining her up a new job. Even the blatant display of homosexual affection at the Gateways Club barely fazes her. Her only miscalculation is that she does not fully see Alice for the unstable pathologically dependent person she is. While some of the more superficial elements have become dated the great acting including the smaller roles remains a pleasure. Only Susannah York lets the side down just a little with an occasionally selfconscious performance. Also it may be just me but the deliberately? garish manner in which George's prostitute friend is presented gives an oddly 'David Lynch' vibe that's not completely unwelcome though. The ending when George finally realises just what has happened and how is unforgettable. All in all a very entertaining emotionally engaging movie from the late 1960s with only a thin dusting of 'quaint' to show for all those years. And for aficionados there's the bonus of some truly groovy neopsychedelic soundtrack music at the Gateways Club party.".

More importantly it's about one woman's slow sad selfdestruction. 'TKoSG' was based on a stage play but rest assured the movie is a satisfyingly 'cinematic' experience realised with skillful editing and excellent direction. Amazing that director Robert Aldritch went from macho WW2 caper 'The Dirty Dozen' to this femaledominated characterdriven 'smallscale' movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I find that some films of the 1960's are very difficult to watch because of their character shattering plot developments. Along with Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? this is one of them. It happens to a very similar character here who like Martha in VW has begun to isolate many people around her. June Beryl Reid is a lesbian soap opera actress in London who plays Sister George a popular nurse on a serial. She lives with the Baby Doll like Katie Susannah York and emotionally abuses her when Katie in her mind acts up. On the set June called Sister George on and off screen is more than a bit demanding jealous of other actors whose popularity ratings are going up and just a bit angry when it is insinuated by one of the crew members that her days are numbered. June gets riproaringly drunk assaults two visiting nuns in a Taxi and is reprimanded by Mercy Croft Coral Browne of the production staff. Her behavior gets more and more out of control until it all caves in on her and she is indeed prepared to be killed off. Even that June can't take with dignity and makes funny faces at the truck drivers who killed her off which sets the cast and crew tittering. It's not apparent whether or not they love her or take pleasure in watching her downfall but that's what happens here. Katie obviously has had enough and Mercy having visited June at a gay bar to tell her the news of her dismissal sets her sights on Katie. From there it's just a matter of time before June Sister George has her blowout and ends up having a breakdown herself much like Martha did in Virginia Woolf.I think that you must be of an artistic serious dramatic viewing mind to watch The Killing of Sister George and familiar with having seen serious dramatic plays on stage. Every actor is outstanding and the film is riveting to be sure but it is deep even if there is a lot of black comedy abound. Then there is the lesbian issue. The films of the 60's have a bleak take on what living openly was like. Take a look at Staircase or The Boys in the Band to see the male version of this. These are not happy people. Sister George is only happy when she is the center of attention on the set or when she is humiliating Katie punishing her by forcing her to eat her cigar butt. Reid is simply amazing to watch with her boundless energy York is enchanting and you certainly won't confuse Coral Browne's Vera Charles Auntie Mame with Mercy Croft. The film shows its theatrical routes which indicates why many plays did better on stage and felt like an acid trip when put on screen.".

There are famous commentators on the cinema that make claims on his decline towards the end of his career. The Killing of Sister George is put into the same category as Whatever Happened to Baby Jane. This I do not agree with discounting Baby Jane and its own selfcontained effectively Gothic world as I believe Aldrich returns in Sister George to the same emotional depths of pain and endurance as films like Autumn Leaves and above all The Big Knife perhaps his greatest masterpiece. In The Big Knife an actor is burnt out of the media system in a similar way Coral Browne as Rod Steiger. Even the howl of utter anguish at the end is similar if not the same as the cry of horror that Ida Lupino gives in The Big Knife. And the physical abuse that lovers inflict on each other the cigar butt eating scene in Sister George mirrors the crashing of the typewriter on Joan Crawford's hands in Autumn Leaves. The Aldrich vision is stark and seemingly cold but it is the burning coldness of fire. This is rightly a bold film on Lesbianism. It is an Aldrich view of it as mental illness was in Autumn Leaves and the picture of both are of their time. What is timeless is the consistency of vision and the contemplation of a flawed humanity".

Two years later William Friedkin would bring Crowley's work to the screen with much better results than Aldrich achieves here but I think it is only fair to point out that flaws and all Marcus and Aldrich got there first.And they brought a cast of heavyhitters with them Beryl Reid a force of nature as June Buckridge Sister George a nurse on a popular soap opera Susannah York as her somewhat infantile lover Childie and the third point in the triangle a serpentine BBC executive by the name of Mercy Croft played to a faretheewell by Coral Browne who has a dual agenda telling June that she's been sacked and stealing Childie from her into the bargain.The acting by all three of these women is in a word sensational. Reid in particular dominates the proceedings June Buckridge is an unpleasant loud obnoxious woman who is abusive to her lover. York however it must be said is no slouch in the role of the submissive Childie in fact there is one scene with a cigar butt where Childie turns the tables on George with devilish glee. And Browne as Mrs Croft is a perfect foil for the both of them a serpent in a Chanel suit oozing style from every pore while scheming to get her way.The only problem is that the basic situation really isn't enough to hang a twohourandeighteenminute movie on. With THE BOYS IN THE BAND setting the proceedings at a birthday party allowed the drama to unfold almost in real time with room for a cast of nine actors crammed into a fancy Village apartment the claustrophobic nature of the set actually works in the film's favor.Unfortunately GEORGE is a barebones story of an aging actress about to lose a job that she has grown to take for granted much as she takes for granted her lover a woman who retreats into her dolls when under stress and whom George abuses mercilessly. Childie as I mentioned sometimes gets her own back and once or twice we see some real affection between the two women but halfway through this thing I found them both quite unbearable and I had a hard time swallowing the notion that either of them would stand for the other's nonsense for so many years. The addition of Mrs Croft to the proceedings does add a little something extra but though Browne works hard the part is underwritten and we really don't understand what motivates her. Is she really attracted to Childie or is she just a bitch out to get George and taking her lover just an added bit of venom? In the end we are forced to draw our own conclusions. And June as difficult as she has been is most certainly the one left with the short end of the stick as the curtain falls.The sex scene which garnered a lot of press in its day and which in fact is a pivotal moment is frankly the movie's low point. Much was made at the time of Susannah York's reluctance to play the scene I do not know if there was any truth to that but Browne's icycold approach to the seduction her fixation on one of York's breasts as if it were a rare specimen of beetle under a microscope and York's orgasm which sounds more like a bloodcurdling scream of pain than ecstasy all add up to what must be the most unpleasant seduction scene in film history.At the end of the day this is a film worth seeing for the performances Reid's in particular and for its historical importance but it's a rather unpleasant business and goes on way too long frankly by the time the thing finally ended I was ready to take a hatchet to all three of them.".

She plays a middle aged radioplay actress for the BBC only to find that her character is to be killed off after many years service.George has a livein lover played by a very young Suzanna York to whom I felt was a poor choice because I really can't imagine someone as young as York wanting to be a lesbian lover to someone who could be mistaken for her own mother. Perhaps I'm being cynical but I suspect York was chosen with one eye on her astonishingly elfin good looks and the other eye on potential box office takings.Anyway York has to suffer the physical  verbal abuse from a frustrated bitter  twisted George now that she realizes she can no longer get any decent work in these changing times of fashion  sex appeal. George eventually becomes so paranoid that she believes York is having an affair with another woman which only adds to her defragmented middleaged life!The story although controversial for its time is quite gentle and would probably pass into a typical soap opera these days without a whimper of protest such are the changing times  political attitudes to gayness. But back then taboo subjects such as homosexuality  lesbianism was a positive no no as far as Hollywood was concerned.The story is very well handled and tries not to fall prey to cheap exploitation. But the love scene between York and Corale Brown although cleverly done is perhaps a little graphic  one wonders why Aldrich had to be so detailed  timeconsumed with this particular scene. A lesbian act is a lesbian act it really doesn't warrant so much time going over every detail of sexual foreplay as portrayed here. Again in my cynical mind I suspect such controversial titilation had more to do with box office than any serious indictment of the subject matter in question.All in all Sister George is a very warm  caring movie the characters are firmly cliched into a typical English Country Cottage lifestyle where everything is tea cakes  roses. Reid  Brown are both excellent and York does her best with a difficult character.I feel the movie would have been taken on its merits at a critical level had it not being for the rather tacky love scene but generally it offers an interesting study into how such a taboo subject was handled during a time of massive social change during the socalled Swinging 60s which didn't quite swing far enough to include the homosexual community.".

She's loud and obnoxious with a hairtrigger temper and is prone to throwing screaming tantrums over even trivial matters one wonders how she managed to keep her job as long as she did. This doesn't help the movie which as a whole is big and broad and overstated there's a slapstick quality to even the dramatic moments. The dialogue is fatuous and artless people shout and argue a lot but no one really says anything. I'm no film student but even the direction seemed bad. As if the words weren't obvious enough there are lots of lingering closeups of the actors giving exaggerated facial reactions to slam home the idea of what they're supposed to be feeling. There's a scene in a very small very crowded lesbian club and the way the camera weaves through the crowd showing various samesex couples slowdancing is supposed to be shocking and salacious but only comes off as rather clumsy. Most of the subtlety in the film is reserved for the glimpses we get of Applehurst a gentle soap opera parody on which Sister George is a featured character. I've read that the author of the play from which the movie is taken has said that it wasn't supposed to be a serious study of lesbianism and that's good because it isn't. The relationship between Beryl Reid and Susannah York is distasteful verbally and psychologically abusive with hints of sadomasochism. The film reinforces those awful stereotypes of older butch lesbians preying on younger more feminine women.One of the few elements of the movie that kept me watching was Coral Browne. She made an interesting contrast with Beryl Reid Browne is actually more mannishlooking than Reid with a large strong face but this is offset by her elegant style of dress and manner. Whereas Reid is all bombast and outwardlyexploding emotion Browne's character is controlled and wellspoken exuding an icy almost reptilian vibe. Her sex scene with York is the movie's apex of unintentional humor though the faces she makes as she's bringing York to climax had me rolling.I would say the film's chief merit is as a curio of its time and the then rarity of the subject matter with which it deals however ridiculously.".

	schema:headline " Preston Sturges worked on the screenplay but don't expect 'The Lady Eve'";
	schema:reviewBody "Sight unseen this movie has a number of factors in its favor 1 it stars two of the most charismatic performers of Hollywood's Golden Age James Stewart  Margaret Sullavan paired for the first time 2 it features the underrated Ray Milland as Jimmy's best friend who becomes the third player in their romantic triangle 3 several of Hollywood's familiar character actors appear in supporting roles Grant Mitchell Hattie McDaniel Christian Rub etc. and 4 its story was born in the typewriter of the legendary Preston Sturges one of the alltime great screenwriters. According to various biographies of Sturges he spent a couple of weeks on the first draft of this drama while simultaneously cranking out a comedy for Carole Lombard called Love Before Breakfast. Sturges' script for Next Time We Love was then handed off to an obscure writer named Melville Baker who revised it but in the end only Baker received screen credit. It would appear that this project meant little to Sturges but bearing in mind the memorable results when Margaret Sullavan took the title role of his brilliant adaptation of The Good Fairy in 1935 I sat down to watch this one hoping it might also be something special.Unfortunately and despite a decent opening halfhour or so this film ultimately disappoints. Stewart and Sullavan have good chemistry and make a believable couple. We follow the course of their relationship with interest as they marry on impulse and Stewart aggressively pursues a career in journalism while Sullavan takes a more casual interest in stage acting while best friend Milland maintains a steady presence in the background. Stewart  Sullavan have a baby but trouble soon develops her career in the theater suddenly takes off just as his progress at the newspaper hits a brick wall. Tension mounts as she becomes the breadwinner after he screws up a major assignment and is fired. They separate and Sullavan flourishes while Stewart avoids coming home and stays out of the picture. Milland at this point finally steps forward and makes his feelings known.More plot twists come along but for me the movie starts to fizzle along about the time Sullavan's acting career takes off. Important events occur too abruptly without the appropriate buildup all of a sudden she's a famous and powerful Broadway star. It looks as if some backstage scenes were filmed but then cut suggested by the fact that Grant Mitchell who plays a theatrical producer receives fourth billing in the credits though he appears in only one brief scene. From that point onward Sullavan's stardom seems unreal while the behavior of Stewart's character becomes increasingly melodramatic and unbelievable. In the later scenes none of the main characters behave like recognizable human beings and despite the best efforts of these estimable actors we no longer buy anything they're saying or doing by the climax. The story raises a provocative issue i.e. the conflict that results when a wife earns more money than her husband and thus wields more power but the filmmakers chickened out without really addressing the matter choosing a sappy Hollywood resolution over anything genuinely satisfying.Next Time We Love is fairly interesting nonetheless worth seeing if you enjoy Hollywood melodramas of the '30s and certainly if you're a fan of the stars but in the end it doesn't amount to much. Fans of Preston Sturges will be hard pressed to recognize his contribution and may prefer to skip this one and enjoy one of his more characteristic works instead.".

Usually when someone calls a film progressive it means it's hypersexed banned by the Pope or has gratuitous shots of belly buttons. Right well none of that. NEXT TIME WE LOVE is progressive because it delves into interpersonal issues that simply didn't exist in the golden age of Hollywood.A wife who chooses career over family? Preposterous. A husbandfather who neglects the upbringing of his child? Outrageous. A marriage that is mutually tolerant of infidelity? Sacrilegious. Hollywood has historically depicted the marriage ceremony as the proverbial happily ever after yet in this film we get a sober and realistic view of how life really works.There are no dramatic fireworks no cartoonish liaisons no screaming or breaking things like we might get in a modern film dealing with this subject. Instead it's extremely subtle and believable. There's not much flashy plot to sink your MTVstarved mind into but if instead you like to digest your films slowly and comprehend the meaning behind every gesturethe tension in Margaret Sullivan's spine the repressed torment in Jimmy Stewart's posture the way a cigarette can be worth a thousand words when lit at the perfect momentthen this film is for you.One thing worth mentioning... this is one of the few films that handles the aging of characters in a credible manner. Margaret goes from a giddy schoolgirl to a mature woman of the world. Jimmy goes from a brash adventurer to a pensive introvert. The makeup hairstyles clothes and especially the way the actors carry themselves convey the passage of time as the film progresses over a decade perhaps mirroring the awakening of a nation from the roaring 20s to the tougher times that followed. The climactic hotel meeting near the end of the film presents two completely different personalities from what we originally met you could almost believe that it was played by two new actors but no we owe it all to the fantastic acting  direction of this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is Jimmy Stewart's first leading male character role. Supposedly Margaret Sullavan had helped in recruiting him for the movie. The movie deals with a couple whose relationship is tested by the career aspirations of each other. The movie deals with a subject that is ground breaking for its time. Married women were relegated to being housewives prior to World War II. Women had also gotten the right to vote in the previous decade. The relationship between the spouses after their marriage becomes strained as the husband aspires to be a reporter and getting stationed overseas while the wife aspires to be a stage star. Their baby's birth becomes an additional dilemma for the couple. Ray Milland also stars as a friend of the couple who also falls in love with Margaret Sullavan. As the couple drifts apart they start to contemplate divorce. Jimmy's character develops a serious respiratory infection from being overseas and realizes that he doesn't want to be a burden to his wife. He encourages her to marry his friend and to break off with him in a move of self sacrifice. However they both still are in love with each other and she stays with him after finding out about his condition. The two of them never forgot about their past experiences with each other and as one character in the movie had stated that they shared a special type of love with each other. The movie title is suitably named since it relates to delaying a relationship until a later time period. The couple's competing career aspirations resulted in a delaying of spending time to share love with each other. The movie spans the time period from 1927 to 1935 and opens and concludes at a hotel where the couple had spent time together. Jimmy mentions the Lindbergh transatlantic flight at the beginning of the movie. It is a coincidence that he would play Charles Lindbergh later in his movie career. There are also references to the turmoil developing in Europe and the Japanese invasion into Asia which forbodes World War II.".

	schema:headline " An underappreciated sophisticated gem from the 1930s";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERTThis is a surprisingly excellent little film from Universal starring Margaret Sullavan and Jimmy Stewart. The two leads play a young married couple whose careers end up keeping them apart throughout most of their marriage despite the fact that they have a child together whom Sullavan's character ends up raising pretty much on her own.The film was released in 1936 and shows the clear influence of the first wave of the modern feminist movement in the U.S.. Sullavan is a successful actress who supports and even helps facilitate her husband Stewart's career as a globetrotting foreign correspondent but she doesn't sacrifice her own career to the usual trope of the good little wife following wherever he goes.The choices and hard decisions of each of the partners in this marriage are portrayed mostly realistically until the unnecessarily melodramatic ending that is and the film doesn't pull any punches about how difficult it is for both Sullavan and Stewart who are genuinely in love to pursue what's best for each of them individually even at the expense of their happiness and their opportunities to live together in the marriage.The movie takes a sophisticated attitude toward the challenges of a twocareer couple in a way that was fairly ahead of its time. It doesn't pander to the usual Hollywood formula and there's certainly not a happy ending. Both Stewart's and Sullavan's characters suffer and experience regrets but there's no disproportionate punishment for the woman character for choosing her own independence and career. These two actors clearly portray the couple as spouses who are determined to respect one another's choices even when they're hurt by them. They also clearly maintain their love for each other even through the years of separation. But in the final analysis their choices mean they don't get to have one another present in their everyday lives in the way I think that each of them would ultimately have wanted for their marriage.Sullavan and Stewart are terrific in playing off one another and they each bring great credibility and feeling to their scenes together. Ray Milland also gives a strong performance in an important supporting role.See this far toolittle known 1936 gem. If you're a fan of the golden age of classic films and of these two fine actors at a relatively young stage of their respective careers you won't spend a more interesting hour and a half at the movies. Highly recommended.".

As far as why it's not a popular film I have a strong guess....it's not a particularly enjoyable picture and you have a hard time really caring about the characters.The story itself is a great illustration of the old saying Act in haste repent at leisure. This is because Cicely and Chris Sullavan and Stewart meet and decide to get married only a few days later. It's clearly an impulsive move and even before the honeymoon it's clear this will NOT be an easy marriage. Chris is a newspaper correspondent and likes the idea of traveling the world to report the news. This is clearly NOT a career conducive to a great marriage. But to make it worse Cicely soon takes up acting and she likes it...and it pays well. In fact when Chris loses a job she carries them. This SHOULD make them happy but it doesn't. After all it's the 1930s and a man a 'real man' was expected to be the breadwinner and a wife was to stay home make babies and wait for her man to come home from workwhich was impossible with being a correspondent and her being an actress. So years pass and Chris roams the world while Cicely becomes famous...and they barely have any time for each other. Both have created their own separate lives...and all the while their good friend Tommy Milland is there to help Cicely...and soon it becomes apparent Tommy wants to be more than just a friend.So basically you have two strongwilled people who are more concerned with their careers than each other...something hardly the stuff of a romance or fun film. In many ways I wonder how much this story was influenced by the Hollywood life...and broken marriages. Either way the acting is stupendous particularly by Sullavan...but the film is still unpleasant and not particularly involving for me. As for me I just wanted to slap them both and tell them to grow up! After all they had a child and yet they seemed a bit childish themselves.".

Sixth billed in Murder Man and fifth billed in Rose Marie he was barely visible in his first two features at MGM. On loan to Universal here he was teamed with Margaret Sullivan and together they play a couple that marries on impulse and then begin pursuing their own individual careers  she is an actress he is a journalist. Conflict develops when her career takes off and his does not. This film is very typical of those melodramas that were so common in the 1930's but it is still interesting to see what Stewart does with this early role in his career. Stewart and Sullivan have a better chance to show off their chemistry in 1938's Shopworn Angel still it is a good look at a film made right before the Laemmle's lost Universal to creditors. I'd recommend it mainly for the performances.".

They were the king and queen of bittersweet romances back in the day.Sullavan is highly successful stage star and Stewart is a reporter with ambitions to be an international correspondent. Sullavan might have been better off marrying Ray Milland who is a producer but something about the shy and stammering Jimmy wins her heart and that would be the first in a long line of female hearts on the screen to feel that way.Of course being an international correspondent does keep Stewart away a lot and Margaret does not want to give up a successful stage career that's just getting started. Even with the arrival of a baby boy the problems only increase until a really heavy crisis comes on that overwhelms all.Next Time We Love is an intelligent mature drama that holds up well and I'm surprised has not been remade.

It is at this moment that you realize that these two may be in love but have nothing really in common and you wonder How can this love survive?Obvious other than the lack of humor is the lack of familiar character performers.

	schema:reviewBody "Wonderful movie and quite unexpected at the time from the neorealist Visconti finally letting some of the operatic juice flow into his film work. It's also the first of his explorations of Italian history and social change to be followed by The Leopard and the fantastic Rocco and His Brothers.One caveat At a screening a couple of years ago at MoMA I learned that it was the Italian government that was responsible for the snipping of some crucial scenes near the end of Senso depicting the Battle of Custozza. These were meant to make his critique of the Italian ruling classes and their failure to pull together during this period of the risorgimento more explicit.

	onyx:emotionText "Wonderful movie and quite unexpected at the time from the neorealist Visconti finally letting some of the operatic juice flow into his film work. It's also the first of his explorations of Italian history and social change to be followed by The Leopard and the fantastic Rocco and His Brothers.One caveat At a screening a couple of years ago at MoMA I learned that it was the Italian government that was responsible for the snipping of some crucial scenes near the end of Senso depicting the Battle of Custozza. These were meant to make his critique of the Italian ruling classes and their failure to pull together during this period of the risorgimento more explicit.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1866 in the spring of Venice an underground rebel movement against the Austrian occupation in Italy is getting stronger. The married Countess Livia Serpieri Alida Valli sees her cousin challenging the Austrian Lieutenant Franz Mahler Farley Granger for a duel in the opera and being arrested and sent to the exile for one year.

How can a masterpiece like Senso be out of any worldwide serious list of the top 250 best movies? The red noble Luchino Visconti is one of the best directors ever and this masterpiece explores a wonderful cruel and tragic romance in times of the Italian El Risorgimento. Each scene in this movie looks like a picture of the XIX Century full of details. The cinematography is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen with a stunning recreation of a period. The story is fantastic with a gorgeous Alida Valli in the top of her beauty and Farley Granger splendid as a scum lover. The restored DVD released in Brasil by Versatil distributor is amazing full of excellent extras. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Senso  Seduo da Carne Senso  Seduction of the Flesh".

	schema:headline " An epic romance from post war Italy.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have rated this film 9 because of it's length there are some ponderous moments but otherwise it is a 10. Italian cinema was still having growing pains from the war but this epic succeeds and skillfully incorporates the war torn landscape into this tale of an earlier war. The music score is very big and melodramatic but fitting. The film opens with an opera in an enormous opera house and this is fitting for the grand scale and operatic scope of this romance and the background. This is Gone With the Wind  Italian style  with a much more sympathetic heroine.I am a fan of Alida Valli and have sought out her work. Perhaps because this is in her native Italian andor because of her Italian director she is a full vital feminine woman in this film very different from her more restrained work in America. Her breathtaking performance in The Paradine Case is a study in austerity and an almost masculine stillness. I had hoped that we would see a more free actress in her native language and we do! She flutters and tosses her hair she is a Countess reveling in her earthy affair. This is a full bodied performance.Farley Granger's performance whether in response to Valli or just given a really meaty badboy to play is a total revelation. He is lusty and sexy provocative pouty and passionate. In one scene he greets her by wordlessly grabbing her hand and almost devouring it with kisses. This is a rare film where both the woman AND the man have real powerhouse roles. The confrontation scene at the end is gripping.A small but pivotal role is played by Marcella Mariani. Her cowlike leadenness laced with sisterhood bespeaks a worldliness that paired with her ethereal youthful beauty is just wrenching. All supporting roles especially the maids are interesting and give a sense of intrigue throughout.A previous reviewer mentioned that the outcome of a major plot point is cut out which leaves you wondering... but what happened with that? Still the major story is the romance which I think will be satisfying for men as well as women because both sides are given such full emotional life. IF YOU CAN FIND IT it is an enjoyable big emotion epic wartime romance.".

	schema:headline " Luchino Visconti's aesthetic revolution";
	schema:reviewBody "Senso was Visconti at his most elegant and aesthetic. It opened his series of historical spectacles. The film showed that epics and melodramas can entail political criticism as any other genres. Senso is his intelligent analysis about the Italian unification  Risorgimento. The film's criticism didn't please all the people and it suffered from censorship and it was edited several times. Nonetheless this aesthetically beautiful film still stands out as a fine ironic masterpiece.The year is 1866 and the moment people have dreamed for decades  centuries  is in our hands. Garibaldi is coming and the Italians are beating the Austrians. In the middle of all this Visconti tells us a story about an Italian woman who is the cousin of the leader of the underground resistance who falls in love with an Austrian lieutenant. She is blinded by her romantic illusion and is ready to betray her family friends ideals and native land  these are part of the ethical problematics in Senso.Senso was Visconti's first color film and he obviously had put a lot of effort to it. It's visually gorgeous and meant an aesthetic revolution for Italian cinema. It is no coincidence that it starts in an opera which Visconti did a lot himself too. The opening sequence shows us the basic power of Opera and melodrama  to change life infrastructure without forgetting the concrete history.Historical films always tell us about two different ages intentionally or unintentionally the one the story takes place in and the time it was made in. It's a film about the Italian unification but also a study about the deepest emotions in Italy during the 1950's. Italy after WWII filled with neo realism  antifascist battle and hope for democracy. But also about the downside the victory of the rightwingers and the beginning of the Cold War.Senso is a gorgeous film which requires patience and love from its viewer. It's a political ironic revolutionary and aesthetic film. Truly one of the biggest landmarks in Visconti's career but also in the history of Italian cinema.".

The film sets its time during the fall of Austrian occupation in Venezia 1866 Valli is wavering between her bureaucratic husband Moog and rioting cousin Girotti to break loose from the stalemate she irrevocably falls for a young lieutenant in the opponent camp but he is no knight in shining armor but a foul and spineless scoundrel with irresistible sheen of deadly charm. Granger's gorgeous loverboy image is a quintessential smokescreen to veil his despicable innards but after all it is a consensual deal despite of Valli's false hope more significantly its antiwar signals have been forcibly cast by Granger's selfabandonment and the lousy war battlefield experienced by Girotti which more plausibly it is an intentional move by Visconti a distraction from the central turmoil but done with a tinge of amateurish fecklessness. Valle shoulders on a profound effort to scrutinize a woman's inscrutable sexual desire which being repressed for too long both she and Granger align themselves with Visconti's brimfulof emotion style again thanks to Techincolor and the overstuffed score as well which approximate the OTT threshold in certain degree although falling out with Visconti eventually Granger succeeds in bringing about his best screen persona and it was such a great era when a gay man can play an outright straight womanizer on the celluloid.On the one hand SENSO fails to impress me as my favorite among Visconti's work of art and scalewise pales by comparison with LUDWIG 1972 810 and THE LEOPARD 1963 810 but on the other hand only Visconti can flaunt such an overbearing melodrama with true mettle and without any compromise a trendsetter would inspire later kindred spirits for instance Baz Luhrmann's 3D adaption of the bourgeois sumptuosity THE GREAT GATSBY 2013 810.".

There are no good nice nor even likable characters but on a rudimentary level one can sense the motives of the two leads even if neither is a character of depth. Thus the film at least has a narrative integrity that many melodramas lack and once Mahler betrays Livia it is inevitable that she will damn him. Its use of red herrings and feints of narrative and character development is well done such as when Livia is told upon the Count's wanting to leave Venice that a man came to call on her she assumes it is Mahler is followed by the Count and when confronted confesses to having a lover only to find out the man who called was Ussoni. The Count thereby assumes her revelation of a lover was a ruse to protect Ussoni whom the Count has little use nor respect for. It's these sorts of moments that lift Senso above run of the mill melodrama albeit like Gone With The Wind not far enough into real drama. If only Visconti had been able to graft a small bit of his working class affinities by showing a bit more of the struggles of the Italian Resistance Senso may have hurdled that bar. Sans that Senso lives up to its titular billing as but a sensual comfort. And all can use a bit of that from time to time.".

In fact at one point she makes herself a traitor by giving the lover money which was gathered to support the Italian army...and all for love or at least what this whore thinks is love.While many reviewers seemed to like this film I couldn't get past the characters. While there was no obvious reason for the lovers to be together they were. And because they were both selfish and nasty you really don't care what happens to them. After all she's an adulteress thief and a traitor. He's a coward cheats on his new lover and is a deserter.

	schema:reviewBody "It's no coincidence that the film opens at the opera. In some fine deep shots we are introduced to our characters with the performance in the background  no doubt to establish the stylistic connection. So Visconti and collaborator Franco Zefferelli wanted to make an opera without the singing. This gives us grandeur but rigidity and even the mini riot that takes place in the opera house at the outset is aesthetically stylised. You need to buy into the approach at this point and I simply didn't. It just seemed like a bad idea. Opera is a stage spectacle all about grand gesture posturing formality it cannot transmit subtleties the format doesn't allow it. Take away the music and you are left with a banal story and a lot of fancy costumery. For Visconti constantly wanting to remind us of his noble descent that is enough  his main concern is showing us lavish interior decor an obsession you'll find either stirring or stifling. For music we get Bruckner whose indecisive meandering drone is largely ignorable.Cinematically the result is halfbaked. Valli walks into a room full of Austrian soldiers. David Lean who I equate with Visconti to some extent would have made a significant scene out of this but Visconti just gives us soldiers draped around the place in various unnatural postures as you might expect. One of them moves and strikes up a different posture  as you might expect. It's all cut and pasted from the Manual of Things Seen and Done Before. The camera stays back wide angle and doesn't lend much of a hand with the narrative leaving the players to communicate with exaggerated gesture.A married Venetian countess falls for a young Austrian army officer  we know from the first scene that he is an utter cad but she doesn't  or rather she does but being a one dimensional clinging woman she is bound to hurl herself into disastrous folly. Hence the film mainly consists of Valli ringing the emotional changes over her illicit affair. Visconti indulged so much time in this that he must have thought he was dealing with an original topic. Along the way there's the approaching end of Austrian rule of northern Italy and some slight comment on the collaboration of senior Venetian figures  but that point seems hardly worth making after all this time. There is a lengthy section where Valli's cousin dashing hero figure rushes on a military errand rather ridiculously right across the battle line of two approaching armies but this section was apparently heavily edited rendering it pointless and incomprehensible. The battle scenes are childish  a puff of smoke and the nearest two soldiers fall to the ground  this happens repeatedly.The script can't do anything with the stereotypical characters and the onesentence plot and there are no standout lines. This is extraordinary considering the 'English dialogue by Tennessee Williams and Paul Bowles'. Probably it was there but smothered by Visconti's operatic technique. One wonders why these writers were attracted to the project apart from a free holiday in Rome  perhaps they liked the final humiliation of the countess which is quite harsh  even gleefully misogynistic. She gets her own back though and it seems the moral is that both men and woman with their impulsive need for each other no matter how noble the exterior are stupid weak and mutually selfdestructive. That ridicules everybody ...or does it?.Funnily enough the main problem is Alida Valli who is required to overemote in every scene in total contrast to her depressive role in The Third Man  it's a little unpleasant to watch and she soon begins to annoy. She doesn't look right at all during the romance  too hardedged. Farley Granger was actually the main point of interest. His slight woodenness suits the impossibly white uniform and cape he was made to wear what sort of washpowder did they have in those days? and in the climactic drunken scene enhanced by a delightful whore  the highlight of the film he did as well as anyone could have done under a direction that demanded overamplification of every attempted nuance. And his eyes expressed something beyond the paltry plot of the film as if betraying that this Italian job was an odd intense experience for him for one reason or another. So for all the film's grandeur all I was left with was some vague speculation of a personal nature about one of its players. Perhaps his story  relating to the real world  is the film Visconti should have made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Senso opens at an opera house in Venice. A production of Giuseppe Verdi's Il trovatore is on display director Luchino Visconti hinting that his film will likewise be a sumptuous opera with big emotions unashamed melodrama and lavish costumes.The opera is then interrupted by a demonstration a group of radical Italian Patriots protesting the occupying Austrian army. What follows is an allegorical plot which may baffle those unfamiliar with Italian history. On the surface the story is about an Italian woman called Livia who finds herself growing apart from her complacent husband an aristocratic opportunist and drawn toward an Austrian character called Franz Mahler but what Visconti is really interested in is demythologising the Italian Risorgimento the political and social movement which led to the unification of Italy's states.One must remember that Visconti was influenced by Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci. Both Marxists Visconti and Gramsci believed history to be the most powerful ideological tool at the disposal of Italy and Austria's ruling elites and both believed in creating not just an organised working class led by grassroots intellectuals who could challenge hegemonic ideals but an art form which assisted or transmuted these challenges. And so when the performers in the opera that opens the film chant All'armi all'armi! To arms to arms! it's no surprise that the patriots in the audience and the Italian aristocrats in the boxes take up the chant and unfurl the Italian flag much to the fright of occupying Austrian officers. During this period of history roughly the 1860s the Italian hero Giuseppe Garibaldi and his partisan patriots were busy battling the AustroHungarian Empire for Italian independence. It was an extremely volatile period. But Visconti is not interested in proletariat uprisings. He seems more interested in exploring the myths underlying the unification stories of the Risorgimento in the years leading up to the removal of the Austrian Empire. He shows how the popular movement was in actuality denied by those in command of the Italian forces several key scenes clearly showing this were removed for being too inflammatory and shows the complicity compromises collusion and various other processes which were taking place amongst the fractured ruling elites. But the film also shows the utter indifference the aristocrats and many members of Italy's poor had toward unification. History the film implies unfolds regardless of public opinion. More than this the film uses the romantic decline and decay between a pair of lovers one Italian one Austrian to show how identities shift. The character of Franz for example is no longer appealing to our heroine when he is exempted from the military and loses his position. Not only is this romantic love based in a materiality which is income based and class based but nationalistic love is itself a kind of parasitic thing Franz and Livia's selfish romance collapse and separation echoing Italy's love affair with and rejection of the Austrian Empire.Of course the film is also implicitly about the era in which it was made. After WW2 Italy was busy trying to distance itself from Nazi Germany and was in the process of making sense of the literal and psychic rubble of the war and in search of a new national identity.So what's most interesting about the film is the way it fits in with The Damned Ludwig Death In Venice and The Leopard other films by Visconti about European nationalism and all of which form a clear progression. It is clear that Visconti believes that nationalism can still be seen as progressive in the Marxist sense of modernity ushering in a more dynamic social order. However films like The Damned also show that Visconti was interested in the limits of nationalism and the dead end which it ultimately leads to at a structural level within society. 810  The melodramatic romance at the heart of Senso does not work unless one approaches it from an allegorical perspective. Stylistically though Visconti loves his rich cinematography his lavish rooms and costumes the film is very stiff very dialogue based. Like many of Visconti's colour films Senso plays like a glorified stage production or Victorian novel.Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason Visconti's early film Senso 1954 eluded me until recently. I had heard of it before but it wasn't until I fell under the spell of Visconti's later masterpiece Il Gattopardo The Leopard that I became interested Senso. It's an odd film but not lightweight by any means. The basic story is a tortured potboiler about a passionate affectionstarved Countess Livia played brilliantly by Alida Valli and her completely delusional infatuation with a first class cad a Lieutenant in the Austiran army occupying Venice in the 19th century. This nightmare lover is convincingly done by Farley Granger early in his film career. He had a fascinating face much more versatile than I remember from his famous Hitchcock performances where he was limited to a naughty baby face or two. In Senso he looks truly sinister and rapacious.Granger was fortunate in his leading lady because she wrenches a great performance from him in their intense and heartrending scenes together. Valli was a volcanic actress in her prime. Very beautiful and clearly the forerunner to Claudia Cardinale only a much finer actress.The camera work of G. R. Aldo and Robert Krasker is gloriously beautiful and natural. It is in early technicolor and not as vividly retina burning as some of the widescreen epics that were to follow. The only major mistake in Senso is the decision to use Anton Bruckner's 7th Symphony themes there from as the ubiquitous melodramatic background. It's not that grand themes aren't apt for this tragic story it's just that grand high classical music and Bruckner is THE grandest and highest of 19th century romantic composers doesn't sound right in this film. No expense was spared the sets and costumes so skimping on the allimportant nay vital musical side seems a little misguided to say the least. Visconti had learned his lesson in this regard by the time he made Il Gattopardo in the early 1960s. Still the same overheated music but original well at least is wasn't Bruckner lifted in chunks from one of his monumental symphonies.Senso is a winner. It seems a bit long about 90 minutes in with 30 minutes to go but it picks up as Alida Valli's character slowly shreds in the final scenes.If you're longing to start a love affair with someone you just met I cannot recommend this film. Otherwise do not hesitate to see this.Granger's voice is dubbed over by the usual Italian voice actor who sounds like a spokesman for detergent. The subtitles seem sensibly translated. But the script is not the main reason to watch this excellent beautifully filmed minor masterpiece. The photography and Alida Valli's magnificent performance are reasons enough to see this important Italian film.I deduct one star for the Bruckner and another for the homogenized Farley Granger voice over.".

This nightmare lover is convincingly done by Farley Granger early in his film career. He had a fascinating face much more versatile than I remember from his famous Hitchcock performances where he was limited to a naughty baby face or two. In Senso he looks truly sinister and rapacious.Granger was fortunate in his leading lady because she wrenches a great performance from him in their intense and heartrending scenes together. Valli was a volcanic actress in her prime. Very beautiful and clearly the forerunner to Claudia Cardinale only a much finer actress.The camera work of G. R. Aldo and Robert Krasker is gloriously beautiful and natural. It is in early technicolor and not as vividly retina burning as some of the widescreen epics that were to follow. The only major mistake in Senso is the decision to use Anton Bruckner's 7th Symphony themes there from as the ubiquitous melodramatic background. It's not that grand themes aren't apt for this tragic story it's just that grand high classical music and Bruckner is THE grandest and highest of 19th century romantic composers doesn't sound right in this film. No expense was spared the sets and costumes so skimping on the allimportant nay vital musical side seems a little misguided to say the least. Visconti had learned his lesson in this regard by the time he made Il Gattopardo in the early 1960s. Still the same overheated music but original well at least is wasn't Bruckner lifted in chunks from one of his monumental symphonies.Senso is a winner. It seems a bit long about 90 minutes in with 30 minutes to go but it picks up as Alida Valli's character slowly shreds in the final scenes.If you're longing to start a love affair with someone you just met I cannot recommend this film. Otherwise do not hesitate to see this.Granger's voice is dubbed over by the usual Italian voice actor who sounds like a spokesman for detergent. The subtitles seem sensibly translated. But the script is not the main reason to watch this excellent beautifully filmed minor masterpiece. The photography and Alida Valli's magnificent performance are reasons enough to see this important Italian film.I deduct one star for the Bruckner and another for the homogenized Farley Granger voice over.";

Countess Serpieri Alida Valli a Venetian aristocrat married to an older man falls suddenly deeply in love with an Austrian army officer Franz Mahler Farley Granger who is however nothing more than a philanderer a crook and a coward who ends up by deserting his army based on a fake and obtained through bribery medical report stating that he is physically unfit for the army. A large sum of money was given to him for that purpose by the Countess. But she had been trusted with that money by the revolutionaries and it was to be used for their cause. When she realizes that he is nothing else than an unscrupulous scoundrel it's already too late and the story ends up tragically. The director Luchino Visconti is above all an aesthetician and this movie has got wonderful images and sceneries both in exteriors and interiors. The critics have already classified his movies as opera cinema. Although he is himself descended from an aristocratic Lombard family his ideology is much closer to Marxism and in this movie like in his other beautiful movie Il Gattopardo he depicts the moral and social decadence of the till then dominating aristocracy and the rising to power of another class the bourgeoisie like it occurred with most revolutions in Europe during 19th century. So as an aristocrat Visconti is an aesthetician and that's why his movies are always rich and beautiful in visual terms. But terms of ideology and of his movies message he is closer to Marxism. The only flaw of this movie in my opinion is the performance of Farley Granger a wrong choice for the role of Franz Mahler. He is much inadequate to the character of an elegant seductive unscrupulous and libertine officer. In fact he is not very talented and anyway goes better in an American detective movie than in the atmosphere of the Italian Risorgimento. He looks very unrefined for that. On the contrary the beautiful Alida Valli is brilliant as Countess Serpieri. If it weren't for that flaw I'd have rated this movie with an 8 instead of a 7.".

	schema:headline " Epic Romance in a period setting !!!";
	schema:reviewBody "'Senso' directed by Italian master Luchino VIsconti marked his first departure from neorealism. This is a grand operatic romance which manages to tie in a social and political subtext with it. From a visual standpoint this is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Right from the first shot to the final one the film remains colourful and visually vibrant which is enhanced by Visconti and his cinematographer's exquisite framing and compositions. The film has a melodramaticoperatic tone to it. 'Senso' falls in line with a number of other films made during this era of the 50s all around the world that came to be known as 'Women's Films'. These movies generally were melodramas with a female protagonist having to go through tough times and even tragedies for the sake of love and romance. 'Senso' with its melodrama and visual flair reminded me of the Douglas Sirk films. But more than Sirk the name that constantly came across my mind Max Ophls. I couldn't help but find similarities with 'The Earrings of Madame de' due to the film revolving around aristocracy opulence as well as having a protagonist who is an older mature woman engaging in infidelity. 'Senso' has a rich political and social context. It is set at a specific moment in Italian history when the Austrian occupation of Venice was about to face violent rebellion from native Venetians who were fighting for liberation from Austria and merging of Venice with Italy. The central characters and the illicit romance in the film go hand in hand with the politics and nationalist movement which reminded me of Satyajit Ray's 'The Home and the World'. On a broad level 'Senso' seems to be a sensitive but at the same time scathing criticism of the aristocracy and the upper class. Livia betraying her rebel cousin Roberto just for the sake of her lovelust for the Austrian officer Franz has to symbolise the rich upper class and the aristocracy turning their back on the ideals and ideology of the nationalist movement. On the other hand based on a more personal reading the film seems to be about identity and the idea of compromising your morals and ideals for selfish desires. There are mirrors visible in many shots of the film and there is a scene where Franz actually talks about how he likes to look at himself in the mirror to see whether he is still the man that he was earlier. We see Livia going through a constant fight within herself to decide whether she to stick to her morals and nationalistic ideals or give in to the charm and her yearning for Franz the Austrian officer. She gives in to her yearning and betrays her ideals. But in the end she gets a taste of her own medicine when Franz becomes nothing short of a mirror image of her own betrayal and selfishness.In a film where the main characters aren't the most likable the actors have to really rise to the top and make the characters really interesting. Farley Granger is good as the cunning and charming Franz. But the film is carried by Alida Valli. She made me believe Livia's attraction toward Franz. Yes she is exaggerated in some of her expressions but it fits perfectly with the melodramatic tone of the film. 'Senso' wouldn't completely work without Alida Valli's brilliantly emotive performance.'Senso' is a lavish sprawling epic romance with a political subtext. It is a very well made well acted and thematically deep film that I'd most certainly recommend.".

	schema:reviewBody "1954's Senso certainly proves as a stylistic departure on Luchino Visconti's behalf. The Neorealist approach that his previous films held is altogether discarded in favor of grandiose set pieces lush technicolor cinematography and operatic emotions. The result is a truly gorgeous if not melodramatic film.To start first with the positives the aesthetic of the film is beyond words. Every composition is masterfully and meticulously crafted. The lighting color scheme and shot placement all reflect the glamorous time period. I was at times in awe of the attention to detail Visconti put into some of the shots. For example during an extended battle sequence explosions can be seen in both the foreground and on the hills miles away from the camera. This may have been Visconti's first attempt at the period drama but he handles it with such grace you wouldn't be able to tell.Of course no film is complete without story and characters of which this film does not excel at but certainly handles correctly. Full disclosure this is a melodrama. The characters have very large emotions which they are eager to express. If that bothers you this most definitely will not be your type of film. I for one thought the melodrama certainly fit the tone of the film. A film with grand costumes sets and locations would feel rather hollow with small emotions.But the main thematic driving force of the film is it's antiaristocrat message. For those of you who do not know Luchino Visconti was born into an immensely wealthy family only to then adopt the beliefs of the communist party. Though I wouldn't call this a communist film it certainly makes a solid point in criticizing the hypocrisy of the aristocratic establishment. Sometimes the message is awkward  especially during scenes when two madly in love people interrupt themselves to discuss ethics  but the payoff is worth it. Alida Valli's character believes that war is being fought for a good cause yet demands that her lover bribe a doctor into naming him illfit for the war. She gives him 3000 dollars only to find out that he has spent it on liquor and prostitutes. Money the one thing she had an excess amount of has suddenly been turned against her. Since she has been betrayed by Granger she deems his actions immoral and orders him to be executed. Only when she realizes the double standard she has been holding throughout the movie it's too late. Visconti's message is powerful not just because it tears the two main characters apart but because he delivers it not with contempt but with pity. Valli's and Granger's characters are two incredibly selfloathing people and they're entirely responsible for their own downfall.Overall I would certainly recommend Senso for anyone interested in Visconti period dramas or both. It's one of the most visually stunning films ever made and certainly not worth missing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Visconti's first film in colour and his first with a patrician 19th Century backdrop'Senso' is a squalid tale ofbase animal passionwith an epic grandeur bestowed upon it that has seen it raised to the pantheon ofGreat Screen Romances by courtesy of Visconti having robed it in the trappings of the momentous historical backdrop of the Risorgimento of 1866 Venetian locations plush interiorsimmaculate costumes and Bruckner's Seventh Symphony which wasn't actually composed until fifteen years later.Theplot actually has marked similarities to Joseph Losey's 'The Sleeping Tiger' made concurrently indrab monochrome in postwar austerity Britain in which refined Alexis Smith married to decent but dull Alexander Knox completely loses her head overdelinquent Dirk Bogarde. Ten years earlier Visconti himself made a much more unadorned treatment of greed and destructive passion with 'Ossessione' 1942an adaptation of James M. Cain's sweaty tale of bluecollar adultery and murder 'The Postman Always Rings Twice'.Maria Callas had beenVisconti's first choice for the part of Countess Livia Serpieri  asociety wife who becomes infatuated withgoodlooking creep Lieutenant Franz Mahler played in a gleaming white uniform by an obviously dubbed Farley Granger  but had too manytheatre commitments even at the projected three months that the film was expected to take to shoot which eventually took nine months to complete. Ingrid Bergman was too wrapped up in the career of her husband Roberto Rossellini at the time to take up the offer and the role eventually went to Alida Valli. Still stunning butalready perceptibly older and more leathery than during her late forties Hollywood sojourn in the arms of Lt. Mahler Valli discovers an erotic fulfilment entirely new to her but to Franz she's just another notch onhis bedpost who he can sponge off.Marcella Mariani who died in a plane crash aged 19 justsix weeks after 'Senso's premiere israther sweetand vulnerable as the young prostitute Clara who is spitefully exploited by Franzto further rub Livia's nose in his rejection ofher. Rina Morelli has an eyecatching cameo flitting aboutLivia's villa in Aldeno asher maid who seems to beactively enjoying the thrillofher mistress's affair. But the most blackly comic element in the film is the way that as momentous historical events escalate around them she and her idealistic cousin Roberto Ussoni played by Massimo Girotti are shown to be completely obliviousto what is making the other tick. Under the impression that Franz is waiting for her at an addressto which she has been followed by her stuffy husband Heinz Moog she melodramatically declares with her back to the door that Yes She Has a Lover! only to discover the place occupied by Roberto and his revolutionaries eagerly making plans as oblivious of theturmoil raging inside Livia as she is by now indifferent totheir cause. She commits treason bysheltering Franzfrom the Italians and then gets even deeper in corruption by helping him to avoid combat by giving money meant for The Cause to him. One of a number of loose ends in the plot is that we never find out what happens when the absence is discovered ofthe 200000 florinsshe filches from the fund that is supposed to be helping to finance the revolution.As her grip on sanity loosensLivia's wardrobe the work of Marcel Escoffier  Piero Tosi becomes more and more buttoned down and severe the black dress she wears in her final scenes making her resemble some large ferocious bird of prey. The distinguished Italian cameraman G.R.Aldo was killed in a car crash during the filming of this his first colour production and the opening scene in Venice's Fenice Theatre is the work of his successor Robert Krasker who himself walked out on the production after falling out with Visconti leaving the film to be completed by Giuseppe Rotunno. Whoever shot the amazing closeups of Valli  her eyes wildly darting from side to side as she becomes more and more unhinged  merits particular kudos. During the final confrontation in the hotel you're expecting her to produce a gun and shoot Franz but she achieves the same endby more deliciously vindictive means and he ends up in front of a firing squad assembled at remarkably short notice while she careens into the night to a very uncertain fate.Having ended with a bang the final credits still have one moresurprise to serve upwhen the first two names we see after Visconti's turn out to be those of the future directors on this occasion humble assistants Francesco Rosi and Franco Zeffirelli.'Senso' was shot in Englishand there are a couple of excerptson YouTube from the truncated 94 minuteEnglishlanguage version 'The Wanton Countess' which enable you to hear Grangerin hisown voice speaking dialogue written by no less thanTennessee Williams and Paul Bowlesthus confirming suspicions that we are witnessinga Venetian variation on 'A Streetcar Named Desire'. By the 1970s Visconti could finally make a film truer to his own inclinations in 'Death in Venice' 1971 with Dirk Bogarde  once the object of infatuation himself in 'The Sleeping Tiger' but now the one smitten  in a production again dressed up to the nines handsomely set in period again using beautiful Venetian locations and this time almost entirely dispensing with dialogue in favour of Mahler his favourite composer whose name he had coopted for the young officer in 'Senso' who had been called Remigio Ruz inCamillo Boito's original novella.".

Mahler Valli discovers an erotic fulfilment entirely new to her but to Franz she's just another notch onhis bedpost who he can sponge off.Marcella Mariani who died in a plane crash aged 19 justsix weeks after 'Senso's premiere israther sweetand vulnerable as the young prostitute Clara who is spitefully exploited by Franzto further rub Livia's nose in his rejection ofher. Rina Morelli has an eyecatching cameo flitting aboutLivia's villa in Aldeno asher maid who seems to beactively enjoying the thrillofher mistress's affair. But the most blackly comic element in the film is the way that as momentous historical events escalate around them she and her idealistic cousin Roberto Ussoni played by Massimo Girotti are shown to be completely obliviousto what is making the other tick. Under the impression that Franz is waiting for her at an addressto which she has been followed by her stuffy husband Heinz Moog she melodramatically declares with her back to the door that Yes She Has a Lover! only to discover the place occupied by Roberto and his revolutionaries eagerly making plans as oblivious of theturmoil raging inside Livia as she is by now indifferent totheir cause. She commits treason bysheltering Franzfrom the Italians and then gets even deeper in corruption by helping him to avoid combat by giving money meant for The Cause to him. One of a number of loose ends in the plot is that we never find out what happens when the absence is discovered ofthe 200000 florinsshe filches from the fund that is supposed to be helping to finance the revolution.As her grip on sanity loosensLivia's wardrobe the work of Marcel Escoffier  Piero Tosi becomes more and more buttoned down and severe the black dress she wears in her final scenes making her resemble some large ferocious bird of prey. The distinguished Italian cameraman G.R.Aldo was killed in a car crash during the filming of this his first colour production and the opening scene in Venice's Fenice Theatre is the work of his successor Robert Krasker who himself walked out on the production after falling out with Visconti leaving the film to be completed by Giuseppe Rotunno. Whoever shot the amazing closeups of Valli  her eyes wildly darting from side to side as she becomes more and more unhinged  merits particular kudos. During the final confrontation in the hotel you're expecting her to produce a gun and shoot Franz but she achieves the same endby more deliciously vindictive means and he ends up in front of a firing squad assembled at remarkably short notice while she careens into the night to a very uncertain fate.Having ended with a bang the final credits still have one moresurprise to serve upwhen the first two names we see after Visconti's turn out to be those of the future directors on this occasion humble assistants Francesco Rosi and Franco Zeffirelli.'Senso' was shot in Englishand there are a couple of excerptson YouTube from the truncated 94 minuteEnglishlanguage version 'The Wanton Countess' which enable you to hear Grangerin hisown voice speaking dialogue written by no less thanTennessee Williams and Paul Bowlesthus confirming suspicions that we are witnessinga Venetian variation on 'A Streetcar Named Desire'. By the 1970s Visconti could finally make a film truer to his own inclinations in 'Death in Venice' 1971 with Dirk Bogarde  once the object of infatuation himself in 'The Sleeping Tiger' but now the one smitten  in a production again dressed up to the nines handsomely set in period again using beautiful Venetian locations and this time almost entirely dispensing with dialogue in favour of Mahler his favourite composer whose name he had coopted for the young officer in 'Senso' who had been called Remigio Ruz inCamillo Boito's original novella.";

Basically set in the spring of 1866 during the last days of the Austrian occupation and the Third Italian War of Independence the unhappily married Countess Livia Serpieri The Third Man's Alida Valli witnesses her cousin Marquis Roberto Ussoni Massimo Girotti organising a protest. Roberto challenges the dashing young Austrian Lieutenant Franz Mahler Rope's Farley Granger to a duel at the La Fenice opera house in Venice Roberto is arrested and sent to the exile for one year. During the commotion Livia meets Franz she hates him at first but spending a night walking together she falls deeply in love with him they begin a secretive love affair despite the fact that Franz's radical behaviour was responsible for Roberto's arrest Livia pretends to be unaware of this. Franz is obviously using Livia for her money and social status but Livia throws herself into the sexual affair giving away her money and not caring about the opinions of her in society but soon she becomes consumed by jealously and paranoia as Franz fails to show up for appointments. War breaks out forcing Livia and Franz apart her husband takes her with him to escape the carnage to the villa in the country but late one night Franz shows up demanding more money from Livia to bribe the army doctors and keep him away from the battlefield she complies and gives all money she had saved for Roberto her betrayal have tragic consequences. Eventually Livia is almost driven mad being unable to see Franz but she rejoices when she receives a letter from him in it he thanks her for financial support but tells her not to look for him Livia ignores this and heads for Verona to find her lover. Livia finds Franz but is devastated to find him as a drunk and selfloathing rogue with a young prostitute and mocking her after forcing her to drink with the prostitute Franz angrily throws Livia out. Livia's sanity is slipping she heads to the headquarters of the Austrian Army with the letter he sent her Franz is arrested for treason and executed by firing squad Livia is now truly insane and is last seen running into the night crying out her lover's name. Also starring Heinz Moog as Count Serpieri and Rina Morelli as Laura. The director originally wanted to cast Ingrid Bergman and Marlon Brando but Roberto Rossellini put his foot down and said Bergman only worked for him she was also not interested while Brando was shunned by the producers. But Valli proves a good choice as the countess used by a cavalry officer well played by Granger I could just about follow the story whilst having to read the subtitles it is essentially a doomed romance going against country and social class it may have been slow and predictable in places but overall it is an interesting melodrama. Worth watching!".

Something in the way they got shot or acted out. Or something unique going on with its story and have some interesting characters in it. What this movie has really going for it is the way it got shot. I really didn't expected this movie to be in color but it luckily was since it truly added a lot to the overall experience.It's a visually spectacular movie to look at also since it is being placed at an interesting time period. The movie is set in the late 19th century during one of the many wars this time between Austria and Italy. But the war elements get almost pushed to the background in this movie until its very end. It foremost remains a lovestory with of course some very dramatic developments to it. It's not a happy or sappy sort of lovestory. It's about an impossible love that isn't really meant to be and you know it could never work out well. The love itself isn't all that gloomily to begin with due to it that the characters themselves are not without flaws. This all set against the backdrop of a war and you know stuff is going to get melodramatic very soon.But it's made all very bearable due to the way the movie is getting told and shot. It's really a fine looking movie with a great directing approach to it. It's the sort of movie that prefers to have long shots and wide shots in it rather than closeups and a fast paced story. Not that the movie is slow or anything but it doesn't rush things. Because of that the story and movie itself feel very organic.A melodrama that is definitely worth seeing.810 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

This film follows much the same plot except 1 There is no full blown sex orgy in which a conga line is led by a woman in stockings and suspenders and Nazi uniform carrying a large golden dildo and 2 It's not set during the same era but during the time of the Italian unification 1866 Garibaldi and all that.

Maybe this was a way to decrease the high expectations that were surrounding this production as the book was a bestseller in Italy.The culprit of this failed attempt must be the director as most actors do a fine job. Alba Rohrwacher delivers as usual a great performance. And I did like the mean Viola played by Aurora Ruffino. Filippo Timi instead overdoes it in a small cameo.I really hope my memory will be able to erase the scenes that I've just seen ala spotless mind... restoring what my imagination came up with while reading the excellent book.".

Maybe this was a way to decrease the high expectations that were surrounding this production as the book was a bestseller in Italy.The culprit of this failed attempt must be the director as most actors do a fine job. Alba Rohrwacher delivers as usual a great performance. And I did like the mean Viola played by Aurora Ruffino. Filippo Timi instead overdoes it in a small cameo.I really hope my memory will be able to erase the scenes that I've just seen ala spotless mind... restoring what my imagination came up with while reading the excellent book.";

	schema:reviewBody "An enigmatic film by Saverio Costanzo was shown recently on a cable channel. The adaptation of a novel by Paolo Giordano comes to the screen in this story that is told in three different times and covers events in the lives of Alice and Mattia two wounded souls who destiny brings together in surprising and mysterious ways. Starting in childhood Mattia and his twin sister Michela who suffers from an unknown disease that has rendered totally dependent on her parents and ultimately his sibling make an odd pair. He is healthy while she is obviously handicapped. Alice on the other hand seems to come from a happier background but after an accident which has left her with a noticeable limp she retreated to a world of her own.In high school both Mattia and Alice's path convene under strange circumstances. Alice an introvert soul is bullied by her peers. She is the butt for all the cool girls jokes and derision. Mattia who begins attending Alice's school is in his own world not mixing with the other boys. A cruel classmate Viola realizes Alice is in love with Mattia. Feigning to like the girl Viola has a surprise in store as she humiliates Alice during her birthday party. Alice's confidence is shattered and Mattia is unable to be of help.As years pass Alice now a photographer lures Mattia into accompanying her to Viola's wedding. Mattia and Alice repair to an empty space avoiding the celebration where she starts caressing the man she has been in love for so long. As fate has it Mattia goes to follow his studies to Germany while Alice by now married and separated seeks information about him with his mother. Mattia concerned about Alice's welfare returns for a visit but he is too horrified to find an unknown Alice who is clearly in a state of despair about the turn her life has taken. Is it too late for these lovers?Saverio Costanzo directed as well as collaborated with Mr. Giordano in the adaptation of the text to the screen treatment of the material. The message seems to refer as how the prime numbers relate to these two strange lives that crave to be together but cannot find happiness in any way they can connect. The staging of the story relies in the use of fog and rain in the key scenes of the film. The story starts slowly as the viewer feels disoriented as well as disconnected from the story but to his credit Mr. Costanzo pulls us into the drama of lives wasted and opportunities that escape these souls that have so much to give one another but never connect like the prime numbers.An excellent Alba Rohrwacher keeps giving amazing portrayals in whatever project she graces with her presence. She is an amazing actress who always surprises with her innate intelligence. Equally surprising is the work of Martina Albano seen as the young Alice. She makes an impression in this film and no doubt she will continue to go to showcase her talent. We enjoyed Vittorio Lomartire as the young Mattia. Luca Marinelli playing the older Mattia does not have much to do. Isabella Rossellini appears as Mattia's mother in a small but pivotal role. Aurora Ruffino is perfect as Viola.The production gets a fabulous look thanks to Fabio Ciancetti camera work. Mike Patton's musical score feels right for all the different eras in the story and the editing of Francesca Calvelli serves the film well. Saverio Costanzo is a talented filmmaker whose work merits a view by fans of the Italian cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title of this movie was my prime stimulus to watch it not only to deconstruct the meaning but also because a movie about math  apparently  might provide a unique filmic experience I thought. Well ... I'm correct about the first but not the second.Happily for viewers it's not all about math. But the story is about a young man who is at an early age recognized as a math genius. We follow him Mattia Luca Marinelli and his childhood companion Alice Alba Rohrwacher as they both grow up through their teen years and on to adulthood. Both are introverted to the point of almost total withdrawal both indulge in aberrant behaviors both experience intense personal and psychic pain early in life which heightens their isolation but also both recognize each other for what they are  primal individuals unable to communicate according to society's dictates. For the next twenty plus years they each try to establish a lasting relationship with each other. During the course of that time they briefly meet in person perhaps on five or six occasions at the end of the story Alice sends a short urgent letter to which Mattia responds in person. At all other times we see their lives unfold individually as they each grapple with the many obnoxious or helpful people who intrude upon their solitary existences.Some viewers might find the plot too slow indeed a few sets and scenes do include long static shots particularly facial closeups. What's more annoying though is the elliptical structure of the story as it cuts between three different time periods which I'm sure will tend to confuse some or even many viewers. Having read the novel  brilliant writing which worked exceedingly well as a linear narrative  I'm still puzzled why the director decided upon disjointed flashbacks. Visually it doesn't work well at all frankly it lessens the dramatic tension especially when compared with the novel.My overarching criticism however concerns the ending the resolution to Mattia's and Alice's solitary anguish. In the novel it ends realistically and appropriately I thought. This movie's end is unfortunately hopelessly Hollywood.The production is competent although I think the music is too loud at times. The cast and acting are fine. In view of my above comments though my recommendation is read the novel forget the movie. Give it 5 out of 10 barely.May 2nd 2016".

As a young boy he was close to his mentally disabled sister Michela and looked after her calming her during her 'episodes' As a young man Michela is no longer there and there is clearly an experience in their childhood to be revealed that that has marked Mattea and left their mark on him in the form of selfharming.Alice also has visible scars.

Neither Mattea nor Alice fit in with the world around them and suffer at the hands and from the taunts of others but it's nothing to the suffering and the pain that they inflict upon themselves over incidents in their childhood.In terms of storyline it's as straightforward as that but the structure of the film split into different time zones for both Mattea and Alice does complicate matters.

It's a fractured past however that nonetheless shares echoes and correspondences between them between past and present between two people each trapped in their own worlds and in their pasts.There are moments when you feel that some kind of escape or redemption might be within their grasp where they might make a connection that could help them to face up to the past and escape from what the might become but the traps of the mind keep preventing them from getting past the past.

There doesn't seem to be too many popping up lately in my opinion.The movie apparently is based on a book and also scripted by the author. I haven't read the book so I don't know how the movie compares.Story follows a girl and a boy later woman and a man through years from about 8 years old to 30 something. Mostly concentrating on childhood. The script is nonlinear so things don't always go as expected and can be a bit confusing.For some time we follow a lonely  but very much adored  young girl at a ski resort. At another storyline we have a smart boy of same age and his mentally challenged sister of also same age. In between we have extracts of seemingly same kids at their teens where their stories connect. A lot and probably dramatic things seem to have happened tho since the kids are not exactly happy in their teens anymore if they ever were.The boy is easy to follow as there is just one of them but for a good while I mixed up three girls partly because they look quite different at different ages but also because they act quite differently and as the movie is nonlinear a lot has happened that we don't yet know. I'm not sure if this was deliberately done but it confused the hell out of me.The movie eventually reveals events from both the girls and boys lives which have dramatically affected them. In this regard the story is very strong and gripping sometimes very hard to watch as a parent myself.The prime numbers part is an interesting thought. It doesn't add much to the movie tho other than a nice title and an intriguing analogy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't read book but was attracted by title. First 30 mins was good. Such promise. Sadly after that it was a complete waste of time. Rather than spend time writing a further review I can say Mendhak's review perfectly sums it up a jumble of timelines and a storyline filled with teenage angst and pointless drama. It is also full of needlessly prolonged scenes that make no sense but which you can feel the director congratulated himself over. Also this movie has nothing to do with prime numbers. Prime numbers may have been mentioned in one or two sentences in the movie but were never the focus. I wonder if there was a better reason in the book for using the words 'prime numbers'.  Don't waste your time on it...even the cinematography descended into rubbish after first 30 mins....".

That was the first time I had ever saw this adorable film though it is still not my favorite in the series That trophy goes to Part 3 but still adorable otherwise. I was 9 years old when I first rented it from the nowclosed Hollywood Video on Woodway.Anyway the film starts off with a somewhat typical family of the 90s The Taylors. The father is widowed and works as a raisin farmer the son is into Elvis and the daughter seems to be on the verge of rebellion. But then their lives change when the past comes to them. They discover miniature dinosaurs which the 2 kids name after various music icons like Elvis Paula Jagger Hammer and Madonna. But it's not until the sleazy museum curator Rico Sarno Played by Stephen Lee from Dolls The Pit and the Pendulum Ghoulies III Robocop 2 wants them back. He was the one who had originally discovered the eggs that the dinosaurs hatched out of in South America.Like I said this film is a childhood favorite. Now that I'm older I will admit it is silly at times but what's to expect? It's still the childhood favorite that I remember.Recommended.EXTRAS The Paramount VHS Which I own and sourced to DVDR has no trailers at the beginning but the Videozone has an intro by Full Moon CEO Charles Band where he talks about The Shrunken City and Remote and in depth details about Moonbeam a behind the scenes an interview with Peter and Andrea Von Sholly and a trailer for Remote 1993".

	schema:reviewBody "I had remembered loving this movie when I was a kid because I loved dinosaurs in my childhood and had seen a handful of very obscure dinosaur movies aside from the other popular ones and it had been so long since I had seen Prehysteria! that I asked for it for Christmas. I came to the occurrence that I had seen the movie before by some ad there used to be on Nickelodeon cassettes to the tune of Happy Days which featured quick showings of it. I got it on cassette and pretty soon after I watched it expecting to love it as much as I did when I was kid. Let's just say I certainly did not like it as much as when I was a kid. Well overall the movie is entertaining and enjoyable fluffy humor and insipid characters make it laughable but ultimately failing in it's attempt to be good. The dinosaurs are so cute and lovable however that they make the film unable to completely hate even if they are in lack of decent special effects. The acting was poor at some points especially from the daughter who I just did not care for at all but still the acting is tolerable. The plot was pretty good so no problems there and they were able to make some likable characteristics even if it is definitely not a masterpiece.Prehysteria! is meant for kids no doubt for the plain and simple fact that I loved this as a child and now I thought it was kind of forgettable but nonetheless it was not a terrible movie and if you think you can appreciate it for what it is give it a view just watch with an open mind. It is absolutely not as bad as it's rating idolizes it to be even if it does not deserve amazing reception. I have seen worse and I have seen better but this can be enjoyable from time to time and by that I mean if you ever do watch it more than once make sure you spend a long period of time between watches to grow any sense of appreciation towards it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movie cans are well aware of the name Charles Band but perhaps most people are not. Band was the son of director Albert Band who decided to follow in his father's footsteps beginning in the 70s. In the 80s he came up with a plan to form his own studio to produce movies for the growing niche market of video stores at the time and to produce so many films before the end of the century. I don't think he quite made his goal but that was not for lack of trying.Beginning under the mantel of Empire Pictures he later changed his productions to fall under the umbrella of Full Moon Pictures. The company had consistent output at first and created several successful series of films most notably PUPPET MASTER TRANCERS and SUBSPECIES. In the early 90s Band decided to have a wing of the company that would make nothing but family friendly films featuring science fiction fantasy and nonhorror relater films. He called this branch Moonbeam. Their first film was PREHYSTERIA! and it's making its way back to disc once again.Opportunistic museum curator Rico Sarno Stephen Lee is in search of a secret cave in South America. A blow hard of the worst kind and an ugly American as well he cares nothing about the sacred lands of the people whose caves and tombs he enters. When his guide tells him they can go no further he returns on his own finds a set of giant eggs in a cave and prepares to steal them. The native finds him but before he can stop him Sarno knocks him unconscious and absconds with the eggs.Cut to Sarno's home town where Frank Taylor Brett Cullen is raising his family on a farm selling fossils he finds to Sarno. His wife having passed away two years earlier Frank has two children to take care of Monica Samantha Mills your typical rebellious teen and Jerry Austin O'Brien an Elvis loving all around kid. Vicky Colleen Morris who works for Sarno tries to treat Frank fairly but Sarno wants none of it. She also tends to flirt with Frank. Trading in his latest finds and then heading home the Taylor's dog picks up the wrong cooler on the way out.Once home the dog takes the cooler to the basement and lays with the eggs in that cooler hatching them. Jerry happily finds the result a group of small dinosaurs. Letting his sister in on the secret it isn't long before the cute little critters make a mess and dad finds out what's going on. In the meantime Sarno is on the rampage looking for the cooler and the eggs intent on making millions from them.Vicky shows up at the Taylor's house to warn them that Sarno is intent of blaming them for the loss of his cooler. When they show her the dinosaurs she tells them not to let Sarno learn about them because he'll just exploit the animals and not worry about their welfare.Of course it isn't long before Sarno figures out what's going on and brings along two goons to capture the dinosaurs and Vicky as well for good measure. But some way the Taylors will find a method to set things right save the animals and rescue Vicky. At least we hope.Let's start out by saying that if you view this film only as an adult you'll find it to be only so so. But that's the point the movie wasn't made just for adults but for kids for families. Viewed through those eyes the movie is a great success offering some fun for the adults cute little dinosaurs for the kids and enough mayhem to have the little ones laughing from start to finish. It's no more harmful than the Three Stooges or Abbott  Costello movies we all grew up with. Kids will love it.The thing that makes or breaks a movie like this though is the dinosaurs. Remembering this was the days before major CGI and done on a miniscule budget do they pull it off? Absolutely. A combination of puppetry and stop motion animation bring the tiny creatures to life. Not only that they display different characteristics as well. And they come off as the cuddliest creatures you will find. Hopefully they won't grow to full size though.The film was followed by two sequels and did fairly good business when released. Kids who grew up in the 90s and are adults now will find a certain amount of nostalgia watching this movie. On top of that they will be able to pick it up to share with their kids as well.The movie is being released on bluray format and includes just a few extras. Those include previews for other Full Moon titles an audio commentary track with O'Brien and Band and the Moonbeam Videozone an extra created at the time to offer a behind the scenes look at each movie being made. If you loved the movie growing up then by all means make sure you pick it up to enjoy again.".

If all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your kid it will do just fine. That said there's a lot of kids' entertainment out there that's much smarter and some of it is even bearable or enjoyable for adults.

First the characters were a little goofy and one dimensional. The 'good people' had similar physical and character traits and the 'bad people' had similar physical and character traits ... hmmm. The basic storyline was OK pretty simple and standard  nothing too exciting or objectionable. The main attraction was of course the miniature dinosaurs  kind of a nice fantasy element to have. However they had a very minimal presence in the movie.Outside of that the movie kept a brisk pace and didn't get too bogged down in any one place. I liked this about the movie.The problem I had with the plot had to do with the the idea of stealing. I think this movie may not have been thought out enough  something's wrong especially if this is a kid's movie. I'll keep the next sentence abstract to not be a spoiler skip it if you're worried. The 'good guys' do some stealing and they don't have the same info the audience has  so it's just stealing and that's kind of a bad thing for a kid's movie.Overall if you have kids because of a questionable plot aspect I'd consider passing. However this whole movie is pretty low key anyway so it may not matter. Pass this one if you have any other interesting choices.".

It simply is one of the best horror movies made in the seventies and I can't think of many aspects about it that are negative. First of all it stars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. There.that should already be enough as a recommendation. These gentlemen are one THE greatest duo in horror ever and they didn't do their finest work just for Hammer Studio's exclusively. And the fun doesn't stop with these two icons.Horror Express also stars Telly Kojak' Savalas in a delightful role.  It's actually a shame that his screentime is rather limited because he manages to impress as much as Lee and Cushing. He clearly enjoyed playing Captain Kazan and he makes the most of his performance.But Horror Express has a lot more to offer than just good acting. It's a powerful and fascinating story that delivers a good old fashioned amount of scares and atmosphere. The entire story takes place on a old train which is the ideal setting for a film like this. The old and noisy carriages create a unique atmosphere of claustrophobia and the nowhere to run'element is used to the max. The plotline itself surprisingly good and it keeps you alert during the entire movie. This is also thanks to the several other interesting topics that are included in the movie like anthropology religion and the evolutiontheory. Sure the entire screenplay is illogical and the plot contains as many holes as a small Swiss cheese but  seriously  who cares. I prefer this kind of silly inspiration and creativity a million times over the horror crap they make nowadays !! Horror Express is  simply put  a must see ! I'd even say it's essential viewing if you're looking for the highlights in the genre.  It's original creepy  even pretty bloody and violent  it contains enough humor to moderate things and most of all.it's very entertaining. Climb on board and find yourself a seat.Horror Express is one movie you won't regret watching !!".

	schema:reviewBody "The first halve of this movie is pretty standard seventies horror stuff like featured in most of the old Hammer movies. The second halve however really surprised and impressed me. I loved it!I really love oldhorror movies with both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in it. In this movie they are better than ever together. Their acting is superb and so is the rest of the cast even though it is a bit strange that almost all of the Russians are played by Spanish people. Telly Savalas also shows up in a fun role. Savalas is probably best known for portraying Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the James Bond movie On Her Majesty's Secret Service but he also played in classics like Cape Fear 1962 Kelly's Heroes Capricorn One and The Dirty Dozen. It's wonderful to see such fine acting in one movie because normally mainly it are just only Cushing and Lee who are the only good actors in a movie like this.Also this movie is actually scary and gory and it has a really good atmosphere. It starts like some kind of monster movie like Creature From the Black Lagoon but the second halve of the movie is more like a Zombie movie like Lifeforce which is an underrated horror classic in my opinion with a great soundtrack. A combination that worked really well for me.The story stays simple and of course ridicules but it still is better than 90 of the other movies from the same genre and it actually goes deeper in trying to explain some of the things.In my opinion a real horror classic!810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "All aboard the TransSiberian Express  non stop to the shores of hell. That's the interpretation of the priest character on board. But he's offbase it's an alien monster that's causing all the trouble  a monster derivative of The Thing story but about 10 years before John Carpenter presented his version. The creature is literally millions of years old having passed through various forms as life evolved on Earth then someone makes the mistake of storing it on board in a frozen apelike fossil. Next thing you know certain individuals are behaving strangely with glowing red eyes and others turn up dead with eyes whited out and brains drained. This of course benefits from the umpteenth pairing of Lee and Cushing Lee is the arrogant scientist here and Cushing is again a doctor. Much of the entertaining dialogue stems from the conflict between science and religion during the transitional phase of the early 20th century. The priest rants on about Satan Lee calls it rubbish. Here's a typical quote from the priest 'There's the stench of death on board this train even the dog knows it.' The dog belongs to a couple of aristocratic Russians on board.At the one hour mark Savalas shows up as a powermad Cossack with his soldiers ready to kick everyone to hell and back. He manages to make quite an impression in the next 15 minutes as the death toll escalates. He and the two leads British all the way sort of ham it up as if knowing they're in some crackerjack cheesy horror material but there's also quite a bit of eeriness to the proceedings. The filmmakers managed to get the nice train set from an earlier big budget production and made good use of it. The train itself becomes nearly another character hurtling through the dark with snow and a chill wind all around and the interior set design is quite good. The musical score is also unusual when one expects ominous tones during some sequences instead we get a kind of tuneful melody. But the best thing about this is the concept itself  this thing this form of energy having been around forever and theoretically capable of curing all our ills contents itself with the easy kill. Boy does it like to drain brains.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSI've noticed that some people refer to this movie as obscure which baffles me because I used to watch it all the time on television in the 70s  early 80s back when it was still fun to watch latenite TV before the dawn of the infomercial. For a number of years all you had to do was turn on the TV after midnight and eventually you'd catch Horror Express.Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing play two distinguished gentlemen at odds with a nasty frozen fossil that Chris picked up in the far East and is now taking back to Europe on the TransSiberian Express. The fossil a half manhalf ape Neanderthal that he believes may be the missing link thaws out and becomes surprisingly animated. The creature begins attacking and murdering the passengers draining them of their brain contents through their eyes which turn white and bleed. Later the fossil is shot down and killed and it's only then that we learn the true threat a formless extraterrestrial intelligence that can inhabit living bodies by entering through the eyes. The brain sucking allows it to absorb the intelligence of its victim resulting in a cunning and seemingly unstoppable adversary.Horror Express has got a wonderful European atmosphere to it in the tradition of the best 70s genre films and it is a real treat for those who appreciate this kind of thing. Although it's a lowbudget Spanish production it's almost on par with the best of the Hammer productions. The presence of Lee and Cushing might actually make you think it's Hammer but when Telly Savalas shows up to keep order on the train you'll know it's not. The sets are weird and appropriately eerie. It's not quite as claustrophobic as a real train might be the cars look a little too wide and a little too opulent. However the miniature shots of the train are not all that bad for a low budget film. The movie does manage to be genuinely chilling in some places especially the climax of the film that gives us an undead army of bleeding whiteeyed victims. Only a few campy sequences hold it back from being a real classic the textbook drawings that are supposed to pass for reallife images they find in the creature's eyeball for one. But so little to complain about in a film so delicious. Definitely worth your time especially late late at night!".

It succeeds brilliantly as long as we allow it to succeed that is as long as we are willing and eager to be entertained. This is one of only two thrillers that I know of in which almost the entire story takes place on board a train the other is Murder on the Orient Express. The setting works very well in both movies but I found Horror Express to be more satisfying. At the beginning as the cast of characters got settled in the train I got settled in my chair eager for the journey to start. During the journey there is enough suspense to keep the viewer interested but nobody except the very young or the very sensitive needs to worry about being scared or grossed out by gore. I must admit to not having paid too close attention to the plot but this probably contributes to the enjoyment and it means that I can enjoy seeing it again. In short this movie is jolly good fun as long as you are not too demanding in terms of plot or character development. One of my favorite horror movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. The two go together like strawberries and cream like white wine and fish. One is a glove the other is a hand that fits perfectly inside. The LeeCushing partnership made many movies together during the '50s '60s and '70s including some of the finest Hammer horror movies. Of their three decades as screen partners their work from the 1970s is probably their weakest  Nothing But The Night Dracula AD 1972 and The Satanic Rites Of Dracula are inferior examples of their films together. However even in he '70s low period they still served up the occasional gem. The Creeping Flesh was a nicely done horror flick with a wickedly unexpected twist ending and this  known in America and Britain as Horror Express  is a powerful and inventive bloodcurdler with a sprinkling of science fiction.In Siberia 1906 anthropologist Alexander Saxton Lee finds a frozen creature which he believes to be the Missing Link. He transports the being back to western Europe by transSiberian train. Aboard the train are the usual assorted types a Polish countess Silvia Tortosa her husband Jorge Rigaud a mad monk seemingly modelled on Rasputin Alberto De Mendoza and a fellow scientist and longtime rival of Saxton's the charismatic Dr Wells Cushing. Midway through the journey as the train passes through a desolate snowscape many miles from civilisation the creature thaws out and begins killing the passengers. Wells carries out an autopsy on the corpses and realises that they are not up against the Missing Link but a weird alien organism which inhabits the bodies of its victims and steals their memories. As the finger of suspicion falls upon each character the scientists try to figure out which passenger is carrying the shapeshifting monster while trying to keep everyone safe and alive.Horror Express has its share of dumb moments what horror film doesn't? but in the main it is quite an intelligent and original piece. Some of the supporting actors are quite amateurish too giving performances that distract one's attention for the wrong reasons. However Cushing and Lee are believable as always and it's their straightfaced conviction which makes the story as spinetingling as it is. There is also a welldeveloped subtext in the film condemning religious fanaticism with Mendoza's character shown to be so unreasonable and misguided that his Christian rantings are every bit as disturbing as the teachings of a heretic. The atmosphere is spookily maintained with lots of eerie scenes which probably got many a heart fluttering back in 1973 in the preExorcist days of the horror genre. In particular the climactic sequence in which Cossack soldiers led by Telly Savalas board the train only to be zombified by the deadly alien is a chilling episode. You may need to be a fan of oldschool horror flicks to enjoy Horror Express but if you are it's definitely one worth seeking out.".

Together with his unique specimen Professor Saxon boards the a train to Russia in Pekin also boarding the train is Dr. Wells Peter Cushing a rival scientist. As the train speeds through the icy wastelands the Ape man comes to life possessed by an alien energy creature capable of jumping from body to body  sucking the thoughts ideas  knowledge from it's victims minds. A hunt is mounted to discover which passenger is possessed with the evil alien...This Spanish British coproduction was directed by Eugenio Martin  is an entertainingly absurd scifi period horror flick that is hard not to like. The script by Arnaud d'Usseau  Julian Zimet takes the basic premise from The Thing from Another World 1951 with it's story of a frozen alien found by unsuspecting explorers  adds a little bit of The Hidden 1987 in as well with it's body jumping alien  even manages to throw a tiny bit of The Night of the Living Dead 1968 into the mix with it's horde of zombies at the climax. One could also say Horror Express takes both it's setting  it's title from the action adventure Shangai Express 1932. The one thing that shines through about Horror Express is that it's very entertaining in it's silliness a two million year old fossil coming to life the sucking of people's minds dry the idea that it's all down to a millions year old alien  the the scientifically unsound notion that images are somehow stored in eyeball fluid. It all works really well to create a unique horror film with a good story that continues to develop throughout it's duration the character's are good  there's the expected religious reasoning as well which is disproved in favour of more scientific explanations. Overall Horror Express is a much better film than I had expect  as a film you can see that it has itself influenced quite a few other films that have been made since.Director Martin does a good job there is indeed a sense that we are traveling on a train at the turn of the century. The period Hammer horror style production design  costumes are excellent. According to the IMDb the train interior sets  the model train used for the exterior shots were the same that the producerdirector had used for their previous film Pancho Villa 1972 although other sources state that producer Bernard Gordon brought the train model from the big budget Nicholas and Alexandra 1971  decided to make a film around it with both sounding equally plausible in the world of low budget exploitation  horror filmmaking. Whichever is true if either are the makers certainly get a lot of use out of the train model since every two minutes they cut to a shot of it speeding along the track seriously if you were to edit out all the train model shots then I think Horror Express would be a good twenty odd minutes shorter. There's not much gore there's some blood there's a dissected eyeball  a surprisingly graphic autopsy scene for the time where Cushing saws the top of a corpses head off to expose the brain.Technically the film is well made with that 70's period Hammer horror atmosphere which makes so much difference the way it's shot  the way the sets are so detailed really help make Horror Express look higher budget than it was. The model train shots look a little fake at times though the monster is wisely kept in the shadows most of the time  the cheesy red eye effect often feels out of place. There's a good cast here with English horror stalwarts Christopher Lee  Peter Cushing who both turn in fine performances as one would expect. The bald one himself Telly Savalas has a small cameo as a Russian cossack  camps it up superbly. The rest of the cast while not as well know put in decent performances.Horror Express is a highly enjoyable  likable scifi horror film in the best tradition of Hammer horror with a good cast  it has an adventurous story that tries to be different as it mixes religion horror  scifi. Much better than I had expected  well worth a watch.".

Everyone is lots of fun and while this film is fairly gory it's no mere bloodbath. It requires constant attention from the viewer as the story is actually rather complex. And unlike the characters we find in most current horror films the characters in Horror Express are intelligent people and their attempts to analyze the strange sciencefictional situation in which they find themselves are most engrossing. Heck even the monster in this movie is smart.It's strange to consider that though it features all the trappings of a horror film it has little of the conventional atmosphere...it's very thinky and so cleverly funny that the word giddy can be used to describe it. The cast seems to have enjoyed the opportunity to work with such an interesting story. It transcends its genre.So much fun that the rough edges from its low budget are easy to ignore.

It's actually generally frightening and also a very compelling storyline. You have to take time and wonder just what the creature is it an alien life form or is it Satan? That's the one problem I have with the film. The movie can't seem to decide what it's villain is. For most of the movie it shows strong evidence that it's Satan or at least a demon  i.e no markings appear on the box that the creature is in when the monk tries to draw a crucifix on the box with chalk. But then when the life form enters the monk it claims to be a form of energy from another galaxy... which says that it's an alien. But then that doesn't explain the other things. Those two facts contradict each other too often so it's almost impossible to come to a conclusion. Either way it's a great film.".

From its eerie opening credits to its smashing fiery finale it's a journey through the bizarre and terrifying unknown. The story is truly chilling and remains compelling all the way as it builds to some great shocks and is cemented in a profoundly creepy atmosphere. Eugenio Martin's direction is good making a B budget film into grade A quality. The camera work is nicely done and the period setting is quite authenticlooking. John Cacavas' haunting music score is also a great addition.Castwise the film is quite solid too. Horror veteran Christopher Lee delivers his usual sophisticated performance while fellow horror star Peter Cushing adds a colorful presence of his own. The supporting cast is also good particularly Telly Savalas who plays the captain of a band of rebels who take the train hostage.Excellent on all levels Horror Express is a delightful and scary film.

But to my surprise none of the usual Hammer names appeared in the production credits and realized that this was actually something different. I decided to give the movie a chance and was rewarded with a pretty good movie. Horror Express is interesting in that the scope and feel of the story and the ideas at play are somewhat more inventive than the typical monster film from the period. What starts out as a Yeti rampage turns into something quite different the thawed out fossil that breaks out of its locked coffin is more of a gorgonbasilisk than a killer ape and its origins turn out to be extraterrestrial rather than supernatural. And things get even more complicated when the creature is revealed to be able to possess minds as well as draining them  so it doesn't just kill its victims it subverts and corrupts their very identities.And if it escapes from the train it might cause untold damage at loose in the world...which raises the stakes even higher than just personal survival. Putting the whole story aboard an exotic train traversing the wilds of Siberia was a clever choice that reinforced the claustrophobia and isolation of the setting as well as interesting props and sets. Cushing and Lee are their usual excellent selves  how many actors from that era could discuss extra galactic intelligences with a straight face and make you believe it? And the rest of the cast keeps up. There's not a flat tire in the cast although I think Savalas' accent. was somewhat jarring and out of place in this setting. IMO Horror Express is one of the finest movies in its genre and it is well worth hunting down and seeing if you haven't already.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those 1970s films that whilst it can't seriously be called a great film is certainly great fun and so full of bonkers ideas it makes you glad it was made and sort of sad that nothing like it would get made these days. Films like Zardoz and The Final Programme would also fit that same description for me but unlike those films Horror Express is despite its occasional scifi elements firmly rooted in the horror genre. In fact it feels much more like one of those horror films that made the video nasties list in the UK in the 1980s than it does the typical Hammerstyle horror film that you would normally associate with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee both of whom star. There is some quite graphic horror here with heads being sliced open and an eyeball being removed during autopsies albeit with rubbish special effects and all safely within a 15 certificate nowadays. The fact that the 2006 2Entertain DVD I watched it on presents the film in 43 aspect with less than great picture quality also undoubtedly helped to contribute to the video nasty feel!It's a British and Spanish coproduction although the only evidence of British involvement on screen is the presences of Messrs Lee and Cushing a fact not lost on the writers. In my favourite moment it is suggested to the British leads that one of them might be the monster that is killing people off on board the titular express train. This is an allegation they refute with an argument that consists entirely of looking indignant and explaining in two words that this couldn't possibly be case because We're British! We British might be a little bit emotionally stifledbut we're not the kind of people that would turn into a prehistoric ape man come alive from a 2000 yearold fossil that may or may not be Satan himself or may or may not be an alien spaceman and that is killing selected passengers on board a transcontinental express train journeying across Russia. That by the way is the plot together with some remarkably strange science along the way that tells us people's memories are either stored in the fluid in their eyeballs or stored in the creases in their brains which brains will therefore become completely smooth if one is unlucky enough to have one's memories sucked out through one's eyeballs. Also amongst the strange ideas that are shoehorned into the film's shortish 83 minutes running time at the expense of overall coherence are a mad monk who converts from devotion to God to devotion to Satan with a remarkable rapidity and a police inspector with one hairy arm who nobody notices as a consequence keeps one of his hands permanently in his pocket. We also get Telly Savalas who stars a Cossack Captain and does his menacingholdinghiscigaretteina funnywaypersona much as he did for his depiction of Blofeld in On Her Majesty's Secret Service for maybe about 15 minutes of the film's running time before being turned into a zombie! So all in all a film well worth a watch if you like that kind of thing!".

The special effects are pretty good and the direction is very nice for the genre and time.But really it's the cast that sells Horror Express so well.

Lee plays the crusty Brit stereotype to perfection while Cushing plays a more laidback character than normal which is pleasant to watch. He even cracks jokes! Most of the nonEnglish actors do surprisingly good with a minimal amount of overacting. Alberto de Mendoza as Father Pujardov is the worst offender but it actually works well for his character who seems a sweaty highstrung mess the entire time. Telly Savalas billed as costar with Lee and Cushing doesn't show up until about an hour in and has a limited but memorable role. He hams it up in every scene but it's a real treat to watch.Horror Express is a great movie to watch late at night.

	schema:headline " Another Disappointment to the Werewolf Genre";
	schema:reviewBody "Tonight I had the opportunity to get a sneak peak at the movie Skinwalkers a new film by creature effects guy James Issasc's. He is probably best known for his work on The Fly and Enemy Mine. I had heard about this film a few months back when I had the pleasure of attending a screening of Alien at the wonderful Arclight in Hhe creature effects were supposedly a twist on the usual werewolf film. So when a ticket for this film passed my way I jumped at the chance.The story which I was in the dark about before is about a 12 year old boy caught in the crossfire between two warring werewolf clans. One consists of werewolves happy to feed on humans while the other camp believes they're cursed and are trying to find a way to become fully human again. They look to a 12 year old boy who was prophesized never made totally clear by who to have something within him that would cure them of their terrible burden. But the catch is he has to live until his 13th birthday and while that seems simple enough the werewolves who want to remain that way don't want to see that happen. Three days prior to his 13th birthday the moon turns red signaling that the prophecy is going to come true. So the whole movie is basically this race to keep him alive to break the curse.Stating it simply the movie unfortunately is not very good. I've seen the standard werewolf films like The Howling and A Werewolf in London. Both of which I thought were great for different reasons I won't get into here. Then I've seen ones I really didn't likeehem Cursed. So I was hoping for a lot here knowing that Stan Winston was involved. The problem with this film is it has trouble finding itself. You don't know if this is supposed to be serious or one big joke. Parts that are not meant to be funny are funny because they're so absurd and then parts that are meant to be lighthearted leave you confused and wondering if you just missed a laugh.The acting was very mixed across the board but no one hit any major high notes with me. I had a hard time seeing Jason Behr who plays the leader of the we love to be werewolves gang as being very villainous. Elias Koteas who leads to good guys was fine in the role but his performance was just bland and didn't stand out much. Then you have Rhona Mitra who I loved on Boston Legal and on NipTuck. She was perfectly fine if anything I thought she was too good for some of the annoyingly badly written lines she was uttering. The child actor was just that a child actor 'nough said.I was hoping that the creature effects if anything would be the highlight but even those left something to be desired. I was looking forward to a great transformation scene something akin to A Werewolf in London. So I waitedand waitedand was left empty handed. The transformed werewolves did look somewhat different then ones I'm more accustomed to. As opposed to simply being big dogs these were more human in appearance. Imagine Michael at the end of Underworld but much harrier and there you go. The female werewolves were probably the most different then anything I'd seen before. Usually you can't tell a female werewolf from a male one. But these kept a more feminine figure when they transformed and their faces became more elongated then the males. Point being it was very easy to distinguish.Even though I didn't have high hopes for this film I was still hoping the creature effects would save it. But they weren't enough to carry this film to the end and had I paid for it I would have felt cheated out of 10. There wasn't anything that distinguished this film from any others similar to it that I've seen. So my recommendation when this film hits a theater near you is rent A Werewolf in London and be thankful for it.".

I've been waiting for nearly two years to see this thing and let's just say I was a little disappointed.No it's not that bad but I was expecting there to be a lot more violence. I still really liked it for the most part but I guess the R to PG13 recut affected that? I liked the Werewolves and wouldn't mind owning the Stan Winston made one. Though I have no idea where I'd put it? Garage? There are plenty of fight scenes to whet the appetite though like I said they aren't that graphic. The hot girls in this are definitely very hot. I have this weird thing for Rhona Mitra perhaps a tad unhealthy.The look of the movie is very good. There's some very cool shots at night and the final scene is pretty damn sweet.The plot is fairly straight forward but adequate for a movie of this type. No big surprises nothing that will change your life or change the way you look at Werewolves.The acting is okay not great but okay. Believable enough.I'd say this movie is worth seeing and you could bring you kids if they are like ten or above. It's not too scary for them I think.Overall it's like a B. If you love the monster movie genre this should fill you up for little while.".

The idea differs a bit in the movie but you get the jist of it. There are a few funny parts that aren't meant to be funny but it's ENTERTAINMENT. When you take a few mediocre actors and put them in a movie like this I don't know what you're expecting. It's done well. If there was another movie to compare it to it would probably be something like 'An American Werewolf in London' or 'Interview With a Vampire.' All that I kept thinking while I was watching the movie is how cool it actually would be to be able to live forever. Or more so how it would be to have INCREDIBLE strength like this. People take this way too seriously. You watch a movie to escape from reality right? Otherwise you'd be watching documentaries all the time. And honestly that would just be a bummer.Don't hate y'all. It's bad for your complexion.".

That's why I'm a fan of this movie. You won't find any vamps in this movie. First of all there's originality in the plot. Instead of any number of bloodthirsty animals running around killing everything in sight we get to see the humanity of the creatures.Secondly you still recognize the human likeness of the person once heshe has transformed into a werewolf. Too many movies portray a werewolf as only a wolf...just some big furry animal with no humanity about him. That's not a werewolf.For us guys it has plenty of action and eye candy. Natassia Malthe Sarah Carter and Rhona Mitra are some beautiful women. The plot keeps moving from the beginning and you won't have time to get bored.This movie didn't make a big splash in the theaters and I'm sure some will say it's not that good. Personally I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and hope to hear of a sequel in the future.".

All beasts being seen as evil of course. There is some decent acting and there are a couple of good actions scenes. I thought that the werewolf costumes were good. I especially liked the eyes they made them look very creepy and ferocious. The used a bird to sort of guide you through the film which normally I would think would be lame but it kind of worked for this. I found this movie to be entertaining there were definitely a couple of silly lines but I think it was an alright movie in general. One of the things that I liked the most was that there were some complex relationships within the tribes though I wish they would have been a little more developed. I think it added a layer to the film that I wasn't really expecting. I would recommend Skinwalkers. It's fun and entertaining and if you have a family you can take the youngsters since it's PG13 which I think is nice because with so many R movies coming out kids having nothing to watch accept for cartoon movies.".

That movie still scares people and it does so for one reason only we know it isn't a real shark but we are able if we choose to suspend our disbelief because the creature i.e. robotic shark is actually on camera with the actors and they interact with it. Well the same happens in Skinwalkers. I thought the acting was very good and it was shot perfectly e.g. lighting. When the Skinwalkers finally change form I was hesitant waiting for the CGI but none that I noticed appeared  this was good old fashioned WORK  apply make up thanks Stan Winston and acting. WATCH this movie for this reason if for none other  it reminds one what a movie with fantastic i.e. fantasy characters SHOULD be as real as it can possible be. We will never believe that computer generated effects are real and they totally stop the story for anyone over the age of twelve. Thank you to those responsible for this choice. And as for those film producers who still insist on clinging to CGI  revisit the classics whether Winston or Savini  these are the masters of the genre to whom you owe your career.

Seriously on a motorcycle in a leather vest I had to wipe my drool. Some of the acting was good. There is this scene with Sarah Carter being sort of possessed and she does a really great job with it. Also the little boy hitting on the nurse good stuff. There were some classic 90's style cuts which of course were great. There was also a classic your going to be okay Timmy? with a dramatic fade in and out right on cue! There werewolf costumes were great very teenwolf but a bit more intense I really liked them. There was a pretty naughty little sex scene with Jason Behr and one of the girls I was surprised to see that in a pg13. Basically people if you were a Roswell fan you have to see this movie. It's classic Jason Behr and he is amazing. I was thoroughly entertained. I don't if people were expecting something cutting edge with this film but it's supposed to be a fun bhorror movie and it is. If you were looking for something heavy there are plenty of dramas out there with hard hitting themes. This film is fun and chock full of hotties! Woo hoo!".

I'm a big Jason Behr fan and it was cool to see him in a different sort of role. I liked him as a badass it works well for him. Also I know it was rated pg13 but they still managed to keep in some of the good stuff if you know what I mean. There are definitely some attractive ladies in this movie. I was pleasantly surprised with Sarah Carter's performance I thought she was one of the best actors in the film. There is a really intense scene with her and a couple of the other werewolves and it really had me on the edge of my seat. The little boy was good he was sort of haunting. He seemed sort of out of it the whole movie but I think that's what they were going for. Some of the cuts were a little cheesy but I liked the werewolf costumes. You could really distinguish the difference between all the different werewolves which I thought was neat. I liked this movie I thought it was fun and worth seeing on the big screen. Also it's not a typical family film but the whole family can go and I think there is something for everyone action a love story suspense. So if you are into werewolves or want something just something fun and entertaining check out Skinwalkers. I did and I was happy with the result.".

The movie raises more questions than answers them leaving the audience to fend for themselves through the thicket of possible explanations. The character build up was virtually nonexistent and the history of not only the unconvincing characters but of the origins behind their lycanthropy disease is muddled and never explained. The werewolves themselves looked so alien that halfway through their performance you find yourself waiting for one of them to point dramatically to the moon with glassy eyes and recite E.T. go home. The supposed and exalted cure for the werewolves is a lot less remarkable than anyone would have ever expected and leaves the audience feeling cheated as it was the bait at the end of the line that kept us watching. The ending immediately becomes a scene that leaves little to be desired and gives the audience nothing more than an unsatisfied mental palate. The conclusion of the movie seemed to come and go so quickly just as any hope of it being any good within the first ten minutes that we wonder if the director simply needed to make a clean break from his own movie because he had a deadline to meet. The movie lacked originality and planning but with a title like Skinwalkers which had absolutely NO relevance to the movie whatsoever what else could we have expected?".

Caan son of actor James Caan wrote and directed the deceptively simple buddy movie and in which he also stars along with Shawn Hatosy Jeff Goldblum and Kelly Lynch.  The film shot on a low budget on Locations in LA manages to create a world of its own and one in which you finally care about these flawed characters and without falling into any of a number of possible clichs of this kind of filmmaking.The film follows two close friends Rusty played by Hatosy and Dallas Caan who call themselves brothers' and are constantly becoming involved in bar fights repeatedly being bailed out of jail by Rusty's mother played by Kelly Lynch.  Rusty wants to grow up but can't seem to break out of this pattern.  Goldblum plays the mother's boyfriend who is a therapist and begins seeing Rusty as a favor to his mother.  The obvious complications of this triangle come out early and are resolved in a very honest and truthful manner and Goldblum gives a surprisingly fresh and satisfying performance.The relationship of the friends is obvious from the beginning and the fact that you see the problems coming makes them no less compelling.  In fact Caan has succeeded in something that is really quite difficult.  As Dallas begins to dabble in ideas of larger crimes we see coming the time when guns will come out and they do but even as it all happens he manages to keep the focus on the characters and not on the action.   We care about what will happen to these flawed characters.  This is a real strength of this film.In fact all of the performances are good here including a nice turn by Val Lauren.  And the film has the great virtue that it is evenly paced and not overly long.  Caan manages the tricky task of working on both sides of the camera well although this is definitely more a movie of characters and performances rather than a cinematic vision.  The photography is effective for the story and shows some of the budget constraints but it also does not call attention to itself.   Undoubtedly Caan will develop as a director over time but this is a very respectable first effort.".

Its the stylishly shot very well written story of two friends in their mid20's who are aimlessly drinking and bar brawling their time away.  One of them Rusty Shawn Hatosy is beginning to recognise the futility of their lifestyle while Dallas Caan's character seems to be headed only deeper into trouble. Rusty has support from his mother played by Kelly Lynch and a therapist well done by Jeff Goldblum.  Mom and the therapist are romantically involved adding a funny and bizarre twist to the story.  No spoilers here  this is all revealed in the first reel. This film stands out because of the writing and the acting.  Caan's semiautobiographical screenplay is laced with lines that made the audience laugh out loud  dialogue original enough that it seems to come from real life not a Hollywood script factory.  There are a few scenes intended to 'reveal' character that drag a bit.  The fine cast is capable of doing with less not more writing.  Caan told the screening audience that he wrote the movie in about a month  yet it seems to be one of those first screenplays that was years in the making.  Either way it led to a film that's far better than 90 of the stuff now showing at your local mutiplex.  It deserves to be picked up for theatrical distribution followed by a long run on one of the premium movies channels.  Please Hollywood  More of this and less of 2 Fast 2 Dumberer.".

Although the plot isn't brand new it's the dialogue and the characters that carry this film.  Early on the film establishes the story and really let the actors become their character. Jeff Goldblum's character was my favorite nice to see him in a noncreepy role he seems somewhat normal in this film. The dialogue between the two main characters are gut bustlingly funny at times and heart breaking during others.Scott admitted to the audience after screening that he might not get a US distribution which is a real shame. Hollywood in the past 15 years of so have rarely put out a film that challenge the mind and makes the audience appreciate the art of film. This film definitely brings some of that art back. It's not perfect The plot does drag a bit towards the middle but it's worth the time to see the performance and writing by Scott Cann".

Caan and Hatosy are fantastic as a pair of us against the world buddies who drink too much fight too much and aren't quite sure where life is taking them. Even more impressive however is the performance by Val Lauren. His immense talent as a stage actor really comes through in his portrayal of Christian an overlyneurotic problem gambler who thinks that the world is conspiring against him. Some may find his character annoying but to me he was absolutely the most enjoyable part of this film. Jeff Goldblum and Kelly Lynch help to round out this brilliant cast and make Dallas 362 a truly enjoyable story. With the proper amount of emotion and reallife dialogue Scott Caan creates a very unique independent film that does not get the recognition it deserves. If you're a fan of the genre give this one a chance you might be pleasantly surprised.".

Are you a retarded person? Have you lost your mind? Flaws are acceptable in debut films but dodgy improvisation can be edited out. Or the scenes redone.On paper the cast is excellent.

Jeff Goldblum is as reliable as ever but the show belongs to Lynch who wrings every drop of dramatic juice from her small role.There's enough energy to hold the attention but this adds nothing new to a familiar story and the silly and unlikely heist at the end helps not a jot.".

The script was savory and sweet and I was content at the end of my 1 hour and 36 minutes less of life. Ever since Boiler Room I've been a Scott Caan fan. Obviously talent runs in the family.

Now I consider myself quite the movie buff and consider my critiques to be pretty accurate and informative. If someone in my family or a friend wants to see a movie they ask me what they should get or ask about the choices they have made. This movie was brilliant. It was witty down to earth yet anything but boring and most off all worth watching. Nowadays its hard to say that about a movie. It's a shame that I hadn't discovered this flick when it first came out as I would have watched it and recommended it to EVERY person I know. It truly was original and Scott Caan is more brilliant than I ever gave him credit for. I've always loved his acting but who knew that he was so incredibly talented allaround? I am proud to say that I love this movie recommend it to movie lovers everywhere and am going to go out and purchase this film ASAP !! Thanks for letting me say my piece. Jerri".

But Scott Caan has been great in all the other movies I've seen him in so I put my preconceived notions aside. I mean we're not supposed to like everything the characters do.  The film started out well and I was getting into it. The first act was great but as it went on it dragged just a bit and lost some of its lure in the second and third acts. The photography was too in your face too upstaging I mean the 70's are over and independent filmmaking should evolve in terms of the look and cinematography.  But in terms of the story content it was well shoot by Phil Parmet and well suited for the characters lives.  Nevertheless it is an extremely well done first film a gritty film with some heart. Starring and Directing must be a tough go and he really did a good job. Not the best film at the festival but a very good one.".

But I must say that I never thought that this was going to be as good as it is. Caan did a really Glad job on this film.If you head asked me two years ago what I thought of Scott Caan I would have said that he was in too many films. Because two years ago it seemed to me that every third movie I saw he was in. But he did do a great job.This film had its weak points which most films do. But I must say that even though I knew how it would end in the middle of the second act it still moved me.

From when I first wanted to watch it till I finally did I had a lot of time to go over it in my head and think of what can happen. But I must say that I never thought that this was going to be as good as it is. Caan did a really Glad job on this film.If you head asked me two years ago what I thought of Scott Caan I would have said that he was in too many films. Because two years ago it seemed to me that every third movie I saw he was in. But he did do a great job.This film had its weak points which most films do. But I must say that even though I knew how it would end in the middle of the second act it still moved me. I feel like crying right now.I know not a review but one day I will learn how to do one.......PsychoPhil4Ever";
