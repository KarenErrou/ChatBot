This is a dark movie where it seems those outwith of the religious community live and survive by force.

Based on a true story albeit likely taking big liberties with the truth this is about the relationship of three brothers two are ruthless whilst the third Le Beouf is weak. They look out for each other and that's the real nub.Action comes generally in short sharp moments but thankfully doesn't detract from the rest of the movie. Surprisingly some great acting and great camera work.Personally I enjoyed this very much. Ending was the only bit I was disappointed with but rest was very good.

His voice is so different to his normal voice which really highlights how he has worked hard on his performance. I was really surprised by Shia LaBeouf's performance he's never really impressed me but he gave a great performance here. He really proved that he could do some proper acting in the future and hopefully move away from the 'Transformers' series. Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain both perform well but their roles are wasted here. They have no real purpose in the film and are merely there as love interests. It wouldn't have been such an issue if they had gotten any actress for these roles but they instead chose two of the best rising stars with huge amounts of talent. Guy Pierce is outstanding here but his role becomes almost comical towards the end. He gives a great performance though and is quite disturbing. Gary Oldman gives a really good performance but has only 5 minutes screen time! It seems like such a waste it would have been interesting to see his character included in the plot a lot more.Overall this film was fantastic but there was a few things that director John Hillcoat could have improved that would have made this film truly brilliant such as giving more characters some crucial screen time. The violence was not really an issue I don't think it diverted the film away from anything which is good. It contained the right amount of violence for the film and shouldn't put anyone off from watching this.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is based on a book written by a relative of some of the main characters depicted in this movie...just looked up Wikipedia and the author was Matt Bondurant whose grandfather Jack Bondurant is called the runt of the litter of the Bondurant brothers featured in this tale of moonshiners in the age of Prohibition in America. That book was called The wettest county in the world and the title refers to how much illegal alcohol was produced in that area. The novel was adapted for cinema by Australian alternative rock icon Nick Cave.The story concerns how the Bondurant's once cozy relationship with sympathetic rural police is changed by the arrival of a corrupt Chicago law enforcement officer Charlie Rakes played by Australian Guy Pearce who wants a cut of the Bondurant's illegal liquor business. Forrest Bondurant Tom Hardy is not one to cave in to these demands. Things get ugly but there is some romance in this movie too.Whilst being a terrific yarn the quirky central performances won't garner any Oscar attention I wouldn't think. Guy Pearce's dandyfop take on Charlie Rakes is highly stylised and amusing before he just becomes a plain horrible character. Tom Hardy's take on Forrest Bondurant incorporates many big cat like purrs which also amuse.Set in America's South you mostly hear Southern drawls so if Cave's screenplay is any good you will miss a chunk of it unless you can decipher the more unintelligible dialogue in this movie...which I couldn't but I understood enough of it not to lose the plot. Early on in the film the reality of life in the South is not elided...you will see signs of racial segregation...literally.Even though this movie doesn't have a lot of violence in it when it does occur it is bloody and horrific...both in what you actually see happen and the horrific implied violence which you do not see...except for the aftermath. These moments can be very confronting...it's horror movie territory.Since the movie is based on a book by a member of the Bondurant family you have to wonder how much is fictionalised in order to paint the clan in a positive light. Watching the end of the movie concerning a final confrontation with Charlie Rakes you have to wonder if it really happened that way.Whilst not a 'chick flick' there are some romantic moments. There's a little bit of comedy too...I'm not sure if Pearce's and Hardy's performances are deliberately amusing but apart from that aspect there are some other amusing moments in the movie. I also liked the singing you first hear when Jack enters a church to be close to a woman he fancies Australian actress Mia Wasikowska. There is a big Australian contingent in this movie. I did see Noah Taylor in the credits but don't remember seeing him in the movie.Apparently this movie has things in common with Cave's original screenplay for the Australian movie The proposition. I haven't seen that movie but if you like either movie it might pay to check out the other if you haven't seen it.I could see this movie winning an Oscar for best picture or adapted screenplay.A ripping yarn.".

Tom Hardy is one of my favorites of late but here he seems to be impersonating someone. It felt like a selfconscious parody. And Shia LaBeouf? What's with this man? Why is he playing leads in films? He I'm sure must have acting coaches and he is clearly following instructions but what about the truth? He acts up a storm but there is not a moment of truth not one. Look at the moment when he's told his friend Cricket has been killed. I felt embarrassed for him. Jessica Chastain's character suffers a radical change in the middle of the story and I kept wondering how? when? and more importantly why? Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch and Mia Wasikowska is lovely and does the most with the little she was given. The lack of chemistry between her and LaBeouf is unavoidable. He is acting all the time. The only highlight really is Guy Pearce. His performance is fearless and enormously entertaining.".

Hillcoat has made a film with commercial appeal but has probably made it a bit too commercial for the American box office for it to be a truly hard hitting and memorable film that the director is known for The battle lines are drawn far too black and white . The Bondurants are merely following the business of America which is business and the fact that they're filling a market that due to the stupidity of politicians is an illegal market is neither here nor there because they are essentially real life American Robin Hoods risking  life  limb and liberty to keep ordinary Americans in home made apple brandy .

I was getting ready to hear him yell things towards something past the audience and watch him force himself to cry which is one of the ugliest things I have ever seen. Apart from my low expectations I kept an open mind and let me say I was pleasantly surprised.The basic premise of Lawless tells a story about a family of country bootleggers in Franklin a small village somewhere hear Chicago. As prohibition came to fruition the law started buckling down. Enter Guy Pearce the SpecialSuper Deputy in charge of seeing over the shutting down of all stills and confiscation of all moonshine out of Franklin. What follows is an account of the Bounderant family taking a stand for their own product and going against the law.The acting in this movie is quite good with the performance of Gary Oldman being short but meaningful. Guy Pearce makes a really good bad guy almost Jude Lawesque from Road to Perdition. Shia holds his own and the supporting cast isn't bad but Tom Hardy steals the show as the invincible Forrest Bounderant. As the title suggests Forrest is a badass in this film. I can't go into details for fear of disclosing spoilers but just know that Hardy once again makes us fall in movielove with his character.The story is quite good giving the audience a different look to the bootlegging scene. The HBO show Boardwalk Empire provides an inside look at upperclass bootlegging while Lawless takes us into where the alcohol originates in the country. There are twists and turns in the plot and the ending wraps everything up nicely.Allinall I'd recommend this movie. It's a solid allaround film and although it seems to drag out sometimes there's plenty of action to boot.3 for Tom Hardy3 for storytelling1 for supporting cast".

There is quite a lot of action in this film but it is mostly about the drama and the different things each character goes through. There are some fantastic actors in this film who all show their versatility and most notable for me was Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf who did an amazing job of making their characters real to the audience and made you really care for them. It is quite a long film but so many different things happen and it kept me glued from start to finish. There are some very grim scenes some intense action emotional scenes and of course romance and even a few comical moments  I think this film has a bit of everything. This film is not all about the action so don't expect it to be but the main element is the theme of brotherhood which I loved.

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of Boardwalk Empire and any number of Prohibitionera movies I was hoping Lawless would deliver the goods in the way its trailer seemed to promise. But much like Shia LeBeouf's first starring vehicle   the HBO Project Greenlight film Battle for Shaker Heights  this one suffers from the same lack of narrative arc and inability to decide what kind of film it wants to be. There are a half dozen potential plot lines that pop up and for a split second seem to be the point of choosing to tell this particular story it is based on a real life family. But just as quickly they are dropped never to be heard from again. You get the sense that there may be a lot of material on a cutting room floor somewhere that might have been assembled into a wholly different picture. The one thing the movie does accomplish is proving once again how supremely untalented Shia LeBeouf is as an actor. Other than the multitude of scenes where he is being beaten by one antagonist or another he does take a convincing a kicking he comes across about as real as the CGI characters you normally see him playing against. Save your time and skip this one.".

But much like Shia LeBeouf's first starring vehicle   the HBO Project Greenlight film Battle for Shaker Heights  this one suffers from the same lack of narrative arc and inability to decide what kind of film it wants to be. There are a half dozen potential plot lines that pop up and for a split second seem to be the point of choosing to tell this particular story it is based on a real life family. But just as quickly they are dropped never to be heard from again. You get the sense that there may be a lot of material on a cutting room floor somewhere that might have been assembled into a wholly different picture. The one thing the movie does accomplish is proving once again how supremely untalented Shia LeBeouf is as an actor. Other than the multitude of scenes where he is being beaten by one antagonist or another he does take a convincing a kicking he comes across about as real as the CGI characters you normally see him playing against. Save your time and skip this one.";

A crooked law enforcement agent Guy Pearce tries to muscle in on the bootlegging activities in a Virginia hill town but some residents are not willing to let him take over. The war the follows is both thrilling and believable. It's also very scary because the movie makes you care about the characters  something that not many movies like this can achieve.First a warning  the violence is memorable and shocking. So it's not for younger audiences. It may be a bit excessive for some adults too.The acting and casting is perfect. Who knew an Englishman Tom Hardy could play a West Viriginian in such a convincing way. He even has a hillbilly figure to boot. Shia is just right as the headstrong and naive and his accent isn't too bad either. The chameleon like Jessica Chastain can act beautiful and her strength is just moving. It was a bit unnecessary for her to display nudity for the role though. Mia is quite good and has an Amish kind of look so it's quite perfect. Guy Pearce sans eyebrows shows his versatility as a menacing villain.Overall this is a well acted and slightly over violent action drama with a good story.".

If you can appreciate the nuance you can appreciate the performances delivered by the superb cast. Indeed the producers and or directors as well as those responsible for casting the likes of Tom Hardy Guy Pierce Gary Oldman Shia LaBeouf Jason Clarke Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikoska must be commended for their choice. The filmographies of Pierce Hardy Oldman LaBeouf and Wasikoska made this a film I would not have missed one I awaited with as much anticipation as the next Bond flick but not for the same reasons. These five consummate professionals were impeccable in depicting characters of Matt Bondurant's novel.Add outstanding colead of Jason Clarke Jessica Chastain movie The Help and Dane DeHaan not to mention very good supporting performances by Noah Taylor and others and this brilliant ensemble could have only failed to bring us quality work if the direction had not been up to par director John Hillcoat whose movies The Road and The Proposition I also highly recommend did as well as he has in his previous movies. He knows how to play the audience by holding back just enough to keep you wanting more and to give you time to feel the emotions the actors put into their respective characters. Each character has strong deeply rooted personas it was a thrill to see some of my favourite actors deliver that on screen. Hardy has that modern quiet intense John Wayne charisma about him Pierce plays the sadistic law officer inebriated by his authority LaBeouf the gentle soul who overcomes the weakness his brothers tried to help reform LaBeouf has the most screen time as he goes through a greater maturing transition called by his character. One part of LaBeouf's transition was falling in love with the natural beauty that is Mia Wasikoska terrific lead role in the movie Jane Eyre and he does that very convincingly. Mind you she looks sweet and her character is most endearing I dreamt of seeing her face on the pillow next to mine the next morning.As the storyline implies this is a period piece one with the sort of action you should expect for its backdrop. I liked that the director chose not to depict any of his characters in the usual hillbilly clichs. Unless you don't like or care for period pieces and even then I recommend this movie you need to see good acting performances by this ensemble of pros.".

Some development of some of the more interesting subplots is required. Plus we are lead down a few blindalleys plotwise. The pacing is uneven too  better direction and editing was required. This said it is entertaining. The movie is suspenseful and exciting and has a degree of grittiness. With more time and a better director it could have been a great crimedrama.Shia LaBeouf is miscast in the lead role  he just doesn't have the presence or maturity for the role. Still he doesn't do too badly and manages to limit the damage. Remaining cast  Tom Hardy Jason Clarke Guy Pearce Jessica Chastain Mia Wasikowska  are excellent. Tom Hardy is the pick of the bunch as Forrest Bondurant.Most underutilised member of the cast must go to Gary Oldman. His character was a very interesting one and deserved his own movie but Oldman for all his genius as an actor only gets 5 minutes of screen time.Good soundtrack the standout track being a hillbilly version of The Velvet Underground's White Light White Heat.".

They run a bootlegging operation during Prohibition era  the main story is all about them trying to continue their business when a corrupt  villainous copplayed by Guy Pearce try to stop their operations.The biggest problem plaguing the movie is that it is strictly avg  very clichd nothing happens in the movie that we have not seen a 100 times before.Well there are always those people who say that every movie must not be a masterpiece or touch new heights  i completely agree with them.But a movie should be entertaining  in order to be so one should have interesting plot or relate able characters  this one has neither.In a gangster movie one does not expect characters to be moralistic or be the good guys but here the characters are outright stupid for example once Howard almost gets his brother Tom Hardy killed as he was busy getting drunk while the said brother believes himself to be immortal  invincible.Another time Jack leads the police to their secret hideout because he wanted to take his girl friend to the place where they make illegal liquor on their first date.Labeouf once took Micheal Bay's side over Megan Fox during a controversy..so yeah we basically know he is not terribly bright with girls and once you see his filmography you realize he is not really bright with anything else for that matter.The acting is serviceable enough with the standout performance being that of Guy Pearce who is great as the diabolical cop.I had been a great fan of his since he did Memento  L.A. Confidential  it pains me to see him acting in movies like this  the bag of crap called Prometheus. The female leads hardly have anything to do in the movie except be tepid love interests  show some nudity..not that i have any problem with the second. I have heard complaints about Tom Hardy's accent  i think criticizing a character or actor on basis of hairstyle or accent is a trivial thing to do.His acting is decent but it fails to hide a poorly written character who it seems will play a prominent part in the movie but that part never comes.Shia Labeouf does not ruin the viewing experience as he usually tends to do so even he is tolerable or maybe there is nothing really left to ruin.SPOILERS The ending is abysmal  as idiotic as it can get where Hardy has a gun pointed towards Guy Pearce but still manages to get shot numerous times on the chest without firing a single shot in return what follows is even worse as he still survives it would have been almost unbelievable if Hardy as Bane had survived that. It is simply ridiculous in a movie that tries to be a tightly scripted crime drama  not a summer action movie.My Final Verdict  There is neither anything cringeworthy nor anything praiseworthy in the movie.It is very average so you may watch it when it is on TV  you have nothing else to do but do not go about buying the bluray expecting something special.Had it not been for the ending it would have got a six. 510P.S.  To the fans of Oldman A lot of reviewers have commented that Gary Oldman has given a great performance in the movie.Don't trust them as they are outright lying because he has only a cameo of 2 minutes  not even a minor role in the movie.".

The cast looked strong Hardy and Pearce can seldom do wrong in my mind maybe with an exception of Pearce's recent space adventure and the story looked engaging but wow was I wrong.Over long and to be honest just plain boring in places its a waste of great acting talent. Hardy does play his role well but then again his character was not that interesting. Pearce for me stole the film.His borderline psycho maybe gay or bisexual creep  he goes mad at the word Nanc  is powerful and engaging. You will notice I have not mentioned LaBeouf thats because he's really not worth mentioning. Thinking that LaBeouf can pull off being mean and nasty is a bit like being threatened by a grumpy Koala bear. Totally miscast and goes to prove that he is best set against massive effects where his acting is a sideline.if you like your gangster films or action films which this is not really one it could fall in the section of crime drama best wait for the DVD or Bluray.".

	schema:headline " A modern Gangster classic of good old boy bootleggers";
	schema:reviewBody "An American classic tale of the stubborn humble country folk bootleggers resisting corrupt city politicians and the mob. I watched this film at the Cannes as a filmmaker myself I was attending the festival to screen my own film. All the stars turned up to support the film and attended the main evening screening including Nick Cave the main man behind the scenes for screenplay and score. The film received a rapturous applause after the screening it is after all a classic modern gangster tale of goodoldboys moonshiners going up against the mob when they refuse to tow the line and pay protection money to gangsters working for the local corrupt elected official. A family of three brothers the elder two Tom Hardy and Jason Clarke play Forrest and Howard Bondurant legendary local hard men and indestructible war hero their younger sibling Shia LaBeouf plays Jack Bondurant a young man trying desperately to live up to and gain respect from his older brothers. When gangsters fronted by Guy Pearce as Special Agent Charlie Rakes as an eccentric very scary villain comes to town with the assistance of the local constabulary the offer is made to give up a piece of their action making moonshine in the nearby hills or to feel the wrath of the law. The brothers are set in their ways bend down to no man and a confrontation is in the offing. Without giving too much away Jessica Chastain as Maggie turns up in town having escaped from cruel violent men in the city she is given a job by Forrest and a very slow romance begins she is smouldering sassy and the only strong woman in the film. Yes...this is a boys movie the scenes of brutal violence will repulse a female audience but then again they will probably turn up in droves to watch La Beouf turn out a strong assured well developed leading man's performance. Jason Clarke as Howard is strong and as always totally believable though it is perhaps for Hardy's remarkable modern John Wayne homage performance that the film will most likely be remembered for he uses all John Wayne's classic acting tips Say less say it low and say it slow enabling Hardy to once again turn out a remarkably memorable star building performance that will both melt the ladies hearts and make him the envy of every young tough man wanting to make a name for himself as a hard man leader type. Gary Oldman appears briefly in a couple of memorable scenes as always understated and highly memorable he plays his part in building the legend of the Bondurant brothers but I only wish that his character had been given a bigger part in the story. The golden team that made The Proposition 2005are reunited John Hillcoat doing a great job of Directing once more and both the script and fabulous country Bluegrass and bluesy score being provided by the music legend in real life Nick Cave. Though the critics Jury at the Cannes film festival undeservedly did not vote for the film favourably most probably because they did not like to see the three antiheroes law breakers prevail against the police corrupt though they were it is more likely that at an arthouse festival the reviews took exception that they were forced to watch and review a main stream film. Whilst The Proposition was an arthouse hit Lawless will have undoubtedly enjoy much wider distribution and be remembered as a modern gangster classic. The original book was written by Jake's very own grandson brought up on the true story if most probably slightly exaggerated over repeated retelling though the ages. The film thoroughly enjoyable and very highly recommended.".

There were two romances in it that had nothing to do with anything. There was a scene where it is implied that something traumatic happens to one of the female characters it was never addressed again.

	schema:reviewBody "Many film's about sad boring lives are themselves boring and not truly sad. Not so Ulrich Siedl's remarkable 'ImportExport' which tells a simple and fundamentally depressing story at great length but with compelling naturalism. Not only that but Siedl shows an uncanny ability to find interesting shots the film has a haunting quality and in every scene there's something that draws the viewer's attention and makes one think. The plot such as it is tells the story of two people a Ukranian woman to emigrates to Austria in search of a better life and an Austrian man who ends up in Ukraine in Hollywood their stories would inevitably be drawn together but Siedl keeps them in parallel throughout. One link is that both are involved at different ends in the Ukranian sex industry and Siedl's uncompromising depiction of this attracted some notoriety for this movie but it's a long way from a titillating film.The acting is excellent and the way the characters evolve is fascinating. Ekatarina Rak's Olga is allowed to inch slowly towards a better life in Austria albeit at a high price. Paul Hofmann's Pauli is even more interesting a loner and misfit denied the chance by his environment to become a good person disaffected from his present life he can find no route map to another one. Not only do the two stories not converge but one ends with a lengthy series of hospital scenes in which the origin of the central character is of decreasing importance this could be a film about lonely people anywhere. Indeed for all the film's naturalism it's depiction of social reality might perhaps be questioned I would have guessed this movie was set in 1997 rather than 10 years later although my own estimate of reality is based on the newspapers so it may well be this that is wrong. Certainly the film is not an explicit political indictment. But it is a sympathetic and original insight into existential loneliness and the harshness of life in the modern world.".

This combined with simple framing leads to the strong documentary impression. In this film the focus is on two story lines which move in opposite directions.

While viewing this film I often wanted to look away or close my eyes as to protect my soul from the terrible experiences the two protagonists are facing in very different ways.

Moodyson concentrates himself completely on the tragic story of the main character's exploitation through the economic system and the resulting criminality in eastern Europe plus the demand for sex without love in the western world and its tragic consequences for your unprotected girls. Seidl on the other hand chooses a young but grown up woman and mother in Ukrainia a trained nurse who can't make a living by working in a hospital and is forced to work as a porn model in from of an internet camera. Then she leaves for Vienna to work there in various unpleasant jobs. In the second storyline Seidl shows a young man from Vienna trying unsuccessful to hold a job and always on the run from people he borrowed money from. He joins his stepfather on his trip through eastern Europe delivering game automates and the like. They are both frustrated by their poor outlook of their future and although they don't like each other they both concur in spending their money easily on booze and women which they like to intimidate and humiliate.The film has some rare comic moments but often scenes open on a funny note but then change fast into something that makes you choke on your own laughter. All in all a great disturbing film!".

	schema:reviewBody "No matter what you think about a film like ImportExport you have to have some kind of reaction to it. It is an unsettling bleak look at a couple of lives that the viewer will rarely think about unless confronted with in a film like this. The story takes place in both Ukraine and in Austria and focuses on 2 lives of very different people who share a similar circumstance of being at the end of the line in the place that they live in. Both seek change and their circumstances take very different shapes and fates but share a similar intention to find a better life.The director and writer give us little hope in their depiction of these 2 lives and how their environments constantly conspire to either keep them down or challenge their will to survive and change. It is a story at once about Eastern Europe and a story about the world's 'lower classes' and their monumental struggle against inertia and their past. It is a movie filled with images humor highs and lows and graphic scenes of sexual play that all add to the base quality of the human experience that exists not only in Eastern Europe but many place in the world today. Human beings have created incredible technology and yet there is still so much ignorance cruelty and general meanness in the world. A rough film told with a keen eye toward a subtle message.".

My personal favourite in 2007 so far.Most if not all actors are nonprofessionals delivering spotless performances. This adds to the film's impact and sliceoflife feel while being contrasted by deliberately artificial camera views. There are two story lines that cross but never merge Olga a nurse in a grey Ukrainian city wants to find something better than her clinic work that just does not pay. She lives in a shabby flat with her mother and leaves behind her little child to go to Vienna after a short intermezzo in the webcam porn business. In Austria Olga gets hired as a charlady in welloff people's houses before she ends up working in a geriatric hospital putting away shitty nappies.Paul from Vienna lives with his mother too. He starts a job as security guard in a car park and loses it again after a bunch of youngsters get at him in the basement at night strip and humiliate him. Paul is broke and constantly has to evade his shady creditors. He stupidly provokes losing also his girlfriend and eventually goes to the Ukraine with his mother's sleazy boyfriend to set up bubble gum machines.The sparse plot is depicted in and around a series of still lifes through which the characters move. The camera changes between handheld motion and those long static almost photographic images. Their often symmetric composition conveys beauty and drabness at the same time. Some scenes are unbelievably hard others very comical many are both. Sex death hope humiliation agony compassion the ugly face of capitalism and the grimaces of poverty. Separate rags for loo and bathroom armatures. Absurdity. Futility. It's all there except deliverance. Breathtaking.".

Naturally a huge complex subject and many films have already touched some of the basic points as to why certain peoples have in the first place emigrated and then the problems they faced in their new world often very serious ones being horrifically exploited in the hands of others.Still I think it would be wrong to conclude that Ulrich Seidl's challenging film is a discourse purely on this. While it does genuinely highlight many vital questions about immigration that I'm sure many people would rather not think about let alone willingly watch when they go for some light relief in a cinema! I think that the main purpose of the film is to try to make us understand the actions of to two very different young people Olga and Pauli The two characters we spend the entire film following while at the same time provoking us to question our own expectations and assumptions about them and others.It just so happens that these characters both want to escape their very upsetting realities and even more worrisome futures. Both do this by leaving their home lands. Olga leaves Ukraine for Austria and Pauli goes in the opposite direction.Both characters never interact with each other or cross each others paths  thank goodness it would be a very worn clich if they had. Instead we are left at the end of this provoking film with many unanswered questions about the actions we have witnessed what drives them and where are they going.The film is incredibly refreshing for its lack of clichs I felt. At many points Seidl sets up our expectations using quite classical narrative techniques and in almost every case what we think is about to occur doesn't. The paths both take are incredibly believable helped enormously by the use of non actors throughout the entire film. It's really hard to forget your watching something that has been constructed when it features so many unnerving scenes of real people that are clearly not acting just playing themselves. Both characters especially Pauli is quite different from the 1st impressions we are given and its incredibly refreshing and sometimes relieving that our worst fears or own clichs about who these people may be are proved to be wrong.The only obvious clich I found was Pauli's disgusting step father Michael. I felt this made an important point in itself to counter the often very negative news stories people in many western 1st world countries are fed about immigrants. In this film a film by a developed 1st world European nation the most unsympathetic low character is from said 1st world country  the land of the film maker himself!  the characters actions while he is aware are an important turning of the tables reminding us as to how we may be seen or act when abroad.Although this is left completely open at the rolling credits there is a very subtle positivism that the very compassionate direction and writing leaves us with I found. While anything could happen after the last shot it seems clear that both now have at least faith a life to believe in one worth struggling for.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a statement which may apply to the two central characters in this movie but it also fits audiences. This film here runs for almost 2.5 hours and is another work from directorwriter Ulrich Seidl together with his wife. Back when this came out 8 years ago he was among Austria's most known filmmakers and today he probably is even more also thanks to his Paradise trilogy. One interesting thing about ImportExport is that most of the actors were absolutely new to the acting industry and same goes for the two central actors. Hofmann had a couple more performances afterward but not a whole lot and for Rak this is still the only credit to this day. Maybe this is also why many of the characters and their dialogs seem so authentic as this is the only role they have ever prepared themselves for. Pretty good writing here and also excellent line delivery for the most part. I am not surprised this film got a nomination at Cannes.The story centers around an Austrian security employee who travels East and a Ukrainian nurse  cleaning lady who travels the exact different direction. At one point they meet and the story is connected. We watch their struggles mostly professional but also occasionally involving their privates lives. There is some Austrian dialect in this film but you can understand it if you are a native German speaker. It is not that heavy. This film is basically about life going on. Most of the time it is very slow but occasionally significant events happen. Seidl uses static camera frequently so we feel as if we are in the room with the main characters watching them. There's some obscenity and nudity and in one scene a woman gets mistreated and pulled on her hair just like a dog so it's not always easy to watch and probably not a movie for feminists. But it's very raw and realistic and I do not have any major criticisms. A minor one would be that I do not like the main poster that much. It's a bit attention seeking with the top half and as the bottom half belongs to the female plot as well I believe they should have split it into one for the guy one for the girl. But this does not have to do directly with the film either so I certainly recommend watching this.".

	schema:headline " Too long for the substance to sustain and too simplistic in its message characters and narrative";
	schema:reviewBody "I came to this film when it was mentioned by a fellow IMDb user who occasionally points me towards some European films that I have not seen. More often than not they are fairly bleak affairs but while Hollywood probably dominates the action genre Europe tends to be best at films dealing with the bleakness of life. And so it is here in a film that painstakingly depicts the bleakness of the lives of two characters. Olga is a nurse in the Ukraine who travels to the West for a better life and finds herself working in an old people's home as a cleaner. Meanwhile Pauli is a young man in Austria who has little going for him employmentwise and finds himself under the wing of his morally defunct stepfather.It is not a theme that I haven't seen before but here it seems to be the entire film and there is surprisingly little in the way of narrative framework far less actual narrative flow to it. In itself this maybe isn't a problem because experience films can work as well as startmiddleend stories  but to go for in excess of two hours without much of a story is a tall order and it is one that this film cannot fill. Without much of a story or characters what results is essentially a wallow in some specific examples of life as survival until death and very little else.

It doesn't even really have any sort of central scenes or direction to it and indeed doesn't even have any big moments that one could see as having been built to  although I'm not saying it would have been better by artificially having them.The cinema vrit style is to be commended because it does convince as a piece of realism which is why perhaps not having one big event is a good thing but the downside of it is that like life sometimes it is pretty dull and doesn't really have much meaning behind it. And this is what I took away from the film because I did find it to be far too long for the loose material to sustain and it did feel like each and every scene had only the same message to deliver and it just kept repeating that long after the audience had gotten it.

	onyx:emotionText "I came to this film when it was mentioned by a fellow IMDb user who occasionally points me towards some European films that I have not seen. More often than not they are fairly bleak affairs but while Hollywood probably dominates the action genre Europe tends to be best at films dealing with the bleakness of life. And so it is here in a film that painstakingly depicts the bleakness of the lives of two characters. Olga is a nurse in the Ukraine who travels to the West for a better life and finds herself working in an old people's home as a cleaner. Meanwhile Pauli is a young man in Austria who has little going for him employmentwise and finds himself under the wing of his morally defunct stepfather.It is not a theme that I haven't seen before but here it seems to be the entire film and there is surprisingly little in the way of narrative framework far less actual narrative flow to it. In itself this maybe isn't a problem because experience films can work as well as startmiddleend stories  but to go for in excess of two hours without much of a story is a tall order and it is one that this film cannot fill. Without much of a story or characters what results is essentially a wallow in some specific examples of life as survival until death and very little else. This message is perhaps fair enough but it is delivered without much intelligence and comment just scene after scene laid out. It doesn't even really have any sort of central scenes or direction to it and indeed doesn't even have any big moments that one could see as having been built to  although I'm not saying it would have been better by artificially having them.The cinema vrit style is to be commended because it does convince as a piece of realism which is why perhaps not having one big event is a good thing but the downside of it is that like life sometimes it is pretty dull and doesn't really have much meaning behind it.

It feels like a documentary and the winter landscapes in both parts of Europe Eastern Ukraine and Western Vienna Austria look and feel equally un inviting and mean. Who would think that beautiful out of the fairy tale Vienna could be shot so unappealing but I guess the nursing places for the ill and old patients are not the most cheerful places anywhere in the world and they only add to the overall feeling of pessimism degradation lack of hope or anything uplifting in the existence of two main characters who never met because their lives moved in the parallel directions and every character they come across. Ulrich Seidl excels in giving ImportExport feel of a documentary and in showing how advanced the humans are in corrupting and humiliating one another. I think this film takes a prize for the amount of the un sexy most unpleasant and longest Xrated scenes ever filmed. I guess if sex is not accompanied with love desire or at least lust it is very boring and uncomfortable to watch and makes a viewer guilty for the degradation they are forced to watch and makes them want to stop or fastforward these scenes as fast as possible. If that what Ulrich Seidle intentions were  he succeeded fully. Let me put it this way  ImportExport is a wellmade move. It made me think of the serious matters  for instance how high is the price of freedom to look for and to find a better life to support yourself and your family to be able to go to any country you chose and to succeed there. I did not see a single false note in any performance given mostly by the non professionals. ImportExport achieves what it was set to do but I would never watch it again. I got the points and I don't think that it is for multiple viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure if Austrian film maker Ulrich Seidl makes the best use of the extended study of duality between two seemingly random seemingly disconnected European people plodding on through their lives as he might'v done in this his 2008 film ImportExport. As characters his two leads are motivated and ultimately somewhat decent folk particularly when placed up against those they spend the majority of their time with but folk we feel are stuck in an inescapable world of sleaze violence and discomfort. They travel their continent looking for incident and such in order to advance their existences but are mostly always greeted with pain frustration antagonism and failure  happenings and the like which whilst often carrying with them degrees of smut which we rightfully find uncomfortable stick it in a break it off for good measure. The film is good value for its early part Seidl's piece probably about thirty or so minutes too long and where the equal balance between either strand felt in place for the first hour such a parity vanishes by the time his heroine has reached that of a hospital and the whole things beds down into a near infuriating drama peppered with content we begin to question the need of.The film follows that of two people one male and one female one of whom is Paul Hofmann an athletic young Austrian living in an apartment whose spare room is rife with items such as boxing gloves gym equipment and military webbing and whose interest in such things extends to the fact he maintains a job in security at a local shopping mall demanding constant athleticism through its rigorous training regime. Olga Rak a young Ukrainian woman works in her drab inappearance colourless snowy homeland as a nurse in a hospital but grows frustrated at her low wages which causes her to head west. This is in sync with around about the same time Paul decides to go in the opposite direction specifically towards Slovakia for various reasons linked to his failed relationship with a girlfriend and problems in owing money to some unscrupulous people.Principally the film is about the apparent duality prominent between these two people how in spite of gender nationality and differing backgrounds of living in the nations of Austria and Ukraine respectively two people can wade through similar if not identical mires purely so as to reach similar denouements. Perhaps if they'd somehow bumped into each other in this wacky mixed up world they'd have been able to solve some of one another's problems and got along better in life. Their quests in either direction both begin with that of frank sexualised encounters encounters of which are humiliating and rely heavily on that of a distinct element of power instigated certain people within. Olga with her lowpay frustrations happens across an Internet peepshow job operating out of a lonely disused building whose offices and such have been converted into small dens in which the girls infront of the web cameras do whatever it is customers logged on at the other end tell them to. During a night shift at his mall job Paul prowls the underground car park area and is apprehended by a group of youths youths whom consequently strip him and instigate a demeaning session of mocksadomasochism involving the man's security equipment that he had with him in the form of belt and handcuffs.In owing money to various people Paul hulks out to the bleaklooking East of the continent with his stepfather on a job delivering beatenup video arcade games and sweet machines. Olga's situation again infused with that of money sees her continue to earn very little when the peepshow job falls through out of an inability to understand the required languages online. We find ourselves leaning towards Paul's strand as things develop Olga's bedding down into a hospital wardset groove in which elderly men living their last weeks begin to find our Olga rather attractive seeing the whole thing descend into a series of sequences shot on static tripod mounted cameras bringing more attention to the craft of the thing than is required whilst more often than not reminding us of Hungarian filmmaker Kornl Mundrucz's rather unpleasant 2005 film Johanna. Paul's begins to become imbued with a sense of antagonism as he falls foul of some gypsies en route and then with his stepfather when attitudes in regards to women have them clash the dragging of Paul into his stepfather's attitudes and lifestyle in regards to women eventually leading to awkward and illfated altercations forcing Paul into redistributing his priorities.There is a sense of frankness about proceedings and I've little doubt Seidl makes the films he wants to make in spite of the crosscultural settings and international teams behind the project a sense of frankness evident in the film's title a cold and inherently cutoff name balancing two opposites with little more than a cutandthrust 'slash' carving the two words and forcing them apart from one another. But we find it difficult to get as excited about the film as we would perhaps like certainly the film's sexualised content is disgraceful and constructed in an uneroitc fashion  a character's departure from proceedings as things step up a gear later on in a motel room echoes that of our own mind having already exited the scene. Additionally cries of sexism on Seidl's behalf ought to fall on deaf ears as Paul is unwillingly dragged through a plethora of flimsy Eastern European girls the man falling foul of his stepfather's hormonal urges around the same time as Olga herself gets caught offguard by some of those leering aforementioned elderly men doing very little for the masculine cause in this respect. Therein lies the issue the sense that these people are precisely the same and yet lightyears apart hammering us on the head again the film is not without merit but it is without an awful lot of much else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two parallel stories  one about a young Ukrainian immigrant in Austria Olga and another about a young Austrian traveling for work reasons in East Europe Pauli. It is a story of simple people with a dark future and gray unhappy lives. The movie was shot in Austria Slovakia Rumania and Ukrania mostly with nonactors in a documentary sort of style. It has a 1980s sort of visual style and it has a depressing mood and colors.The movie despite being in Cannes official selection has a sluggish script poor dialogues and lacks in focus all factors that rest credibility to the story.The movie has beautiful and shocking scenes they won't leave you indifferent for sure. Some of them are so because of their sexual nature others for their sadness others because of their tenderness and others because depict situations that are not easy to see without getting an emotional reaction. The characters of Pauli Olga and Pauli's father are well played by Paul Hofmann Ekateryna Rak and Michael Thomas respectively. However the drawing of the characters lacks in dramatic depth and the viewer resents that. We see them struggling in their lives but we don't understand why they got to that point what is their personal background which is only hinted what is troubling their souls. On the other hand Olga's story is told in a straightforward clear way but Pauli's story is not despite his character being a priori very interesting and cool.The story doesn't seem to have any purpose just to catch glimpses of a sad reality. If that was the director's intention a documentary would have been more respectful and less pretentious. The end on the other hand is also unresolved.I found that the selection of some Rumanian Slovakian and Ukrainian depressed areas offers a misleading view of countries that otherwise are modern and normal. However those areas are presented as if they were the real country i.e. as if all of those countries were like that. Marginal suburbs can be found anywhere in the developed world not just in those countries.I'm appalled at the poster of the movie being the one it is which is utterly misleading. The movie is not about sex is about life and death about two different life paths that lead nowhere but in opposite directions.Nothing new in the horizon and nothing memorable either but is an interesting movie not easy easy to watch but engaging nevertheless.".

	onyx:emotionText "Two parallel stories  one about a young Ukrainian immigrant in Austria Olga and another about a young Austrian traveling for work reasons in East Europe Pauli. It is a story of simple people with a dark future and gray unhappy lives. The movie was shot in Austria Slovakia Rumania and Ukrania mostly with nonactors in a documentary sort of style. It has a 1980s sort of visual style and it has a depressing mood and colors.The movie despite being in Cannes official selection has a sluggish script poor dialogues and lacks in focus all factors that rest credibility to the story.The movie has beautiful and shocking scenes they won't leave you indifferent for sure. Some of them are so because of their sexual nature others for their sadness others because of their tenderness and others because depict situations that are not easy to see without getting an emotional reaction. The characters of Pauli Olga and Pauli's father are well played by Paul Hofmann Ekateryna Rak and Michael Thomas respectively. However the drawing of the characters lacks in dramatic depth and the viewer resents that. We see them struggling in their lives but we don't understand why they got to that point what is their personal background which is only hinted what is troubling their souls. On the other hand Olga's story is told in a straightforward clear way but Pauli's story is not despite his character being a priori very interesting and cool.The story doesn't seem to have any purpose just to catch glimpses of a sad reality. If that was the director's intention a documentary would have been more respectful and less pretentious.

I am already experienced with this genre of semireality no storytelling movies as I call them. The reason I rated this movie just with two is because since the Cannes Film Festival exists we all have seen movies of this type. I mean a plain and more than simple direction that doesn't tell any story but showing us true life in some sort. I in my opinion disagree with directors of this kind of movies like Hanneke sometimes because they try to get the most out of reality without understanding that a real thing is a plain documentary without any comments. Just by putting a camera somewhere you are already implying your point of view. There for subjective and not objective. Anyway as I am to experienced with this type of movies I can't understand why they keep having success. there's nothing in a movie like this. You do it once or twice OK. But tell me a story now and then. Don't just grab a whole team to film something that almost everybody can do. No credit from my side. I must say that bullshit movies like Die Hard 4.0 is almost better then this and I thought it was one of the worst movies ever.".

	schema:headline " This film needs exporting to the mouths of hell!";
	schema:reviewBody "Holy hell I have never had such a night. I recorded ImportExport on Film4 it was on there as part of the Extreme Season and thought that I'd give it a watch because it looked quite unsettling and I expected it to be slowpaced yet gripping. It was none of those things. It wasn't even slow paced it was beyond slow paced I didn't even know a film could be this slow paced! I gave it a watch last night and I understand that it was about 2hrs 30mins long but it felt like 4 and a half hours. I didn't actually read anything up about the film before viewing it because I thought it was one of those films like The Ordeal where its better to let things unfold before knowing what's going to happen. Why the hell does this have an average rating of 7.0? I feel generous giving it 1!I don't often give films 110 because I can usually find something positive like the directing or the effect it had on me. I even gave Lars Von Trier's The Idiots 210 on the account of it making me feel so uncomfortable and feeling disturbed that it's and experience I'll never forget. Similary ImportExport is an experience I'm not likely forget and not for the right reasons. I'll never forget it because I never knew that film could be this boring! Think of Amelie or Mouln Rouge. Do you remember how full of energy and life they were? Well ImportExport is the absolute polaropposite of these films. Now I'm not trying to say that it should be as full of life as those films because that clearly isn't what it's trying to go for here. But what I am saying is it should just have a little bit of something that actually leads it on a path to somewhere.The film's biggest issue was that it didn't have a plot. So there are these two stories. One about a Ukrainian lady who goes around looking for a job the system goes finds one loses it finds one loses it and these jobs aren't exciting either nothing happens that is significant in them at all. The second one is about a father and a step son going around looking for a job this time with a twist wait for it!! they're looking for one IN the Ukraine! I know! I couldn't believe its interesting originality either! Oh and guess what. Nothing happens. For the already long overrunning time their is actually no content in the film. I believe the director's intentions was to show the truth about our human world and show how depraved we can be. Listen mate I don't mind if you show me this but at least present in a more exciting way. The two characters travel a road with pointless encounters that leads to nowhere and so does the film.The characters are completely unidentifiable they're given little character and have little things to like about them. One's an immigrant who can't communicate the Austrian language and the other ones immigrants who can't speak the Ukrainian language. Hooray! Fun times. And who can forget the absolutely horrendous sexual imagery that served no purpose but to poison the viewers mind and probably to excite the perverted director. Some images were like porn. In fact it was porn really. The director said that he wanted these two scenes in to show the truth that these things actually happen and people are too happy to brush it under the carpet. He said that he wanted to make them long so that it would have an impact. Yeah right he's just a pervert! Listen here Moon Unit I know that the sex industry exists and I know about prostitution so you don't need to shove pointless pornographic images down my throat to understand that! If I wanted to watch porn I'd go down to WHSmiths and look in the Adult section but I don't want to watch porn! I want to watch a decent film! ImportExport is probably the worst film I've ever seen.I felt like I spent my whole life down in that sitting room and I seriously am struggling to think of a film I'd rather not watch than sit through this again! I can't understand why I didn't stop it? I've come close to stopping a film before Live Feed but I've never actually done it. If I made it through ImportExport I think that I could probably watch anything with glee. So weirdly I don't regret watching it because now I can watch anything and see how so much better it is compared to this. The scenes with the geriatric patients were sometimes quite distressing and so the final scene was quite haunting for me. But that doesn't change any of my views about this film. It's a plot less characterless scriptless mess that shouldn't be allowed to play on screens without giving a health warning first. I've heard people call films a 'snoozefest' and I think that this is pretty much the definition on one.".

I figured it would go down the path it took but I was surprised at how cohesive the entire movie felt as a whole. There are some excellent performances especially from the two brothers and the referee who deserves more praise for her part.

On the other hand in building up to the grand guignol finale the film strains and struggles testing credulity both in terms of character motivation and in terms of basic emotional mathematics it's hard at points to understand why Erik doesn't just dismiss the whole mess and go home.

The plot shift and changes in tone from then on which keeps it unpredictable. The film is extremely well put together especially for having been made on such a low budget. The cinematography and the unusual soundtrack are first class. There is some genuinely beautiful and haunting imagery especially once the hunt gets underway.For me the biggest problem with The Wild Hunt is that at its heart this is supposed to be a love story but we never really learn much about the characters or their relationships. It's about a guy on a 'quest' to win back his girlfriend but she remains a cypher from the beginning to the end. I never understood her motivations at all she just came across as unstable and selfish and therefore I never invested in what's at stake for him. The other characters are underdeveloped as well and as someone who can't relate to the idea of LARP I would have liked to know more about what draws people to it other than the obvious implication that some do it to escape their real life problems.".

There's some initial comedy in the fishoutofwater concept but reallife LARP aficionados needn't fear ridicule the comedy is in the clash not at the expense of players. The film in many ways actually celebrates this type of gaming and in more than a few instances defends it from common taunts.From a simple beginning the story grows to a climax of epic proportions bringing to mind Shakespearean levels of drama and tragedy. The Wild Hunt is an intelligent and impassioned exploration of fantasy and escapism desire and obsession. Yet through all of this the film remains grounded in it's characters. One of the great strengths of the film is the realism and complexity at the heart of each role. You won't find any onedimensional characters here. Instead we have very real people struggling with an escalating series of events and the games quickly lose their innocence as people lose control.The Wild Hunt is a truly remarkable film. The exploration of a blurring line between fantasy and reality is chilling the performances are excellent and from a technical standpoint it's equally well done.

This movie needs neither apologetic introduction nor patronizing kudos.Most aspects of the film are mastered better than in the majority of mainstream movies so your eyes your mind or your heart will find something to latch on from beginning to end.Plot has multiple layers some easily read and others complex. You can enjoy the film at any level.Cinematography is solid in a Hollywoodactionmovie sort of sense. But also gives you some meaningful artsy shots which convincingly express the turning points in the plot and in the characters' evolution. They set the mood without being overbearing  like the right frame around a masterly painting.Characters find their depth in the way that each attempts to enjoy survive or in some cases take advantage of the coexistence of inevitably real motivations with the seductiveness of acting improvisation roleplaying fantasy...Music obviously helps set the mood and tell the story but it acts more as a commentary  as a minstrel would do. In fact I found that the movie has its own carefully crafted rhythm.Costumes and props are topnotch  forget that it was a lowbudget movie. It looked better than most 100M CGI stuff.Dialogs sound true from beginning to end.Go see this movie like you would go see any other movie. Enjoy.".

This movie needs neither apologetic introduction nor patronizing kudos.Most aspects of the film are mastered better than in the majority of mainstream movies so your eyes your mind or your heart will find something to latch on from beginning to end.Plot has multiple layers some easily read and others complex. You can enjoy the film at any level.Cinematography is solid in a Hollywoodactionmovie sort of sense. But also gives you some meaningful artsy shots which convincingly express the turning points in the plot and in the characters' evolution. They set the mood without being overbearing  like the right frame around a masterly painting.Characters find their depth in the way that each attempts to enjoy survive or in some cases take advantage of the coexistence of inevitably real motivations with the seductiveness of acting improvisation roleplaying fantasy...Music obviously helps set the mood and tell the story but it acts more as a commentary  as a minstrel would do. In fact I found that the movie has its own carefully crafted rhythm.Costumes and props are topnotch  forget that it was a lowbudget movie. It looked better than most 100M CGI stuff.Dialogs sound true from beginning to end.Go see this movie like you would go see any other movie. Enjoy.";

This movie is basically about those types of people from the movie Role Models except the people that participate take it way more seriously. It's what they call a liveaction role play game. This is just one of those movies you have to at least play some RPG games or watched those Lord of the Rings to get the entertainment value out of it at least get the most out of it. The story here is very simple but the premise of the movie is what makes this movie really good. I am pretty sure everything in this movie is over exaggerated and some may complain about this but I personally thought that was what made this movie entertaining to watch. I didn't know anything about Mark A. Krupa but he is what made the movie entertaining the most and stole every scene as Bjorn Magnusson. The female lead in this movie is annoying to watch but it's her role so it's alright and is what progresses the plot. The female lead acts like she is a cocaine addict but she isn't a addict which makes her even more annoying to watch.

The problem with this movie in particular people who engage in live roleplaying do so because it's fun. They don't go around constantly using fwords and cwords and taking things too seriously and not seriously enough at the same time as shown in this movie I am not a live roleplayer but I have friends who are. Artistic license it may be but that doesn't stop it from also being a betrayal of what live roleplaying is really like. Yes a betrayal some audiences not knowing how distant this portrayal of it is from the real thing will be scared away from live roleplaying by this movie. It's all but saying that roleplaying will lead to uncontrollable violence  a repetition of ignorant conservative long outofdate fears about young people's love for comics video games and roleplaying.I realize the story is trying to take things to a different level speculating about minor conflicts getting out of hand and turning into deadly serious major ones and that's fine. There are many good ideas here and very nice directing but in my view it should have been handled very differently. It just never feels like something that could happen or like a good representation of live roleplaying. Many plot developments seem contrived like Lyn suddenly getting sick and the car that won't start and the way most of the characters hate each other is completely contrary to real live roleplaying situations even though the latter certainly has its share of intrigues and internal politics. But in this movie the characters esp. Shaman Murtagh are just not believable. They range from too angry and obnoxious to nastily selfridiculing. The story itself goes into such extremes that we are asked to suspend our disbelief beyond any bounds of credibility. I wonder which audience this is made for. Is it an attempt to thematize the danger of fantasy being confused with reality? Or is it just an excuse to escalate the pretendviolence into real violence? I for one don't think it works.Of course I'm judging this from how similar it is to real live roleplaying. Maybe the writer and director didn't care about that but wanted to do something different. All right. But people involved in live roleplaying are the ones who will mainly and mostly want to see this movie and therefore one might argue that it ought to be truer to their experience. If the writer and director achieved what they set out to do good for them. For me however this was a disappointment and in bad taste. It should either have been more tasteful some may not be aware of it but great drama is possible without copious profanity as any student of literature will know or much more like a comedy. After all live roleplaying is about fun. This movie undermines and takes away that fun. Maybe it would be an interesting and innovative movie if there already existed twenty movies done in the proper spirit but since there doesn't this is not what people who understand live roleplaying is looking for.For those like me who may have been disappointed with this movie I recommend watching All's Faire In Love instead.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say as an all around lover of everything nerdy I had high hopes for this movie. I really did. I am quite sad to say it failed on almost all points. For one the main characters were one dimensional and shallow. Lyn went from trying to seduce someone to running away from Erich to outright fear for her life then back to enjoyment in the time span of what couldn't have been more than a few hours. Doesn't make sense to me at all maybe i'm just missing something. For two the plot itself was poorly created with almost zero development surprise or even a story line that made sense. Everything was expected. It was not a Shakespearean Tragedy as described as at no point in the film did the protagonist ever move into the accepting fate portion of said writing style. However there were quite a few redeeming moments especially the well placed comedic relief. The SCA chapter Society for Creative Anachronism and NOT LARP that they found for a lot of this footage was quite good especially the actual site weapons costumes even some of the game events that just made up the background. I applaud that.However my third and final point as a LARPer Live Action Role Player I burst into tears during the last 25 minutes of this movie and almost turned it off. It is very difficult for a movie to get to me and I understand that this is fictional but I have so many issues with this movie it's horrifying and would take up pages.

	onyx:emotionText "I have to say as an all around lover of everything nerdy I had high hopes for this movie. I really did. I am quite sad to say it failed on almost all points. For one the main characters were one dimensional and shallow. Lyn went from trying to seduce someone to running away from Erich to outright fear for her life then back to enjoyment in the time span of what couldn't have been more than a few hours. Doesn't make sense to me at all maybe i'm just missing something. For two the plot itself was poorly created with almost zero development surprise or even a story line that made sense. Everything was expected. It was not a Shakespearean Tragedy as described as at no point in the film did the protagonist ever move into the accepting fate portion of said writing style. However there were quite a few redeeming moments especially the well placed comedic relief. The SCA chapter Society for Creative Anachronism and NOT LARP that they found for a lot of this footage was quite good especially the actual site weapons costumes even some of the game events that just made up the background. I applaud that.However my third and final point as a LARPer Live Action Role Player I burst into tears during the last 25 minutes of this movie and almost turned it off. It is very difficult for a movie to get to me and I understand that this is fictional but I have so many issues with this movie it's horrifying and would take up pages. As if we geeks didn't have it hard enough sure go ahead and portray a completely harmless sport that has spent years and years trying to gain a favorable reputation and toss it out the window.

The film doesn't setup the relationship between the Erik and Lyn. I appreciated the melancholy tone it sets but without any background there's no real investment in Erik's quest. Erik himself doesn't go through any arc he begrudgingly enters the LARP world complaining the whole time. When at last it looks like he's coming around he goes right back to being a sullen jerk to everyone. The character of Lyn seems to shift into whatever mode the scene calls for at once she's emotionally confused then she's ready to give things a go with Erik but goes right in to chastising him. If the film were trying to say something about the value in letting things go or that Erik's desperate attempt to save his relationship is more of a fantasy than the LARP I'd get it. Not every film needs a happy ending but this one falls short.Erik succeeds in rescuing Lyn about halfway through the film and the climax of the film simply has her getting kidnapped again albeit in a more sinister fashion with Erik in pursuit again. I wish they had thought of something different instead of just repeating an earlier plot point. To me this would be like having Star Wars A New Hope climax with Luke and Han having to rescue Leia AGAIN. While I can dig a tragic ending the film wraps up abruptly with a lot of characters meeting graphic and tragic ends but none of it seems to relate to their journey along the way. The first 23rds of the film are enjoyable but if you expect the characters to grow or the story to take you in different places you'll find the last 13rd disappointing.".

I loved the story the characters the setting the dancing and well  the music was phenomenal not one bad song in the whole soundtrack.

I saw this film in 1987 when it was released and was completely blown away and like Baby I fell in love with Johnny and Patrick Swayze. It has such classic lines as I carried a watermelon and Nobody puts Baby in the corner and too many others to mention. I loved the story the characters the setting the dancing and well  the music was phenomenal not one bad song in the whole soundtrack. It just shows that you don't have to spend a fortune to make a great film. Thank you to the cast and crew for making such a wonderful film which makes me smile like a Cheshire cat whenever I watch it.";

Swayze was brilliant just like Grey was too!Although this film was absolutely fantastic you cannot say that you have seen it if you haven't seen the last scene. It really does take your breath away as the whole choreography of the last dance was done brilliantly it had you dancing at the end of the film and it really wouldn't surprise me if it influenced people to take up dancing!Overall Dirty Dancing is a film NOT to be missed and even if half the actors are in the Where are they now? period the actors will always have this superb film in their career!".

	schema:reviewBody "I viewed this movie for the first time last night and I enjoyed every aspect of it the dancing the acting the dialogue the plot the script and the whole atmosphere that this movie created. I would highly recommend it.Jennifer Grey gives an absolutely wonderful and first class performance in her role as Frances Baby Houseman. She has a natural ability and flair for dancing and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor. But what is wonderful about Baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension to her character. This is not simply a movie about dancing but the scriptwriters have also given us a chance to see Baby deal with the various emotions and feelings that she is experiencing throughout the movie and to allow us an insight into how her interaction with others at the camp changes her life. Grey portrays her character with such realism and poignancy that you end up feeling deeply for Baby as she experiences all she does in this movie.Patrick Swayze is magnificent in his role as Johnny and truly succeeds in making his character come alive. He gives his character a comprehensive personality strong appeal and great depth. The chemistry between Swayze and Grey is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this movie Cynthia Rhodes is great in her role of Penny and her portrayal of the ordeal that she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film. The other members of the supporting cast Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor deserve a special mention herealso give wonderful and imaginative performances that gives this movie an additional dimension of high quality acting and believability that is wonderful to experience. The dancing is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved. The script and interaction between all the major characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful fashion. The plot although exceedingly predictable is given more than enough life and vitality to make this movie successful. Furthermore the wonderful selection of music contained in this movie creates a truly magical atmosphere and very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the various scenes.Dirty Dancing' is a truly powerful magnificent and very appealing movie that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance. I highly recommend it".

I know for a fact there are blokes out there that either admittedly or secretly enjoy watching and love this classic film! Not just EnglishBritish menbut men world wide! and rightly so...nearly 18 years on and this film is STILL watched and enjoyed world wide and people are still able to relate to it.I know all the words i've seen it that many times!Most of my dance moves i use for workare taken from this film!There's so much energy.In fact it is my firm belief if people were brought up thinking watching these types of films are deemed as 'cool' and OK to watch the world would be a slightly better place to live.An enjoyable film that doesn't make you want to go out into the world and cause havoc and heartachedo drugs or get into gun crime coz its classed as being 'cool'this films makes you want to find a girlthat you can love and feel that special feeling felt in this film.It also makes you want to go out and enjoy yourself by simply Dancing!It's freeLegal and makes you feel goodwhile keeping you fit and healthynot forgetting FUN! In my opinion the films main two themes are 'LOVE' the true love story between Baby and Johnny Jennifer Gray and Mr Swayze compared to Baby's sister's relationshipwhere she was just used for sex plus classic Music. Yes music! The type you can really dance to! Every song on the soundtrack is fantastic! In true cheesy Dj style i still play all the old classics from the soundtrack especially 'Time of my life'and is still goes down a treat every single time! You just can't stop yourself! Anywayeveryone has wrote hundreds of reviews and has pretty much summed up this film and explained the story...all thats left to say is....If you haven't seen this film yet...go treat yourself buy the DVD you can get if for an average of 5 or less British pounds Roughly 9 American Dollars i think!It's well worth it and highly recommended.If you enjoy the filmplease go out and buy one of the 'Dirty Dancing' soundtracks especially the Ultimate Dirty Dancing released in the UK 2004 in celebration of the films anniversary as it contains all of the songs and is digitally remastered. I got my second personal copy from the British supermarket 'Tescos' for an amazing 6! For anyone 'Up North' try 'Music Zone' as its only 6 in there too!Anywaycheers for taking the time to read thisi'm sorry i went on a bit! If your planning on seeing this film for the first time...enjoy! And as everyone else has saidvery cheesily! Try and have THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE!I will go as far to say 1010. Highly enjoyablewith lots of energy. Makes yo wanna move like Swayze and Gray!".

	schema:reviewBody "There was talk on the E! Hollywood Special about the Making of Dirty Dancing which still is considered by many women including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite all time movies. Maybe the music the dancing or the melodrama around the plot of Baby Frances becoming a dancing sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course this film established Jennifer Grey whose biggest role to date was the resentful sister in Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Patrick Swayze is perfectly cast as the heart throb leading man who sweeps baby away literally. Dirty Dancing has it all to become a Broadway or West End smash hit. It has the love story the music and most of all lots of dancing. Jennifer and Patrick could revive their roles easily. it is nice to see Jerry Orbach play a doctor instead of a police officer and Kelly Bishop as the mother. It all took place in the Catskills in the sixties where many Jewish families vacationed in the area during their summer vacations. At the end of the film it is sad to see the hotel owner Kellerman be baffled by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and traveling through Europe than spending the summer in the Catskills. Those old grand hotels are becoming Indian gaming casinos. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well. After all they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever this should be a no brainer! I know that this film is one of the favorites that you don't get tired of after watching 800 times. There are people that have probably seen this filma 1000 times by now. Somehow watching the making and the story behind Dirty Dancing made me long for my childhood days as a thirteen year old. Dirty Dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in the history but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeated watchers like the 800 club whose members have watched it so many times. I watch it fondly now with all the awkwardness of Baby's first days and her first true love with Patrick Swayze as heart throb Johnny Castle. Nobody could have imagined this little film as a big hit then with the sixties music two soundtracks and even a tour in the late eighties. I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical. It would work for the audience to be part of a film. No wonder it still attracts kids and even adults particularly women of all ages to watch it over and over again. Well Australia and London both have had productions of Dirty Dancing. It looks like it will come to Broadway in 2007 just in time for it's 20th anniversary.".

After repeated viewings and seeing a documentary of the making of DIRTY DANCING discovering the depth of this film certainly increases its appeal.DIRTY DANCING is a film about change.  The evolving nature of relationships within the family the changes in one's view of the world during their coming of age etc.  The story takes place during August of 1963 the final weeks of the last summer of innocence for the American people.  The many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in American society that would be marked by the Kennedy assassinations and Vietnam.Female movie go'ers adored this film and repeated trips to the movie houses made it the world's most successful dance movie.  As a male I find the romantic pairing of ultimate stud Patrick Swayze with very plain Jennifer Grey very hard to accept.  This would be fatal for most romantic dramas and it also may have create the intense dislike expressed by most male reviewers.The film's soundtrack found 1 status before the release of the movie.  To this day it is nearly impossible to attend a wedding reception without hearing a DIRTY DANCING song.Near the midpoint of the film Baby's mother wakes up and asks Baby's father Is anything wrong?Baby's father the antichange family member attempts to keep all that is happening a secret.  He tells his wife to go back to sleep.  However resist as one can change is unstopable.  DIRTY DANCING is the story of one person waking up just at the final moments of our country's last sleep in innocence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Contains Spoilers I rarely write comments. In my 20 years of viewing films and at times overanalysing them to the despair of my partner I have very rarely decided that a film in my eyes is worth viewing 10 times.Dirty Dancing  1987 a low budget film was released set in the summer of 1963 and focused on a teenager Baby Houseman Frances her older sister Lisa and their parents visiting a Summer Camp which was hosting it's final year. Baby was everything Lisa wasn't. Lisa loved fashion dating and boys. Baby wanted to become a Peace Embassendor enjoyed reading and didn't have many social interactions. She was the under the watchful eye of her father and did everything she could do to please him.This all changed in a matter of a few months for Baby Houseman. The prim and proper Daddy's Girl that never answered back found an outstanding hobby she excelled in new friends and most importantly her romance with Johnny Castle. Drafted in to take the place of Penny Johnny's usual dance partner the two struck a friendship up and within time fell in love. The relationship was banished by Baby's father and despite forbidding her to have anything to do with them Baby continued to see Johnny behind her fathers back. Her father is under the impression that Johnny is responsible for Penny's abortion  a child that was in fact fathered by Robbie a med student doing a summer job in the resort and who was attached to Lisa. Jake Houseman refuses to talk to Johnny for this reason and also is unaware of the fact Baby asked for money from him in order to fund the abortion.Johnny is then accused of stealing from one of the residences who he had a previous fling with and who is jealous of his relationship with Baby after catching them unawares. Max the owner of the resort approaches Jake and talks of sacking Johnny which incites Baby who knows full well he is innocent as they were together. This is Baby's coming of age admitting to herself she is love and admitting to her father that she knows the man she loves is innocent because she was with him. In the end as predicted she announces his innocence to protect him and keep him in a job at the resort which is his only income. She falls out with her father her family most of the resort and even then Johnny is still fired for having a relationship with a resident Baby. One of the most poignant moments of the film is Baby crying to her father apologising for letting him down as well as the moment Johnny leaves the camp.It is at this moment that you realise what is perhaps the most heart warming part of the film is. The way in which the characters all learn something from each other Johnny realises that not everything is black and white that people do not exist in this world to use him. Jake realises that his daughter is growing up and learns to accept her choice. Even Lisa the stuck up spoilt sister of Baby learns that her sister needs her unconditional love and another moment in the film is when Lisa is comforting Baby after Johnny leaves. But Baby's plight is perhaps the most important  A girl who never stood up to her family sheltered spoilt and socially awkward. A girl who learnt to dance learnt to embrace love and sociology and a girl who learnt that sometimes no matter whether things are correct they will always finish wrong. The two central characters rely on each other to figure these things out  Without each other they would have carried on for an undetermined time living a life where they knew no different. Some say this is a soppy pathetic documentation of love. I'm not sure if even the love story is the most significant factor here I truly believe or hope the emotions run high for the viewers that enjoy this film is because of the massive change that happens to the characters personalities. The way they grow in just a few months. The way that they know whatever happens from this moment on nothing will ever be the same again. This is why the film never fails to make me cry. The chemistry between Baby and Johnny even if the actual actors themselves fought on set is explosive  Even when they are practising and Baby frustrates Johnny with her ineptness. Everything clicks into place and the ending moment is magical. What is worth noting in this film is for all those that bash it for being too slushy is that no I love you notion is utter during the film. When Johnny gets up on stage to announce his return and final dance he is almost professional in his display of affection and love for Baby. He doesn't overgush with sentimentality  Which I think is the same for the film.I admit I don't watch this every month like I know some fans do but every time I do view this I think it captures the innocence of Baby the angst of Johnny and the acceptance of Jake perfectly. It shows a time before the Vietnam War the downfall of the American Government after JFK's assassination and before the swinging sixties revolution brought on from the likes of Presley and the Beatles.A 910 from me  A timeless classic.".

From classic '60's hits like Love Man by Otis Redding and Big Girls Don't Cry by Frankie Valli to pure '80's hits like Eric Carmen's Hungry Eyes and Frank Zappacosta's Overload Dirty Dancing is a mix of fun and sensual showing the transformation of a young girl from shy teenager into a blossoming womanhood all against the beautiful backdrop of a summer romance that we all hope and wish turned into more.The dancing in Dirty Dancing is not to be forgotten. Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and lithe gymnasts. Patrick Swayze does more than a fantastic job and shows off more and more of his skills not just as an actor but dancer and singer as well. And Jennifer Grey shines as Baby while her transformation in dancing portrays her transformation in status as well.All in all Dirty Dancing is one of the best movies of all time and well worth watching at least once. It's doubtful that the first beats of the Ronette's Be My Baby in the opening title won't snare your attention and draw you in to a magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment.".

	schema:headline " The dancing makes this movie the fabulous classic that it is. I could watch a million times and still be in love with it";
	schema:reviewBody "It could be the summer atmosphere or the time frame of simpler days or maybe it's the forbidden love between the ultimate bad boy and daddy's little girl and the music that perfectly sets the mood for each scene but what I think what makes the movie Dirty Dancing so intriguing is simply the dancing itself. We've all seen those movies where we leave the theater thinking we can sing any song or move to any beat that comes our way and this is one of those movies. The dancing is different from any other movie because although it takes place in the sixties the dancing is so much more risqu than anything movie watchers were accustomed to seeing at that point in time. While using older songs combined with young sensual dancing the movie is able to reach out to an audience with a variety of ages.The movie introduces its unique dancing early on automatically intriguing the viewers to question things like Did people really dance like that? and Could I learn how? The movie is able to reach out to these common people by having the main character Baby Houseman witness the dancing for the very first time and shows her utter shock but also her desire to know more. As the plot continues and the characters become more developed the dancing becomes not only a sight to see but also it leaves a window for inferences to be made. As Baby is trained to dance by badboy Johnny the viewers begin to wonder if their sensual dancing will ever lead to something more? This movie is able to take the typical idea of boy meets girl boy and girl fall in love and completely make it new unique and fascinating all through the use of dance.As Baby and Johnny get to know each other better throughout their training process the movement of their dancing goes from simply following the motions and transitions to actually feeling the music and even expressing their inner feelings for one another. As their love affair grows so does the viewers love and desire to see more and more dancing. The movie does a great job creating the idea that the characters are their truest selves in dancing scenes more than any other.I think so many people enjoy the movie because it doesn't just tell a love story but shows one. It is able to show a love story not by the characters words but by their choreography. Before Baby or Johnny even declares their feelings for one another it is seen in the way their dancing morphs over time from impersonal to all consuming. To the characters in the movie their raunchy dancing is a way to rebel against the expectations of the generations above them and through this the movie gives the audience a sense of defiance and the idea that they should be proud to do what they love no matter what society may think.Over all it is so difficult to pinpoint what makes Dirty Dancing the wonderful clich classic that it is but the dancing aspect I feel is what ties the intriguing plot the charismatic characters the music and the beautiful setting all together to create something more than a romantic drama. Dirty Dancing is one of those movies I could watch time after time and only grow more in love with it. It has the perfect amount of drama romance conflict and cheesy monologues to satisfy all my desires when watching a movie. Because of this movie the song Time of My Life will always strike a chord in my heart and dancing will never be quite as great unless it's Dirty Dancing.".

This movie was a favorite of of many especially teenage girls who saw a real poor role model in Jennifer Grey's Frances 'Baby' Houseman. Grey was extremely irritating to watch to listen to a big pain in the butt. I laugh at some of these reviews that cite her depth and dimension. Give me a break she's a slimeball. Only a likewise immature bimbo would enjoy this movie.As bad as Grey's character is in here Patrick Swayze's Johnny Castle isn't a whole lot better. He's a guy trying to seduce a teenager via his dancing prowess. That's all we need to see in that age of child sex molesters on the web and who knows where else. At least she was 17 so I guess the filmmakers felt that was old enough.From the sexobsessed leads to abortions to the father changing his mind and giving approval to this male scum this script offers nothing redeemable. Baby has no clue about anything and is one of the dumbest characters ever seen on film. I am not surprised to read about so many reviewers who thought this was cool when they were young and stupid but now that they are a lot more mature look at this film again almost in shock at how bad it looks to them now. Good for them at least they've grown up.".

I can't believe Jennifer Grey was 27 in this movie  my friend and I thought she looked about 18 or 19  20 at the most. I guess this is attributed to her acting talent. And she did really look awkward at times. Patrick Swayze is also very good but you can tell he is in his thirties and seems a bit old. Nevertheless still very good. I love 80s songs so it really struck a chord with me and the love story yes I'm a romantic was so wonderfully done. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Exceeded my expectations!".

The bad guys were simply too evil to be believable.  The best villains are the ones who aren't so obviously evil.  These guys the owner's nephew the waiter who impregnates the girl do and say NOTHING that would leave me to believe they could be real people perhaps there are guys like them but I sure don't want to see a movie about it.Another scene the first where Grey and Swayze meet when the employees at the resort are dancing.  Swayze and Grey dance together and seem to enjoy themselves.  The next time they meet Swayze is hostile towards her.  Why? What happened in between to make him dislike her so when they danced well together?And some of those lines I mean COME ON I cringed at the end when Swayze muttered the line Nobody puts baby in the corner.  How did he EVER do that with a straight face.Another thing wrong the setting of the 1960's.  Everyone looked and dressed like the 1980's!  Who was in charge of the costumes and hairstyles?The music original music for the film was laughable with the exception of I Had the Time of My Life which was a good song.Not the worst film I've ever seen but DEFINITELY the most overrated".

Brennicks wife Karen is also back but replaced with a different actor.To cut a long story short. The Fortress has now been turned into a giant power station which is floating around in space and is owned by the Mentel cooporation.  Inmates are kept there to keep it in working order and to build new structures for the Fortress. John Brennick Christopher Lambert gets caught again and is thrown back into the Fortress. He then sets out struggling to find a way out.Like most sequels Lambert has starred in. I feel that Fortress 2 was rushed there's giant gaps in the movie which could of been filled in with maybe some clever dialogue or interesting scenes. Overall being a massive Lambert fan even I must agree that this movie is below average. 410".

I arrived at the cinema complex where I work and was totally shocked to discover that a Fortress 2 had been released! The film was officially released in Australia on 2. March 2000 but I'm afraid it hasn't been too popular...We're only screening it in one small cinema and so far we've probably had about 200 patrons in four days and that's being generous. Considering the fact that our largest cinema seats 500 for one session this is not good popularity odds.It was released suddenly without advertisements or even posters. You could tell from the start that this was going to be an unfortunate Bgrade sequel to the enjoyable well planned original.Still I thought I'd give it a go. I loved the first film and Christopher Lambert had returned to reprise his role so I thought why not?Unfortunately I was quite disappointed. The script was very lame with characters suddenly having the convenient skills to make an escape possible at just the right time. Not much planning went into set design. There were very little of the fancy modern gadgets of the first movie and you can tell they were cutting costs. Much of the film was computer generated to cover the missing pieces. As for the plot  it was far too unbelievable and dare I say it actually quite boring.This time the prison is in outer space ! and instead of those little metal tracking devices used in the first Fortress prisoners are given a behaviour modifier than is implanted in their brain. These ones definitely can't be removed.It is a rehash of the first. Christopher makes some friends inside and then they help him to escape. None of the characters other than Chris are very likeable and I found myself not really caring if they survived or not. Chris seemed to just cruise through the film without much effort  what more could he do?".

As for the plot  it was far too unbelievable and dare I say it actually quite boring.This time the prison is in outer space ! and instead of those little metal tracking devices used in the first Fortress prisoners are given a behaviour modifier than is implanted in their brain. These ones definitely can't be removed.It is a rehash of the first. Christopher makes some friends inside and then they help him to escape. None of the characters other than Chris are very likeable and I found myself not really caring if they survived or not. Chris seemed to just cruise through the film without much effort  what more could he do?";

	schema:reviewBody "Being a big fan of the first movie I was a little nervous as to the quality of a sequel. But today at 10.30am I was pleasantly surprised. The movie picks up 10 years after the ending of the first one. Brennicks child is now 10 years old. The child Brennick and his wife have been on the run from the Mental Corporation all that time. Without spoiling the movie  Brennick is captured and sent to a new fortress one that orbits the earth.Lambert is back as Brennick and is in good form. The only other recognizable cast member is Pam Grier basically an extended cameo. The special effects are above average for a movie with a reported budget of only 10 million. The space fortress is very convincing as are the docking shuttles. The film looks like it cost twice as much. The antigravity movement outside the fortess is very realistic looking. The story itself is quite clever a few cliches but hey this isn't oscar material. There are several terrific action sequences and the ending is satisfying. To be honest this is quite a gem of a movie it had no advertising small budget and basically appeared out of nowhere. I found the movie to be equally enjoyable as the original. 710.".

Added to that was the twist of his wife and unborn child becoming a conquest for the main villain to master. In the first film the other characters were interesting each with his own personality and reason to be on Chris Lambert's Team.In contrast Fortress 2 seems to plod along. The character seems to muck around within the prison for a long while before we see any movement towards escape. When he finally does escape and if you consider knowing that he DOES escape is a spoiler then you are naive since it is obvious that the end product of the movie will be the character escaping it all seems so easy and not really that difficult to do at all unlike the first film where a lot of movie time was spent planning the escape. He pulls of amazing computerrelated feats as well as succeeding in kicking as many butts as possible all within about 20 minutes.The other characters in this film are kind of cardboard and onedimensional. You never get to know the support characters in the film the way you did in the first one and therefore you don't really care whether they live or die. At one point in the film a character removes his face mask and Chris Lambert's character recognises him. However both my girlfriend and I were not quite so quick and spend about 5 minutes trying to work out who the character was and why Chris Lambert's character felt so betrayed by him. This definetly demonstrates that the characters are not very memorable. I am not sure whether this is due to the fact that Chris Lambert wanted a bigger role in this film or whether it is due to bad script writing but it is there never the less.However having said all of that the film isn't a total loss. If you put your brain on hold for a couple of hours and just enjoy the action and suspense of it all without trying to compare it to the first film then you will probably come away thinking that it was an average bit of action film making with a very strong lead character Chris Lambert.".

So much for privacy and heaven help you man or woman if you drop the soap! Liz May Brice Resident Evil AVP plays Elena Rivera and gives quite a memorable performance with her shower scene.Plot holes soon develop when Brennick and his cohorts hack into the video surveillance system. Then the film gets a bit cheesy when a retarded man gains access to ZED and recorded shower scenes fool the pornhungry prison guards. The special effects are appropriate with such a lowbudget film and the laws of gravity are stretched to extreme. All you can honestly ask after watching this is What did you expect? 210".

	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Lambert the king of newer Bmovies. The guy has been in everyI think Highlander movie so far despite the fact that only the first was particularly popular. He's done so many Bmovies that one has to wonder if he is aware that the films are bad and doesn't care or if he really doesn't realize their qualityor rather lack thereof. Here he returns in a sequel to the fairly lowbudget Bmovie actionscience fiction flick Fortress. In the first one the prison was huge and underneath the ground. Here it's... well it's still huge but this time it's in outer space. I guess the writer thought hey the first time it was underneath the ground... the only place that could be worse than that would be outer space. I hope he's right... I surely do because if he is maybe we won't see anymore halfcooked actionscifi flicks like this. Lambert portrays the exact same character which I suppose is good as he was a decent character in the first. A few somewhat big names also join the cast most noticeably Pam Grier. The cast of characters from the first are pretty much remadeapart from Lambert himself meaning that the new cast pretty much just fills the shoes of the characters from the firstanyone who knows how the first ended knows why. Unfortunately that means that the film seems more like an overblown remake with the same guy portraying the lead rather than a sequel. The hacker from the firstwho was a neurotic nervous guy beautifully portrayed by great horrortalent Jeffrey Combs is replaced by an annoying blackguy stereotype. The female lead is replaced by a girl from the resistancewhich Lambert's character is said to be a member of as well... odd... I don't remember that from the first... does that mean he joined the resistance after he got a kid? Who'd do that? instead of his wife as it was in the first... apparently mainly because the scriptwriter couldn't find a good way to capture both Lambert and the wifecharacter without capturing the kid. The MenTel prison commanderwho was played by the cool badguy actor Kurtwood Smith from RoboCop fame is now an annoying wimp with a ridiculous British accent that really gets on your nervesas opposed to the cool Smith who was a menacing and threatening presence. The plot is a rehash of the first. The pacing isn't particularly good. The very scenes in the movie seems to befor the most part remakes of the scenes of the originaltalk about lack of originality... and the action is mostly just rehashes of the first just made a little less excitingremember those waycool machine guns with three barrels in the first? They're replaced with dull futuristiclooking stickstunguns. The special effects are decent at best. The script is a weak rehash of the first with a few added subplots none of which being particularly good... most of them are just there to keep the film going or put it an action scene in order to distract the audience from the poor writing. The dialog is pretty bad with one or two exceptions. All in all the film is just a tame rehash of everything the first waswhich isn't even a lot. Somebody took the first film said hey this is popular... but it's not very good... how about if we try to do something of even lesser quality and see if people will like it? Probably writerproduceractor John Flock who going by the plot and the writing of this film really is as dumb as he looks. I recommend this only to huge fans of the first Fortress Lambert or Bmovies. Everyone else don't bother. There's a million better ways to spend 90 minutes and there's at least as many reasons not to see this film. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "The first movie was a serious psychological dystopia on the topic of dehumanization in particular of an inmate and in general of the society that unfortunately after the first half had this very noticeable transition ending with a rather disappointing finale in a style of B class action movies. And that shift was so profound that even the not so great music greatly matching what was shown on the screen was practically removed during that transition only to come back when the more action oriented last quarter of that first movie have startedAnd with this sequel they took a practically different approach. The music is even worst and does not evoke any feelings in conjunction with the on screen events. Also the dystopic ingredient is somewhere in the back while the action is more in the front. But aside from the opening scene the rest is coherent unlike in the first picture of this duology. So if the viewer will enjoy the first 1020 minutes once the action is placed in the prison then this joy will last to the end unlike in the first picture of this diptychYes there are plot holes and behaviors illogical to some extent that normally would disqualify any movie from taking it serious. But that is the whole point if you do not take it seriously just in the terms of action comedy and not a drama you will simply enjoy it. There are numerous great and funny moments like when a female copilot is apparently learning how to dock under the supervision of the experienced male pilot. Both those characters are played absolutely great especially given that the male pilot has only few spoken lines and the copilot only has one. Also one of the characters from the hero's team of escapees that has a damaged brain is portrayed with such a craft that he just makes the hero of the story look somewhat bleakAside from the cheap special effects and story that has only traces of being complex this is a great entertainment. It is somewhat similar in style to the new Mad Max Fury Road 2015 in that when put on paper it seems stupid and boring but when put all together and presented on the screen it is just so damn entertaining and positively different from previous installments".

Go into this film expecting the same level of quality as the first FORTRESS movie offered and you'll be disappointed again. But there we go  sequels have always been subject to the law of diminishing returns and this film is no different. The cast are gone apart from the lead actor the story is a simple retread of the first film's and there's less money all round which means the effects are worse and the film has an emptier feel to it as a whole.Despite these negatives the film as a whole is fun for a Bmovie. It's short fast paced and never runs out of steam. There's plenty of incident along the way and while most of it is derived from similar stuff in the first film it was fun to revisit a Bmovie classic. Stuart Gordon did the first film and while nobody can match his gory take on the genre Kiwi director Geoff Murphy directed one of my alltime favourites UNDER SIEGE 2 and does a perfectly good job here. The CGI space effects are pretty cheesy but then that's the film's tone as a whole you can't watch Lambert battle a guy with a flamethrower or get ejected into space only to fly back into the airlock and expect to take it seriously.As for Lambert himself he puts in another sterling turn one of his most likable yet. I've never not enjoyed this guy in a movie and I think he's seriously underrated. There's an interesting supporting cast here too. Brit Patrick Malahide is a bit subdued as the main bad guy  the trouble is Kurtwood Smith did this stuff really well in the last film and Malahide doesn't have a chance to come close. But there are bit parts from engaging character actors. Pam Grier has an extremely weird extended cameo and seems totally out of place veteran nasty old guy Carl Chase is a prison thug Nick Brimble FRANKENSTEIN UNBOUND's monster is a fellow convict Liz May Brice is a pretty prisoner whose lengthy shower scene  a running gag in the movie  is one of the highlights. Sure it's not fine art it's not even a great movie. But for a cheap scifi Bflick it never gets boring or too stupid and I came away with a warm fuzzy feeling. So yeah I liked it.".

The incidental music is a little repetitive and it's admittedly a onejoke plot. But it is a fairly good joke and would have made for a superb hourlength TV movie. Unfortunately it's a 90 minute cinema film and so doesn't maintain its momentum all the way through.I've seen people criticise the film for Stallone not getting to be funny in this movie. I mean have you heard of a straight man?? Sylvester's contribution to the comedy is his underplayed reaction to his mother's obsessive behaviour. What do you expect him to do dress up and tell jokes?Admittedly the surprisingly violent aspects of the film don't sit well and it's hard to laugh at Getty when she's just shot a man and splattered his blood all over an airplane runway. Another problem is that her chemistry with Stallone isn't as pinsharp as it could be the two leave notable pauses in between lines. Maybe a few more takes could have honed up the reaction time but generally it's fine and Stallone really makes an effort to make it work.Not an alltime classic certainly but a pleasant enough film to pass a Sunday afternoon. Just don't listen to the naysayers watch it yourself and make up your own mind. 510.".

Just don't listen to the naysayers watch it yourself and make up your own mind. 510.";

And his mother is coming from Newark for a visit. This time she didn't answer the phone figuring it would be Joe telling her why she couldn't come.So when Joe arrives at the airport to pick her up everyone is laughing at him. Even flight attendants. They've all seen the photos and heard the embarrassing stories. And on the way to his house Joe has to help a man who is threatening to jump from a tall building. Don't worryone of the classic moments in the history of comedy movies guarantees a happy outcome here.And Joe's mom witnesses a murder. This is after she has cleaned his apartment pleaded with him not to do anything dangerous and done everything else possible to make him feel like a secondgrader. But she won't let anyone work on the case except her sonwhich also means she has to be his partner! How is this possible? She's so tough she won't let anyone scare her with threats of arrest for providing false information to the police. And Joe's mom can do it all! Watch her drive the car in a chase scene. And the movie's title is a line spoken by her son to a suspect.The amazing thing is that when he was 13 Joe was the strong one when his father died. So his mom knows what he is capable of. Her explanation of how he handled the situation gives the movie one of its several tender moments.I shouldn't have listened when people said this film was bad. I would have seen it so much sooner. Estelle Getty was great and while Sylvester Stallone didn't seem quite suited to this type of role he was good enough. I liked the character. But yes he can do comedy. Remember Oscar? I remember I liked him in that.I liked several other performances. Dennis Burkley as the big tough gun salesman the one with the van and Nicholas Sadler as the man on the ledge I thought he was one of the Lawrence brothers!. And as always Gailard Sartain as a big buffoon of a bad guy. And JoBeth Williams as Gwen. I can't forget her.This is my kind of movie and while it's obviously not Oscar material it's quite entertaining.".

The supporting actors were given the back burner and the villains were unforgettable. And yet while the plot goes at a very steadypace with limited action I've found the comedic chemistry between Stallone and Getty which make up most of the movie to be pretty entertaining and fun to watch and is at times heartwarming. Getty's obsessive behavior to be very babynurturing to Stallone as he responds in his frustrated way is itself classic. And it's not everyday you see a petite motherly 68 yearold lady brandish a gun and deal with gangsters!

The rest of the cast was not so fortunate and since then has only been seen on milk cartons under the caption Have you seen me?.Imagine my disappointment in finding that this turkey managed somehow to escape the bottom 100 list despite being widely acknowledged as one of the worst attempts at comedy since Police Academy 6. That this steaming pile rates a 3.1 makes me question whether or not the online voters have been subjected to lobotomies or their minds were so severely damaged by this film that they are no longer capable of making sound decisions.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm a selfadmitted lover of cheese films in other words I am a cinematic masochist with a threshold for celluloid pain that would give Ahnold's Terminator a run for the money but 'Stop or my Mom will Shoot' is painful in a way that a shot of morphine a handful of codeine and a dozen shots of whiskey cannot overcome.Speaking of the Terminator there are very few stars whose careers could survive a beating like the one dished out by 'Stop or my Mom will Shoot' but Stallone survived long enough to resurrect his career with Demolition Man and Cliffhanger. The rest of the cast was not so fortunate and since then has only been seen on milk cartons under the caption Have you seen me?.Imagine my disappointment in finding that this turkey managed somehow to escape the bottom 100 list despite being widely acknowledged as one of the worst attempts at comedy since Police Academy 6. That this steaming pile rates a 3.1 makes me question whether or not the online voters have been subjected to lobotomies or their minds were so severely damaged by this film that they are no longer capable of making sound decisions.";

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying I own this movie. I didn't rent it on VHS or catch it late night on cable I own the 2003 Universal DVD released on 1.851 Widescreen with 2.0 Stereo so I can watch this anytime the mood strikes me and also watch an 'exclusive behindthescenes featurette' if I didn't get enough of the story after 80 minutes. The motherson slapstick formula is nothing new but the character combination of Stallone attempting lighthearted comedy or more accurately attempting to play the 'befuttled straightman' and a painfully annoying performance of unprecedented levels by Estelle Getty make this movie particularly unenjoyable. Yet for all the flak this film rightly gets personally I feel it's better than Rhinestone...I feel it's better because whereas Rhinestone had an awful cast and awful story this film simply has awful casting and tolerably bad story. Furthermore Stallone is not the biggest black mark on this movie it is unquestionably Estelle Getty. Why? Because Stallone is not attempting full on comedy here like he did in Rhinestone he is more playing a standard cop who is at a loss to deal with the stupidity of his mother. Estelle Getty's performance is like a onedimensional character gag that would barely work as a 5 minute sketch comedy bit and dragging it out for 80 minutes in a multimillion dollar project leaves me questioning big studio production judgment. The main story is sleepwalking action fare some guns are stolen and being sold by a corrupt business man but not without a couple red herrings to try and confuse the poor audience. Of course by chance Tutti the mom witnesses a murder that could help lead to the very source of the stolen weapons and she insists on tagging along on the following police investigation with the information she knows moms know best etc. There is also the obligatory romantic sideplot Stallone has an inoffice relationship on the rocks with his Lieutenant boss played by JoBeth Williams complicated by the arrival of his mother obviously. Basically these two plots had me alternating between irritation and boredom. Particularly atrocious scenes are when Tutti washes her sons handgun with the dishes and the following breakfast segment the entire ending scene at the airbase when a gun wielding Tutti essentially 'saves the day' and in general whenever Tutti is on screen interacting with the tattooed Biker. One more thing this PG13 film isn't really a kids movie as some people think as there is way too much sappy relationship humor. This police story is probably a borderline 4 but i'm a generous Stallone fan so 5 out of 10".

It was probably only his superstar status that saved him from being constantly overlooked by casting directors in the future. Even my cousin who is 7 said that this film was awful. It was only the fact that this movie was rented that I didn't throw the video cassette into the microwave or in the blender or curled it David Beckham style over my neighbour's gardens.I've also read what the other IMDb users have said about this movie and I have to admit I am in shock. Although the vast majority say it is a dreadful film there are some who actually like this flick! which I find quite astonishing. The only reasonable explanations that I can think of is that they have either just been discharged from a mental institution releated to Stallone or Sly is paying them a disclosed fee to lie about this garbage film.Well I've hope I have made my point clear and I also hope that other IMDb users who are considering renting this movie out just because it has Sly 'Rocky' Stallone in it will definitely think again.DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE BE WARNED!.Rating 010 SHOCKING.

	schema:reviewBody "Stop or My Mom Will Shoot is probably one of the most unintentionally funny films ever made. It's not just that it's bad  it's pathetic. Every time it tries to be witty or clever or smart it slips up.Sylvester Stallone plays Joe Bomowski I wonder of what ethnic background they want us to think he belongs to?? a big city cop whose pesky little mother Tutti Estelle Getty comes to visit him and manages to singlehandedly destroy his life.First she makes a mockery of his job by visiting the police after reporting herself to be a witness of a murder. Soon the pair  mother and son  are teaming up to track down a motherkiller and...oh yeah...in between we get loads of lame gags about how desperately aggravating mothers can be.This would have been a really great film  if it were three minutes long. The material is barely enough to sustain a Saturday Night Live skit  even then it would be aggravating. The plot is cutesy  so are all the gags lines and characters. I felt like bslapping Estelle Getty and you know there's something wrong when you want to beat up an old woman.The plot basically works like this scene after scene 1. Annoying Mother Figure tries to control Son's life.2. Son is angry. He tells her he likes having his underwear strewn across the floor and likes to leave the seat up.3. Annoying Mother Figure tells him he'll never get a wife this way and mentions his exgirlfriend who left him.4. Son Figure rolls his eyes and says Oh Mom don't bring that up again. 5. Aggravating Mother Figure says a cute oneliner.6. PutUpon Son looks putupon.Repeat and rinse. Voila  one huge turd of a film.One of the quotes from the movie is His ass was grass and I was the lawnmower. I felt shame on the producers' behalf that they even made Estelle Getty utter this line. It's really sad. It's utterly pathetic.Stallone was nominated for another Raspberry Award for his performance. Believe it or not he gives a GOOD performance. Really good. That's part of the problem  his aboveaverage acting makes the film seem even more desperate. There's an argument between him and JoBeth Williams in one scene and his acting is really good it's convincing. But the rest of the film isn't.Stallone tried to have this banned from being released onto DVD and I believe he's succeeded so far. Rent it out on video or watch it on TV and see for yourself why it's his least favorite film he's made in a career of some pretty bad films.".

It is about a young boy who tries to do the right thing for his family and for himself after the death of his father and the marriage of his mother to his uncle. Sulik's characters are by no means heroic or theatrical they are ordinary people who want to stay alive in a world of poverty unemployment and discrimination. They are gypsies who are living on ramshackled houses or huts most of them do not have a proper job stealing seems to be main area of business. This does not affect their mood though they do not like the cheerful and bizarre gypsy characters of Emir Kusturica films but they also like to sing and dance. Although you feel the agony of poverty and deprivation in every frame of the film Sulik masterfully portrays a colorful and lively village with its all living souls. He also gives a crucial role to the surreal images which is a distinctive aspect of his narration style.

	schema:reviewBody "666 The Child starts as a plane crashes the only survivor of flight 666 was a young boy named Donald Boo Boo Stewart who is adopted by news reporter Erika Sarah Lieving  her cameraman husband Scott Lawson Adam Vincent after they covered the incident for Channel 6 news. At first Donald seems like any normal kid but death seems to follow him around after warnings from a Nun  Vicar Scott begins to believe that Donald is evil  the cause of all the deaths...This straighttoDVD horror flick was directed by Jake Perez under the pseudonym Jake Jackson  one has to say 666 The Child is really rather poor. Whenever I see The Asylum is responsible for a film I get worried I get very worried since their track record is awful. They seem to specialise in making or distributing low budget horror films which are usually ripoffs of some recent successful big budget horror film  in the case of 666 The Child you don't need a degree in rocket science to realise that it's a complete ripoff to cash in on the recent The Omen 2006 which was released the same year. The script by Benjamin Henry  Austin Laurel is terrible  simply can't match the ambitions of the the Hollywood equivalent I mean just what exactly does Donald the Antichrist expect to achieve from a middle class family in a small town? It's hardly a great starting point to bring about the destruction of thew world is it? Every character in 666 The Child is some form of the main character's from The Omen the adopted parents the Priest who tries to warn them  the sinister babysitter. There's a real lack of incident there's barely any gore  the plot is poor. I mean Donald killing a dentist because they were trying to fix his teeth is just so random  needless what were all the disgusting pictures Donald drew all about where did the babysitter come from  there's just nothing that ties everything together  it's just a disjointed mess that just becomes very boring very quickly. The references to the number 6 also becomes annoying  are very unsubtle.Director Perez does alright I suppose it's competent if nothing else. There's virtually no blood or gore there's a few sprays of blood a cut off hand  someone gets a circular saw stuck in their face but it sounds a lot better than it looks on screen. It's certainly not scary there's no atmosphere thanks to a throughly bland contemporary setting in a suburban house  there's no tension because we never really know what Donald is trying to do  there fore there's no threat from him.Technically the film is alright it's reasonably well made but since the actual film is so poor it makes little difference. The acting isn't that great but at the same time I've seen worse.666 The Child is a poor mans The Omen ripoff I'd sooner watch either the original or the remake over this any day of the week. Not good  definitely not recommended. Followed by the sequel 666 The Beast 2007 which also went straighttoDVD.".

Before you can say boo boo people are dying all over the place although nobody quite manages to put two and two together even when a dentist and his assistant both get drilled in the eye when trying to work on the kid it is just blithely dismissed as an accident in the following scene.Things don't get any better as the film progresses. All the adults are so stupid they deserve to die and little Damien  er Donald  who at some point is joined by a nanny called Lucy Fir is too bland to be the antiChrist. Blood flies against walls in illuminous red so bright you can imagine it glowing in the dark and eventually everyone dies. Except for Donald  er Damien no  Donald.

I can see where some originality might have been what they were going for but it could have been better. Also the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over. After hearing all of Lucy's name and figuring out it was 'Lucifer' I wanted to gag. Yes it's interesting that Lucifer was a woman but look at the name. It's a male's name. It should be given to a male character. All in all the movie was a bore and could have used a better plot.".

For example the nanny Lucy in this film is actually one of the devil's minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of Satan.....does this sound a lot like Mrs. Baylock to anyone else. Another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted just like in The Omen. However luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his body....yet another coincidence?????? And to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus all over the walls much like the priest in The Omen having pages of the Bible plastered on the walls like wallpaper. Please don't even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and The Omen for you because as I've stated above there are far too many to mention here.".

The story is set at the time of religious wars and turmoils following the protestant reformation and the hero fights for the freedom of his country from Spanish occupation and from the holy inquisition. The fist parts of the film are devoted to showing the atmosphere of oppression in the Netherlands at the time with people being reported to the inquisition by envious neighbors and burned at the stake on flimsy excuses when the real goal is for the king to get hold of their riches. Obviously this must have been a hot theme for soviet citizens even in the seventies and it might be the reason why the film is so effective though I wonder how it passed censorship. The whole film is spectacularly shot in the tradition of the best Russian filmmaking but probably the most monumental scene is at the end when Til drives a ship into a flooded town.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the soviet cinema masterpieces and it passes the test of time rather well. I watched the film version as a kid and it was impressive but this extended version reedited for West German TV to almost twice the movie length over 400 minutes sliced into 5 episodes is even better for there are less holes in continuity. Alov  Naumov production designers and the brilliant cinematographer Valentin Zheleznyakov in the mid1970s did what Peter Greenaway achieved somewhat laterthey made Dutch and Spanish classic painting come alive creating the total illusion of immersing in the believable albeit mythological period as perceived and depicted by Masters.Although the cast is the allstar band of soviet cinema of that period with again believable faces unlike the present day actors' wellfed mugs the voiceovers are atrocious intonations false and theatrical and the dialogue stilted and unnatural. This however with time is perceived as the conventionality and all attention is paid to the visuals. Even the human effigy of Byelokhvostikova Nele is very watchable 'cause she of course has an almost ideal face but a bad actress nevertheless. As for the design and picture again it's like watching a living painting and I wish there were a guide somewhere explaining to broad public what art masterpieces were used as inspirations where I could see a lot but not all of them of course I'm not that visual myself.Another minor shortcoming is that some scenes seem to be rather bloated timewise but again this might be our impression nowadays after all the extrafast editing of contemporary blockbusters. And don't forget soviet viewers needed all the explanation one could offer them. In order to feel the pain and rage of the character watch all 10 minutes of him being tortured on the wheel bitches.".

I watched the film version as a kid and it was impressive but this extended version reedited for West German TV to almost twice the movie length over 400 minutes sliced into 5 episodes is even better for there are less holes in continuity. Alov  Naumov production designers and the brilliant cinematographer Valentin Zheleznyakov in the mid1970s did what Peter Greenaway achieved somewhat laterthey made Dutch and Spanish classic painting come alive creating the total illusion of immersing in the believable albeit mythological period as perceived and depicted by Masters.Although the cast is the allstar band of soviet cinema of that period with again believable faces unlike the present day actors' wellfed mugs the voiceovers are atrocious intonations false and theatrical and the dialogue stilted and unnatural.

Frank accepts and Mephisto reveals that he is actually Mephisto Jr. and that Frank Faust is a descendant of Doctor Faustus from the classical play by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Therefore the Mephistos always come to help the Fausts in situations like these. Anyway Mephisto tries to get Jennifer's attention to focus on Frank by transforming into different local celebrities and showing up on important parties with Faust. Unfortunately Mephisto Jr. also starts discovering his own sexuality and develops some unpredictable interests and soon nobody knows what's going on anymore.";

It's classy fast comedy that isn't hilarious but is at all times pleasant. The kind of movie that puts a smile on your face no matter how simplistic and formulaic it all is.It also is filled with some cameo's from some very famous German individuals like Claudia Schiffer and Boris Becker as themselves which adds to the whole fun of the movie.The movie is like a modern retelling of the German folk legend of Faust in which Faust sells his soul to the devilish Mephisto in return for youth. Things are changed around a bit in the story of course and characters and plot lines are changed. Yes you can say that this movie has actually very little to do with the old folk legend instead for the fact that it uses the same main concept and the names of the two main most important characters.The fact however that the Mephisto II character slowly develops into a homosexual who feels attracted to Frank Faust isn't exactly a sign of good taste or subtlety but German movies often feature this kind of odd and pointless story developments. It's also after this point that the movie starts to get worse. It becomes unlikely as well as annoying since the story becomes so dreadful and doesn't show good taste. Too bad because if the rest of the movie was just as fun and entertaining to watch as its first halve this would had really been a simple recommendable little movie. Now it's quite the contrary actually because of this poor and wrong painful tasteless story development.In the end it's sadly nothing more than a tasteless homophobic German production.410httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

He's white and he wants to marry his daughter.The meeting the parents premise has been done to death recently with Monsterin Law and Meet the Fockers being the most recent films. However what the film lacks in originality it makes it up with laughs. There were a lot of funny moments and the movie hardly ever got boring. However most of the funny bits were used in the trailer and this makes the jokes a little less effective since they are already expected. Also the repeat value of the movie is very low. It's worth watching once but that's pretty much it. I don't think that's a bad thing since most light comedies are like that.I think the film works well because of the two leads. Both Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher give funny performances and they have nice chemistry together. Their scenes were the best and they never felt forced. Zoe Saldana also gives a good performance and she has come a long way from appearing in Crossroads. Most of the supporting actors are also funny including Judith Scott who plays Bernie Mac's wife. Mike Epps also makes a cameo though it wasn't that good.Kevin Rodney Sullivan directs and he only does an okay job. The first half of the film is pretty funny and the racial issues are handled lightly. During the second half the film becomes all serious and it's kind of awkward. The director ditches the laughs for awhile and he approaches the issue in a mature manner. It kind of works but some of the serious scenes felt fake. It seemed like the actors were about to burst out laughing at any second and the film also got kind of dull. The ending was surprisingly strong though. The changes of tone in the film worked out okay but they weren't as effective as they could have been. In the end Guess Who is worth a rental nothing more though. Rating 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Of course this movie is mostly being blasted because it was released so shortly after the success of Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers which uses the exact some concept. Only difference with this movie is that it's about an interracial couple. But also when you look beyond this and ignore the fact that this movie is basically the interracial version of Meet the Parents it just isn't a great movie because for a comedy its surely lacking. Basically Bernie Mac was the only reason that I still found this movie to be an enjoyable one to watch. Perhaps biggest problem is that the movie is too predictable. No not just with its story I mean basically everyone already knows in advance how this movie is going to end but also comical wise the movie is too predictable. They surely didn't came up with a whole lot of original moments and because everything happens in such a predictable manner the comedy also just doesn't always work out.The movie could had been a better one had it handled its subject of an interracial relationship better. That way the movie could perhaps had send out a message but it doesn't really does so now. The movie doesn't take away any stereotypes instead it only sort of confirms them and it happily does so in order to provide the movie with racialtyped humor. Somehow I have the feeling that it perhaps could had worked out better had the guy been black and the girl white and so her parents who they are visiting as was the case in the original movie this movie got based on Guess Who's Coming to Dinner staring Spencer Tracy Sidney Poitier and Katharine Hepburn which was also a drama rather than a comedy. Even though I haven't seen that movie yet I still am sure of it that that movie its theme worked out better perhaps also because it was a '60's movie when interracial relationships obviously were still a bigger issue. Seriously when I take a black girl or Asian or whatever home one of these my parents surely won't make a big issue out of it at all. So isn't this a movie a bit too outdated already with its theme and only relevant had it been made about 40 years ago? That is if the filmmakers intentions were to take away the stereotypes and reluctances and intolerability of people towards interracial relationship but I have the idea that the filmmakers simply dropped this idea and intentions and went for a simple fullblood comedy instead. I haven't seen Bernie Mac in an awful lot of movies also since he started out pretty late white his acting career but so far I have always liked him in his comical roles. He plays it serious and sarcastic rather than overthetop funny which makes him such a great and hilarious actor in my opinion. It's also mostly his movie in my opinion and Asthon Kutcher gets pushed more to the background by him even though Ashton Kutcher surely ain't a bad actor either no matter what other people always say about him.A comedy you can surely do without but when you decide to watch it you'll still be most likely lightly entertained by it.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "When it was released in 1967 Guess Who's Coming to Dinner was acclaimed as a breakthrough film for its lighthearted yet serious depiction of an interracial romance. In the years since society has moved so far in the direction of acceptance of socalled mixed marriages that any remake is bound to feel at least to some extent superfluous and anachronistic. And that is exactly the case with Guess Who a 2005 update whose abbreviated title is only the first of the many changes the filmmakers have rung on the Stanley Kramer original.The screenwriters' first alteration involves switching the race roles so that it is now a black family having to accept a white male as a prospective inlaw rather than the other way around. Bernie Mac assumes the Spencer Tracy role as the father whose world is turned upside down when his beloved daughter brings a Caucasian boyfriend Ashton Kutcher as a white Sidney Poitier home to meet the family. On the distaff side we have Judith Scott taking over for Katherine Hepburn as the understanding mother and Zoe Saldana replacing Katherine Houghton as the freethinking daughter.Since interracial marriage is no longer the hotbutton issue it once was the filmmakers have been forced to inject a number of other nonracerelated plot complications into the mix to develop and maintain the conflict and drama. Thus we have Kutcher trying to hide the fact from both his fianc and her family that he has recently quit his highpaying job at a prestigious firm and that he may in fact be the target of a securitiesandexchange commission probe. Indeed with Kutcher spending most of his time trying to win over his critical and overbearing future fatherinlaw Guess Who feels more like a remake of Meet the Parents than of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. The real problem with Guess Who is that it rarely has the courage of its convictions. Having decided to tackle a relatively dicey topic the film too often drops the issue in favor of scenes that wouldn't pass muster even on a thirdrate sitcom. For every scene that is incisive and daring  i.e. Kutcher telling a series of black jokes at the family dinner table  there is another that is pure Hollywood hokum Mac and Kutcher sleeping in the same bed together Mac and Kutcher having a gocart race to determine who has the higher testosterone level and the greater machismo etc..All of the performers are fine especially Mac and Kutcher in the lead roles. However they just haven't been given very sophisticated material to work with here. Guess Who might have been a better film had it aimed more for genuine hardedged satire and less for lowbrow slapstick and predictable romantic comedy sentimentality.Still it's been 38 years since Guess Who's Coming to Dinner first shocked the nation with its inyourface defiance of miscegenation laws and the world has since moved on to other issues of social injustice and marital definition. Which is why in the year 2005 Brokeback Mountain was a breakthrough film and Guess Who was not.".

The jokes were forced out for the most part and the actors looked like they were going through the motions. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between the the leading male and female in this. At no point did I feel I was looking at real characters. I just felt I was seeing Bernie Mac playing the role of the father and Ashton playing the 'boyfriend'. Ashton was silly while trying to be funny which is his style and personality. But he was unconvincing and awkward while trying to be serious. Ashton is just in over his head with this kind of acting. He was in his element with the show 'Punked' and 'Dude Where's my Car?'.In short this is one I would suggest waiting to see on video.

Supposedly this was a remake of a 1967 movie Guess who is coming to dinner. I cannot comment on the original movie since I have not seen it but I sure hope it was a much better film. 310 for me.";

Surprised as I was Guess Who very much surpassed those expectations and worked throughly well as a hilarious comedy that attacks cultural differences with an irreverent raunchy and jovial punch. Simply put here is a film that could have excelled with any number of premises given the inimitable charisma and comic wit of Bernie Mac who flat out carries the show on his own piercing sarcastic own. Ashton Kutcher works well with what he is given yet his character comes across as a trite clumsy bumpkin to Mac's ferocious flare and is merely the butt of every comedic catastrophe rather than a multidimensional character who can hold a candle to thwarting his own preordained chagrin. Kutcher gets involved with his other half is initially terrified at meeting her father he's better with moms and all hilarity ensues when he and the father with the bulging eyes and capricious temperament get uncomfortably and frolically acquainted with one another eventually realizing that maybe this relationship will require some selfdepreciation and frenzy to eventually be accepted. To be certain much of the comedy adheres to the racial tension theme and there is of course plenty of the proverbial cultural clash that abounds consummating with you guessed it a torrential family dinner scene in which Kutcher's empowerment eventually gets the best of him but Guess Who isn't content to strictly deplore racial boundaries as it also works effectively as a howlingly funny meet the father from hell scenario succeeding solely on Mac's uncannily nimble charisma and wit who has an aura about him that would make any future soninlaw shrink to his skin or to a greater extent be obliged to sleep and spoon with the man! Of course while this is consistently amusing and funny what we're mostly left with toward the end are the platitudes of mawkish sentimentality of rekindling the love we lost that seem to always hobble the comedy of even the most outrageous of premises as if the premise has been exhausted enough and becomes more of an endearing love story than a convivial comedy... Why is that? Anyhow I would solidly recommend Guess Who for its cutting raucous comedy and for Bernie Mac's spunky fleeting charisma that really gives a convincing element to this otherwise wired premise. The laughing stock might not be constant throughout the film yet there is just enough humor to enjoy and laugh yourself silly. After all watching Bernie Mac popping a blood vessel over a basketball game debasing a man's character for not being avid in sports or keeping a cautious and close body near Kutcher's nighttime affairs is certainly worth the price of admission!  out of ".

Eventually you see them start a friendship near the middle of the movie.Even though there were some serious things happening in the movie basically the movie was very funny. A perfect example is when Bernie Mac's character doesn't believe Ashton Kutcher's character about him knowing about the racing circuit and tests him by racing him in a gocart I found it extremely funny when they start to race each other and try to beat each other and land up tearing through the hedges and getting stopped by a police officer. Another funny example is when Ashton Kutcher's character teaches Bernie Mac's character the tango and later on Bernie Mac's character denies to his wife that he was taught the tango by Ashton Kutcher's character.This movie had a great cast.

Both films use the William Rose original premise about a prospective soninlaw that is being brought by a daughter so her parents can meet the young man. Everything has been reversed for this occasion. While Sidney Poitier was the black fianc in this new version it's Ashton Kutcher a white man who is the odd man out.Most of the comments in this forum are downright negative. We don't think the creators of the film wanted to capitalize on the original model or even to imitate another recent movie of the same theme Meet the Parents this was just a vehicle in which to showcase the talents of Mr. Kutcher and that funny man Bernie Mac. The film was directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan.That said the film although predictable has some good moments. Both Mr. Mac and Mr. Kutcher show an affinity for the roles they are playing and both are good together. Best moment in the film has to be the home dinner sequence where the Jones family is sharing the meal with Simon and he starts with his ethnic jokes about blacks. This would have been something no film would have dared to show because Hollywood would not dare offend AfroAmericans in this climate of affirmative action and they wouldn't dare to get Rev. Jackson or Rev. Al Sharpton to have them boycott the movie.Aside from Bernie Mac and Anton Kutcher the lovely Zoe Saldana is seen as Theresa the daughter who is living with Simon and comes home to be made aware of her parent's unease caused because of the ethnic background of the boyfriend. Judith Scott a beautiful actress that should be seen more often plays Marilyn the understanding mother. Hal Williams and Kellee Stewart are seen as the other members of the Jones family.Just enjoy the film for what it is as comparisons are always unfair. Who would not like to see Bernie Mac and Anton Kutcher rehearsing the tango late one night on the patio?".

	schema:reviewBody "The most insulting thing about this movie is that it purports to be a remake of the 1967 classic Guess Whose Coming to Dinner. That movie starring the late Spencer Tracy in his last role the late Katherine Hepburn and Sidney Poiter dealt with the issue of race as real people would do. The original was made during a time of racial tensions in this country. Tracy's moving speech at the end of the original 1967 movie brought it all together for me.Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher do not deal with race seriously. This movie is not about social justice like the original. The jokes are not funny. Mac seems too grouchy and Kutcher is not funny. Kutcher's girlfriend and Mac's wife do not seem like real people. This movie has no soul and for a rental it was money poorly spent.".

It's pretty much like this  you know how on his show he's basically doing a watered down version of what he he does in his standup? Well this was like the third filtration from the standup and basically a watered down version of what he does on the show. I don't even know why this movie was PG13. It was a solid PG as far as I could tell. You could edit out the word sht maybe a couple of times and show it uncut on network television.I hate it when comedies forget to be funny. Another lame unimaginative completely generic and formulaic comedy from Hollywood. Skip this one and find a good comedy to watch.".

The money is from a recent robbery at the local post office. But when the robbers discover the location of the money the children are thrown into a dangerous web and have to find a way to escape.The movie has an awesome atmosphere the music is superior the children and especially the grownup actors give great performances. And Sren KraghJakobsen has done a fine job directing the movie.I love the fact that the movie portrays Denmark in the 1980's  before every child had a mobile phone and before Danish movies had to be filled with action and special effects all the time. This is a good Danish movie which takes its time to tell an exciting story using the necessary means. The movie contains both humor suspense and lots of atmosphere. Furthermore it's one of the few Danish crime movies made for the whole family.The DVDrelease features great picture quality  the colors are bright and the picture is clear and crisp despite the fact that the movie is 18 years old. The bonus material is really good. There's both an interview and a featurelength commentary by script writer Anders Bodelsen and director Sren KraghJakobsen who tell about the making of the movie. This is both entertaining and interesting.I can only give this DVDrelease my best recommendations to all Danish movielovers adults as well as children. Guldregn is an amazing movie for everybody.

The story of Abe Sada was brought on screen other two times in a film with the same name in 1975 by Noboru Tanaka and in the famous In the Realm of Senses by Nagisa Oshima in 1976. Teruo Ishii not just advance them of some years but let Abe Sada herself tell her story in a 1969 interview included in the movie. I don't know if the other stories are based on true facts they seem just an excuse to show pretty naked girls and gory scenes anyway for exploitation fans these are reasons good enough to look this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Beauty. The Terror. The Poetry. The Horror. The Innocence. The Guilt.Maybe that's just about all I should write in this comment for A TALE OF TWO SISTERS. The best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it. I myself didn't even know one single thing about the history of the two girls when I went into this movie. I just took a look at the nice coverart didn't even read the synopsis on the back and popped it into DVDplayer. I only knew that it won several prices on festivals around the world and that it came highly recommended.The DVDcover read The Most Frightening Film since THE RING THE GRUDGE and DARK WATER. Though the frighteningpart might be right you can forget about the rest because the only thing A TALE OF TWO SISTERS has in common with those movie is... a ghostly apparition with long black hair. It's even a bit unfair to compare it with those famous Japanese movies because this Korean movie has a lot more to offer and is in fact a bit more complicated and intelligent than those others.This movie simply is a small masterpiece and here are some reasons without telling anything about the plot The movie itself caught me off guard at least two times with clever surprisetwists. And just when you think you've had the conclusion whether you get it or not that's irrelevant for the moment and you think the movie will end... this movie goes on a bit longer. The cinematography is amazing using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night. The camerawork is excellent with the director sometimes choosing impressive if not innovating angles. Some shots are pure poetry e.g. the topshot with the two sisters at the lake. It all looks very stylish. There are only four main characters but the intrigue surrounding them is intense. The story itself starts a bit slow but there's a lot of variety in tone and emotions to keep it interesting. There was even one scene when the girls took off towards the lake that suddenly had me remembering Peter Jackson's HEAVENLY CREATURES. But when the horror kicks in it's quite effective. There are also a few successful surprisescares in it. Damn I jumped right up from my sofa. The musical score is great and at times when it's not supposed to be scary I couldn't help but noticing that it had sort of an Italian feeling to it. A bit strange for a Korean movie. But nevertheless a great score. So much care went into every detail of this film including a perfectly balanced surround sound.I also think that calling A TALE OF TWO SISTERS just a horror movie is giving it not enough credit. It's more a mysterious horrordrama that works both on a psychological and supernatural level. No matter how you look at it this is Asian horror that ranks way up there amongst the finest. It might not be gory but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject matter is pretty disturbed. So if you haven't seen it yet then find a copy pop it into your DVDplayer go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for it's 110 minutes running time.There I hope I did a good job praising it without spoiling anything.".

	schema:headline " So solid in construction so consistent in tone and so beautifully disorienting";
	schema:reviewBody "A TALE OF TWO SISTERS goes the furthest of any Asian horror film in proving that Asian horror films are the only horror films you really need to watch. As someone whose grown to love Asian chillers and as someone who lives for those precious moments when a film actually surprises with a twist ending that I didn't see coming or at least suspect I was totally blindsided by this film's intricate plotting.The set up is simple. Two girls return from the hospital after an extended illness with their father to an imposing rural KoreanGothic house. Almost immediately their snarky vaguely condescending and suspiciously omnipresent stepmother Yeom Jeongah who played a pivotal character in TELL ME SOMETHING is on them welcoming them and criticizing them in equal measure a notunfamiliar Korean trait though it deliberately borders on parody here. The tension between the three women only grows thicker from there as the stronger sister Im Sujeong protects  and increasingly harmfully overprotects  the weaker sister Mun Keunyeong from the stepmother who may be a stronger threat than either of them can handle and who blithley informs them that life's a bitch sometimes and she ain't gonna go away!Obviously relationships in the household have deteriorated to the point of open hostility and mindgames to which only the puzzlingly sedate father seems immune. Just when one wonders how much better  or worse  things were before the girls were sent away the filmmakers drop the first of two twistbombs that instantly provide clues to the prestory hints at a possible murder in the very recent past and makes the viewer replay the preceding hour in their mind from a whole new perspective. Absolutely brilliant but it doesn't end there.The feud continues  and the hints at prior foul play multiply  until the father decides enough is enough and finally turns to outside help to smooth things over at which point the puzzle starts to become diabolically clever.I can see where just about anyone reviewing this film has to remain frustratingly vague in regards to its psychological underpinnings so solid is its construction so consistent is its tone and so beautifully paranoid and disorienting is its atmosphere that upon a second viewing you'd be hardpressed not to stare at your companion's face or the collective faces of an audience preferably instead of the screen as the realization sets in.Structurally comparisons could be made to similar supernatural American thrillers one in particular from recent vintage where the ending forces you to reevaluate all that has gone before  and of course to rescreen the film to see if the director was sharp enough to include the visual cues you obviously missed. Only this time out supernatural explanations are not required to understand the bizarre seemingly paranormal goingson inside the house. Quite the opposite really as suspension of the audience's belief in the supernatural is the film's ultimate goal after gleefully necessarily trading in spook show delights for the better part of two hours no less and a more clever mechanism by which to do it I've yet to see even in the consistently intelligencerewarding pantheon of Asian horror.Truly a fantastic artistic piece of moviemaking. Highly recommended. Incidentally if you purchase the Korean Special Edition DVD there's a lengthy series of deleted scenes that while fascinating and informative in their own right ably demonstrate how tricky this film must have been for the director to pull off . Though several of the scenes clearly give away just a teensy bit too much information once you've seen the film it's nice to see how they actually further support the psychological intentions of the filmmakers yet at the same time had to go.".

I would particularly single out the stepmother character who was utterly brilliant. The ending will have you wanting to watch it again if you can cope. The plot is relentless and offers no comforting moments of release along the way.If I do have a small criticism there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring. We have however accepted straight copies of other peoples' ideas for Western films for years and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 1010.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film two years ago in the cinema and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters coping at home in their large country house with their father and stepmother. Their relationship with their stepmother is strained to say the least with the stepmother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls. The film though slants with Oriental style ghost effects and horror which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear but is all the more intriguing.The direction is incredibly good and the acting is stunning with the stepmother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film. The large house adds eeriness and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat. This film to me clearly shows why Korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment.

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw this film two years ago in the cinema and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters coping at home in their large country house with their father and stepmother. Their relationship with their stepmother is strained to say the least with the stepmother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls. The film though slants with Oriental style ghost effects and horror which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear but is all the more intriguing.The direction is incredibly good and the acting is stunning with the stepmother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film. The large house adds eeriness and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat. This film to me clearly shows why Korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment. You simply don't get anything like this in the Western World sadlyand really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade.Highly recommended viewing in my opinion a real joy and scare...";

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw A Tale of Two Sisters last night and really enjoyed it. I've been a big fan of Asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from South Korea. There aren't many jump out at you scares as in the usual American horror film but the director does maintain the offkilter and foreboding mood very well especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. Most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's there's something under the bed fears from when they were a child but in this case it's the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together. He's also good at revealing people's inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her makeup in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering TV. I think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE TWISTS OF THE MOVIE REVEALED I was following the story pretty well but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part. However I think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together. The film is very much like The Machinist in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions.Here's my interpretation of the film. The SuYeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of SuMi or the actual ghost of SuYeon that only SuMi can see and interact with. The initial stepmother that we see is in my opinion a delusion of SuMi. There is a real stepmother however and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit. I believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesn't appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house. The stepmother before that point is imagined by SuMi perhaps part of her split personality? That explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy and doesn't remember anything that she recounts. I think it was SuMi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality. The film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her makeup in the mirror which is revealed later to actually be SuMi wiping her makeup in the mirror.I think the ghosts in the house aren't entirely imagined by SuMi and are either of SuYeon or the mother or both. In the final flashback it is revealed the SuYeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. Also it's the hairpin that SuYeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink.The real stepmother in the end gets punished by the ghost of SuYeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like The Ring. After that the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death while SuMi unintentionally played a supporting role.I wonder if the mother that SuYeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry in the flashback is a ghost already. Perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet. That's left ambiguous.Other things that are suggested but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother at some point was a nurse perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too. It's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself. It's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too requiring a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells SuMi you're beginning to take after your mother. I don't think she meant just physically.Also if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually SuMi then there's the suggestion of incest too since the father sleeps with her. Is that why SuMi freaks out and shouts Don't touch me each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes? Is that the filthy things that you've done that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father? This film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations. A few of the scenes however were kind of derivative such as the woman in the black crawling around scene which reminded me of the herkyjerky movements of Kayako in the JuOnThe Grudge films. Also the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of The Ring. Furthermore just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from The Sixth Sense or The Others.Overall I enjoyed it however and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake that's already in production turns out. I have to be honest I liked both The Ring and The Grudge so I'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too. One remake that I'm really excited about is Dark Water coming out this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet but both films are definitely on my tosee list.".

It's something more complex and it's done in such a way that it beats Ringu and The Grudge out of the ring no sweat. A Tale is a way more clever film than those huge cultural hits because it really cares for its characters and the direction is flawless. Every detail in this film will leave you breathless if you're the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie. The acting is superb specially from the stepmother and the main girl. Those two are worth the price of the ticket alone. Do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps I'm one of the only avid horror fans who thinks that the recent overload of Asian shockers is so overhyped! Films like Ringu or the The Eye  which are praised all over the world  simply didn't convince me and they looked more boring than frightening. Well this blunt opinion doesn't go for the South Korean gem A Tale of Two Sisters. This is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terrortale that REALLY gets under your skin! The plot based on a local folklore tale might be a little too confusing to get this film listed among the alltime greatest genre achievements but the atmosphere and tensionbuilding surely provokes feelings of great respect. This is one of those few films that are impossible to label the events in Two Sisters qualify as mindbending horror as well as intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait. Besides a mesmerizing story A tale of Two Sisters also has all the great elements that I feel are usually missing in Asian horror films like compelling music good acting and innovative camerawork. The mansion were the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated like a truly creepy place where secrets and danger lurk behind every door. Several sequences like the dinner with relatives or the nightly appearance in the girls' room are pretty much the ultimate in eeriness. They really made me feel uncomfortable and I do like to believe that I've seen my share of spooky horror. A Tale of Two Sisters is a terrific movieadventure and a definite must see for Asian film fanatics. A little warning for people with a short attentionspan though this movie forces you to have your eyes and ears focused at at all time. It's also a film that requires repeated viewing even though no one will never really get it for a full 100.".

	schema:reviewBody "This review is long overdue since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made. I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking. It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces. The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema. I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute. Quite literally Jiwoon Kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels. A seemingly insignificant object may be shown  a rack of dresses two diaries a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack a bottle of pills etc.  but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more  a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene or perhaps the movie in total which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer's intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront. Such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie but in A Tale of Two Sisters such events occur in such a rapidfire relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness lest they miss something important. In other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films. How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this? It's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable.The most commonly cited criticism of A Tale of Two Sisters is nicely summarized by Zaphod B Goode who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions. He posits that Jiwoon Kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that. In reality however nothing could be further from the truth. A Tale of Two Sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the EXACT occurrences of each and every scene of the film. If our good friend Zaphod had been paying attention he would have noticed  for example  the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film. These flashbacks convincingly contradict Zaphod's assertion of complete subjectivity. The objective elements of A Tale of Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them. Can Jiwoon Kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film? I think not.Please note that I will not insult the intelligence of critics such as Zaphod that cannot get A Tale of Two Sisters because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence. The movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer. Yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture. You need only put them together. Remember the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind  he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that  when completed  bestows an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe.Don't misunderstand me. There are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design. Spider Forest 2004 Perfect Blue 1998 and Donnie Darko 2001 are perfect examples of this. A Tale of Two Sisters is not. It's ironic that Zaphod claims Darko to be more masterfully constructed than A Tale of Two Sisters especially considering that Darko not only provides almost NO objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina clich that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence. I'm ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence but the contrast is an important one. Although it does perplex me that Zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort. He apparently likes his intelligent films in the most superficial form possible. This is evident when he makes 17 consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself. Just read the threads by Opiemar within the IMDb A Tale of Two Sisters Discussion Forum. Anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned OBVIOUS.I'd like to say more but I've come to my 1000 word limit. All that has been said here needed to be said. So be it now said!".

	schema:reviewBody "This isn't so much a review of A Tale Of Two Sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details so I advise you NOT to read this review if you haven't seen the film because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for you.In a way A Tale Of Two Sisters is far from original at least from a purely superficial aspect  some of its iconography is taken straight from Ring or Dark Water while the storyline itself especially what Brendt Sponseller calls the rubber reality aspect of the narrative is reminiscent of films like Fight Club lead character interacts with someone created in their mind Mulholland Drive character creates alternate reality in a psychogenic fugue as well as other minor aspects of Lost Highway Jacob's Ladder and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness plus Amenabar's films The Others Abre Los Ojos Memento particularly with regards to the torturous nature of memory et al. Thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the film's overall emotional impact and I personally found A Tale Of Two Sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience.Many people have commented on the confusing nature of the narrative but I personally found the storyline to be fairly selfexplanatory even if it is in part portrayed in a nonsequential manner. The narrative only becomes confusing for some because midway through the final third the story switches from a purely subjective setting ie. SooMi's warped perception of reality to an objective one with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of SooMi's nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. The shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard but structurally I found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned Mulholland Drive even though we're not dealing with a character's perception of reality via a dream but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies  something which in turn reminded me of another Lynch movie Lost Highway. To be honest I don't really regard A Tale Of Two Sisters as a Horror movie as such but rather a tragic story of a family's breakdown as well as an honest look at a character's mental illness and I hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytical cinema are going to love this film.That aside the cinematography in A Tale Of Two Sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films I've seen this side of Wong Kar Wai's 2046. The performances are also fantastic without exception and I expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future not to mention the music but then east Asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days.It's very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of A Tale Of Two Sisters and simply dismiss it as yet another Asian horror film oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytical approach. But then each to their own. If you can ignore some of the film's platitudinous aspects and simply take it for what it is at heart ie. an extremely tragic heartbreaking story then I see no reason not to recommend it.".

After what feels like a million years it builds to a big twist that contradicts the narrative structure that led to it.Kim JeeWoon has made some great films including A Bittersweet Life but I was very disappointed with this snoozefest.

	schema:reviewBody "I know there are people who are willing to work with this movie  I too really really wanted this to be a great movie a masterpiece as so many are willing to call it and I think a lot of people gloss over the horrible incoherence of the story precisely because they want so bad for it to be a masterpiece. But wishing won't change the facts or as the great lyricist and percussionist Mr. Peart put it You can twist perceptions  reality won't budge. And incidentally I think a review is only as worthwhile as its honesty  I flatly refuse to sugarcoat a lame movie for the sake of Useful votes. I sought this movie out specifically because I'd read a number of reviews talking about a masterpiece with a stunning surprise ending. I have to say it's been a long long time since I've been this disappointed  no this utterly disgusted  with a film.Yes Tale of Two Sisters has a certain sense of style the cinematography is rich and wellphotographed throughout the acting is very good the dialog is well done  though certainly not outstanding in any of those elements. The story unfortunately is an incoherent unresolved mess. Surprise indeed.Along with the positive technical aspects listed above I think the reason people are so willing to shower Tale of Two Sisters with the comicallyundeserved label of masterpiece is the same reason people give historic figures like Kant Hegel and the like the label of great thinkers. If you say something nonsensical enough and wrap it up in a slick enough veneer you will invariably find plenty of people who will be willing to confuse incoherence with profundity. In other words I don't understand it therefore it must be deep. I say That there emperor is buck nekkid.An essential requirement of good storytelling is to maintain a solid logical framework no matter what plot twists misdirections red herrings or stylistic deceptions you may weave into it. Tale of Two Sisters is a game of logical 52pickup. It starts with a promising setup but in the midst of the plotthickening process refuses to lock into a coherent final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions. Instead the writer tosses half a dozen possible explanations skyward lets them drop in a random clattering jumble then hastily flips out the lights and runs for the door.Compare this with Donnie Darko The Machinist or the excellent Hong Kong thrillers Koma and The Eye. In each of these the audience is led through an increasinglyconfusing series of events in each there is a surprise ending that plays off of carefullyconstructed misconceptions maintained up to that point. But most importantly each is a great film because there is one solid definite truth beneath all of the deceptive ruses. It is that jarring contrast between the carefully constructed false premises and the actual final fact that makes each story work. If instead you leave out that essential final truth as does Tale of Two Sisters what remains is a meaningless hash of arbitrary possibilities with no reality to anchor them.It is no accident that there are dozens of theories as to what the hell actually happens in Tale of Two Sisters The writer and director didn't bother to complete the story.Put simply we don't know what really happened and we never will.Is the younger sister a ghost? Is the older sister an alterego of the stepmother? Why was the older sister in a mental hospital? Or was it both of them? If the younger sister is a ghost how did she die? Did she get beat to death inside that sack or was that something the older sister imagined? If so who did it the older sister or the stepmother? Why? If the younger sister was beat to death in a sack why is she later shown being killed by a wardrobe containing her mother's body falling on top of her? Is the stepmother a psycho? How much of this happened in the past and how much in the present? How did the mother die? If the stepmother did it what is the explanation for the two of them living in the same house together? If the father did it why? Why did the dinner guest's wife go into a violent seizure? Who was the greasy kid she saw under the sink? Why would that ghost happen to appear to someone largely irrelevant to the story? Etc. etc.The only possible answer to any and all of these questions is Anybody's guess. Since there's nothing identified as the final actual fact they all remain arbitrary possibilities and there is no logical thread tying any of it together. The only proper rational response to arbitrary assertions is Who cares? A writer bailing out on his responsibility to construct a coherent story is a phenomenon deserving designation not as a masterpiece but rather as contemptible laziness in storytelling.Tale of Two Sisters is a pretty building with no internal framework  it collapses into the void where a solid logical story with a coherent resolution needed to be.

The film starts out well enough giving the viewer enough information while still leaving questions unanswered. Soon enough the viewer is treated to the horrific side of the movie and when this first occurred I felt as if it was shaping up to be the scariest movie I would ever have seen.A slow pace is understandable for the beginning of a film as are unanswered questions. However these two traits remained throughout the film actually getting worse as time went on. The audience is treated to a lot of snuffling noises from the characters crying or breathing heavily as they walk for five minutes down a creepy hallway. Then they might peer into a room very slowly and then slowly walk back into the creepy hallway for another few minutes.As a mystery it fails because it does not provide enough sensible evidence for the audience to work with. This may indeed have been the intention of the film but what it amounts to is anyone trying to even get a sense of what is going on will be stonewalled  the film dances around the plot vomiting up all the critical points at the very end. This isn't in the same vein as the classic mystery where the detective has the clues and pieces them together in one big revelatory scene the necessary clues aren't given so instead the audience watches as wacky things go on whilst the characters continue their glacier pace.To say I was disappointed by A Tale of Two Sisters is a gross understatement and I cannot remember the last time I actually mourned the time wasted on a movie until this one. Personally I thought that the truth to the big mystery of the film to be prosaic and completely in line with standard Hollywood shlock. Any sense of horror one might receive is washed away by the yawninducing chunks of time where we see people walking or staring or frantically looking around. Showing fearful characters is completely understandable but when that is the gist of the movie then we have some problems.By the time the truth was revealed I was ready to watch something else or read a book or do anything that was actually enjoyable and perhaps engaging.

I don't need or want all the answers spoonfed to me during a ghost story but there's a huge difference between 1 using legitimate plot elements to build suspense carefully toward a solid climax or conclusion and 2 dumping a ton of red herrings on an audience and then expecting that audience to concoct its own conclusion with little or no help from the plot.A Tale of Two Sisters ultimately cops out into number 2 which is too bad because it could have been a superb film had the screenplay been better and the director less selfindulgent. Lately I've found Korean films in virtually all genres to be for the most part superb but A Tale of Two Sisters is a huge letdown.".

In fact unless you really hate the above two categories this is an absolute must see.The story surrounds two sisters who return from a spell in a mental institution to the house of their father and stepmother. The family is also quite dysfunctional and the stepmother in particular is very cruel. As the film progresses you begin to understand why the sisters were in an institution. You also get some terrific scares. But what is really going on? is the house haunted are the sisters really mad is the stepmother playing tricks on them or even the other way around. By the end of the film if you've been paying attention you'll know and I simply cannot give anything away as it will ruin it for you. The film is supremely clever and you're required to use your own intelligence to understand what is happening.

	schema:headline " Even better the second or third time round as you look for the clues";
	schema:reviewBody "A Tale of Two Sisters is a beautiful film that showcases some fine talent along with some great cinematography which adds to the spookiness. The first time I watched it I didn't really get the resolution in the story but the second time round it all made sense. So this is a film that works better on the second viewing because you start to look at how it all fits in together and scenes that may confuse you at first start to have more meaning to them when you pay extra attention.And it's a film that slowly builds up the suspense. Not a lot is said in this film and it relies on facial expressions atmosphere and that feeling of what is going to come next to tell its story and for a while you are really wondering where it's going and sometimes wish it would hurry up. That is probably one of the minor flaws so you have to have some patience with this film.Pretty much the story is about a girl called Su Mi who is released from a psychiatric hospital and returns home with her sister Su Yeoung to her house near a lake. Her father has recently remarried so their step mum is trying to adjust to her new surroundings while the sisters are hateful of her. And yet there seems to be a mysterious presence in the house that no one is entirely sure of.This is psychological horror at its best because you honestly won't see some of the twists coming.

While I am usually biased against remakes I will have to admit The Uninvited was actually a decent remake though they Americanise it and sex it up a bit more which makes it more conventional and less psychological here. But A Tale of Two Sisters captures the atmosphere tension emotions and scares that it really needs to make you think long and hard about this film afterwards and make you want to check out more that Korea and Asia has to offer in the horror genre. This film has a little bit of everything and it is very rare to get a film that combines all these elements and make a film enjoyable. Highly recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "A Tale of Two Sisters is a beautiful film that showcases some fine talent along with some great cinematography which adds to the spookiness. The first time I watched it I didn't really get the resolution in the story but the second time round it all made sense. So this is a film that works better on the second viewing because you start to look at how it all fits in together and scenes that may confuse you at first start to have more meaning to them when you pay extra attention.And it's a film that slowly builds up the suspense. Not a lot is said in this film and it relies on facial expressions atmosphere and that feeling of what is going to come next to tell its story and for a while you are really wondering where it's going and sometimes wish it would hurry up. That is probably one of the minor flaws so you have to have some patience with this film.Pretty much the story is about a girl called Su Mi who is released from a psychiatric hospital and returns home with her sister Su Yeoung to her house near a lake. Her father has recently remarried so their step mum is trying to adjust to her new surroundings while the sisters are hateful of her. And yet there seems to be a mysterious presence in the house that no one is entirely sure of.This is psychological horror at its best because you honestly won't see some of the twists coming. And you will have to think hard because it doesn't tell it to you in black and white  which is why a second viewing makes it even more exciting as you start to see moments of 'aha! so that's why this is happening'.At its heart though this is a story of regret loss and emotional guilt.

There is little bloodgore. The movie slowly builds up suspense and dread and brings you into the protagonists psyche by never revealing too much.The best thing about this movie is that it delivers an equally beautiful opening and ending sequence.

When the scientist and his formulae goes missing Holmes becomes involved in a rush to rescue the man and prevent nemesis Professor Moriarty getting hold of the rest of the formulae.Although I'm not a major fan of the Holmes films where he finds himself in the modern day world this is one of the better ones I have seen thus far. The plot is a little thick at the start but really gets going when the scientist goes missing.  The investigation by Holmes is very engaging and the climax has a nice couple of scenes where Holmes and Moriarty match wits.Rathbone makes a good Holmes as always and here he happily hasn't as bad a haircut as he did in some of the modern films.  Bruce is much better than usual  he is less of a mug and is made less fun of by Holmes he actually shows a bit of sense about him.  Indeed so does Lestrade Hoey so often a comedy figure it's nice to see him involved a bit more than usual! Atwill's Moriarty is good but I always saw him as a leaner meaner man  Atwill looks more like Watson than Sherlock even though their battle of wits is good I never felt that he was any match for Holmes never mind being a nemesis.Overall I enjoyed this film.  It does have a small bit of propaganda at the very end but unlike some of the other films doesn't ram it down your throat  by making it about Moriarty rather than Nazi goons the film works better.  It has a slow start but it opens up to be very enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "The evil Professor Moriarty plots to gain control of both SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEAPON which could win the war for the Nazis.Basil Rathbone  Nigel Bruce return to the screen as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's beloved detective and sidekick Sherlock Holmes  Dr. Watson in this entertaining little mystery. Universal Studios wasted no money on either fancy production values or a sensible script knowing that its two stars would be all the attraction an audience would need. Indeed Rathbone as the cerebral ego and Bruce as the bumbling id seem to actually become the characters they are creating gleefully keeping their faces straight while engaged in the most utter nonsense.Dennis Hoey makes his first appearance as the dogged Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard teamed with Bruce these two goodhearted but pedantic fellows actually get to save the intellectually superior Holmes' life twice. Lionel Atwill a master of the sinister who deserves more recognition for his talent does a fine job as Moriarty making the wicked rascal a foe worthy of Holmes' steel relishing the scenes in which he gets to inflict torture  pain.William Post Jr. and Kaaren Verne play the Swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are at the heart of the mystery but they're not given much to do. Sweet Mary Gordon makes a token appearance as Holmes' landlady Mrs. Hudson.Rathbone spices up his already classic interpretation of Holmes by getting to appear in disguise three times during the story thereby revealing to the viewer that the great sleuth was a bit of a ham actor at heart.This filmwhich is based very loosely on elements in Sir Arthur's short stories 'The Dancing Men' and 'The Empty House'followed SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE VOICE OF TERROR 1942 and preceded SHERLOCK HOLMES IN WASHINGTON 1943.".

Indeed Rathbone as the cerebral ego and Bruce as the bumbling id seem to actually become the characters they are creating gleefully keeping their faces straight while engaged in the most utter nonsense.Dennis Hoey makes his first appearance as the dogged Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard teamed with Bruce these two goodhearted but pedantic fellows actually get to save the intellectually superior Holmes' life twice. Lionel Atwill a master of the sinister who deserves more recognition for his talent does a fine job as Moriarty making the wicked rascal a foe worthy of Holmes' steel relishing the scenes in which he gets to inflict torture  pain.William Post Jr. and Kaaren Verne play the Swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are at the heart of the mystery but they're not given much to do. Sweet Mary Gordon makes a token appearance as Holmes' landlady Mrs. Hudson.Rathbone spices up his already classic interpretation of Holmes by getting to appear in disguise three times during the story thereby revealing to the viewer that the great sleuth was a bit of a ham actor at heart.This filmwhich is based very loosely on elements in Sir Arthur's short stories 'The Dancing Men' and 'The Empty House'followed SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE VOICE OF TERROR 1942 and preceded SHERLOCK HOLMES IN WASHINGTON 1943.";

	schema:reviewBody "It was an interesting enough idea I suppose to set a series of Sherlock Holmes films in the modern day...at the time the WWII era...but those who are familiar with the first two RathboneBruce films might be thrown off by it. When the rights passed from Fox to Universal the two stars were retained but apparently our two heroes stepped through a hole in the spacetime continuum. The Fox films were Victorian period pieces whereas Universal took the opportunity to utilize Sherlock Holmes in the series of modernday Bmovies into which this entry falls several of which were fairly standard wartime propaganda...pretty much the order of the day for Hollywood films circa 19421945.While the film may boast some entertainment value the plot is actually quite silly. Sherlock Holmes sporting a remarkably bad haircut has been charged with the task of guarding Dr. Franz Tobel the inventor of a bomb sight which when you see it will give you an idea of what the film's budget was that will apparently revolutionize airborne warfare. Holmes's task is to keep Tobel safe at which he fails and to keep the bomb sight out of the hands of the Nazis. When Tobel is abducted Holmes must unravel a coded message before his archnemesis Professor Moriarty does. Though the credits state that the film is an adaptation of Conan Doyle's story The Dancing Men only the code itself is taken from said story. And a small reference to another story The Empty House also shows up early in the film. Apart from that you'll find no Conan Doyle here.Interestingly enough what makes Tobel's bomb sight so remarkable apart from the fact that the bombs seem to land where they're supposed to is never expounded upon...leaving the viewer to assume that both Allied and German bomb sights were abysmally inaccurate as both sides are clamoring to get their hands on one that actually works. Probably not the best way to bolster confidence in the Allied fighting machine...but then logic is scarce in this outing. Holmes relies just as heavily upon chance and educated guesses as he does upon deduction and it's the bumbling Watson who was never bumbling in the original stories who inadvertently provides the solution to the major stumbling block despite the fact that the solution should have been obvious to someone as brilliant as Sherlock Holmes.All in all this film has its moments but fails to live up to the legend of the world's greatest detective. Rathbone is a fine Holmes and Bruce despite the almost unforgivable dumbing down of the Watson character does a good job as well. But much of the supporting cast seem to be phoning in their performances. The production values are rather noticeably low and the script is fairly ludicrous. I still watch this one from time to time and certainly prefer it over Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror the first Universal Holmes entry...but I can't help but think that Sherlock Holmes deserves better than this.Interesting sidenote  This film contains the series' one and only reference to Sherlock Holmes's hypodermic cocaine usage. As Holmes is describing to Moriarty an elaborate hypothetical death scenario involving an intravenous needle Moriarty interjects The needle to the last...eh Holmes? How this managed to slip by the censors at the Breen Office which at the time strictly forbade such references is perhaps the one great mystery to be found in this film.".

Then the franchise was moved to Universal Studios and a series of mostly declining quality was established. This was an early example. It's not terrible not embarrassingly bad it just loses something in being updated to the 1940s and in not having the atmosphere ConanDoyle managed to inject into his characters and into the atmosphere itself. Not to mention some of ConanDoyle's sometimes unwittingly delicious bon mots  The wind sobbed like a child in the chimney. The Secret Weapon doesn't tell us much we don't already know about Holmes and Watson. There is a variation on ConanDoyle's Dancing Men but not really much else that's too interesting. I never cared much for Lionel Atwill as an actor and he looks especially clunky as Moriarty. Moriarty should be a reptilian ectomorph with an oscillating head. Still this is okay for fans of the series. Homes wears his hair combed from back to front on the sides which is a little different. I wish the code had allowed him to do some cocaine once in a while. The best of the Universal films was unquestionably The Scarlet Claw so if you have to choose choose that one to watch.".

	schema:headline " Dancing Men and the Professor";
	schema:reviewBody "In the Universal series of modern Sherlock Holmes stories with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEOPON is not one of the top films  although it is entertaining. I think the problem with it is that much of the film's dueling between Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty here played by Lionel Atwill seems to delay the actual point of the Professor's work.Moriarty appears in three of the Holmes films with Rathbone. In THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES he was played by George Zucco who gave real relish to the love of villainy for its own sake to the role. For my money Zucco's performance as the Professor was the best of the three there is even a brief moment of comedy in his performance when he's disguised as the Sergeant of Police towards the end  like he's preparing to sing A Policeman's Lot from Gilbert  Sullivan. Next comes Mr. Atwill's performance here  more of that later. Finally there is Henry Daniell's intellectual Moriarty in SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE LADY IN GREEN. It's a typically cool classy performance by Mr. Daniell but his confrontations with Holmes seem to be a tedious bore to him. They keep him from completing the main plan. In the stories that the Professor pops up in he really senses Holmes is a nemesis who will remain a danger as long as he is alive. Yet because of the intellectual tennis match between him and Rathbone Rathbone in his autobiography actually felt Daniell was the best of the film Moriartys.If Zucco captured the love of evil in the Professor and Daniell seemed to demonstrate the tired Oxford Don in the stories the Professor is a well regarded mathematician whose volume on the binomial theorem had a European vogue and who wrote an intriguing book THE DYNAMICS OF THE ASTEROID Atwill demonstrates the Professor as pragmatic businessman. First of all he's sold his services apparently to Nazi Germany. This is never gone into but one presumes as this is before the Nazis began to really collapse he figures they will win the war. Secondly he is not a fool. When Dr. Tobel William Post Jr. has shown he is a state of near physical collapse due to the torturing of Moriarty's gang the Professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who are assisting Tobel because he's as good a scientist as Tobel and would be able to put together the bomb site. I somehow can't quite see Zucco making such a sensible decision on the spot and if Daniell had to make it he would seem annoyed that there is yet another delay to his plans.By the way one trick used in all the Holmes series regarding the Professor is how to rid the film of him. If you read the Holmes stories Moriarty appears as the villain three times in THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' last story THE ADVENTURE OF THE FINAL PROBLEM in THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' first story THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE and the last of the four novelsnovellas THE VALLEY OF FEAR.

Charles Higham in his biography THE ADVENTURES OF CONAN DOYLE suggests Sir Arthur may have picked up the code from a magazine game in the 1870s but we really don't know. The code is basically one of letter substitutions for the figures of the dancing men. The story in the short story is dramatic but deals with a triangle.

	onyx:emotionText "In the Universal series of modern Sherlock Holmes stories with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEOPON is not one of the top films  although it is entertaining. I think the problem with it is that much of the film's dueling between Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty here played by Lionel Atwill seems to delay the actual point of the Professor's work.Moriarty appears in three of the Holmes films with Rathbone. In THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES he was played by George Zucco who gave real relish to the love of villainy for its own sake to the role. For my money Zucco's performance as the Professor was the best of the three there is even a brief moment of comedy in his performance when he's disguised as the Sergeant of Police towards the end  like he's preparing to sing A Policeman's Lot from Gilbert  Sullivan. Next comes Mr. Atwill's performance here  more of that later. Finally there is Henry Daniell's intellectual Moriarty in SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE LADY IN GREEN. It's a typically cool classy performance by Mr. Daniell but his confrontations with Holmes seem to be a tedious bore to him. They keep him from completing the main plan. In the stories that the Professor pops up in he really senses Holmes is a nemesis who will remain a danger as long as he is alive. Yet because of the intellectual tennis match between him and Rathbone Rathbone in his autobiography actually felt Daniell was the best of the film Moriartys.If Zucco captured the love of evil in the Professor and Daniell seemed to demonstrate the tired Oxford Don in the stories the Professor is a well regarded mathematician whose volume on the binomial theorem had a European vogue and who wrote an intriguing book THE DYNAMICS OF THE ASTEROID Atwill demonstrates the Professor as pragmatic businessman. First of all he's sold his services apparently to Nazi Germany. This is never gone into but one presumes as this is before the Nazis began to really collapse he figures they will win the war. Secondly he is not a fool. When Dr. Tobel William Post Jr. has shown he is a state of near physical collapse due to the torturing of Moriarty's gang the Professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who are assisting Tobel because he's as good a scientist as Tobel and would be able to put together the bomb site. I somehow can't quite see Zucco making such a sensible decision on the spot and if Daniell had to make it he would seem annoyed that there is yet another delay to his plans.By the way one trick used in all the Holmes series regarding the Professor is how to rid the film of him. If you read the Holmes stories Moriarty appears as the villain three times in THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' last story THE ADVENTURE OF THE FINAL PROBLEM in THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' first story THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE and the last of the four novelsnovellas THE VALLEY OF FEAR. It's amazing how much mileage the Professor got out of so few appearances he is mentioned in two or three other stories as well  in passing. But because of his fate at the Reichenbach Falls in THE FINAL PROBLEM and THE EMPTY HOUSE we always see him fall to his death. Zucco falls off the White Tower on Tower Hill. Daniell with more imagination tries to flee Gregson and the police but is shot as he jumps and wounded fails to hold on to the wall of an adjacent building. Atwill here it is not seen but heard seems to fall down a trap door he's planted in an escape tunnel. It is really tedious after awhile to see the Professor always fall in these films.

Arriving in London he takes residence with Holmes and Watson but goes out for a visit with his girlfriend Charlotte Eberli where he leaves a clue for Holmes as to the locations of his bomb sight which he has divided into four pieces but Holmes' eternal nemesis Professor Moriarity is also seeking the bomb sight to sell to the Nazis and abducts Dr. Tobel and the clue left at Charlotte's a code series of dancing men which both Holmes and Moriarity are both unable to decipher completely. Holmes eventually discovers the clue to the code and get the location of the fourth piece of the bomb sight but Moriarity has the other three and a showdown is inevitable. Very good entry in the Holmes series with plenty of mystery and guesswork to go about. Atwill's portrayal of Moriarity is more sadistic than the cunning sort described in the Doyle stories or George Zucco's performance in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes but Atwill's skills as an actor makes his Moriarity quite the benevolent fellow. The script and direction both make this entry more of a cat and mouse game between the two characters and that is one of the reasons this entry succeeds so well. Great job on the cinematography as well. Rating 8.".

After Holmes opens the envelope he finds Tobel's code gone and replaced with a message reading We meet again Mr. Holmes! which means only one thing that Tobel was abducted or possibly killed by England's most sinister mastermind Professor Moriarty Lionel Atwill. Holmes Watson and Inspector Lestrade Dennis Hoey race against time preventing the secret weapon from reaching the Nazis or worse Moriarty as he attempts to figure out Tobel's dancing men message code.Others appearing in the cast include Philip Van Zandt Kurt Henry Victor Frederick Hoffner Michael Marke George Harry Cording Jack Brady one of Moriarty's men and of course Mary Gordon as Mrs. Hudson Holmes' landlady.An slight improvement over its previous installment SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE VOICE OF TERROR with the writers resuming its London blitz World War II setting once again as its basic theme source once again borrowing portions from Conan Doyle's original story. Unlike THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES where Moriarty was the central secondary character SECRET WEAPON gives Moriarty a chance to shine and rise from the dead 38 minutes into the story thus holding his own and Holmes as well once together again facetoface eye to eye for some very tense moments. Under Moriarty's orders to his associates Holmes falls victim to some death facing death experiences.

Not only must Holmes have to keep an eye out for the Nazis but the biggest problem might be the trader Professor Moriarty Lionel Atwill. This is a pretty thrilling adventure for the series and manages to have a great ending which has some nice tension as Holmes is slowly having the blood drained from his body while the police and Watson try to find his location. Once again the screenplay dealing with the German's wanting to find a scientist isn't very original but it's fun enough to keep the film moving well for its short running time. Rathbone once again turns in a very strong performance as Holmes and his charm and wit are on full display and mixes well with Bruce's sometimes dimwitted Dr. Watson. A great bonus is having someone like Atwill playing the bad guy. Both Atwill and Rathbone don't miss a step in their banter towards one another which they did greatly four years earlier in Son of Frankenstein. Roy William Neill was a very underrated director and he does a fine job here at keeping the film moving at a very fast pace and he nicely adds up the tension towards the end.".

Rathbone once again turns in a very strong performance as Holmes and his charm and wit are on full display and mixes well with Bruce's sometimes dimwitted Dr. Watson. A great bonus is having someone like Atwill playing the bad guy. Both Atwill and Rathbone don't miss a step in their banter towards one another which they did greatly four years earlier in Son of Frankenstein. Roy William Neill was a very underrated director and he does a fine job here at keeping the film moving at a very fast pace and he nicely adds up the tension towards the end.";

	schema:reviewBody "Before joining director Neill on the set of Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man as the Mayor Lionel Atwill played the archrival of Sherlock Holmes Dr. Moriarty in this 1942 film. Atwill is a actor who can be admired in classic films as The Vampire Bat 1933 Mysteries of the Wax Museum 1933 Mark of the Vampire 1935 and To Be Or Not To Be 1942 to name but four. Atwill was an actor on stage as well as on the white screen just like Basil Rathbone. Rathbone combined stage and screen work till he felt that his identification with the character of Sherlock Holmes was killing his film career he went back to New York and the stage in 1946. Apart from a few narrations he only returned four times to a movie set in the next fifteen years. In 1962 Rathbone joined other legends Vincent Price and Peter Lorre in Roger Corman's classic Poe adaptation Tales of Terror. A handful of films followed until his death in 1967 an uneasy mixture of classics Tourneur's Comedy of Terrors in 1964 and bubblegum pulp The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini in 1966. The Secret Weapon isn't set in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's times the story is transferred to the 1940s and Holmes finds himself battling both Moriarty and the Nazis. This is rather weird at first both because you don't expect Sherlock Holmes in the 20th century and because you don't want to confuse your detective entertainment with war propaganda. The propaganda scenes especially the one at the end of the movie sometimes harm the movie but not as much as they harmed an earlier attempt to transfer Holmes to the 1940s Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror. All in all it's living proof that the Sherlock Holmes stories can be timeless.".

	schema:reviewBody "What unlikely trio to fall in love with just as unlikely as the landscape. When a movie fits so well without a tag that links it to anything else in its historic film context it can only be described as a happy accident. Premeditated for sure but accident nonetheless. Terence Stamp is an actor with a spectacular career. Varied and surprising. It defies description but let me try. Peter Ustinov's Billy Budd William Wyler's The Collector Federico Fellini's Spirit of the Dead John Schlesinger's Far From The Madding Crowd Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema Joseph Losey's Modesty Blaise Oliver Stone's Wall Street Stephen Frear's The Hit Richard Donner's Superman Steven Sodebergh's The Limey Am I making my point? He is an actor for all seasons beautiful beyond belief to boot. In The Adventures of Pricilla Queen of The Desert he unveils another unexpected side to his considerable talents. A Woman. And what a woman a Meryl Streep with a past and thanks to director Stephan Elliot with a future. Dressed by geniuses. More human than ever. He is flanked by two spectacular Aussies. Hugo Weaving The Matrix giving a performance of such tenderness that even my brother in law a homophobic macho man of the first orderloved him. And Guy Pearce L A Confidential He is such a beautifulsexy funny girl that made me long for a herhe all to myself. Some other monstrously cloned movies were rushed into production trying to capitalize on the success of Pricilla. They all failed miserably and rightly so. Frank Capra accepting his AFI Lifetime Achievement Award sent a profound and heartfelt advise to young filmmakers. Don't follow trends start new ones Well done Mr Elliot. Well done.".

Of course ABBA is merely one of MANY verbal targets for the film's three main protagonists but far from this alienating us from any of them we cannot help but be swept along by the sheer garish joy of the entire venture.The basic plot focuses on recently bereaved transsexual Bernadette a magnificent hardly recognizable Terence Stamp who teams up with two younger drag artistes sensitive TickMitzi Hugo Weaving and screaming queen AdamFelicia Guy Pearce so that they can travel halfway across Australia on board an all but dilapidated bus named Priscilla in order to perform a cabaret act at a remote casino run by an expartner of Tick's soon revealed to be horror of horrors a WOMAN!  Along the way they encounter all sorts of absurd situations and individuals almost as strange and unconventional as they themselves are whilst Bernadette against her better judgement falls for gruff mechanic Bob Bill Hunter who also features in MURIEL'S WEDDING that they pick up en route and in so doing he loses his mailorder bride Cynthia Julia Cortez who in one especially memorable scene does things with pingpong balls you just don't want to imagine!The performances are really the thing here  Terence Stamp who won numerous accolades for his castagainsttype labours is amazing and totally credible as the quietly dignified transsexual and it is hard to believe that Weaving and especially Pearce have not worked as flamboyant lipsynching drag queens all their professional lives!  The gaudy outrageous costumes won a welldeserved Oscar and the photography of the barren surreal landscape is also masterful as is Stephan Elliott's creative direction and hilarious ultimately poignant script.  The soundtrack may not be to everyone's taste but it has enough camp classics to satisfy anyone yearning to relive the tacky heyday of the '70s  including ABBA's Mamma Mia the Village People's Go West and Gloria Gaynor's superb I Will Survive given a gloriously inventive rendition to a bunch of appreciative aboriginals with one of their number joining in most enthusiastically.A true kitsch classic then  well worth revisiting again and again ... and again.".

How genius is that? I had to see this to believe it and when I did I was not let down! Beautiful scenes costumes dialogue and music made this probably one of the most interesting and memorable movie experiences of my life! I wasn't the least bit uptight about it as some people were turned off by the flamboyant behaviour and distasteful jokes which I found refreshingly great! and delighted in the campy antics of this fantastic trio! It's a beautiful feelgood comedy that I recommend to anyone with a catty sense of humour and a VERY open mind.".

The sense of humor is very wicked and thank God for small favors not restrained to Hollywood standards. And I've never watched a game of table tennis without a smallish grin on my face which has little to do with the game in it self. The actors are great an absolute anti choice in the matters of typecasting . The scenery of the movie is great the bus in the desert are two extra players that give this movie an extra beaut. The extra castmembers are great and unforgettable. Ever since when I watch an episode of Flying Doctors or things in his sort I wonder about the nutty folks out there. the costumes are great and gobsmacking they perform very well in the musical numbers.I showed this to my mum after the initial shock she was very amused and agreed with me that it was a very funny movie.I will watch this movie a lot in the future why?? It keeps me laughing every time.".

	schema:reviewBody "A relatively low budget Australian film about drag queens took the world by storm almost caused a riot at the Cannes film festival and drove a million young queens to the dressing up box in the hunt for sequins sparkles and pink flipflops! The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of The Desert gave us such classic lines as Just what this country needs another cock in a frock on a rock! and Listen here you mullet why don't you just light your tampon and blow your box apart it's the only bang you're ever going to get sweetheartIt is without exception the best and arguably the most successful drag queen movie of all time breaking box office records and capturing the top of the charts in numerous countries around the world. It was an Academy award winning extravaganza of glitter glam and lipsyncing with the most outrageously camp costumes the world had seen outside Madame JoJo's or Funny Girls! Uproariously funny and yet deeply affecting it proved to be way more than just a camp outing of tried and tested queer humour. The late eighties was a bit of a coming of age time for Australia's gay population especially Sydney it really came alive and blossomed into one of the bigger gay populations in the world. Australia has a reputation for all the big butch manly men which considering how the modern nation of Australia started would seem pretty accurate only it's not it's completely different ever so much more vibrant and colourful. It is that vibrancy that colour and that hopefulness that is so perfectly depicted in Priscilla.Stephen Elliott the director and writer who incidentally has a small cameo in the movie as a cute door boy in Alice says he saw drag shows in other places like the US and England which were essentially men in dresses lipsyncing to other peoples songs. In Australia they did the same but took it in a completely new direction it became a completely new strange variety of theatre so much so that he even used to go to drag queen jelly wrestling pushing the envelope to the maximum. It was this experience along with watching a drunken drag queen at the Sydney gay Mardi Gras which gave birth to the movie idea which took hardly any time at all to write. From the very opening you know this film has deep rooted soul first shots of Hugo as Mitzi mouthing the words to the poignant Charlene song 'I've been to paradise but I've never been to me' give the impression of an emotively sad song yet this is so rapidly defused by the appearance of a lethargic priest and Felicia nursing a baby rubber chicken. You have left in no doubt after that that is no ordinary Australian movie and the jokes and gags just tumble on from there in rapid succession. However it's not all giggles there are some key moments of high emotion  seeing the graffiti sprayed on the side of the bus in pink paint the morning after shocks the trio along with the audience and strikes a chord with those of old enough to have lived through a time of such prejudice and discrimination and how true those word seem when they ring in our ears that no matter how tough we think we are such things still hurt.There are deeply moving scenes such as the gay bashing of Felicia and the confrontation between Mitzi and his son in Alice which really seem seep through the comedy to dance in your heart and make you fall in love with the film.  One of the key aspects of the movie is the superb casting Terrence Stamp previously typecast as your typical British villain took a risk on the role of Bernadette and knocked it out of the water in a downbeat down trodden put upon yet completely resilient way. Hugo Weaving is the less visually striking member of the trio and the central character of Mitzi who really is the lynch pin between the two worlds. The role of Felecia is taken by the simply stunning Guy Pearce who had literally just left long running soap Neighbours in which he played goodie two shoes Mike and was an inspired choice and oh so pretty. Guy's superb performance takes the movie to new heights and is so good that the he has had troubleconvincing people he is actually straight in real life even to this day. Bill Hunter a massive Australian character actor shines outstandingly as the gruff and butch Bob the mechanic and unlikely love interest for one of the three. Priscilla is a beautiful magical combination of humour catty bitchiness kitsch costumes stunning disco soundtrack and subtle sentiment with provocative thoughtful scenes and a delicate brush of honesty. Some jokes are obvious so too is the stereotypical veneer of the characters upon first glance yet look a little deep as the film rolls on you see more and more layers being unpeeled and exposed in a gently moving and comical way. It is one of the most enjoyable gay movies of all time each subsequent viewing cements that sentiment further into fact.

You can say that this film is about the great reach of little lives a comment originally applied by Donald Spoto to Tennesee Williams' The Glass Menagerie. We also see in Anthony Bellerose's story that sexuality is not a cutanddried affair. Underneath it all we see that these people aren't much different from those we meet ion our daily lives. A screening of Priscilla would do more good than a hundred lectures to high school kids on the acceptance of diversity.".

We also see in Anthony Bellerose's story that sexuality is not a cutanddried affair. Underneath it all we see that these people aren't much different from those we meet ion our daily lives. A screening of Priscilla would do more good than a hundred lectures to high school kids on the acceptance of diversity.";

I was frankly amazed by Terence Stamp an actor who has made a career playing dangerous macho types and made a surprisingly compelling and believable ageing transsexual. The novelty quickly wore off it was one of those rare performances that was just totally without affect.

It is a really funny film as we follow a group of drag queens lip syncing to famous pop songs while journeying across Australia. However it is also has a very meaningful heartfelt message as it embraces the idea of doing what makes you happy whether people like it or not cause it is your life and you choose how you live it. The only issue I really had is that I felt we did not get to learn enough about the three main characters before they begin their journey. Very little is actually said about their past or personal life which would have helped us connect with them more before their adventure begins.The three leads are stellar it was a huge risk on all of their careers as straight actors to be taking on these roles and they could not have performed them with more liveliness. Terence Stamp keeps a serious demeanour throughout Hugo Weaving's characterisation is fantastic while Guy Pearce's wild and energetic personality is the highlight of the film for me. There is nothing quite like it big fun with big heart. Sweet funny and meaningful I would recommend The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert to anyone looking for a good comedy. A trio of drag queens journey across Australia to perform their unique act.Best Performance Guy Pearce".

	schema:reviewBody "As EVERY comment has pointedout Priscilla is about two dragqueens and a transgendered performer who get on the bus in Sidney and take a perilous journey through the outback of Australia to do a gig at Alice Springs. I won't comment on too much of the plot because that's the secret of this most entertaining movie. I am DELIGHTED there were so few negative reviews. I am NOT surprised that those who loved it truly did  they were almost all female or gay but also a couple of heterosexual males....plus some married folk who certainly have open minds andor know some dragons.....maybe some plainole gays.I particularly loved the innocentbutwise attitude of Mitzi's Hugo Weaving son.....I think there are a lot more little guys like him but mom and dad just don't know about it. Mom June Marie Bennett ? certainly was a wildbutclever enough woman to educate him about his dad  why wouldn't he like him? Alice Springs looked a lot like Las Vegas  I think it had some offcolor business goingon there I'm sure you noticed one of the parkingattendants screamed here are the dragqueens without batting an eyelash and the audience wasn't all that excited about the show. The situation between dad and son was one of the tragicomedies which didn't materialize one of the heartwarming subplot of this beautifullytold screamer. Bob Paul Hunter played his role with ultimate skill that does happen as Brokeback Mountain proclaims. Femaleimpersonators have stagedoor Johnnies you wouldn't believe.......This is dangerous territory for me to write about some of you will know from my other reviews that I am a retired dragqueenfemaleimpersonator......I could write volumes. However some other users have poignantly written about the hidden tragedies in Priscilla I hope others have read those reviews and understood the message. I just want to make a couple of factual remarks.These performers were outrageous dragqueens NOT femaleimpersonators. The latter entertainers attempt to look and be as feminine as possible in every detail  taking themselves deadseriously. They see dragqueens as campy freaks  they seldom want to be associated with them in comparison. In professional revues however it's the freaks who usually are most popular if they get their stuff together. Bernie Terrance Stamp Mitzi Hugo Weaving and Felicia Guy Pearce gave fantastic performances and would reign supreme in many American clubs because it was apparent they didbutdidn't take themselves seriously.......in performing. Lizzy Gardner provided costumes ANY dragqueen would give their eyeteeth for and maybe another vital part of their body . BRAVA Liz ! How do I know? I performed for decades as an attractive femaleimpersonator with gorgeous wigs and costumes  and talent  but discovered how wonderful it was to be a dragqueen for the last part of my career I really don't take that term seriously. I called myself a dragqueen because I had the pleasure of working with many and admired them greatly.To Michael3B LesGirls was a fabulously successful nightclub in Sidney that featured femaleimpersonators AND dragqueens. It toured all over the AsianPacific. There are several more clubs in a certain area of Sidney where drag is featured and many gay people congregate. Bernie portrays one of the original performers who actually did become transgendered  she visited a club I worked in in Los Angeles. She did a guestperformance.....a lovely person. That such an outrageous film would ever be filmed in Australia is astounding. Not too many years ago ANY gay person could not get into that country as could not Blacks nor Orientals. Homophobia was the country's second name. It wasn't until the AIDSepidemic did it become acceptable for gays to even be recognized but it took a lot of screaming and kicking. NOWADAYS Australia  especially Sidney  is full of drag'........a second club was opened in Kowloon China to which I was going from Hawai'i. Sissy ME in China ? Not on your life.Americans cannot get it straight about men who dress as women they are all lumped into the term transvestites. SURPRISE transvestites are straight men who like to dressup in women's clothing and would not dare to leave home in that attire until recent years. SURPRISE NUMBER TWO their wives couldn't care less and usually accompany their husbands when they go out into public especially to gay bars. So all you macho numbers we've been onto you for a very long time.I agree that Terrance Stamp played his role with vivid feeling. There are so many people like that character but we want to think of them as being eternally ecstatically beautiful. T'ain't so  the most successful trangenderedsexchanges are the ones you don't know about.The cinematography of Australia was breathtaking  there was plenty of room for those miles of flying fabric on Priscilla. I can attest every dragshow in THIS country tried to imitate it. Stephen Elliott certainly broughtout the very best in the entire cast unlike some users I didn't find one weak scene in the entire movie I DID in that American Thank You Julie Newmar thing. The songs by Abba were so appropriate  who dares to think they're dated? The last song on MY VHS is one sung by Whitney Houston I think and is so appropriate. I worked with a performer who sang it live just as well. So touching....I shall inform you I have a critic of my reviews whose opinion of this one should be scalding. Priscilla is delicious may it live forever  yes it did deserve an Oscar. I also suggest that those folk who didn't enjoy it should watch it several times again to truly understand the subplots  and see Guy Pearce's fine buns.........you know I give it a 20.....".

It's a road movie unlike any I have seen before outrageously funny in one moment and poignant and touching the next.Second the performances by the 3 lead actors are outstanding. It's hard to pick one which has outshone the others. My personal favourite like a lot of others is Terence Stamp as the transsexual.Third the stunning costumes are worth watching just for themselves. Some of the scenes in the movie where we see the characters in their wildly colourful costumes against the background of an outlandish landscape are breathtakingly beautiful and memorable.It's a movie one can see many times and enjoy it every time.".

	schema:headline " Touching dazzling movie with some comedy sprinkled on top";
	schema:reviewBody "In honor of pride month I decided to watch a movie I could not believe I have never seen before. That movie is of course the adventures of Priscilla Queen of the desert. I can honestly say that it is one of the best LGBTQ films ever made. And just because this is an LGBTQ movie doesn't mean that that's all that it's it's not. It's is a road trip movie about these three individuals. It's stars Hugo Weaving Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp. Weaving and Pierce play to gay drag queens and Terence Stamp plays an aging transgender woman. They all three decide to get in a bus that they have named Priscilla and drive across the desert to some drag shows they will be performing in in a town called Alice Springs. On this road trip they come across many things homophobic assaults they learn secrets about one another and they get to know each other better through deep meaningful conversations. That's why I call it a touching road trip movie sprinkled with comedy it is not strictly a comedic film I would first call it a drama before I would a comedy. The acting is really what holds this movie up along with the good dialogue and the fantastic costumes for which the film won an academy award. The one that really shines the most in this movie is Terence Stamp his performance as the transgender woman Bernadette was absolutely flawless personally I think he should've gotten an Academy Award nomination. Hugo weaving and Guy Pearce were also very very good in their roles it's just that Terence stamp really outshined everyone. Guy Pearce was not only very good looking in this role but he was also very flamboyant and cheery character so he was kind of the comedic relief of the film not that the movie was making fun of his being gay or being flamboyant he was just a very funny character which was good because it's always good to have a balance of good touching drama with some comedy. The costuming absolutely deserved that Academy award win they were fabulous and just perfect for the drag shows. The soundtrack is great too. All in all this is a very well made film and I suggest it to any and everyone. 910. Happy Pride Month everyone!!".

	schema:reviewBody "When we talk about Hugo Weaving we always talk about his famous roles like Agent Smith V or Elrond. This is Hugo Weaving before he was Smith and he is playing as a drag queen. No kidding he's playing a drag queen! Not only you get to see Hugo Weaving as a drag queen but also Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp. They're all playing drag queen. Now how often do we see Hollywood actors playing as a drag queen? Mitzi Weaving Felicia Pearce and Bernadette Stamp decides to go for a performance in a Hotel. They travel on bus across the desert and it breakdown in the middle of nowhere. They discovered that the owner for the hotel they are performing for is owned by Mitzi's wife. They soon meets Bob who help them fix the bus. They bring him along on their journey to fix the bus. Soon they made it to the hotel and Mitzi finds out that he has a son and he doesn't want his son to know what he is working as.This is a wonderful singalong movie with lots of laugh out loud jokes. I watched this movie once and I've already end up singing along with the movie. The soundtrack of the movie is great. Lots of famous songs like 'Mamamia' or 'I Will Survive'. This is a soundtrack worth buying. The characters are well crafted and the acting is brilliant. It is so good and so believable they deserve a best actor award.The camera works are simple but great. It matches well for the film. The editing is great for some of the scenes like the performances scenes. The art direction for this film is excellent. The costume for the performance scenes are well done. The script is well written with lots of jokes that can make you laugh till you drop. You will not get bored of the jokes.I hardly watch movies about drag queen and I'm not really a fan of it but after watching this movie I like it even if it is not my cup of tea. Fans of Hugo Weaving Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp must watch this film to believe it. If you are looking for some good laugh this is strongly recommend. Drag queens have never look this good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although this movie got a lot of good criticism when it was first released I never watched it until now. I always thought that this wasn't a movie for me. I'm a straight guy and I was convinced that I didn't want to see weird men dressing up in women's clothes playbacking seventies hits from ABBA or other groups. That's why I never rented it but when it was shown on television I decided to give it a try anyway. I could always switch it off if it was too terrible. But I didn't I kept watching it until the end.The story that is told in The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert brings us to two dragqueens and a transsexual who will go to a resort in Alice Springs a town in the middle of the Australian desert to perform a drag show. As they travel from Sydney to Alice Springs they encounter all kinds of people but are almost always the subject of misunderstanding and hate because the locals don't always understand or like the way these three men act. When the engine of Priscilla that's how they called their bus breaks down in the middle of the desert they paint it lavender waiting for help to come. Then they meet Bob who takes them for what they are and who fixes the problem with their bus. He travels on with them protecting them for more problems...If you are looking for a not so average comedy then you definitely should give this movie a try. A road movie about two drag queens and a transvestite isn't exactly something that you'll find every day let alone a good one. And I admit that I started feeling completely different about this movie once I was seeing it. OK it may not always be perfect and sometimes it is completely overthetop but it also offers some excellent laughs. And seeing Guy Pearce Hugo Weaving and Terence Stamp in this kind of roles is already great fun on itself. Normally you wouldn't expect them in such a role but they did a very fine job.All in all I guess you have to be incredibly homophobic to hate this movie. I'm not saying that it's my favorite comedy of all times but the story the acting the humor... made it all worth watching. I give this movie a 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many outstanding features in Stephan Elliot's legendary examination of prejudice and triumph relating to Australia's queer community. Firstly of course those incredible costumes by Lizzie Gardiner and Tim Chappell  you can't take your eyes off them. The lush colour and attention to detail is astounding. Next the stunning landscape although stunning seems an understatement of outback Australia with the light and perspectives used to amazing effect in every scene. The acting with Guy Pearce Terence Stamp and Hugo Weaving in the main roles is impeccable. All of them inhabit their characters to such an extent that you forget they're acting. Terence Stamp in particular struck me as just perfect for his role. His character an older transsexual is brittle yet witty and resilient and later on shows she is supportive and empathetic of her friends. Guy Pearce gives an astonishing physicality to his role  he is so immersed in his character that he doesn't have to impersonate anyone his IS the camp flamboyant muscled up young drag queen. The role when heshe confronts the violent thugs chasing her in Coober Pedy is outstanding  it manages to be funny disturbing offensive shocking and confronting all at once. The film's script is sharp and entertaining although sometimes there is too much dialogue. Sometimes scenes are more like a play and the actors fall to reciting their lines albeit with great wit. It's a very Australian film. There are many people who are encountered along the way who accept the three main characters love them and help them but also a lot of senseless hostility and the film lays out those issues effectively. The film also shows how there are many grey areas with the characters for example Hugo Weaving's character has a wife and child and is conflicted in many ways in his sexuality. He's still working out who he is. He feels guilty and uncertain. It's a great portrait that the scriptwriters paint in his case. The films is amazingly assured and accomplished. A real landmark of Australian cinema.".

I think Americans love Jackie Chan because he's so nice and great person.The main reason why I like this movie is the wonderful duo they play constantly arguing while walking around exciting California USA about everything but in the meantime they are loyal partners. The great diversity there is in America singles out in a city like Los Angeles when we go through Chinatown. And fortunately the movie brings us out there. Interesting cultures melt into a huge variety of ethnicities that make anything possible to happen. This is why America is so interesting and wonderful and we from abroad love her as a beautiful land.All in all this is a worthseeing Hollywood movie and probably you would like to watch it several times!".

	schema:reviewBody "Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan the best comedic duo since Lethal Weapon bring us Rush Hour. A classic action movie that brings great action as well as awesome comedy that makes you laugh every minute. Chris Tucker has always been one of my favorite comedians even before I saw Rush Hour so it was great to see him in Rush Hour. I know a lot of people find him annoying but I thought he was just so funny. He showed off his talents in Rush Hour. Not only him but this is the film that is making Jackie Chan into a world wide super star. His stunts are simply incredible. Rush Hour is one of those very fun actioncomedy movies that I'm sure you'll enjoy if you love movies like Lethal Weapon or 48 Hours. The story was just pure entertainment and really kept me on the edge.Lee is a body guard to the Chinese ambassador and is also a close friend he also is a teacher to his daughter Soo Yong. The ambassador goes to the United States with his daughter but she is kidnapped by an evil man of the Chinese Consol. They want 50 million dollars in return but the ambassador thinks that Lee should be involved so he sends for him but the F.B.I. doesn't want him near the case. So they hire L.A.P.D. screw up James Carter to babysit him. But together the fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west they must learn to work together despite their complete opposite personalities and get the girl back.Rush Hour is a guaranteed classic down the lines somewhere I'm sure. It's already spawned a sequel and it's been a success. Chris and Jackie are such a great team I was really impressed with their chemistry. My favorite scene is where Lee plays War by Edwin Starr in Carter's car and he doesn't know how to say the lyrics correctly and Carter shows him some moves it was such a classic scene that brought me down to the floor laughing. I highly recommend Rush Hour it's all in good fun and it'll give you more than a few good laughs.810".

Naturally they have a very hard time cooperating.I guess that a major aspect of these movies is that you shouldn't try to take them seriously just accept them as completely crazy.

When a drug bust goes haywire and two cops caught in the crossfire are shot the LAPD Supervisor knows it's all Carter's fault!  Not looking very highly towards Carter the LAPD Supervisor gives him two options Either be suspended without his badge for two months or help the FBI chase after a gang of ruthless criminals who have kidnapped a Chinese Diplomat's daughter Julie Hsu. The choices for this egotistic selfcentered cop will not be simple...Enter Detective Inspector Lee Jackie Chan a police officer who wrote the book on fighting crime. Back in LA Carter immediately gets his feet wet before shortly experiencing a chagrin moment. Detective Carter has learned that his assignment is to babysit Inspector Lee.    Carter must make sure that Lee does not interfere with the FBI's business.   Carter is not happy with the workload he is responsible for but he must fulfill his duty nonetheless...Carter usually works alone...this time he has company. Reluctantly the Lee and Carter align together and a culture clash becomes obvious. The wonderful pair is drawn to a series of mishaps conspiracies and plenty of high kicking action and adventure! Carter shows Lee a tour or two around the city of Los Angeles and the pair quickly become best buddies. However Lee and Carter can't help but to interfere with the FBI's affairs. Lee cares only so much about the kidnapped child.  He feels that he must help track her down before the nefarious villains murder her... Meanwhile Carter ticks off a few of the locals before he faces absolute terror. Can Lee convince Carter to focus on this mission to rescue the Diplomat's daughter held for ransom? Or will it be too late?RUSH HOUR is one of the most jamming actioncomedy mixtures ever.  This film is one awesome venture with the presence of both Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker helping to create a winner for the action genre. RUSH HOUR is entertaining a fastpaced copbuddy flick. Part of this film's success owes to the eccentric chemistry between the two leading stars. For example Jackie Chan's athletic capabilities are strikingly in contrast to Chris Tucker's overzealous fidgety reactions. Chan's ability to maneuver high risk jumps leaps and other assorted dangerous stunts definitely keeps the energy going while Tucker's jittery silliness always creates a warm smile on the viewer's face. Tucker's motormouth is surprisingly compatible to Chan's martial arts prowess. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are a definite revelation!The cast in RUSH HOUR prove themselves worthy of their roles. Besides the two main characters the supporting cast is terrific. Elizabeth Pena adds a touch of sentimentality as Tucker's unappreciated sidekick who turns out to be an asset to the police department after all. Mark Rolston ALIENS and Tzi Ma CHAIN REACTION RAPID FIRE as a strategic FBI agent and Consul Han respectively all add credibility to their parts. Newcomer Julie Hsu is also fabulous as a hostage who proves to be more difficult for the bad guys than they can handle...RUSH HOUR has top notch stunts mixed with oneofakind comical moments which help make this film an enlightening combination of action and comedy with a dash of Chan's fantastic skill work.The ChanTucker collaboration is the best onscreen duo since Abbott  Costello! The duo has showed all their right moves and have proven themselves a spectacular heroic pair for moviegoers to cheer on everywhere. Again the action in RUSH HOUR is no short of exhilarating with outrageous sequences such as Chan trying to protect a valuable vase from the wrath of the bad guys.Great dance moves by Tucker but nobody impresses the audience like Jackie Chan leaping from place to place mowing down the bad guys! RUSH HOUR is fantastic fun! A mustsee for die hard action enthusiasts. This film is Jackie Chan's and Chris Tucker's finest hour.  Watch for the requisite funny outtakes by the film's end credits.

The formula is tired and predictable but it's redeemed to a surprising extent by the effective pairing of Chan and Tucker who are an ideal actioncomedy duo. Lots of gimmicky action scenes and big time laughs with the added bonus of a script that doesn't require a lot of thinking. ".

Which it does  there's not as much action for Jackie Chan as I would have liked and his fight scenes feel toned down in favour of Tucker's manic comedy this was partially reversed in RH2.  This is a shame because Tucker is funny but his manic antics can get a bit irritating in large doses  it needed more of Chan.However it is funny and Chan does hold his own and get to show how fast he is.  His fight scenes don't feel as inventive as in other films but he has a good chemistry with Tucker.  The bad guys are quite characterless but it doesn't really matter as the lead duo manage to carry the film.Overall a good buddy cop movie that is a good vehicle for both Chan and Tucker and plays on both their strengths to good effect.

So an LAPD officer James CarterChris Tucker is  sent in to help keep Lee out of trouble. It had some very good lines passed between the actors and you could tell they were having a fun time together acting. Some of the martial artskarate that Chan does in the film is impressive just like in all his films and Tucker does a good job playing the loud moutheven if he did get out of hand sometimes. I'm going to definately see the sequel Rush Hour 2. I would give this film 35 stars. It's a good movie to just rent out or watch on tv some night.".

With just the first viewing of future many I wasn't let down. For a single minute.I sincerely love this movie and ranks as my second favorite buddycop movie behind Lethal Weapon 2. Only some slight flaws cause it to lose a full 55 stars but then rarely is a movie perfect.Super Cop Lee Chan in Hong Kong is summoned to the USA after Consul Han's Ma daughter is kidnapped. Since the F.B.I. doesn't wish to use outsider Lee's help they team him with I don't want a partner LAPD cop Carter Tucker not that anyone would have such a loose cannon.Yes I realize this is predictable and as unoriginal as it comes however if not for the fantastic quick wit of Tucker and the fantastic quick punch  creativity of Chan none of this would work.At any rate they team Lee fights and Carter uses every available to investigate the daughter's disappearance while uncovering a conspiracy. All to an exciting finale using both Chan and Tucker's charm and talents.I'm not doing this movie much justice but suffice to say each and every time I've seen this I have been rolling with laughter and excited with all of Chan's enormously original fightflight sequences. This is a mustsee for fans of comedy heart action adventure and of course buddycop films. I could watch this movie a hundred times and still get the same effect. I probably have already.".

RUSH HOUR is a reasonable combination of a suspense thriller with touches of hip comedy. Plus it teams up both Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker the two whose attitudes are by no means the same. It looks like I'll have to give credit to Tucker whose smartass superior personality is the reason to enjoy this. The movie wouldn't have been so much fun without him as his comedic charms lighten up the actionstyle mood we're witnessing. As for Chan well don't expect a whole lot of his potential this time. It isn't that he still performs a few killer stunts but there is relatively little that was done. You've seen Chan in kungfu brawls before so nothing is very special or different. Speaking of action RUSH HOUR suffers from little of it anyway. Nothing is absolutely groundbreaking even with a couple of big explosions and gunfights. Tucker's blabbermouthing takes a huge chunk out of over one hour until the climax opens with Chan's daughter strapped with a bomb. The conclusion is stylishly amusing though and once again the outtakes are an added bonus for extra fun. Chan fans may be disappointed by the scarcity of his signature action routines but the humorous magic remains. RUSH HOUR is an entertaining combo of all sorts but don't take this one too seriously if you're into heavy highimpact action thrills. You may enjoy Tucker a lot more than anything else in the world.".

The music is absolutely amazing and is one of the best if not the best thing about the movie. I could listen to this music forever and I wouldn't get bored of it. A perfect action comedy film. This film is a buddy cop masterpiece and one of my favorite films ever. 1010.";

Rush Hour is fast funny and Fantastic. It is 2 hours of non stop entertainment. I have seen the sequel No where near the Classic. Jackie Chan is amazing as the martial arts expert cop from Hong Kong. Chris Tucker is Hilarious as the fast talking cop from America. What happens when two people like this meet Excitement and entertainment. This is Jackie's Best Hollywood Movie. I have seen a few Chris Tucker movie this is his Best performance. I hope the third in the series will entertain as the First. If you have not seen this movie then i recommend this movie. A great action comedy movie for all type of audience to enjoy. One of the best cop buddy movies since Lethal Weapon.".

The FBI don't want him anywhere near their investigation so palm him off to the LAPD which in turn partners him with Detective James Carter who has no current partner because he annoys everybody else in the department. Carter is initially pleased with the assignment but soon learns that he is just expected to babysit Lee and keep him away from the case Lee is equally unimpressed and is determined that he must help find his friends daughter. Inevitably it isn't that long before the pair are investigating the case and the FBI are thinking they are getting in the way.This film's story is decent enough even if the big reveal about who is ultimately behind the kidnapping is rather spoilt for anybody who reads who is starring in the film at the start anybody appearing third is surely not only going to have one brief scene in the opening minutes! That isn't much of a problem though this is all about the laughs not the depth of the mystery. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are a lot of fun in the lead roles they provide lots of laughs and develop a good chemistry as the film progresses. The action is well choreographed as one would expect from anything featuring Jackie Chan it might not be as intense as that in his Hong Kong films but that is partly to give room to the fast talking Chris Tucker to provide more verbal laughs. Overall I found this to be a fun mix of action and comedy which manages to avoid the sort of offensive material that might put off many viewers.".

Susan Sarandon makes full use of her powerful screen presence and easily stands out. No wonder she's an exceptional actress. Reggie Love is one of her most memorable performances among the so many she's already given. The late Brad Renfro as the young Sway is very competent and does impress in several scenes. Tommy Lee Jones is funny both intentionally and unintentionally. From the supporting cast MaryLouise Parker leaves a mark. William H.

Tommy Lee Jones is funny both intentionally and unintentionally. From the supporting cast MaryLouise Parker leaves a mark. William H. Macy barely has more than a few lines but has a dignified presence. The villains both look and act like caricatures. In a nutshell it's an interesting film with a flawed but gripping plot and marvelous performances.";

While the film was put together in a rather conventional way with Tommy Lee Jones playing an over clichd character the film is still rather gripping.

Watch the scene in Dead Man Walking when she visits the family of one of the victims. She doesn't just sit quietly. She actively listens to them. And Tommy Lee Jones uncovers the comic side of his dashing political lawyer. Even the elevenyearold kid gives a spot on performance anything but cute which is a relief. The smaller roles are equally well done although there is less to be done well. J. T. Walsh is always good. MaryLouise Parker never makes a wrong move as the stressedout mother. Ossie Davis is a monumental presence as the judge. Bill Macy is given only a few lines.The script isn't bad either especially in the first half of the film in which the characters are being established. There are alas three clichs.The bad guys LOOK like move bad guys usually look. They dress in black have long greasy hair are engraved with threatening jailhouse tattoos of barbed wire and things and they never seem to enjoy themselves.There are also two stereotypical scenes which really should have been avoided. In the first the boy Renfro is trying to sneak out of a hospital. He pokes his face through a door into the reception room where he sees his mother and two cops walking around. In the shadows he also spots the man he knows is trying to murder him. So what does he do? Does he run to his Mom and the police for protection? Certainly not. He does what aay potential murder victim would do. He dashes away from safety down several flights of an empty stairway followed closely by the squinter with a knife. The scene that follows is lifted straight out of Coma with the killer being locked in a refrigerator. The other stereotyped situation is towards the end when just by the most improbable of coincidences Sarandon and Renfro reach an empty boat house at the same time as three of the heavies. The two innocents try to avoid being discovered. There is a lot of tiptoeing around on creaky boards a foot chase through some bushes one of those scenes in which one person holds a gun on a second and the second smiles and says You don't have the guts to pull the trigger and walks up closer to the muzzle.I've pointed out these weaknesses not because this is a bad movie. It's really pretty good. But the cast is so outstanding that any weakness in the story is the more highly illuminated. See it if only to see the range of facial expressions into which Jones is able to fashion his face.".

At the very core the entire basis for the movie falls apart with any scrutiny.  The kid is only a threat to the mob if he DOESN'T talk  once he talks the damage is done and he's of no interest to the mob I don't think the mob kills kids for telling the cops what they know!.  So to protect himself the first thing he would do is squeal.  Even ignoring the big plot lapse there are several aspects that leave you scratching your head like why is it that the DA who's trying to convict the mob assassin is the BAD GUY in this?  Why is the kid so mad at his lawyer?  Why did the kid break out of jail  it was the only place he was safe!  These nagging questions just go on and on as you watch this movie.2  The actors overact.  In the case of Tommy Lee Joneshe does a great job in creating a slick manipulative DA see above but it is so cliche as to be cartoonish.  Susan Sarandon does a good job also but it's not really a role that should have been oscarnomination material  aside from her past life troubles there's not much there for her character.  My complaint with her is that her character is again cliche.  The most egregious bit of overacting belongs to Brad Renfroe though I blame the director.  As opposed to sympathizing with him his yelling and cursing tantrums made me want to slap him.  He was way over the top.3  The movie was sheer formula predictable familiar.  Little kid takes on the evil andor incompetent adults  and of course wins.  Throw in the rediculously cliche mob wiseguy the slick mediasavvy DA the goodhearted smartasawhip beautiful female attorney the wise selfconfident unflappable southern judge black for good measure and the secretly menacing cop and voila!  It's basically a 60's Disney movie on steroids. The cute snappy repartee between the lawyer and the DA wherein the female of course 2yearsoutoflawschool domestic relations lawyer goes toetotoe and holds her own with the powerful ironfisted DA typifies this movie.Judging by the vast majority of other comments I can see that most people weren't as put off by this rather typical John GrishamHollywood concoction as I so it must be entertaining to a large audience but please don't confuse it with good cinema.".

But there are ample parallels to real life in preRomantic history. It is really our modern assumptions of prolonged childhood and adolescence which are abnormal in the fuller perspective of human experience.  Aren't we on the verge of these concepts' retreating from the apogees to which western culture pushed them in the 19th and early 20th centuries?If so this film is on the cusp of the trend.  Yet it might never have worked but for the director's good fortune in locating Brad Renfro for the lead role. What a find!  His earthy protean spunk and obliviousness to any cute brownnosing towards his elders simply because they are elders make him entirely convincing in the part. He is I hope on his way to being a great actor but perhaps it will continue to be this film which shows his freshness most clearly.Not that it isn't very taut cinema in other regards. The build up of drama in the opening scenes is superb with acting cinematography and the score all combining to provide a seamless experience.

Susan Sarandon gives another terrific performance this time as an alcoholic lawyer. Tommy Lee Jones' character doesn't have much to do with the plot but he's a welcome addition to the film even though.

Mark Sway just swore a lot and didn't have a clue what he was doing and some people call him the 'hero'!. Not sure what Reggie the lawyer was trying to protect the boy from for she seemed far more concerned over the law then the bad guys.The Barry 'the Blade' character made me wonder whether he was some guy who was posing as a mob killer and thought that's how they dressed and acted. For he seemed as far from realistic as one could get. The cop that finds Mark has got to be one of the worst cops in Memphis. Kid finds body you think he's hiding something. So the obvious way to get him to talk? Of course try to scare it out of him! It always works!The federal agents seemed to be about as inept as possible. The DA made me wonder why anyone would pay attention to him let alone the media. The family is in the hospital under police watch but there's a detective down the hall watching the room? How does that happen? Speaking of the media how about the supposed newspaper reporter. Taking pictures of the kid in the hospital room? Really? And the newspaper not only gave out his name but printed a big picture of him?Finally this is all about 'finding the body of the senator' but they never explained WHY that was important. A body is just a body. Sure it can show the senator is truly dead. But not once did we hear If we can find the body we're sure to find proof that the blade did this!. Let alone why would they think they could find it? Had they ever found any of his other victims? And did those not help send him to jail?Oh and I didn't even get to the part where they go to NO to find the body for some insane reason.

And what a glorious start for his career! Not so much for the movie itself which isn't that great but for his demanding role and especially for his absolutely impeccable performance. He was such a talented young actor so lively so energetic and so dedicated to his actings that it's difficult to believe and imagine that his life was destroyed by drug addiction and that now sadly he is no longer alive. He was 25 when he died. He was one of those old school young talents like you don't see in this generation one of those really eternal.Brad Renfro plays Mark Sway a boy who together with his younger brother Ricky witnesses a drunk and outofhismind fat brute guy trying to commit suicide in the most unusual way by putting one end of a garden hose in the exhaust pipe of the car and the other end into a rear passenger window and rolls up the window so that the carbon monoxide poisoning can kill him.Mark attempts to prevent that unsuccessfully. But on the 2nd attempt the insane brute sees what he is doing grabs him and takes him into the car with him. The entire sequence inside the car is extremely intense. More than seeing you can feel the tension and panic on Mark Sway he's sweating shivering and fearing what that crazy lunatic might DO to him. And his little brother is no less anxious with the stress of the situation. When the 2 brothers escape the guy shoots himself in the mouth a horrifying event witnessed by the 2 brothers. The younger brother goes into major shock.Mark Sway lives a living hell since then. He is threatened by a mafia shark with a knife in case he tells anyone what he knows. The boy becomes so frightened that he is forced to lie and even speaks aggressively. Mark swears often but even when he swears he's cool and cute.After the beginning another tense scene is when Mark is chased by a criminal but he manages to outsmart him. The story has a happy ending.The best things about this film are the 2 most tense scenes I mentioned the happy ending and the amazing acting by Brad Renfro and the kid who plays his cute younger brother. Brad Renfro's brilliant acting makes this movie better than it would have otherwise been without him.".

Brad Renfro's brilliant acting makes this movie better than it would have otherwise been without him.";

For reasons that totally elude me the producerswriters decided to include totally unnecessary scenes and create unnecessary tensions between the major characters that are just annoying and irritating to the extent that they make the movie unpleasant to watch and erode much of its potential quality.

I can't accurately judge Brad Renfro as an actor because he's not given much to work with. Susan Sarandon is superb in everything she does but even her stellar performance can't add much charm to this film. Mary Louise Parker has given some great acting performances in her time but she is appallingly miscast in this film as Mark's mother. All the other acting is by and large forgettable This movie was painful to watch. Avoid it like the plague and read the book instead.".

A young boy and his even younger brother slip off from school to indulge in youthful frivolities and end up as witnesses to a Mob lawyer's suicide. The legal authorities are able to place the youth at the scene of the death and they suspect the lawyer may have revealed some evidence about a murder that has gone unsolved. The mobsters in the city suspect this too and the boy is caught between a rock and a hard place wondering where to go to get help and to stay ahead of the criminal elements stalking him and his family.Enter in the scene of total chaos two folks who are attempting to help the boy with his problem. Susan Sarandon has the role of a lawyer willing to risk her career for Ricky the youth and Tommy Lee Jones plays an ambitious federal prosecutor anxious to use Ricky's testimony to further his own career. Susan's character takes Ricky under her legal protective wing as it were and the two square off in an effort to make the young client Ricky turn evidence over to them. Ricky is determined to protect his family before doing anything to help the authorities.It's a superb suspense thriller based on the John Grisham novel of the same name and both Jones and Sarandon turn in great performances. The movie also benefits from support cast members such as Ossie Davis Anthony LaPaglia and as The Client Brad Renfro. Renfro shows some talent and one hopes that he hasn't wasted the chance to have a good career. I gave the film a rating of 810 and would encourage viewers to keep one eye on the screen at all times.".

Working in a plot that demands attention to and awareness of subtleties every actor on down to the smallest part puts forth flawless performances and are directed brilliantly.  If I was John Turturro I'd have calmed it down a little but if he did that he wouldn't be John Turturro. Isabella Rossellini is given the strongest role of her career I mean in Blue Velvet she was scorching and daring but she was played as a bit of an archetype and dream figure and not as a woman struggling through a life crisis in quite so identifiable a way.  Rather than fall prey to playing her role as an insensitive wife who doesn't understand the extraordinary passage her husband is undergoing she is given the chance to really be a hero in her own right.  She could never understandbut she tries toand gives extraordinary credibility in a role of struggling to give what she can as Jeff Bridges' Max Klein hurtles himself into his obsessive selfmade universe from his ordeal and survival.  When it's clear she can no longer do that she becomes a noble warrior to fight for her own sanity and that of her son.  The procession of her character is flawless and every moment feels right.The interplay between Rossellini and Rosie Perez is played out with unexpected honesty restraint and brilliance.  Perez' Carla has her own parallel situation with a husband who completely can't understand why she won't exploit the situation for all she can get in court a great early small performance from Benecio Del Torro.  He is like Rossellini troubled by the bizarre and nonobvious intimacy that has developed between his wife and Jeff Bridges two people whose lives might never have ordinarily crossed.  Perez is as has been mentioned elsewhere here devastating. Her grief over the loss of her son is sustained and utterly utterly credible.This brings us to Jeff Bridges.  Man oh man this is his career masterpiece performancearguably the greatest leading acting role of the 1990's.  He gets what writer Rafael Yglesias and Peter Weir are narrowly aiming for here and it's something no other movie has approached that I've seen. It isthe instantaneous and seemingly lifelong bond that develops between those who have been through a lifechanging crisis and how that can completely absorb them to the exclusion of everything else in their lives. What sounds like a subtle point here is nailed by Yglesias and Weir and I can't imagine another actor who could have gotten what that feels like.  I know from personal experiencemine was nothing like a plane crashbut the phenomenon that this movie ventures to explore that I just described which may seem like mostly bizarre behavior shifts in Bridges' character to those who haven't experienced what I'm talking aboutis in fact as real as love fear or passion itself.  What Bridges realizes in putting together Max Klein is that he's utterly lucidhe feels as though he sees things as clearly as he ever has in his life and never wants to let that clarity go to revert to a more rational way to confront the trauma he has gone through.Others have mentioned the why didn't this get bigger press issue.  The studio was quite nervous that this was an art house movie and didn't promote it as heavily as they might have.  It actually did quite well at the box office initially and early advocacy for Bridges and Weir to get Oscars were definitely out in the review stream but this had the misfortune of being released just before a little movie called Schindler's List which summarily grabbed the cinematic spotlight and completely eclipsed everything else at the Oscars.Director Peter Weir himself considers this his greatest work and was greatly stung by what he considered the slight it was given by Hollywood and the public.  In many ways it has shaped a cynicism towards Hollywood he has had ever since and it would be five years before he'd find it in himself to direct another film.".

The film was almost totally ignored by the Academy perhaps due to the fact that 1994 was the year of the historicalpolitical epic'Schindler's List' 'In the Name of the Father' and 'The Remains of the Day' were the big winners that year casting a bit of a shadow over a film about a rich white American suffering from PTSD.Based on the novel by Rafael Yglesias 'Fearless' is the story of Max Klein a successful San Francisco architect who survives a horrific plane crash. Among the casualties of the crash are Klein's partner and best friend and the only child of Carla Rosie Perez a young Puerto Rican woman from Oakland who blames herself for her son's death. Prior to the accident Max suffered from an acute fear of flying when the plane goes down his fear becomes so intense that he accepts death. When he survives the crash he suffers from a form of posttraumatic stress syndrome in which he can no longer feel fear because subconsciously he has already faced death. His condition creates a rift between himself and his family a gap he tries to fill through a friendship with Carla who is similarly afflicted with PTSD.Bridges gives a tour de force performance as Max who is simultaneously heroic he leads other passengers to safety believing he is guiding them out of the plane into heaven and contemptible he is unspeakably cruel to his family and leaves his wife temporarily to pursue a relationship with Carla.He's not sure whether he's alive or dead and he is frequently drawn to test his fear and uncertainty through ludicrously dangerous stunts like dancing on the edge of a skyscraper's roof or walking calmly into speeding traffic. It's an unflinching and emotionally honest portrayal of a psychologically damaged man unsure that he has the strength or will to be healed. Equally stunning is Rosie Perez as Carla a devout Catholic who believes that her baby's death is a punishment from God and is nursed back to normalcy by the agnostic Max. Other supporting actors are also captivating Isabella Rosselini as Max's wife Laura who loves her husband desperately but is unable to cope with Max's alienation from her and their son Jonah Tom Hulce as an overeager but wellmeaning attorney suing the airline on behalf of Max his partner's family and Carla John Turturro as a psychiatrist specializing in PTSD hired by the airline to help the survivors cope with the aftereffects of the tragedy and Benicio Del Toro as Carla's husband a poor carpenter who can't help but feel giddy about the possibility of making millions off of his son's death. Perhaps most moving is Deirdre O'Connell as the widow of Max's partnerthe scene in which Max arrives at her home to confirm that her husband did not survive the crash will break the hardest of hearts.The film is brilliantly directed by Weir who captures the surreal nature of Max's condition masterfully.'Fearless' is not an easy film to get through perhaps even moreso in the wake of 911. The subject matter is emotionally wrenching and its presentation is utterly unsentimental. Max is heroic but he is also a victim and Bridges' performance captures the tension between Max's newfound love of life and his nearpsychotic need to continually face and overcome his fears. It's a tearjerker and it's certainly haunted by the ghosts of the dead but it's wellworth watching if only for the pleasure of seeing one of the best actors in the business at his best.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard about Fearless for a long time and was never in the right mind to see it. It's the story about how survivors of a plane crash cope with life afterwards their neuroses fears and personal demons. It is a quiet film so quiet that one can barely hear the inner tremblings of the main character.He is a survivor without fear. He has summoned up a supernatural lack of fear towards life and psychological health now that he has survived a plane accident. In times of crisis he has the ability to block fear and to live on adrenalin alone. He has become in the eyes of the other plane passengers a hero and an inspiration.But even though this lack of fear is his saving grace it is also threatening to jeopardize his life. He copes with the nightmares and emotional traumas with  the same reaction that helped him along on that fateful day. But in real life this way to cope is unhealthy and even dangerous. One must live afraid to be a normal person. One must worry about finances and loss of love.The film is imperfect as any great film should be. There are slow moments and perhaps a little too much pop psychology. But the film is as subtle as it gets. There are marvelous character touches such as a lawyer trying to file a lawsuit who keeps apologizing for his greediness. The film exposes the genuine dilemmas of trying to compensate victims and their families.Perhaps the most amazing scene is a reenactment of the plane crash itself. I won't give anything away about the story but the scene is hauntingly beautiful it shows the overwhelming force of the wind and the earth ripping apart the fusilade and all the parts of the luggage and cabin that humans normally deal with. It is a violent horrifying scene and a horrifying memory but for the main character he can imagine it with the appropriate distance and  without the pain. This accident was the defining moment for his life and after that scene we realize how amazing it is that he and the rest of them could have survived and how fragile their life was in the face of overwhelming force.This story imagines a disaster and how useless it is to be afraid of a force more powerful than any individual and that is the main character's profound insight.".

	schema:reviewBody "The inability to reconnect' in the wake of a significant emotional event especially one involving a close encounter with death is examined by director Peter Weir in Fearless' a gripping drama starring Jeff Bridges as a man emotionally adrift after walking away from an accident a plane crash that by all rights should have killed him but inexplicably did not. And Weir goes on to take what is essentially a character study one step further beyond the inevitable why me?' that one who survives such an unimaginable episode in their life must necessarily make to probe the psyche of the survivor and attempt to sort out the ensuing catch22 of the mind wherein the incident has manifested a schizophrenic sense of guilteuphoria born of fate's decree that he among those now dead should live.  It's a lot to assimilate a taxing physical and psychological challenge necessitating an expanded utilization of the human capacity and the subsequent negotiation of the attendant recast attitude and aptitude. All of which Weir succinctly captures through keen observation and his own intuitive grasp of the human condition.As the film opens we see Max Klein Bridges making his way through a cornfield just outside of Bakersfield California he's carrying a baby in his arms and has a young boy by the hand leading him determinedly through the haze of smoke from the crash.  There are others following Max as well. And even before they emerge from the field coming upon the crash site where rescue workers are already furiously attempting to sort it all out there is a detachment about Max that is readily discernible.  He surveys the situation calmly as if seeing it all through the eyes of someone else as if he were outside of himself observing rather than experiencing.  Then after locating the baby's mother he simply walks away from it all never looking back.Two days later the F.B.I. finds him in a local motel.  They put him together with a representative from the airline who offers him a train ticket back home to San Francisco.  But Max wants to fly home which astounds the rep. But your wife' she says Told us that you didn't like to fly even before the'  The crash?' he replies.  Then with assurance he tells her I want to fly home on your airline.  But I have a request I want to go first class.'  And we know now without question that Max is not the same man that he was before the crash. In his previous films such as Picnic At Hanging Rock' 1975 Witness' 1985 and The Mosquito Coast' 1986 Weir established himself as a director who knows human nature and is adept at exploring the emotional depths of his characters in stories dealing with ordinary people thrust into extraordinary situations.  As he does with this film Weir sets a deliberate pace and allows that extra moment that means so much to the development of the characters.  It's a subtle approach that adds depth and resonance to his films and allows his audience to experience rather than just watch the drama as it unfolds.  And he understands as few directors do especially Americans  the impact that silence' can have as in the scenes here shortly after Max leaves the crash sight.  First Weir shows us a solemn Max driving alone through the desert at high speed gradually awakening to the joys of living to that feeling' of being alive as he sticks his head out of the widow and lets the wind hit him in the face slapping him with the reality that he is indeed alive.  But then we see Max parked by the side of the road sitting on the ground pensively staring out at the vast expanse of desert and at the low blue mountains in the distance.  The absolute silence Weir effects allows us to share Max's thoughts at that moment to get inside his head as he picks up a bit of dirt and examines it closely then as he looks up again at the nothingnesseverything that surrounds him.  As Max reflects we reflect with him and in that precise moment that necessary connection between Max and the audience is firmly established.  It's a quiet and brilliant piece of filmmaking.Through many years and many movies Jeff Bridges has demonstrated time and again his consummate ability as an actor who can touch' his audience and he continues to evolve with every new film.  Max is perhaps his most challenging role ever as it requires a vast emotional range to make this character convincing and bring him to life believably.  And Bridges succeeds magnificently and on a number of levels with an inspiring Oscar worthy performance.  The finesse with which he conveys his moods and emotions is extraordinary he enables you to feel' his displacement share his compassion sense his empathy and know his anger.  Quite simply Bridges makes Max Klein a character you are not going to forget.As Laura Klein Isabella Rossellini gives a remarkable performance as well as the wife given the gift of her husband's life only to have to suffer his state of limbo' as she desperately attempts to penetrate the defense mechanisms that have given him a renewed appreciation for the touch taste and beauty of life all of which she is unable to share because his experience has taken him to a place she cannot possibly go.  Her portrayal is astute convincing and some of the best work she has ever done.Also turning in a strong performance for which she deservedly was nominated for Best Supporting Actress is Rosie Perez as Carla a fellow crash survivor with whom Max forms an especially strong and significant bond.Written for the screen by Rafael Yglesias adapted from his own novel beautifully filmed by Allen Davian and with a haunting score by Maurice Jarre that so sensitively enhances the drama in an understated way Fearless' is an example of filmmaking at it's best.".

I have never seen a story like it. Every scene in the film felt natural and real. The psychological thrulines were utterly believable and no moment was over played or exploited. Every scene played as the most logical event based on the actions that came before it.The characters down to the smallest bit parts were real and sympathetic. There were no good guys and bad guys. Each character even the lawyer had depth multiple dimensions and valid reasons for their behavior. This was not the shallow Hollywood blockbuster designed to bring in the biggest box office possible. It was a thoughtful often painful and sometimes exhilarating examination of normal people reacting to the most extreme of circumstances.One technical note. The soundtrack on my disc was very muddy. I had to turn the sound up much higher than I usually do and yet there were still some lines of dialog that I could not make out.

	schema:headline " One of the few films that in the end brought on a fullfledged catharsis";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw Fearless in a movie theater I believe there were about 20 to 30 other moviegoers in the theater on a weekday afternoon. It was in it's second week in theaters. After the credits rolled I heard a lot of weeping from the small but vocal audience.Maybe the film flopped because some people expected a 1970'sstyle disaster flick with cardboard characters laughable dialog and unknown extras  doubles performing dangerous stunts.It's been almost eight years since watching Fearless for the first time. This is one of only 5 movies I actually own in my very small tape library.Director Peter Weir amazes me. With a few exceptions I didn't like Dead Poets Society and I haven't seen Green Card he has always walked on a tightrope when it comes to telling a story. It might not result in a satisfying ending but when you think about what was presented two hours earlier it makes a lot of sense. It's a logical and very fascinating progression.I believe that Jeff Bridges can almost do no wrong. His character may not be very likable but put yourself in his character's shoes and you may understand the reasons why he believes that he is fearless.I haven't seen Isabella Rossellini's performance in Blue Velvet but it makes me wonder if her performance in that film beats her role as the caring but very confused wife of Jeff Bridges' character. She's definitely the heart of Fearless. I cared for her. I felt empathy her confusion of what her husband was doing to himself her family and herself. She's on the outside trying her best to understand what it was like to survive a plane crash. But at the same time not totally understanding what it was like to be on the illfated flight. Rossellini gave a glowing performance.Rosie Perez's performance as the distraught woman who lost her young son in the crash was incredible. Unlike some people in this world I do like Perez thick Spanish accent and all. What really impressed me was how she captured the depth of losing her child. There have been some films  TV movies that have captured the effects of a family losing a spouse or adult child. There haven't been as many to deal with the loss of a child as well as Fearless did. Perez hasn't had a role with this much depth in a long time. I was pleasantly surprised when she received an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actress the movie's only nomination.The unrequited bond between Bridges' and Perez's characters was fascinating to watch. They survived something that their love ones will never understand. In the end the two need to understand that despite their losses they are still alive in this world and somehow they need to find a way to get back to reality.Screenwriter Rafael Yglesias who wrote the novel captured the complexity of crash survivors almost flawlessly. One weak link John Turturro had the thankless job of playing the underwritten role of the psychiatrist.When a film like Fearless even inspires a music video Brian McKnight's Back At One then you know that this movie will have a lasting effect and with cable VHS  DVD it'll never be forgotten. I certainly haven't forgotten it.".

	onyx:emotionText "When I first saw Fearless in a movie theater I believe there were about 20 to 30 other moviegoers in the theater on a weekday afternoon. It was in it's second week in theaters. After the credits rolled I heard a lot of weeping from the small but vocal audience.Maybe the film flopped because some people expected a 1970'sstyle disaster flick with cardboard characters laughable dialog and unknown extras  doubles performing dangerous stunts.It's been almost eight years since watching Fearless for the first time. This is one of only 5 movies I actually own in my very small tape library.Director Peter Weir amazes me. With a few exceptions I didn't like Dead Poets Society and I haven't seen Green Card he has always walked on a tightrope when it comes to telling a story. It might not result in a satisfying ending but when you think about what was presented two hours earlier it makes a lot of sense. It's a logical and very fascinating progression.I believe that Jeff Bridges can almost do no wrong. His character may not be very likable but put yourself in his character's shoes and you may understand the reasons why he believes that he is fearless.I haven't seen Isabella Rossellini's performance in Blue Velvet but it makes me wonder if her performance in that film beats her role as the caring but very confused wife of Jeff Bridges' character. She's definitely the heart of Fearless. I cared for her. I felt empathy her confusion of what her husband was doing to himself her family and herself. She's on the outside trying her best to understand what it was like to survive a plane crash. But at the same time not totally understanding what it was like to be on the illfated flight. Rossellini gave a glowing performance.Rosie Perez's performance as the distraught woman who lost her young son in the crash was incredible. Unlike some people in this world I do like Perez thick Spanish accent and all. What really impressed me was how she captured the depth of losing her child. There have been some films  TV movies that have captured the effects of a family losing a spouse or adult child. There haven't been as many to deal with the loss of a child as well as Fearless did. Perez hasn't had a role with this much depth in a long time. I was pleasantly surprised when she received an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actress the movie's only nomination.The unrequited bond between Bridges' and Perez's characters was fascinating to watch. They survived something that their love ones will never understand. In the end the two need to understand that despite their losses they are still alive in this world and somehow they need to find a way to get back to reality.Screenwriter Rafael Yglesias who wrote the novel captured the complexity of crash survivors almost flawlessly. One weak link John Turturro had the thankless job of playing the underwritten role of the psychiatrist.When a film like Fearless even inspires a music video Brian McKnight's Back At One then you know that this movie will have a lasting effect and with cable VHS  DVD it'll never be forgotten. I certainly haven't forgotten it.";

	schema:reviewBody "None of us can view a movie objectively apart from the sum of who we are.  Having a classical music background I am always keyed into a film's use of music.  Fearless reminds me that the combination of music and film is an art form which has been sadly neglected in modern culture and trashed by MTV. This movie is high art.  The final sequence is emotionally and spiritually a transcending experience illustrating the bittersweet reality of human existence.  An experience not available through words music or images on their own.  I cried like a baby. Movies tend to be built upon a setup and a payoff.  Tension and release are the common currency for most art.  I have never seen a better cinematic payoff than the one Fearless provides.  And that's because the setup is flawless.  There is endless brilliance here in the telling of the story. Don't miss the use of light.  Light flashing across Max's face when death is at the door in the plane and the car scene with Carla.If possible Fearless might have been even more effective in black and white.  The subtle transition to slow motion during the scene with Carla and the baby at the mall. Jeff Bridges is irresistible in this performance.  His character has been translated out of the realm of corporeal perspective.As demonstrated through his allergy to strawberries.  When he walks through the plane and assures the passengers that everything will be fine I believed him.  His appearance is almost a religious experience.  But his serenity cannot last. He must be reborn into the frailties of human existence or he will be estranged from the world.  And that is the payoff.  The glorious payoff in which death in an airplane crash becomes a poetic vision of the human experience.  We live we die but we imbue the universe with a greater purpose even if there is no god to acknowledge it. I hope history will judge this movie to be a classic unappreciated in it's time.  This is Peter Weir's masterpiece.  It's hard for me to believe that he could follow this effort with the extremely banal and uninspiring Truman Show  But I suppose even Mozart had off days.".

Fear is so much more difficult to overpower or even sometimes be conscious of than reason that when we do overpower fear it is not necessarily replaced by reason but by exhilarating mania.

He enters an enhanced perceptive condition believing he is dead beginning to rethink life death God and the afterlife.Bridges becomes addicted to walking a tightrope over death because it makes him feel as alive and enlightened as he possibly can. But this also dwindles his connection to his family and his life. He begins to have difficulty recognizing the limits of mortality in some way perceiving himself as more than mere flesh and blood. Rosie Perez however in a performance equaling Bridges' in personal reconciliation with her role plays another survivor whose baby son she failed to protect from death by the crash. In her own aftermath she is the unmistakable foil to Bridges' expansive superman complex as a mother who loses all will to live.The two find themselves bonding sharing a connection that transcends the love we tend to understand or that Isabella Rossellini as Bridges' wife and Benicio Del Toro as Perez's husband tend to understand. And as Bridges begins to reach the dangerous peak of his high on existence Perez is forced to make amends with the world taking control of shaping herself. The film is a boundless interpretation of an allencompassingly utilitarian philosophy a kind of precept that amalgamates the black and white duality of unflappable idealism and hopeless despair.There are peripheral nebbishy professionals played in bit parts by a gregarious Tom Hulce and John Turturro who has as a virtually futile psychologistforhire a sort of ironic missionary zeal. We hear Gorecki's beautiful major string orchestra sound.

Fearless 1993 is such a film. I hope someday there will be a DVD package worthy of such a courageous and moving experience. Assuming the brilliance of all involved especially Peter Weir director Rafael Yglesisas Writer and all of the actors this profound viewing experience changed how I look at life. One very perceptive friend described the plot as a journey from not dead to alive. Max Klein Jeff Bridges makes such a journey but not alone even if he thinks to the contrary. This is also one of the best depictions of marriage on screen. The scenes between Bridges and Isabella Rosselini really crackle with emotion and intensity. It's rare to see a marital conflict where you can sympathize and even empathize with both characters. That is a tribute to Isabella and the writingdirecting. Also successful though not as universal is the strange relationship between Max and Carla Rosie Perez. Nice atypical work from John Turturro Benecio Del Toro and Tom Hulce provides some muchneeded humor.Also this film avoids dwelling on the simple psychological clichs of PTSD and survivor guilt. Instead of talking about it the viewer sees feels and experiences it. This is a rare gem of film history and one of the most overlooked movies in history. Here's hoping that changes soon.".

Jeff Bridges is always worth watching though his acting is so subtle and natural that I always forget I'm watching him and that he's acting. But Rosie Perez's performance is a real standout she should have won the Oscar she was nominated for.

Why on earth did the Motion Picture Academy give the film and its' amazing director Peter Weir so little recognition? I suppose Schindlers' List was the on voters' minds that yearrightfully so it too is a masterpiece and Tom Hanks' fine performance in Philadelphia was most certainly appreciated by the actor community to help the world understand what was happening right under their noses we need to fight AIDS and stop denying the humanity of those who suffer from it. But I read an earlier comment on Fearless from someone who felt this movie portrayed loss grief and fear better than any gay or AIDStheme movie ever. This blows me away because Tom Hanks received an Oscar for playing a gay man dying of AIDS yet Jeff Bridges wasn't even nominated for his completely amazing portrayal of a crash survivor Rosie Perez was the only actor from this movie to receive an Oscar nomination she too was brilliant. The last scene in the movie had me sobbing unbelievably and I've seen it twice before. The story the characters the music and the locations are all woven together by Mr Weir into the most beautiful comprehensive depiction of what it means to live breathe and feel that I have ever seen.".

The book is 3 times much better than the movie and the movie itself was wonderful.  Peter Weir has always managed to make movies that make people in general Think. Remember Dead Poets Society Truman Show?  This movie is no different. It tells a lot about immortality and how fragile life can be and how people react differently to traumatic situations.  With what's happened in the last few months this movie hits that much closer to home.  A truly epic classic.".

Peter Weirs films have a way of communicating intense emotion to me although not all are quite so good I watched all of the disappointing Dead Poets society and only felt this emotion in one scene where the boy commits suicide. A powerful scene. In 'picnic at hanging rock' I felt this intense emotion a few times especially with that shot of the girls disappearing.I had wanted to see Fearless for a number of years and was not disappointed. I have never seen a film in my life that affected me so much. But hey you might watch this and feel nothing. It is about human emotion about the meaning of life and our mortality. If you care about these then I would guess this film would say something to you.If you feel like an outsider like an alien drifting amongst strangers this is the film for you. If you dream of enlightenment take pleasure in the simple intensity of the moment this is the film for you also. IMHO is not just Peter Weirs greatest film I feel it is one of the greatest films I have seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "From Peter Weir comes a truly wonderful film that is intense and harrowing beautiful and heart rending. It does drag in the middle half and John Turturo's part is underwritten but this is a remarkable film. The crash scenes are certainly very harrowing but it is in the performances music score and direction that Fearless really soars. The script is surprisingly intelligent the story and its themes is compelling and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Fearless is brilliantly directed as is usually the case with Weir and the score is one of the most haunting and emotional scores I have ever heard in a film and I have heard a lot of them. The performances though are pretty much outstanding bringing to life complex characters. Jeff Bridges is in my opinion a very underrated actor and certainly a talented one. Here he gives one of his best performances as a man who is thrilled by the fact that he survived death and is convinced he is immortal. Isabella Rossellini is also remarkable as the loving wife and Tom Hulce is fine as the well meaning attorney. And despite his underwritten role John Turturo does what he can. But for me the best performance came from Rosie Perez she was truly captivating and absolutely believable as the mother who lost her young child and now completely overwhelmed by guilt and pain. Fearless isn't a very easy film to get into first time it is emotionally heart wrenching and I think ambitious as well the ending is proof of that. Overall a wonderful film minor flaws abundant but a film that deserves more recognition. 910 Bethany Cox".

As a psychotherapist I feel the portrait of posttraumatic stress disorder is very accurate but the film is much more than a film about psychopathology. Most of all the film speaks of humanity's confrontation with mortality and finitude and the courage to be fully human in the face of tragedy and death. Jeff Bridges is excellent in a role that is very challenging and he manages to hit all the right notes. Hands down this is Rose Perez' best role right up there with Do the Right Thing. I also think this is Peter Weir's finest moment which is saying quite a bit given that he's directed such wonderful films as Gallipoli Picnic at Hanging Rock Dead Poet's Society and Witness okay nevermind Truman. The film is beautifully shot and edited the score is perfect and the pacing is just right. Like others who have commented on this film I was deeply movedin fact to tearstears of joy.

It stars Audie Murphy Barry Sullivan Venetia Stevenson John McIntire and Kenneth Tobey. A UIP production in Eastman Color with music scored by William Lava  Irving Gertz Joseph Gershenson supervising and cinematography by Ellis Carter. Plot finds Murphy as Seven Ways from Sundown a Texas Ranger who tracks and captures notorious outlaw Jim Flood Sullivan. As the two men make their way back to Texas a bond begins to form...It's another Audie Murphy Western that rarely gets a mention when the talk turns to Murphy's best Oaters. On this occasion though it's not because it is operating suspiciously at the low end of the B Western scale or that it is boorish in the formula department this is actually a case of it being under seen by the last couple of generations of Western fans. A shame because it has much to recommend.Film basically centres around the two initial polar opposite characters finding a mutual respect as they traverse the dusty land back to Texas. Along the way they encounter problems Apache attack bounty hunters et al but they play cards they fight with both men getting ample opportunities to either escape or wound but mostly they talk. Wonderful dialogue driven chat from the Huffaker Rio ConchosThe Commancheros pen. This isn't in the same league as the psychological smarts laden 310 to Yuma chatter between Heflin and Ford no sir but it's well scripted and boosted considerably by the chemistry between Murphy and Sullivan.It's an odd couple physically especially in the early parts as Seven has Greenhorn traits to overcome but the guy's odd friendship does become believable. When Seven says late in the day that there's no man he trusts more than Flood we understand why because Keller Day of the Bad ManQuantez and Huffaker have done great work in bringing the characters and actors to life. There's extra spice in the beans too with knowledge given to us of what Flood has done with his guns and what Seven is irked by in his past he has a calling but is it a burden?There's enough action in here to please the undemanding Western fan with gun play fist throws and show downs look out for a nice stunt leap off of a wagon while there's the odd smattering of heroism such as Audie saving a dog from a bird of prey! A potential romance angle no not between the men is very low key and not a hindrance McIntire and Tobey impact nicely with their respective performances and Nevada's Red Rock Canyon forms a magnificent back drop bravo Ellis Carter. But this is all about Murphy and Sullivan and the care and consideration afforded them by Messrs Keller and Huffaker. Far from perfect for sure anyone will find holes in this sort of production but forgiveness is not hard to come by when it plays out so damn well. Hey! The ending is a real beaut as well. 810Footnote I viewed the film from British TV Dave Channel. A lovely print that only makes me lament there's no widespread DVD release for this film. There is a very expensive Region 2 French DVD available from certain outlets the quality of which I can't vouch for.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like many B westerns this opens with a bang introducing the villain Jim Flood by showing him gunning down a handful of people and setting fire to the saloon before fleeing. The next day the townsfolk aren't impressed when rookie Texas Ranger Seven Jones turns up... wondering where the law was when they actually needed it. He then continues on to his first posting and is soon out tracking Flood along with experienced ranger Sgt. Henessey. As they track Flood it becomes clear that he is popular with the people in many towns he goes through. As they ride through the New Mexico desert Flood shoots and kills Henessey leaving Jones to hunt him alone.Surprisingly Jones manages to catch him relatively easily that is only half the task though he must now get him back to Texas. Flood is determined not to go back and there are several other dangers to worry about including local bounty hunters Apaches and the brother of the men Flood killed in the opening.This was a fairly typical Audie Murphy western if you are a fan of his work you are sure to enjoy it if you aren't you probably won't. Personally I think Murphy does a great job in this sort of film his character isn't overly macho but it doesn't seem unbelievable when he prevails over an apparently superior foe. Barry Sullivan made a fine villain rather than being an obviously bad man he is actually quite a charmer this made a nice change. There is enough action mostly just shootouts though so no spectacular horsework. The scenery looks great with Utah filling in for the New Mexico desert. As for the title... Jones' full name is 'Seven Ways from Sundown Jones he is the seventh child and his siblings were similarly named although we only learn the names of One and Two!".

	schema:reviewBody "Just caught a couple Audie Murphy Westerns back to back that were pretty cool this one and Posse From Hell both of which I rank in the upper tier of Murphy's pictures. Backing him up in this film are a couple of TV Western stalwarts John McIntire from 'Wagon Train' and 'The Tall Man' Barry Sullivan. There's something interesting about TV good guys taking on bad guy roles and Sullivan's portrayal of Jim Flood in this story is that of an affable outlaw with a unique brand of personal integrity. I thought he did a pretty good job.It's interesting too that Seven Jones Murphy never does find out the details behind the murder of his brother 'Two' all of that becomes known to the viewer but the hero is never let in on the secret. I won't give it away you'll just have to catch the picture but it's one of those things that wind up rare in movie Westerns.As for 'Seven's' name I wound up thinking about that for a while and came to the conclusion that it was a colorful way of Jones's father to come up with his boys' names. Maybe it was a little lazy but it certainly was a lot better than boxer George Foreman naming all of his six sons George distinguished only as Jr. III IV V and VI. I don't believe they ever had descriptives attached to their names like 'Two for the Money' or 'Seven Ways From Sundown' so being born into that Jones family must have been pretty unique. Still a little confusing though.Say how about that under the table Han Sololike shot by Jones against one of the bounty hunters coming after Flood in that saloon scene almost two full decades before Star Wars came around? It looked pretty novel when I first saw the space fantasy but I've seen the move more than once now in movie Westerns so I guess you'd have to say George Lucas borrowed the idea when he wrote the scene. I think it comes off more surprising in Star Wars in a Western you almost expect it.Well it's too bad it had to come to that kind of an ending for Jim Flood. He was actually a pretty decent guy for an outlaw and we never did come to learn why he was such a bad guy except for the cryptic reference I made earlier. You come away from the picture believing he let Jones get away with outdrawing him a fatal career move that one only gets to make once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seven Ways from Sundown producer Gordon Kay began his career as an associate producer bank rolling westerns in the late 1940s with Allen Lane as the cowboy champion. Indeed Kay spent the bulk of his career producing sagebrushers with occasional forays into social drama Voice in the Mirror the Esther Williams vehicle An Unguarded Moment the George Nader suspense thriller Man Afraid .the Tony Randall animal comedy about a lion Fluffy and a World War II combat saga The Young Warriors with Virginian James Drury. Seven Ways from Sundown was the second of seven sagas that Kay produced with Audie Murphy riding tall in the saddle. You can spot the usual Universal Pictures back lot sets. Interesting enough Seven Ways from Sundown used the same Ranger headquarters set that the television western Laredo about Texas Rangers used for its two season run. The scenic Alabama Hills look majestic in the sprawling outdoors scenes with the principals riding through them. Veteran western novelist Clair Huffaker of The War Wagon adapted his own novel for the screen with Fort Dodge Stampede director Harry Keller who helmed six of Murphy's sagebrushers calling the shots. No Seven Ways from Sundown isn't half as good as The War Wagon. Meanwhile Keller collaborated on eight films with producer Gordon Kay. He helmed Covered Wagon Raid Man Afraid Voice in the Mirror The Unguarded Moment Six Black Horses Day of the Badman Quantez and Seven Ways to Sundown. This formulaic 80minute horse opera about a heroic young man and an older villainous gent makes for an amiable easygoing but mildly entertaining western. Former World War 2 hero Murphy is adequately cast as the wetbacktheears Texas Ranger protagonist while Barry Sullivan has a field day as his charismatic quarry. In many ways Keller and Huffaker look like they must have seen those memorable Randolph Scott westerns that Bud Boetticher directed and Burt Kennedy wrote where the villains were so charming that they emerges as sympathetic. Initially triggerhappy hellion Jim Flood Barry Sullivan of NBCTV's The Tall Men is shown killing for four wellarmed hombres and burning down a saloon. Our hero Seven Ways Audie Murphy of To Hell and Back rides onto the scene the day after the conflagration armed only with a Winchester repeating rifle. It seems that he has only recently signed up with the Rangers. The irate citizens are prepared to lynch him for turning up so late in the game so he skedaddles before they can lay hands on him. In the town of Buckley Texas Ranger Lieutenant Herly Kenneth Tobey of The Thing from Another World orders Sergeant Henessey John McIntire of Backlash to take the kid along with him to capture Flood. Henessey argues that Herly should send more men after Flood. It turns out that Henessey knows a lot about the elusive Flood. He knows enough about the outlaw to not trust anything that any of Flood's friends or acquaintances tells him about the gunman. As they embark on their search for Flood Henessey has to wetnurse Seven because the young man doesn't know squat about handling a sixgun but he is a crack shot with his Winchester. Eventually Seven gets pretty adept with his Colt's revolver and proves himself in later scenes when he is forced to intervene in predicaments.Things take a dramatic turn for the worst when the cunning Flood bushwhacks Henessey on the trail and the older Ranger who had served as a mentor for Seven Ways dies. Seven refuses to heed Hennessey's advice to forget about Flood and ride back to Texas. Our tenacious young hero catches up with Flood wounds him with a lucky shot and takes him captive. The two men form a relationship vaguely reminiscent of that between Seven and Henessey. Keller and Huffaker never let us forget about the treacherous of Ranger Lieutenant Herly whose cowardice prompted the death of Two for the Money Jones one of Seven's older brothers. The cast is sturdy and the dialogue is memorable though the storyline remains a mite formulaic. Our hero is given a love interest but the action sidetracks this affair for the search for Flood. Seven Ways to Sundown is the kind of oater where the hero and the villain bond but in the long run they have to turn on each other for one to survive. The Italians would take this dramatic situation and work it out in some instances particularly in Sergio Corbucci's westerns where the hero and villain would reconcile their differences and emerge as friends.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have sometimes written in some reviews about some Claude Chabrol's flicks that I didn't find Poulet Au Vinaigre a memorable work. However I watched it recently and it's not that bad after all. Of course it is several notches below such incomparable works as La Femme Infidle 1969 or Le Boucher 1970 but it remains thoroughly watchable. Congratulations to the English film distributors who found an equivalent for the translation of the French title into English. It is perfectly well translated.When in 1984 Chabrol starts the preparation of this Poulet Au Vinaigre he endured three fiasco in a row. The eighties didn't look a fruitful decade for him. Le Cheval D'Orgeuil 1980 got bogged down in a spate of clichs about Brittany and betrayed PierreJakey Hlias' book. Les Fantmes Du Chapelier 1982 his first venture in Georges Simenon's universe was well received by French critics but hardly anybody went to see it. Le Sang Des Autres 1984 was a turgid and impersonal film in his spotty but riveting career.So what could Chabrol do to get things back on an even keel and to be reconciled with both critics and his public? Very simply to cook them a typical Chabrolesque dish to the core with a minimum of money the filmmaker wanted to show that it was possible to shoot good films with a modest budget in times of inflation and time a few weeks of shooting were sufficient for him to shoot his film. Thus he kept turning over the staple ingredients which made his hallmark recognizable. He needed the apparently peaceful scenery of a small provincial town. Here he chose ForgesLes Eaux in Normandy which isn't very far from I live in Rouen! The perfect backdrop for his story. Then precisely a solidly structured story with several functions. First to grab and entertain the audience and his fans with a certainly derivative but catchy storytelling. Louis Cuno is a timid postman who lives under her mother's thumb Stphane Audran. They refuse to sell their house to a trio of perfidious perverse bourgeois the doctor Morasseau the butcher Filiol and the notary Lavoisier Michel Bouquet who want to set up a momentous and shady estate business. As he is a postman Louis gets information about this trio of upperclass people At night Louis spies them and one night he kills the butcher by pouring sugar in the essence of his car and the maverick inspector Lavardin Jean Poiret keeps on harassing him... Then Delphine Morasseau the doctor's wife seems to have absconded while Anna Foscarie Caroline Cellier a prostitute is found dead in a car crash. With his unconventional methods Lavardin will find the truth...It is at this reading that we fully understand Chabrol's mainspring for the last function of his scenario and perhaps the most essential ingredient to unearth skeletons in the closet of his trio of bourgeois and to shatter the respectability of the provincial bourgeoisie which has usually been Chabrol's trademark. He tapped it again with gusto here. But his scenario also encompasses a dash of psychology to better construe the persona of his characters and it gives more substance to his work.Chabrol served his film and his recipe with ingenious camera work too. It encompasses neat camera angles and fluid camera movements which can only rejoice the gourmets. To enable them to fully savor the film Chabrol shot his story on an unhurried pace. There was also effort on the lighting and framing which are up to scratch to the aura the film conveys according to the circumstances. And the director didn't put aside his pronounced taste for gastronomy. The inspector Lavardin is nutty about paprika eggs. He has eaten 30000 of them in his life! At last the chef Chabrol spiced up his work with a soupon of deadpan humor essentially provided by the apparently nice Lavardin. By the way is it innocuous humor? One has to admit that Lavardin's methods to make the suspects speak aren't really reassuring.Maybe the cast contains a few little drawbacks. Lucas Belvaux is not bad but often bland. Pauline Laffont's acting is sometimes annoying. Jean Claude Bouillaud acts a caricatured character. But Stphane Audran once Mrs Chabrol is excellent as usual. Like in la Rupture 1970 she was Michel Bouquet's enemy. This is precisely Bouquet who dominates the cast at the level of the quality of the acting with of course Jean Poiret.In the end the chef Chabrol concocted the audience and his fans an eatable even tasty Poulet Au Vinaigre which pleased a lot to the chef's connoisseurs. It was succulent enough to prompt Chabrol to do it again with a sequel which opened the next year Inspecteur Lavardin 1986. That said Chabrol's pice De resistance in the eighties came with the contemporary Masques 1987 which stood the test of time quite well.".

Le Cheval D'Orgeuil 1980 got bogged down in a spate of clichs about Brittany and betrayed PierreJakey Hlias' book. Les Fantmes Du Chapelier 1982 his first venture in Georges Simenon's universe was well received by French critics but hardly anybody went to see it. Le Sang Des Autres 1984 was a turgid and impersonal film in his spotty but riveting career.So what could Chabrol do to get things back on an even keel and to be reconciled with both critics and his public? Very simply to cook them a typical Chabrolesque dish to the core with a minimum of money the filmmaker wanted to show that it was possible to shoot good films with a modest budget in times of inflation and time a few weeks of shooting were sufficient for him to shoot his film. Thus he kept turning over the staple ingredients which made his hallmark recognizable. He needed the apparently peaceful scenery of a small provincial town. Here he chose ForgesLes Eaux in Normandy which isn't very far from I live in Rouen! The perfect backdrop for his story. Then precisely a solidly structured story with several functions. First to grab and entertain the audience and his fans with a certainly derivative but catchy storytelling. Louis Cuno is a timid postman who lives under her mother's thumb Stphane Audran. They refuse to sell their house to a trio of perfidious perverse bourgeois the doctor Morasseau the butcher Filiol and the notary Lavoisier Michel Bouquet who want to set up a momentous and shady estate business. As he is a postman Louis gets information about this trio of upperclass people At night Louis spies them and one night he kills the butcher by pouring sugar in the essence of his car and the maverick inspector Lavardin Jean Poiret keeps on harassing him... Then Delphine Morasseau the doctor's wife seems to have absconded while Anna Foscarie Caroline Cellier a prostitute is found dead in a car crash. With his unconventional methods Lavardin will find the truth...It is at this reading that we fully understand Chabrol's mainspring for the last function of his scenario and perhaps the most essential ingredient to unearth skeletons in the closet of his trio of bourgeois and to shatter the respectability of the provincial bourgeoisie which has usually been Chabrol's trademark. He tapped it again with gusto here. But his scenario also encompasses a dash of psychology to better construe the persona of his characters and it gives more substance to his work.Chabrol served his film and his recipe with ingenious camera work too. It encompasses neat camera angles and fluid camera movements which can only rejoice the gourmets. To enable them to fully savor the film Chabrol shot his story on an unhurried pace. There was also effort on the lighting and framing which are up to scratch to the aura the film conveys according to the circumstances. And the director didn't put aside his pronounced taste for gastronomy. The inspector Lavardin is nutty about paprika eggs. He has eaten 30000 of them in his life! At last the chef Chabrol spiced up his work with a soupon of deadpan humor essentially provided by the apparently nice Lavardin. By the way is it innocuous humor? One has to admit that Lavardin's methods to make the suspects speak aren't really reassuring.Maybe the cast contains a few little drawbacks. Lucas Belvaux is not bad but often bland. Pauline Laffont's acting is sometimes annoying. Jean Claude Bouillaud acts a caricatured character. But Stphane Audran once Mrs Chabrol is excellent as usual. Like in la Rupture 1970 she was Michel Bouquet's enemy. This is precisely Bouquet who dominates the cast at the level of the quality of the acting with of course Jean Poiret.In the end the chef Chabrol concocted the audience and his fans an eatable even tasty Poulet Au Vinaigre which pleased a lot to the chef's connoisseurs. It was succulent enough to prompt Chabrol to do it again with a sequel which opened the next year Inspecteur Lavardin 1986. That said Chabrol's pice De resistance in the eighties came with the contemporary Masques 1987 which stood the test of time quite well.";

	schema:reviewBody "It is true that Chabrol loosened his grip after 'Les Innocents Aux Mains Sales' possibly horrified by his own insights.  This is probably a shame but the light comic mysteries and thrillers he has largely produced since are by no means negligible always entertaining and full of Chabrolian irony and motifs.  In this film believe  it or not he seems to believe in the God of marriage.  Normally that venerable institution is the site in Chabrol of repression a usually literal stifling of humanity a closed rigid world not too far from hell.  With the relaxing of his style comes a relaxing of his world view.  As ever with Chabrol a young man is being emotionally strangled by his mother's dependence her emotional paralysis somewhat unsubtly figured in her being crippled.  Although the title punningly refers to the detective and the film is nominally a mystery story Chabrol seems more interested in his ritesofpassage narrative   the detective doesn't make his first appearance for forty minutes and doesn't dominate the movie until the last third.  It would be wrong to claim that this is Chabrol in 'realistic' mode but he certainly gets a sense of a rural town community its unexpected connections the malicious schemes of its most respectable citizens pure soap opera maybe but the idea of a society turning in on itself almost incestuously is convincing.  Louis Cuno is the unexpected centre of the town's secrets a sullen gangly lovestruck teenager but as postman he connects as noone else can betraying his civic trust as he takes home to his mother incriminating letters to peruse as a defence against plans to demolish their property destroy their home.  Chabrol usually deals with the threat to the home from within the extending of focus here leads to a more relaxed film.  Because the film focuses of Louis whose not always legal actions are treated indulgently by director and detective alike the other characters are more shadowy more like caricatures minimising the mystery making its potentially horrifying conclusions somewhat perfunctory.  Chabrol doesn't let his hero off too easily as we suspect Louis is exchanging one mother for another his initiation into the delights of sex is in the grounds of a country house a typically Chabrolian green space blighted by the surveilling eyes of the detective.Spying is one of the main themes of the film from the camera taking pictures at the beginning to Louis' nocturnal amateur detective work.  In such a community private and public space are not so clearly marked and one's identity is as much defined by one's public role doctor butcher etc. as by any personal merit so there is something creepy as well as comic about this police the Law spying on the sexual act. There is something creepy about this policeman anyway.  Unlike the rooted defined villagers he is a rootless stranger without motive personality role except to solve the crime he keeps insisting that he is the 'flic' in order to do which he resorts to alarming thuggery even more objectionable than Harry Callahan whose heart at least was in the right place.  Don't be fooled by Chabrol's autumnal cheerfulness  this is a vinaigre with a very bitter aftertaste.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen a handful of Chabrol films and have so far been impressed with all of them. This film is my first experience of Chabrol's work in the eighties and while I'm not surprised at the fact that it gets lambasted by some and it's not quite up to the great French director's previous high standards personally I found this to be yet another great example of Chabrol's moody and brooding direction coupled with an interesting plot line and some good performances. The plot is not quite as deep as the ones seen in previous Chabrol films but there's still plenty to chew on. The base of the story is Madame Curo and her son Louis. They live in a house that is wanted by two unscrupulous people in the village but what they don't realise is that the son can read their mail owing to the fact that he works at the post office  which gives them an advantage. The plot kicks off properly when Louis puts sugar into the tank of one of the men's cars which soon results in a fatal car accident. After the disappearance of the other man's wife a hard nosed police officer is brought in to investigate.This film has one of the strangest titles I've ever heard of  'Poulet au vinaigre' translating literally as Chicken with the Vinegar. Quite what that means I have no idea. The film has a fair few different plots going on but the one that Chabrol seems most interested in is the one surrounding Louis who finds himself in the middle of a war that is a bit too big for him and has to deal with his needy sick mother at the same time. The murder investigation does provide the film with one of its main narratives but since it doesn't kick off until we're halfway through it's clear that it wasn't Chabrol's main concern. The acting is very good all round with Lucas Belvaux making a convincing lead and getting good support from Chabrol's exwife and regular muse Stphane Audran Jean Poiret who is excellent as the formidable police officer and my personal favourite the exquisite Pauline Lafont as the love interest. Chabrol seems to have a thing for ending his films abruptly and that is the case here as while everything is wrapped up by the end it is done in a matter of about five minutes. Overall it's not hard to imagine why this film isn't as well liked as some of Chabrol's other work  but for my money it's still a more than worthwhile thriller and comes recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "After another undue interruption in my ongoing Chabrol tribute  incidentally I messed up the date and he will only turn 80 on the 24th of June rather than last May!  I plan to tackle it in earnest now a task which will occupy me till the end of the month to go along with a parallel Dennis Hopper tribute.Anyway this proved to be another steppingstone in the French director's erratic but prolific filmography by the end of the 1970s his career had suffered a decline but it got back on track with this enjoyable awardwinning thriller incidentally the hybrid retitling for U.S. consumption was an unusual touch one that was successful enough to warrant a sequel  INSPECTOR LAVARDIN 1986 a viewing of which is to follow this one  and a brief TV series made between 1988 and 1990 which seems to be unavailable for reappraisal.Still for all the film's typical elements of detailed setting nuanced characterization and ironic outlook it does not quite scale the heights of Chabrol's finest work due to an essentially flimsy plot indeed even such later  and ostensibly lowerprofile  efforts as the recentlyviewed THE CRY OF THE OWL 1987 involve a denser and more gripping narrative! This is not to say that COP AU VIN lacks suspense or surprise actually the latter concerns most of all the iconoclastic Inspector himself  in spite of a dapper facade he is blas forthright even referring to a character's effeminacy as ACDC! and not above breaking into premises sans warrant or intimidating suspects to get at the truth  belatedly called in to investigate a murder only to be met with a very similar one soon after and later the disappearance of a woman all of whom are tied to a property development company whose methods are not the most ethical either.Jean Poiret ideally cast here and who would of course reprise the central role in the sequels had garnered a reputation as a playwright and even secured an Oscar nomination for cowriting LA CAGE AUX FOLLES 1978 then in 1992 the same year he died of a heart attack at 65 he stepped into the director's chair with LE ZEBRE which won him a posthumous Cesar for Best First Film! Incidentally later on in the decade he married one of his costars here i.e. Caroline Cellier who years before had been the leading lady in arguably Chabrol's masterpiece THIS MAN MUST DIE 1969 besides the latter the film under review featured two of the director's frequent protagonists in supporting roles exwife Stephane Audran playing an invalid and a very slim Michel Bouquet. Also on hand is amiably kooky Pauline Lafont daughter of Bernadette another New Wave regular and who would actually costar in INSPECTOR LAVARDIN  whose promising career was brought to a premature end when she perished in a fall at just 25 years of age in 1988!".

I plan to tackle it in earnest now a task which will occupy me till the end of the month to go along with a parallel Dennis Hopper tribute.Anyway this proved to be another steppingstone in the French director's erratic but prolific filmography by the end of the 1970s his career had suffered a decline but it got back on track with this enjoyable awardwinning thriller incidentally the hybrid retitling for U.S. consumption was an unusual touch one that was successful enough to warrant a sequel  INSPECTOR LAVARDIN 1986 a viewing of which is to follow this one  and a brief TV series made between 1988 and 1990 which seems to be unavailable for reappraisal.Still for all the film's typical elements of detailed setting nuanced characterization and ironic outlook it does not quite scale the heights of Chabrol's finest work due to an essentially flimsy plot indeed even such later  and ostensibly lowerprofile  efforts as the recentlyviewed THE CRY OF THE OWL 1987 involve a denser and more gripping narrative! This is not to say that COP AU VIN lacks suspense or surprise actually the latter concerns most of all the iconoclastic Inspector himself  in spite of a dapper facade he is blas forthright even referring to a character's effeminacy as ACDC! and not above breaking into premises sans warrant or intimidating suspects to get at the truth  belatedly called in to investigate a murder only to be met with a very similar one soon after and later the disappearance of a woman all of whom are tied to a property development company whose methods are not the most ethical either.Jean Poiret ideally cast here and who would of course reprise the central role in the sequels had garnered a reputation as a playwright and even secured an Oscar nomination for cowriting LA CAGE AUX FOLLES 1978 then in 1992 the same year he died of a heart attack at 65 he stepped into the director's chair with LE ZEBRE which won him a posthumous Cesar for Best First Film! Incidentally later on in the decade he married one of his costars here i.e. Caroline Cellier who years before had been the leading lady in arguably Chabrol's masterpiece THIS MAN MUST DIE 1969 besides the latter the film under review featured two of the director's frequent protagonists in supporting roles exwife Stephane Audran playing an invalid and a very slim Michel Bouquet. Also on hand is amiably kooky Pauline Lafont daughter of Bernadette another New Wave regular and who would actually costar in INSPECTOR LAVARDIN  whose promising career was brought to a premature end when she perished in a fall at just 25 years of age in 1988!";

Things start to get more interesting when a vengeful prank misfires into something much worse and then get even more interesting when Inspector Lavardin arrives on the scene. Lavardin is like a strange cross between Hercule Poirot in his eccentricity and intuition and Dirty Harry in his unorthodox and occasionally even violent methods of investigation and interrogation. Another character I really liked was the hero's girlfriend played by Pauline Lafont who tragically died in an accident only three years later every boy should be so lucky to get his emotional  sexual maturing via such a beautiful affectionate and playful girl. The goodlooking and wellacted movie ends with a couple of Agatha Christietype twists two of them blindsided me but the one about the mother Stephane Audran for some reason I suspected it from the beginning. Leonard Maltin gives this 12 out of 4 stars but IMO he's overrating it I'll give it 12.".

Its plotline has quite a few things happening in it but it consequently doesn't have the focus of his best work. It still follows the basic template he often seems to follow in that its story is underpinned by a crime but the real focus of attention seems to be on the weaknesses and character defects of its cast. This one is no different but doesn't have as interesting dynamics between its characters as usual. Chabrol's wife and regular actress Stephane Audran appears as the wheelchairbound mother. She was often the best thing about the movies she appeared in but here her character is somewhat unappealing and she is never the main focus in any case. The setting is pure Chabrol though smalltown rural France with the typical pastel colour scheme to match.

Chabrol's genre of choice is the murder mystery and from what I've seen they're kind of subtle scaledback ones. Cop au vin involves a small town beset by murders and disappearances. Kindlyseeming police detective Jean Poiret shows up in town and begins to unravel the mystery. What's particularly good about this film is that we at first suspect Poiret is pure business. He's neatly dressed seems nice but also smart enough to figure out what's going on. Frankly what I was expecting was a French version of Matlock when he showed up. But then Poiret begins revealing his true colors and we find out his nice guy appearance is just a facade. This is the type of guy who thinks nothing of beating the crap out of anyone he suspects might be lying. And I certainly am not the type to think that's cool. We're meant not to like him very much. It's kind of a neat reversal of expectations.Thankfully Poiret is not really the center of the movie. Lucas Belvaux plays a sweet kind of dumb postal worker who lives with his domineering crippled mother Stphane Audran Chabrol's exwife and frequent star. Their dilapidated mansion is the center of a real estate conspiracy which is connected to the murders. Adorable Pauline Lafont plays Belvaux's nutty coworker with whom he begins a relationship.Poiret's character Inspector Jean Lavardin got his own sequel the next year and a television series a couple of years later.".

It is rare for romantic comedies to be entirely original they are after all dealing with love but Down to You does have it's moments differing it from most of the recently released teen comedies to which it has constantly been compared.Through narration by both protagonists the audience is able to see the development of both characters in the longterm and how they ultimately react to each other.  Freddie Prinze Jr and Julia Stiles were perfectly cast and behaved as mature young adults for the majority of the film sparing the audience from cliched teen talk.  They leave the zaniness to their costars which was a good move.  The film is more of a love story then most recent teen flicks dealing mainly with physical attraction or opposites attract.One problem with Down to You however is it's not presented well enough to keep the audience interested.  Perhaps in the hands of a more capable director this would be achieved as I got a bit bored with a few of the scenes and some jokes really fall flat.  Because of this it's not as memorable as other teen flicks such as 10 Things or Scream even.. as it's pacing is quite slow.  It's saving grace is the cast.  Henry Winkler gives a comic performance as Prinze's celebritychef father and Zak Orth plays Prinze's friend turned porn starfriend with gutso.  Selma Blair gave a sultry performance but lacked development making her nothing more than the porn star girl.Compared to the other three major teen romance flicks of the year Loser Whatever it Takes Boys and Girls Down to You is indeed one of the finest. It just needed more oomph to make it more memorable.710".

The film is more of a love story then most recent teen flicks dealing mainly with physical attraction or opposites attract.One problem with Down to You however is it's not presented well enough to keep the audience interested.  Perhaps in the hands of a more capable director this would be achieved as I got a bit bored with a few of the scenes and some jokes really fall flat.  Because of this it's not as memorable as other teen flicks such as 10 Things or Scream even.. as it's pacing is quite slow.  It's saving grace is the cast.  Henry Winkler gives a comic performance as Prinze's celebritychef father and Zak Orth plays Prinze's friend turned porn starfriend with gutso.  Selma Blair gave a sultry performance but lacked development making her nothing more than the porn star girl.Compared to the other three major teen romance flicks of the year Loser Whatever it Takes Boys and Girls Down to You is indeed one of the finest. It just needed more oomph to make it more memorable.710";

In tocamera interviews they discuss their relationship and trace it's path from the first time they met in Imogen's freshman year.It is a device that I have grown accustom to because I have seen it done well quite often but the directtocamera style is clearly difficult to do. First of all you need strong or likeable characters as the style is basically requiring some degree of interest of empathy from the first second.  Without this it is pretty weak.  This film stumbles at this point because even halfway through the film I was still struggling to care less about the characters.  Past this problem the plot is not the strongest  it has been done before regardless of superficial changes.  It has little genuine humour and mostly is just the cinematic version of puppy love.  When the problems come they are so poorly handled by the script that they fail to convince.Sadly the blame must be shared between script and actors for most of this. The script fails to create characters that convince.  The dialogue rarely rings true and sounds like a weak teen drama at worst.  However this doesn't totally excuse the actors as they don't bring much to the roles.  Prinze Jr is so wishywashy and lifeless that he is not someone I ever got behind as real.  He is too idealistic and as a result any scenes where he has to show hurt or anger are unbelievable.  Stiles is OK but suffers from a poor script.  The support cast are basically monkeys who are simply comedy characters.  I know that sounds cruel but none have any effort put into them  the porn star no type of porn I've ever seen the geek etc.  Henry Winkler gets the odd smile but is just a famous face to add colour.  Selma Blair is the least convincing porn actress I've ever seen but the Biggest waste to me was Rosario Dawson not only gorgeous but a real talent given the chance her character was so pointless that I wondered why they even bothered creating it.It's not an awful film  it is simply mediocre and unremarkable to the point of monotony.  Every part of it feels like you've seen it better somewhere else.  The script is lazy  things are poorly thought out and the characters are thin and poorly developed.  None of the cast really put their heart into it and the end result is a film that doesn't really do anything but still seems to take forever to finish!Although it will be remembered for things like Trainspotting and My Beautiful Laundrette FilmFour folded partly because it produced things like this that were without spark wit or invention.".

Very uninterestingthe cast mostly is forgettable and frankly we've seen this movie before......However what sets Down apart is 3 wonderful performances and 1 so bad it's gonna get special attention in this review...We'll start with the good....Julia Stiles is Imogen a new freshman at an unnamed NYC college.  She is a stellar artist and wishes to persue that in some manner.  Ms. Stiles delivers a performance above the drivel she has to work with making Imogen a teen character with heart and feeling.  She once again as in 10 Things dances in this one..and I personally think she needs a dance scene in each movie.Henry Winkler plays Ray Connelly...host of a nationwide cooking show and father of Al the lead male in the story.  His character is well played and humorous with grand visions for both himself and his son he wants to do a cooking show take off of Cops with Al.  A great performance from Mr. Winkler and he is quickly putting the ghost of Fonzie behind him.Now to the bad before I surprise you and give you the last good.....Selma Blair plays Cyrus a major flirt and porn actress. I hate to have to say this but after Cruel Intentions and now this I am truly convinced that she is either someone's daughter or is involved in a relationship with someone.  This woman cannot act.  I truly believe with every fiber of my being that she could not play dead convincingly.  Hopefully her performance here will kill what little career she has.Now for the last good review.......are you ready for this?? Freddie Prinze Jr. is Alfred..the film's lead male character.  He spots Imogen across a crowded room and the two instantly hit it off.  After forgetable turns in every movie he has done he shows a never before seen maturity and makes Alfred a character that seems real and true.Down To You is more formulaic drivel aimed at the easily entertained teen audience.  While the story is something we've all seen before the performances of its lead characters make this movie worth a watch regardless of how bad it really is.1 out of 5".

I am a fan of Julia Stiles and I went into this movie thinking it would be of the same caliber as 10 Things I Hate About You but it didn't even come close. And it all boiled down to the one thing ... no chemistry.If you are a fan of Julie or Freddie and just want to watch because it is a title with their name on it. Then ya go ahead.

Freddie and Julia are cute to watch but their coupling was just not believable. Truth be told I found the scenes of them kissing almost painful to watch. It's meant to be a romance and it looked as though he was kissing his sister. I am a fan of Julia Stiles and I went into this movie thinking it would be of the same caliber as 10 Things I Hate About You but it didn't even come close. And it all boiled down to the one thing ... no chemistry.If you are a fan of Julie or Freddie and just want to watch because it is a title with their name on it. Then ya go ahead. If you are looking to feel to be griped by gut wrenching teen angst that comes with the normal boy meets girl movie then you should pass this title completely.";

	schema:reviewBody "Down to You 2000 Dir Kris Isacsson  Cast Freddie Prinze Jr Julia Stiles Henry Winkler Shawn Hatosy Selma Blair Standard teen flick about discovering that someone who eliminates all others. It stars Freddie Prinze Jr. who loves to cook and specializes in smoked salmon. His father hosts his own cooking show and hopes that his son will follow in his footsteps. Julia Stiles plays an artist who designs album covers. Concept isn't bad but the rest is predictable with a conventional ending. Directed by Kris Isacsson with fine location work. The screenplay thrusts Stiles and Prinze through standard romantic clichs and a lot of bull crap. She is a woman thrust into confusion. Prinze Jr. is given a lame sequence where he digests shampoo. Perhaps that was his reaction to the script. He and Stiles also have hokey scenes where they sit around and eat cake. Henry Winkler might have been interesting on his own but the screenplay calls him to be at odds with his son's decisions and then forgive. Shawn Hatosy plays one of their friends who shows up and makes a total ass out of himself at parties. Selma Blair was a scene stealer in Cruel Intentions but here she can merely stand back and watch this travesty fall without romance or laughs. Pointless romantic drivel out for a few undeserved tears and a few sighs but never showing any originality or depth. Perhaps viewers may need the shampoo next. Score 3  10".

He's personable he knew HOW to be cute and I'm sure that to many women he seemed very datable...which is perfect for what is essentially a date movie. Julia Stiles was okay here although  and I know this is shallow  her teeth bothered me when she smiled broadly.As to the bad most of the actors who played supporting roles with one exception. The exceptions first  nice to see Henry Winkler here as the father my good has it been that long since Fonzie?. But the rest of the supporting actors and their performances here...well just flush.As to the ugly the characters that supported the main story line. Not a one to like. Deadbeats. And a movie with a lot of deadbeats doesn't go very far.The story itself is pretty standard  boy meets girl boy loses girl boys wins girl back. The twist here is that the boy is the good one the girl gets bitchy.The movie was cute enough to hold my attention...even though I'm 65...but I can hardly give it more than a substandard 6. Me thinks the director just just wasn't ready for prime time and apparently still isn't based on his credits.".

I don't know why its just that overlysappy stories with 20somethings playing teenagers has never been my thing. However I do make exceptions I'm a Breakfast Club and She's All That fan.  This film is kind of a departure from teen loveteen comedy because it focuses on a more adult topic that's right it deals with college kids.I only saw a few scenes towards the end first time I saw this and then the next time it was on TV I only saw the same scenes.  I knew I needed to see this film but it became rare on the payperview channels I saw the ending on so I went out and paid 29.99 for the DVD.  It's okit was worth the price.  I was almost single at the time as well my 1st boyfriend and I were on the outs and was just turning 18 when I bought this movie.  It actually helped me through the breakupI knew things could be worse.In this spirited 2000 retelling of Annie Hall which I've never seen a young man and woman find out about love and relationships during their college years.  Sophomore Al Connelly Freddie Prinze Jr. is a satisfied college sophomore who is studying liberal arts but wants to be a chef. Freshman Imogen Julia Stiles worships artistry but according to her mother art should only be done on the weekends.  The two meet in a bar one night AL I thought it was a cool place but that's because they never checked IDs.  Al falls for Imogen immediately sort of like infatuation. The two begin a whirlwind courtship that includes a conversation over cake psychoanalysis I'll explain this one better because its one of my favorite scenes sleeping together and just enjoying each other's company.  But the two become distant and suddenly Al is floored when Imogen dumps him. He suddenly realizes that he needs her to live and will do anything to get over her even if it means going to extreme measures.While genuinely a sentimental flick this is lighthearted and smart. The viewer comes away a little more knowledgable about the opposite sex after seeing this flick.  You can see the chemistry between Al and Imogen and Prinze and Stiles capture the romantic scenes perfectly.  The story is told from both of their points of view which is good because the story would not work onesided.  Every now and then the movie would flash forward to either Prinze of Stiles in present day talking about each other giving their take on everything as well as a great voiceover track from both during the film.  Anyone who has ever experienced love lost could relate to Al but I don't know nor have I heard of anyone who has ever tried to forget their lost love the way Al did that was an interesting part.  The reason this film works is the chemistry. Although I am completely over the moon for Prinze he is not the only reason I enjoyed this film.  It's funny but doesn't try to be silly.  It's sentimental but not too sappy.  It's smart but doesn't over kill us with too much intelligence.  It's never stupid and certainly never dull.  This film works simply put.My favorite scenes in this film are when Al goes to Imogen's dorm room with cake Something sacred he says.  The two have a conversation over the cake which leads to psychoanalysis You know we're prime for psychoanalysis Imogen comments.  Al lays on her bed and Imogen asks him questions about his vices sleeping beer wine he asks about hers smoking chocolate a few others his past relationships Faith KeenanClepto Megan BrodskiCheerleader Haley Heller Scientist her past relationships Gabe StianoNew Age Ted McGurranAllergic and Ricky Jameshated by the dog what they love himfish her art.  They also disclosed their first kisses shown in humorous flashbackshis was a woman who dropped a ring when he was 12 hers was her gym partner when she was 11 12 who knocked her down with a baksetball.  In addition I liked the opening scene in the coffee shop where Al is observing two young lovers while talking to the camera Reminds me of my relationship except Imogen never wore that much jewelry and I wouldn't be caught dead in those shoes. the flashback scenes the narration the scene where Al attempts to get over Imogen by drinking shampoo this actually was the one scene I heard alot about before seeing this movie and the concluding scene which I will not give awayits too good.This movie is a must rentbuy for anyone who likes romantic comedies Freddie Prinze Jr. or Julia Stiles.  I'm disappointed that alot of people didn't like this film nor did it get the box office success it deserved. This film is targeted at teenage and young adults girls and probably wouldn't interest the general public under the age of 13 or over the age of 2530.  This was a goodintentions film and a must see for those who are romantically involved or for a girl's movie night.  I've actually owned the DVD for 2 years 2 years as of today I believeit was sometime in late October and the film holds up well with time.  Definitely see this film there's something for everyone!".

The plot explores the 'tingles' of first love in a refreshingly mature and honest manner without being trivial and stupid like some teen movies. A fantastic flick to watch on a girlie night in.".

Ned Kynaston is the assumedly gay crossdressing actor who has been playing female parts in plays for years particularly Desdemona in Othello he also has a close relationship with a member of the Royal Court the Duke of Buckingham. One day however the rules of only men playing women could change when aspiring actress Maria auditions as Kynaston's praised role Desdemona and soon enough King Charles II decides to make the law that all female roles should be played only by women. Maria becomes a star while Ned finds himself out of work. But after a while Ned finds it in his nature to forgive Maria's aspiration they may even fall in love and Charles may proclaim women will be played by either gender.";

Fundamentalists and I used to be one! would at the same time find material to support their nurturenotnature conclusions in Ned Kynaston's background implicit victimization at the hands of an implicit pedophile the bigoted comments of the king about effeminate boys and most of all the actor's eventual orientation reversal at the hands of the right woman. This of course would anger those who have chosen to engage them in the loaded is it a choice? battle which completely dismisses the B in LGBT. If you are coming from an angle in which no Kinsey scale exists then the offense makes sense.I think it's a mistaken angle however. My only complaints about this movie were minor and involved poor editing unnecessary dialogue and a couple of unlikely scenarios e.g. the carriage ladies' hyperbolic reaction to Ned's petticoat surprise. Otherwise I loved it  enough to watch it four times on DVD. For me this story was about identity authenticity the malleability of gender and sexuality and the difference between love and projection. At the bustling outset of the film Ned pitchperfect Billy Crudup ravishing in any incarnation is arrogant and narcissistic his selfregard is balanced perilously upon a constructed self that relies on the applause of others. Alone with Maria we get a glimmer of something else in him when he pauses contemplatively to quote his mentor  Never forget that you are a man in woman's form...or was it the other way 'round? This hint at an awareness on his or the film's part of the essential duality of human nature is echoed by Maria  You would make as fine a man as any woman. When Ned loses his role and his audience to Maria he loses his very identity in this way she kills him. The theme of killing and dying is cleverly woven throughout the narrative both onstage and off. But more on that presently.Lost and literally beaten Ned turns to his former lover who spurns him with droll indifference. Ned is no longer the shallow Duke's glittering projection but a raw needy and very messy human being. Ned's disastrous lastditch attempt to play Othello for the king in order to save his livelihood is the final humiliation. Maria watches his disintegration onstage and grasps his utter vulnerability for the first time. It's a credit to Claire Danes' talent that she can speak volumes without uttering a word in this scene and the inn scene her unexpressed love bleeds from every pore.The almostsex scene between the two at the inn is one of my favorite love scenes in any film. The gentle roleswitching from man to woman in alternate parlance top to bottom or dominant to submissive leads to a passionate confusion in which if you'll notice Ned tells Maria astride him first that she is the woman  And now? she says kissing and caressing him  The woman he says  And now? she says her passion intensifying  The man he murmurs. Do the roles really matter? If only he had shut up about Desdemona! But there is still some dying left to do and not in the Shakespearian sense. Call it evening the score.For alas Maria is a terrible actress as affected as Ned was and twice as false. In rehearsal with someone who evokes her own passion however her performance begins to come alive.The harrowing climax of the film has the viewer wondering along with the theatre audience if the newfound Othello's murderous passion is real. And it is which is why Ned is so good at it. In killing Maria onstage he manages at once to work out his Othellolike ambivalence and rage toward a woman he also loves to kill her affected stage persona and to give birth to himself as an authentic actor in his own male body. It's damn near perfect. Finally got the death scene right. Ned may not yet know who or even what he is but he finds expression of his innermost being with a person who loves and accepts him for whomever he may turn out to be. We should all be so lucky.".

Crudup is taut as the bisexual Kynaston trained to be a calamity and actress since early adolescence and emotes powerfully as he struggles with his sexuality and identity in an unfriendly new political landscape.

Well don't because it also happens to make a highly successful transition from stage to screen thanks to the genius that is director Richard Eyre.It tells the tale of Ned Billy Crudup a young actor who specialises in portraying women on stage. In a world where only men are allowed to tread the boards Ned's Desdemona from Shakespeare's Othello is the closest thing 17th century audiences get to femininity in theatre. However a young upstart in the form of Maria played by Clare Danes wants to change all that. She has a passion for drama and unfortunately the bisexual Ned. With the help of King Charles II Rupert Everett she may just get her wish changing theatre forever and hopefully pick up Ned on the way.When thinking of the themes of the film many people dismiss it as a clone of Shakespeare in Love. This is unfair the film is more thought provoking substantial and better acted than the aforementioned Oscar snaffler. It explores themes of sexuality and gender with insight and intelligence as well as telling and in fact enthralling us with a love story. As previously referred to the acting is exceptional especially the two leads Danes and Crudup who shine. The supporting cast is strong too with Richard Griffiths as a heterosexual prequel to his role in Withnail and I Tom Wilkinson brimming with quiet intensity as Betterton and Everett hamming it up wonderfully as the King. Even if it does end on a slightly trite note not to give too much away but its' birth of method acting shtick irritates Stage Beauty is a funny heartwarming and occasionally quite cerebral meditation on love and art. What more could any theatre or film lover for that matter want? And don't say Shakespeare In Love!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has the blessing of the flawless direction of Richard Eyre who knows a lot about kings and queens. The screen play is adapted by the author of the play Jeffrey Hatcher. Surprisingly these two men have been able to create a film that is not only visually satisfying but it also is an adult entertainment.This movie gives us a glimpse of how theatre functioned in England up to the times of Charles II. The female roles of all plays were portrayed by male actors. The school of acting in that era was an artificial one where actors relied in gestures and affectations that would be laughable today in a serious drama but that was the way it was the accepted Method then nothing to do with Stanivslaski or Strassberg.The leading figure of that theatrical world was Ned Keynaston who was the most famous Desdemona of his time. There must have been a lot of gay men that were attracted to that world as was the case with Mr. Keynaston who might have been bisexual although that comes as a secondary subplot. This actor is greatly admired by all including the dressing assistant Maria. This girl loved to be in the theatre but could not because only men were allowed. So instead she goes to a second rate company that puts on plays in a pub and emerges as Margaret Hughes an actress in her own right who will challenge Keynaston's Desdemona and makes that role her signature role as well.Claire Danes as Maria or Margaret Hughes has never been better! She shines as the girl whose ambition is to be on stage. She is wonderful in the part. Ned played with gusto by Billy Crudup shows an unexpected range although he has done theatre extensively. Both of these actors takes us back to London and make us believe that what we are watching.A glorious English cast behind the two American principals are gathered to play effortlessly the theatrical figures of the time and also the King and his court. Ruper Everett as King Charles II is hilarious. The scene in which he plays in drag with his mistress Nell Gwynn is one of the best things of the movie. Also Richard Griffith as lecherous Sir Charles Sedley gives a stellar performance. Ben Chaplin as the Duke of Buckingham reveals the ambiguity of the men that were attracted to those early thespians. Thoroughly enjoyable because of Richard Eyre's direction and eye for detail.".

Theaters shut down during the Protectorate now reopened and the diehard dour Puritans either doffed their somber garb and decamped for more favorable vicefree venues or joined the fun.Director Richard Eyre and script author Jeffrey Hatcher who wrote the play on which Stage Beauty is derived set the screen with a feast of authentic costumes and an almost palpable ambiance of a great city resurrecting a rich cultural life at least for those of means.But as has been said the play is the thing and the acting here is uniformly engrossing indeed superb.Based more or less on history the film chronicles an awkward and for many painful evolution of law and theater the two intertwined. For when Charles II was restored to the throne lost by his father who also lost something else of even more estimable value theaters reopened but under an old law that forbade the presence of actresses on the stage. The great female roles of Shakespeare were performed by men some of whom were the subjects of audience and patron adulation for their skills of gender mimicry.Ned Keynaston Billy Crudop is the leader of the pack a star of the stage whose Desdemona is the height of his career. Serving as his dresser is Maria Clair Danes a frustrated actress who mouths the lines of Desdemona from the side of the stage as Ned wows the punters.Maria actually gets to act behind Ned's back but in a less than firstline theater her costume borrowed to be generous from the unsuspecting Ned.What follows is a comedy and a drama as the king Rupert Everett at the urging of one of his mistresses Nell Gynn newcomer Zoe Tapper proclaims that women may take on the roles of their sex and the cadre of female impersonators must seek new and gender authentic roles. At first amused then devastated by a loss of roles income and prestige Ned slides to singing bawdy songs in drag to a somewhat lower class clientele in a sink run by a foulmouthed harridan. But under the protection of a genuinely odious rotund and foul Sir Charles Richard Griffith Maria becomes the toast of the town for her fine acting.Sexual attraction equally matched by a moving ambiguity permeates both the roles played by Maria and Ned and their offstage lives. Maria is in love with Ned who is at least potentially bisexual while actually intimate with one of the king's favorites the second Duke of Buckingham Ben Chaplin. Buckingham was in actuality one of the most complex characters during Charles's two decade exile and then restoration to the throne. A conniver and master manipulator here his skills are shown as being wholly adapted to surviving in a court attended by intrigue at every turn.Eyre projects role reversal both with Ned and Maria's theater life and their increasing personal but never simple involvement. Can he make love to a woman? Does he know himself what his orientation is? There is a certain contemporaneity to the artfully acted issues raised in this mid1600s scenario.Eyre could not have selected a better cast. Crudop is penetrating as a man whose whole strange persona is transformed in an instant by a monarch's command. Everett is disarmingly foppish as the Stuart monarch but in a critical scene he reveals his deep lasting resentment over his father's and his dynasty's fate as he orders women to be allowed to perform. Edward Fox is splendid in short takes as Charles's key minister Sir Edward Hyde the Earl of Clarendon but he's never identified with his proper peerage title.Zoe Tapper may well have studied the life of her character the Protestant Whore so known and loved by the London underclass to distinguish her from the despised Catholic Whore who alternated with Nell for the king's company and body forget about the queenshe doesn't even make an appearance here. She's crude raw vulgar sentimental loyal and cunning  she IS Nell Gynn. Hugh Bonneville is the randy compulsive diarist Sir Samuel Pepys father of the Royal Navy here a stage door Johnny a voyeur. Ben Chaplin as the Duke of Buckingham is just the right admixture of randiness and a healthy regard for the penalty that can be incurred by going too far over the edge of conventionality. And Tom Wilkinson as Ned's and then Maria's stage impresario combines business acumen with a soft human touch.But special kudos go to Clair Danes  this is her best performance to date. She runs the gamut of emotions from helpless subservience to repressive laws to sprightly awakening of her worth to deep confusion about her priorities and needs. She inhabits the role of Maria with skill and grace. An Oscarworthy display.The score is fine briskly and authentically complementing the story. And for the first time ever in a movie a king of England is shown cavorting in the royal rack with his mistress while six adorable King Charles Spaniels look on.1010".

A whole new world opens up for Maria but it looks like curtains for Ned.What happens next is pure anachronism Ned and Maria are able to rise above the limitations and constraints of their era. Not only do they transcend their gender or sex roles but they overcome their classical training and in effect engage in Method acting a technique still three hundred years away in the fardistant future. When he teaches Maria how to break the mold and play Othello's Desdemona in a whole new natural way Ned becomes a seventeenthcentury Stanislavsky.But by George it works. Their performance of the celebrated death scene from Othello sends shock waves through an audience accustomed to pantomime and exaggerated gestures  and it electrifies us as well.Not since Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love have an actor and actress so shimmered and shone simultaneously on stage and screen. One hopes that Billy Crudup and Clare Danes will be remembered for their luminous performances at the 2005 Academy Awards.".

The reference to Shakespeare in Love is an affectionate comparison I enjoyed the light snack of Gwinny luvvies and Fiennes and have sat through the DVD time and again.

I think that this is relevant to all of us as we perform the roles that we and those who've influenced our upbringing have created for ourselves.

	schema:reviewBody "I was very impressed by Billy Crudup's portrayal of Ned Kynaston the last of the great English actors who specialized in Shakespeare's female heroines. The only other film I had seen this actor in was 'Big Fish' and that was a performance that as it turns out has grown in stature with each subsequent viewing. One of those quiet difficult roles that Crudup does to perfection as it turns out. He never overplays or attempts to steal a scene. And in Big Fish his character is never meant to steal scenes... who could from Albert Finney! But in the hospital room Crudup manages to bash the viewer with quite an emotional wallop showing a depth that had hitherto gone unappreciated. In 'Stage Beauty' Crudup never resorts to eyefluttering shemale antics in order to convey his understanding indeed internalization of the eternally feminine principals that are so foreign to most men. He avoids what might have been highcamp in the hands of a lesser actor.It is also remarkable how beautiful Crudup IS as a woman. He's not what I'd call a beautiful man though he is very appealing and his sexuality is muted both as a gay man in his relationship with the Duke of Buckingham wonderfully performed by Ben Chaplin now THERE'S a sexy man! and his burgeoning interest in Claire Danes' Maria. Though that last relationship never rings very true nor does the director attempt to shove it down our throats as being really feasible for the homosexual Kynsaston to suddenly desire without qualm the lovely Maria.Danes is quite good in the early scenes as the longsuffering handmaiden to her male star Crudup. It isn't her fault if the character becomes a tad maudlin in later scenes and a bit more annoying than endearing. She is stretched to the limit in the Desdemona Othello scene she plays with Crudup the latter playing the Moor with uncanny ease he must be quite a Shakespearean on stage! But Danes is not to be faulted in what is probably a misfire in the concept of this scene developing as it does out of the stylized acting of Crudup's Desdemona and then leaping wildly into the Method school of acting for this last performance of Desdemona's death. A bit of an anachronism that spoils the film's ultimate impact but not too much.There is a wonderful performance of Charles II by Rupert Everett. He seems to specialize in royalty and always holds the eye effortlessly. Everett is getting better and better as he gets older. I look forward to the day when he's a cynical old actor like Ian McKellan who can do anything he pleases brilliantly.I always enjoy Richard Griffiths who is here Lord Charles an obese fop with a rapier wit delivering some juicy and subtle quips to hilarious effect. The setting is good if a bit stagy. There is one shot of the old London Bridge with houses and shops built on it that is quite remarkable. The atmosphere of 17th century London is captured quite nicely which can't have been an easy thing to do. Costumes and other technical credits are beyond reproach.But somehow this isn't a great film but a very good one and worth repeated viewings.7 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was very impressed by Billy Crudup's portrayal of Ned Kynaston the last of the great English actors who specialized in Shakespeare's female heroines. The only other film I had seen this actor in was 'Big Fish' and that was a performance that as it turns out has grown in stature with each subsequent viewing. One of those quiet difficult roles that Crudup does to perfection as it turns out. He never overplays or attempts to steal a scene. And in Big Fish his character is never meant to steal scenes... who could from Albert Finney! But in the hospital room Crudup manages to bash the viewer with quite an emotional wallop showing a depth that had hitherto gone unappreciated.

Stage Beauty however gives me pause. Billy is entrusted with a bigger than life role and he comes out of it with a half cooked self conscious affected performance. He underlines every other line with a semi smile a slight pressure of the mouth as if he didn't trust the power of his own delivery. It could be treated as a character trait if you've never seen Billy Crudup before but that tic belongs to the actor not to the character. I'm of course being a bit anal retentive. At his weakest Billy is stronger than most but my expectations are so high that something like that would throw me out of my involvement with his character. The film as a whole is lovely and fun. The one most effective element is Rupert Everett's performance as Charles II his best  an that is saying a lot  in many many moons. Comparasions with Shakespeare in Love are unavoidable but totally misguiding. See it for what it is and you'll enjoy it thoroughly.".

	schema:headline " A Fascinating Search for What Is MaleFemale On Stage";
	schema:reviewBody "Stage Beauty is a clever and moving combination of the period feel of Shakespeare in Love and the themes of A Double Life. In the latter Ronald Colman is an actor who immerses himself into his role as Othello and as in Beauty continually repeats and reinterprets the murder scene with increasing realism.The emphasis here is on malefemale gender roles on stage from just before to just after women are allowed on stage. Playwrightscreenwriter Jeffrey Hatcher's choice to use Othello as his prism is significant on many levels. All the characters agree that the productions of the play at this time in the 1660's already included the artifice that the Moor is portrayed in blackface though this is a serious drama of passion and not one of the lighter comedies or romances with hidden or mistaken identity. The final presentation of the key scene does have the onscreen audience terrified that the actors' animosity has led to all pretense being abandoned.Hatcher simplifies the gender issues by focusing on a play where the leads Desdemona and Othello are unambiguous in their sexual poles which makes Billy Crudup's Ned Kynaston tortured selfdiscovery to move from one role to the other particularly fascinating. The movie includes a brief comic debate about the ramifications of Rosalind in As You Like It in a time where a male actor would be portraying a Shakespearean heroine disguised as a man in what we now consider 'trouser roles' like Portia in Merchant of Venice or Viola in Twelfth Night.Set in the period of the Stuart Restoration when kings are in and out of exile and a brash cockney mistress masquerades as the queen though Nell Gwynn's influence is doubtless exaggerated the mise en scene is a society where all are playacting in wigs and makeup. Ben Chaplin's Duke of Buckingham in a much more leonine role that his milquetoasts in The Truth About Cats and Dogs or Birthday Girl wryly demonstrates as he cynically moves from an affair with Kynaston to a rich marriage. Claire Danes's contrasting naturalness is luminous as she has no doubts about her femininity but is frustrated in getting Kynaston to perceive it and not just as another artifice. While it is an asymptotic flirtation as his sexuality is left indeterminate it is marvelous to watch Kynaston tentatively and painfully learn to explore his masculine side that was suppressed since childhood on stage and off.The conclusion seems a cri de coeur for audiences to accept gay actors as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire to get across that no matter how naturalistic the acting it is still pretend.Director Richard Eyre's camera work swirls around a bit too much to animate the choice dialogue but there are also outdoor scenes of dirt violence and cruelty that open up the action from the play thus showing the theater as a refuge from reality.George Fenton's score sounded marvelously appropriate to the period.Crudup's and Danes's British accents are unfortunately a bit too bland but convincing.".

I wasn't interested in the film but then my sister got the DVD for her birthday. I saw it for the first time over the week and I have been watching it over and over again. What a beautifully written story about acting gender theater illusion romance and discovery of one's own identity. During the Restoration of England under the reign of King Charles II women were finally given the freedom and right to perform on the stage whereas before the decree it was illegal and obscene for a woman to perform on stage.Ned Kynaston Billy Crudup is the greatest actor and the most beautiful woman of the English stage. He played several women's part and his most famous is the role of Desdemona in William Shakespeare's Othello. He is studied admired loved and envied by his dress keeper Maria Claire Danes. She watches from the wings and longs to act and she does so behind Kynaston's back and in low pubs before a royal official the Duke of Buckingham Ben Chaplin. Then the chain of events unfold as Maria is introduced to Charles II Rupert Everett and his mistress Nell Gwyn Zoe Tapper who then declares that women will be given the freedom to perform in theater.As Maria's fame rises and women are playing more and more of the female roles Ned Kynaston the last of his kind of actors is casted aside. As an actor and as man Kynaston had learned to suppress all masculinity in order to gain the grace and beauty of a woman. He knows only how to portray women and he is lost in learning to play male roles. But then again Maria is unable to play the role of Desdemona as a real woman. Both Kynaston and Maria fall in love and into passion as they learn from each other their own sexual identities and to channel their femininity and masculinity.I fell in love with the film's story and with the performances of Billy Crudup and Claire Danes. As Kynaston Crudup reveals vulnerability and strength as a man who discovers himself as a man and a very hot one at that through the role and eyes of being a woman. As Maria Danes is beautiful and real those tears are real! She can cry on cue and with the heartbreak of a real woman in love and envious of the man she loves. Maria is a strong forthcoming and in way a modern actress ahead of her time. She is not an Eve from All About Eve she is a Viola Delesop from Shakespeare In Love but real. The love scene between Danes and Crudup is sexy tender and passionate showing that explicit sex and nudity is not always necessary. They look into each other's sides and truly learn from each other as man and woman.This is a highly recommended film for those who love acting period pieces or just if you want to see a really good film Stage Beauty is very much the film to watch.".

Maria is a strong forthcoming and in way a modern actress ahead of her time. She is not an Eve from All About Eve she is a Viola Delesop from Shakespeare In Love but real. The love scene between Danes and Crudup is sexy tender and passionate showing that explicit sex and nudity is not always necessary. They look into each other's sides and truly learn from each other as man and woman.This is a highly recommended film for those who love acting period pieces or just if you want to see a really good film Stage Beauty is very much the film to watch.";

Rupert Everett's droll turn as the King was perfect and Claire Danes has never been more passionate and radiant. Billy Crudup's role was the most difficult of course and he handled it commendably. My favorite scene is the one where the two of them are in bed and she's asking who are you now? the man or the woman based on the position  a brilliant scene which depicts the ridiculousness of genderstereotyping with wit and charm to spare.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen Billy Crudup on stage and he can be very good. I'd say that here he's brilliant.I seem to have missed this when it played in New York and I don't know how. One might quibble over some of the....uh....eccentricities but over all this is quite amazing.There was a recent Chinese film about a boy who plays women on stage and his lover. It covered a lot of the growing up part of how a boy gets to play a woman on stage. This neatly skips that part and deals in a truly fascinating way with the aftermath.Claire Danes is a revelation. She makes you completely believe in what you're seeing. Her reaction to her environment and the fact that she is also hiding who she really is give her a realistic ability to understand the man that Crudup plays.Billy Crudup delivers a truly indelible performance as a man with the 'wrong' kind of up bringing. A pretty boy who's identified as a potential player of women's roles his entire education is built around learning the art of being a woman. He learns the part well enough to perform the role both on and off the stage and becomes very close to a member of the King's staff.I'm surprised this didn't get some academy buzz but with the gay subplot that might be understood. Richard Griffiths is a particularly smarmy but amazingly understanding Lord of the Manor. The cast gives a great rendition of life in the 1600's. They even step in what's found in the street from time to time for some good verisimilitude.The historical event that provides the focus for this story is England's King Charles ruling that women would replace men in all women's roles on the stages of England. Nell Gwynn clearly had some influence on this event. Given the times in which the events occurred and the nature of the participants Hogarths depictions of the world may well have given some impetus to the depiction of events as they are portrayed here.While parts of this are a rollicking good time there are some dramatic moments that are quite overpowering scary even. Portrayed as the reality of events the personal behaviors are entirely believable. I couldn't find a sour note in the entire story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite how much I've enjoyed some movies this summer such as The 40 Year Old Virgin and Batman Begins the lackluster movie season has made me turn to DVDs.A few nights ago I rented Stage Beauty starring Billy Crudup and Claire Daines and got a pleasant surprise. The film was a wonderful blend of comedy and drama. The story set in London circa 1660 centered around Ned Kynaston Crudup a famous bisexual actor who plays women on the Elizabethan stage. His dresser Maria Daines wishes to be an actress despite a royal decree that only men can act. Still Maria finds a loophole and under the stagename Margaret Hughes she performs impresses the mistress of the King and inspires a law that forbids men from playing women. Kynaston is therefore out of a job and blames his downfall on his former friend but of course he eventually falls in love with her. In short it's a tale of sexual politics told to perfection.I was initially skeptical about this film as I've never been a big fan of Claire Daines and though I've always found Billy Crudup attractive I've never thought of him as a great actor especially one that could convincingly portray a man who in many ways identifies himself as a woman. However both shine in this film and the chemistry between them is electrical. Their sex scene togetherin which they substitute nudity with simply kissing and running their fingers over each otherwas one of the most beautiful and sensual sex scenes I've ever seen. It probably helped that they fell for each other in real life over the course of this film prompting Crudup to leave his wife Mary LouiseParker while she was pregnant.The supporting cast of this film is stellar too. Rupert Everett is a riot as the King and unknown Zoe Tapper makes an astonishing debut as his mistress. The excellent cast paired with exquisite writing made for an entirely enjoyable film.I'm sure it must be hard to make a dramatic comedy that's as funny as it is dramatic especially when it's a period piece as well but Stage Beauty pulls it off with flair. Though on many occasions I felt totally emotionally invested in the characters especially in the stirring conclusion to the film at other times I was laughing out loud. This film is full of quotable lines and exchanges such as when the King says Why shouldn't we have women on stage? After all the French have been doing it for years and his adviser replies Whenever we're about to do something truly horrible we always say that the French have been doing it for years. Whether you are a fan of period pieces or love Billy Crudup and Claire Daines rent this film. I sincerely hope it goes down in the books as one of the most underrated films of 2004. This one was way more Oscarworthy than the pile of dung otherwise known as The Aviator. If I keep telling myself I have to buy this as I'm watching it you know it's gotta be good...well that or I have a major DVD buying problem...or both.".

Now a new precious jewel of the British cinema comes to film theatres and from my first impression it could be the best film of this year well at least until the new Harry Potter comes out.The topic is more or less familiar from Shakespeare in love It is the drama of this time when women wanted to act on stage but only men were allowed to do so. While Shakespeare in love showed this drama from a female point of view Stage Beauty deals with a man whose life falls to bits and peaces when a woman plays a woman and achieves a change of law which now allows women to act on stage.Ned Kinaston Billy Crudup is a stage beauty means A male actor who is skilled in and specialized on strictly performing female roles. He had done so for years can do it like no other and play nothing else. He is a star and the best stage beauty in London.

Maria does not only love Ned she lives for the theatre and dreams to be on stage herself. One night she borrows Ned's costumes and wig and makes her dream illegally come true on a little stage.

Kinaston sees the end of his career and drowns in despair. But it is Maria again who might save him.A fascinating tale about men in dresses women in tights and the theatre in Shakespearean England. But Stage Beauty is so much more. It is about two people whose heart belongs to the theatre and who are so deep into it that reality and fiction is sometimes a dangerous mix. It is about a man and a woman who find their way in a time where this way seems not to exist. It is dramatic sometimes wonderfully romantic and fragile very entertaining and simply beautiful.Hands down for Billy Crudup's performance This beautiful man is not bad as a woman but basically the film celebrates his male beauty. When he is on stage he's incredible and when he's off stage he's simply hot but also convincing when facing the greatest crisis of his life in his role I mean. But actually the person carrying the film is a fantastic Claire Danes. Once again she is playing Shakespeare this time not Julia but Desdemona. She is strong she is beautiful she is courageous but also sympathetic. The supporting cast is what every director and viewer can only dream of It includes Tom Wilkinson Rupert Everett Hugh Bonneville and Ben Chaplin.If you haven't seen this film yet do so it's a great experiences.

	schema:headline " Art wins over artifice Crudup and Danes triumph";
	schema:reviewBody "Stage Beauty succeeds beautifully in what any good period piece does whether set 300 years ago or 300 years from now. It takes us into that setting finds evocative characters and has them bring up plot matters that resonate. With us that is ... not necessarily with those actually living in the time depicted.I say this because the central element of the story has been described as unbelievable or unconvincing by some critics. Ned Kynaston Billy Crudup at the end of his run in playing female parts is pulled from personal and professional despair through the insight and love of Maria Claire Danes his dresser and successor  and they create a triumph out of this by bringing some real emotion to the Restoration stage.This has been decried as bringing Method acting to the 17th Century. It's nothing of the kind. Innovation is made during a fertile provocative period of history. It did take 250 years to get away from excess artifice and gesture on stage. Yet Stage Beauty makes you believe that these characters could have accomplished it in the 1660s.If you can live with that showing a success on stage that we can believe even if it couldn't actually have happened ... then you'll enjoy this story. I was riveted by the way Ned and Maria turn their mutual fortunes around.

	onyx:emotionText "Stage Beauty succeeds beautifully in what any good period piece does whether set 300 years ago or 300 years from now. It takes us into that setting finds evocative characters and has them bring up plot matters that resonate. With us that is ... not necessarily with those actually living in the time depicted.I say this because the central element of the story has been described as unbelievable or unconvincing by some critics. Ned Kynaston Billy Crudup at the end of his run in playing female parts is pulled from personal and professional despair through the insight and love of Maria Claire Danes his dresser and successor  and they create a triumph out of this by bringing some real emotion to the Restoration stage.This has been decried as bringing Method acting to the 17th Century. It's nothing of the kind. Innovation is made during a fertile provocative period of history. It did take 250 years to get away from excess artifice and gesture on stage. Yet Stage Beauty makes you believe that these characters could have accomplished it in the 1660s.If you can live with that showing a success on stage that we can believe even if it couldn't actually have happened ... then you'll enjoy this story.

But while their band may for the lack of a better word suck rest assured that this high school musical drama doesn't in fact it has plenty of spunk loads of verve and infectious spirit to make it one of most original and lively Thai films we have ever seen.Firsttime feature film director Chayanop Boonprakob is also the co writer of the film and he brings 'oomph' to what could otherwise have been a standard teenage drama about friendship falling in love and getting the girl. Koong Patchara Jirathiwat and Ped Jirayu La ongmanee are the two protagonists the former confident and ostentatious and the latter shy and reserved. But despite the differences in personality Koong and Ped have been childhood friends and it is Ped whom Koong turns to one day to start a rock band and compete in the Hotwave Music Awards for highschool bands across the country.His motivation is less than noble Koong's twinbrother Kay is a talented guitarist in a rock band called The Arena and the object of affection of many highschool girls so Koong decides to follow in Kay's footsteps partly to upstage him and partly to attract girls. The one they attract is their primaryschool classmate a sweet charming girl called Earn Natcha Nualjam whom Ped has had a crush on since they were young.In fact Boonprakob begins the film from their early childhood years when Earn lends the musically clueless Ped a cassette tape after their music class a Loso song if you must know that marks the start of Ped's feelings for Earn. Nonetheless the older Ped is equally timid to admit his feelings to either Koong or Earn and even more so when Koong declares that he likes Earn. And like any such teenage romcoms you can probably guess that Ped and Koong's affections for the same girl will turn their bond of friendship sour.Still Boonprakob and his four other writers boldly take liberties with formula by getting Koong to pluck up his courage to tell Earn his feelings halfway through the movie such that Earn will leave their band even before they start competing to join The Arena. Just as well Boonprakob doesn't miraculously turn Ped Koong and their drummer Ex Thawat Pornrattanaprasert's band into some kickass team by the end of the movie rather the trio pretty much remain true to the name of their band which is coincidentally the title of their selfcomposed song too.Sure the movie celebrates the underdog spirit but kudos to the scriptwriters for keeping their film real and not resorting to a happilyeverafter ending in order for the band to go from zero to hero. Rather the makebelieve embellishments come in the form of musicvideo interludes featuring popular Thai rockstars Pu Blackhead Big Ass Paradox So Cool and Bodyslam. Some of these references will likely be lost on a nonlocal audience but these vignettes are nonetheless colourful and entertaining.A lot of the movie's raw charm also rests on the chemistry of the young cast. Jirathiwat does go overthetop quite often but he nails most of the funny lines and the setups well. Laongmanee gives a pleasantly sensitive performance as Ped especially in portraying his character's suppressed affections for Earn. But the scenestealer here is newcomer Nualjam the daughter of veteran Thai blues axeman Laem Morrison has a natural unaffected charm and awesome musical talent on the guitar.Contrary to what its premise may suggest this is more than just a teenage drama for the highschool crowd. Indeed it celebrates the best and the worst of adolescent years standing out fitting in falling in love and most of all holding on to our dearest friendships with such exuberance and empathy that you can't quite help but be moved and stirred by it. Add to that some infectious rock tunes and this is one highspirited celebration of being the best you can be even if you may suck!www.moviexclusive.com".

I had seen the soundtrack for this film several times in the Thai record stores and was intrigued by the track list and artists who were involved. Otherwise I didn't know anything at all about the film. The album cover made me suspect it was a dumb teen comedy. But when I saw it listed in Thai Airways' AVOD system on a recent flight I decided to check it out. And I was very pleasantly surprised.Far from being a dumb comedy although there are plenty of funny moments it's really one of those unrequited love triangles. And I love those kinds of films. I'm not ashamed to admit I shed more than a few tears. The acting is excellent especially Ped. I imagine that for an actor playing that type of withdrawn shy character must be a real challenge. And while the relationship between Ped and Ern seems to be the center it's really the relationship between the boys Ped and Koong that is what holds the film together. Their break up and reunion had a palpable realness to it that really hit me. Poor Ped just can't figure out how to ask for what he wants or needs from anyone. So he is a bit isolated. You feel really sad for him when he loses the girl and the boy.The music is great. And I also enjoyed the cameos from the music stars. Definitely worth checking out!".

	schema:reviewBody "Its been quite sometime since I last saw Thai movie cause more than half the time it end up very much disappointing. The good thing was not this time this time I felt great. The movie left me with this really good heartwarming friendship bonding kind of feeling and by the end the movie it managed to make me laugh weep and enjoying myself through and through.Synopsis Like most teenage boys Ped and Koong the two best friends decide to form a band. The problem was they suck. So they decide to recruit Ex  a drummer and Earn a guitarist. Things when haywire when Koong started to fell for Earn who was Ped secret childhood crush.I must say there is nothing new in this movie. It is the story that has been told like a thousand times but something was different this time. There is a good balance in the substance and it has been executed pretty good. The story might be a little childish when compare to Western culture but it is more or less accurate to the Asian culture. I love the fact that they managed to entertain me for over two hours without forcing sex into the movie like most teen movie do. This one is about friendship.I love the casting it is one of the best thing that GTH production can do and most of the time they always able to nail in this department. All the four characters are likable the best part was they all have enough screen time for us to feel for them. I must say the group work out a whole lot better than I expected. Plus Earn is so freaking cute.Their acting might be dub as unacceptable if compare to Hollywood but I somehow don't really get distracted by it. I even love some of the expression and some of the scene they acted even it seem by force.When it comes to the technical stuff Thai movie is nothing to really speak of  it is very ordinary. But since it is Chayanop first feature films I say do is doing just fine.Another thing that can't be left out is the music accompanying this movie. It is a great combination of Thai rock music. Each song define how each characters feeling which sadly for those who doesn't understand Thai might not enjoy it as much as one should be.Overall I love this movie and will definitely be adding this to my DVD collection.Recommendation I highly recommend this movie to anyone that below 35. You will love it if you're a teenager.Rating 7.510 Grade B".

The movie left me with this really good heartwarming friendship bonding kind of feeling and by the end the movie it managed to make me laugh weep and enjoying myself through and through.Synopsis Like most teenage boys Ped and Koong the two best friends decide to form a band. The problem was they suck. So they decide to recruit Ex  a drummer and Earn a guitarist. Things when haywire when Koong started to fell for Earn who was Ped secret childhood crush.I must say there is nothing new in this movie. It is the story that has been told like a thousand times but something was different this time. There is a good balance in the substance and it has been executed pretty good. The story might be a little childish when compare to Western culture but it is more or less accurate to the Asian culture. I love the fact that they managed to entertain me for over two hours without forcing sex into the movie like most teen movie do. This one is about friendship.I love the casting it is one of the best thing that GTH production can do and most of the time they always able to nail in this department. All the four characters are likable the best part was they all have enough screen time for us to feel for them. I must say the group work out a whole lot better than I expected. Plus Earn is so freaking cute.Their acting might be dub as unacceptable if compare to Hollywood but I somehow don't really get distracted by it. I even love some of the expression and some of the scene they acted even it seem by force.When it comes to the technical stuff Thai movie is nothing to really speak of  it is very ordinary. But since it is Chayanop first feature films I say do is doing just fine.Another thing that can't be left out is the music accompanying this movie. It is a great combination of Thai rock music. Each song define how each characters feeling which sadly for those who doesn't understand Thai might not enjoy it as much as one should be.Overall I love this movie and will definitely be adding this to my DVD collection.Recommendation I highly recommend this movie to anyone that below 35. You will love it if you're a teenager.Rating 7.510 Grade B";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review SuckSeed";
	schema:reviewBody "The Thai production house GTH was probably synonymous with the horror genre until last year's romantic drama and surprise hit Hello Stranger made one sit up and take notice that they too are capable of churning out hits outside of their established genre. SuckSeed just proved once again that they are as comfortable as the Japanese in taking the zero to hero formula and coming up with an awesome coming of age tale of a group of students trying to make it to the finals of their high school rock band contest and comes complete with the requisite love story comedic antics and plenty of rock music to make up the soundtrack.Directed by first time helmer Chayanop Boonprakob SuckSeed tells the story of good friends Ped Jirayu Laongmanee and Koong Pachara Chirathivat opposites in character with the former being the shy boy nursing an infatuation toward fellow classmate Ern Nattasha Nauljam and the latter being the daring buddy with the slightest of attention spans having to dabble in plenty of hobbies but never settling for any until his envy of his twin brother Kay's success with his band Arena made him want to start his own besides the notion of assuming that being in a band will mean being an automatic chick magnet. Roping in basketballer turned drummer Ex Thawat Pornrattanaprasert the trio obviously don't have the talent necessary to entertain nor perform but that doesn't mean that they're giving up in true blue zero to eventual hero formula willing to even parody themselves by calling their band SuckSeed where first you have to suck before success will come. After all once you hit rock bottom the only way is up no?And this is the surprise package that delivered where it mattered be it the musical numbers thanks to real life Thai bands andor their frontman making cameo appearances one of my favourite Thai songs came on as the first how cool is that? the more dramatic moments or the comedy where the actors mostly first timers as well will put some veterans to shame with their exuberance. While the story was written by a host of writers it didn't fall prey to the too many cooks spoiling the broth syndrome where the end product would turn out to be rather scattered and piece meal. Rather SuckSeed proved to the contrary with the ensemble cast playing pardon the pun their hearts out in their roles.One may think of it as being quite generic at times with subplots like unrequited love teenage romance sibling rivalry and the likes that pepper movies featuring teenage characters but the delivery of its charismatic leads here more than make up for it especially between Jirayu Laongmanee and Pachara Chirathivat as best buddies and that between the former and Nattasha Nauljam in their romantic angle. Chayanop Boonprakob also utilizes different techniques to keep things varied and interesting where animation also came into play more than once to spice things up in style especially in its manga inspired moments when dealing with introducing of band members or even the rebirth of SuckSeed in phoenix style where it rose out of its ashes after two members got burnt by their failure to snag the girls they fancy and decide to pour their energies into making their band a success. Or not.Like Japan's Beck this year which also had the formation of a band as its premise and the focus on the relationships between band members SuckSeed is the Thai equivalent and powers its way into one of my favourites this year. It's a complete film as much as emotions go in its roller coaster ride where friendship romance comedy and rock all fuse together in synergy to bring forth a crowd pleaser. Highly recommended and an inspiration to those who suck  I Need You! Want You! Love You!".

It hasn't yet and I don't think it ever will I was as captivated by it as I was the first time and yet it portrays a world its people and their actions I'll never know and probably wouldn't want to know either. Some people I know can't watch any film or TV programme a second time and are puzzled when I can  but then could listen with pleasure to a piece of music for a thousandth time.Lubitsch's peerless masterpiece about two crooks Gaston and Lily moving amongst high society falling in love with each other with high society and with high society in the attractive shape of rich businesswoman Madame Colet falling in love with Gaston is a witty charming sophisticated erudite relentless sparkling etc comedy that by the finish has had the effect of defragmenting my mind and deleting the real world for a short while  no mean feat! Every second of every scene carries it's witticisms not a moment is wasted from the dignified opening with the title song fading into the rubbish boat on the Grand Canal in Venice to the swift orgasmic climax in the taxi in Paris. At the beginning when the stricken Monsieur Philiba rises and falls to the floor of his hotel room again and the Neapolitan music lulls you across a cheesy model set to where the smoking Gaston is urbanely discussing cocktails with a waiter you should know you are in for something special. Ultra demure Kay Francis gets to says Divine twice in a row! Even looking at nothing but a clock for a minute carries a soundtrack bulging with wit and innuendo. Something as unimportant as Herbert Marshall apparently running up and down Kay Francis's stairs on camera in mirrors or in sound only turns out to be an injoke  he had only one leg. Other running gags make you smile after the film has long finished such as Positively Tonsils and No Potatoes. And to think about this film even years later it's always with the lilting insistent mocking romantic background music! But I could go on and on there's enough in this for 10 films of today to borrow if they could make them like this any more. Frasier on TV has been the closest in sophisticated comedy in recent times but even so it couldn't match TIP's compact inventiveness. Out of the 97 million movies I've watched this is definitely in my top 5 favourites.It's a pity that so many people can so easily be put off by black and white photography and bygone stars who they've never heard of in this case what they're missing out on is near perfection and again another film that will still be available when all of the undisciplined uncensored inyourface films of today are forgotten.".

	schema:reviewBody "So funny sexy subtle and sublime this film only gets better with each viewing BUT it's not available in ANY format! WHY?Ernst Lubitsch used Laszlo Aladar's play The Honest Finder as a springboard for one of his most delightful early1930s Paramount confections. Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins play Gaston and Lily a pair of Parisian thieves both disguised as nobility who decide to rob lovely perfume company executive Mariette Colet Kay Francis Gaston gets a job as Mariette's confidential secretary while Lily installs herself as the woman's typist. Love rears its head forcing Gaston to choose between marriage to Mariette and a fast getaway with Lily. Filled with marvelous throwaway gags and sophisticated innuendo Trouble in Paradise was described by one critic as as close to perfection as anything I have ever seen in the movies.For over seven decades this film has been unmatched in the realm of sophisticated farce. Films from THE AWFUL TRUTH to THE LADY EVE to SOME LIKE IT HOT are sublime on their more modest social scale and in their basic Americanness. By contrast TROUBLE IN PARADISE has all the class and Continental elegance one associates with the Paramout of the 1930s. Made before the Production Code clampdown of 1934 this Lubitsch masterpiece shows his talent for sly sexual innuendo at its most witty and polished. The result is pure caviar only tastier. The story tells of two jewel thieves Gaston Marshall and Lily Hopkins who together work at bilking a merry widow Mariette Colet Francis out of a small fortune. They secure jobs as her secretary and maid but trouble begins in paradise when Gaston starts falling for his lovely prey and when one of her many suitors Horton a former victim of Gaston's begins to recognize Mme. Colet's new secretary. The many laughs in this consistently delightful souffle come not only from Raphaelson's marvelous screenplay but also from Lubitsch's supple visual wit. On one hand there's delightful repartee about a former secretary who enjoyed an antique bed a bit too much and on the other we have the sexy silhouette of Gaston and Mariette cast over a chaise lounge. From the opening shot of an operatic gondolier who turns out to be a garbageman to a police report about theft and tonsils translated for Italian officials this film is full of unforgettable moments of merriment. The cast too is peerless. In one of his earliest Hollywood efforts Herbert Marshall does the greatest work of his career. Too often maligned for playing stodgy consorts to dynamic star actresses such as Garbo Davis and Shearer Marshall here gets to display his impeccable timing and supple grace. Frequently hilarious his quiet approach and crushed velvet voice still let him remain suave throughout. Even Cary Grant would be hard pressed to match this portrayal. He'd be too frantic. Kay Francis too that popular sufferer of countless women's films with her twoublesome r's gives of her very best. With her sleek glamorous style and elegantly wry line readings she is light sexy and totally captivating. Her doorway caresses and her fingersnapping seduction of Gaston are priceless. Miriam Hopkins was luckier in that she had many more chances to display her comic flair in film. Today one of the most underrated and unfairly maligned stars of the 1930s the brittle feisty Hopkins can rattle off witty banter at a breakneck pace or she can be deliciously languorous and coy. Her enjoyment of her own sexuality is heady even today and the thieving competition between Gaston and Lily in which escalating crimes turn into escalating passion remains one of the greatest scenes of foreplay ever caught on film. Ruggles and Horton prove yet again that they are two of the greatest farceurs in Hollywood and the rest of the cast is equally choice. One standout is Leonid Kinskey whose bit as a leftist radical only foregrounds the satiric anarchy of the entire film. Beautifully handled from start to finish gleamingly shot and full of Dreier's incredible Art Deco designs TROUBLE IN PARADISE is Lubitsch's greatest film and one of the indisputable highlights of comic cinema Directed by Ernst Lubitsch the master of sophisticated comedy Trouble in Paradise 1932 is the most accomplished example of the Lubitsch Touch for stylish innuendo and sly wit. With a script by Samson Raphaelson and Grover Jones Lubitsch derives sparkling humor from the lusty PreCode love triangle among two jewel thieves Lily and Gaston and their intended victim Mme. Colet. From the opening image of a garbage gondola's gliding through the picturesque Venice canals Lubitsch makes light of the notion that amorality lies beneath the glossy exteriors of the rich. Elegantly sending up idealized movie romance Gaston and Lily fall in love as they attempt to rob each other blind over an intimate dinner sealing a bond between two scoundrels. Such Lubitsch details as a hand's hanging a Do Not Disturb sign on a doorknob and the shadow of a couple cast on a bed neatly communicate the nature of Gaston's relationships with Lily and Mme. Colet complementing the clever dialogue spiked with nimble comeons and ripostes and delivered with aplomb by Herbert Marshall Miriam Hopkins and Kay Francis. Praised for its smoothly imaginative technique and comic invention Trouble in Paradise burnished Lubitsch's reputation as Paramount's premier purveyor of 1930s Continental class and it is still considered one of the best adult comedies ever made.".

Films from THE AWFUL TRUTH to THE LADY EVE to SOME LIKE IT HOT are sublime on their more modest social scale and in their basic Americanness. By contrast TROUBLE IN PARADISE has all the class and Continental elegance one associates with the Paramout of the 1930s. Made before the Production Code clampdown of 1934 this Lubitsch masterpiece shows his talent for sly sexual innuendo at its most witty and polished. The result is pure caviar only tastier. The story tells of two jewel thieves Gaston Marshall and Lily Hopkins who together work at bilking a merry widow Mariette Colet Francis out of a small fortune. They secure jobs as her secretary and maid but trouble begins in paradise when Gaston starts falling for his lovely prey and when one of her many suitors Horton a former victim of Gaston's begins to recognize Mme. Colet's new secretary. The many laughs in this consistently delightful souffle come not only from Raphaelson's marvelous screenplay but also from Lubitsch's supple visual wit. On one hand there's delightful repartee about a former secretary who enjoyed an antique bed a bit too much and on the other we have the sexy silhouette of Gaston and Mariette cast over a chaise lounge. From the opening shot of an operatic gondolier who turns out to be a garbageman to a police report about theft and tonsils translated for Italian officials this film is full of unforgettable moments of merriment. The cast too is peerless. In one of his earliest Hollywood efforts Herbert Marshall does the greatest work of his career. Too often maligned for playing stodgy consorts to dynamic star actresses such as Garbo Davis and Shearer Marshall here gets to display his impeccable timing and supple grace. Frequently hilarious his quiet approach and crushed velvet voice still let him remain suave throughout. Even Cary Grant would be hard pressed to match this portrayal. He'd be too frantic. Kay Francis too that popular sufferer of countless women's films with her twoublesome r's gives of her very best. With her sleek glamorous style and elegantly wry line readings she is light sexy and totally captivating. Her doorway caresses and her fingersnapping seduction of Gaston are priceless. Miriam Hopkins was luckier in that she had many more chances to display her comic flair in film. Today one of the most underrated and unfairly maligned stars of the 1930s the brittle feisty Hopkins can rattle off witty banter at a breakneck pace or she can be deliciously languorous and coy. Her enjoyment of her own sexuality is heady even today and the thieving competition between Gaston and Lily in which escalating crimes turn into escalating passion remains one of the greatest scenes of foreplay ever caught on film. Ruggles and Horton prove yet again that they are two of the greatest farceurs in Hollywood and the rest of the cast is equally choice. One standout is Leonid Kinskey whose bit as a leftist radical only foregrounds the satiric anarchy of the entire film. Beautifully handled from start to finish gleamingly shot and full of Dreier's incredible Art Deco designs TROUBLE IN PARADISE is Lubitsch's greatest film and one of the indisputable highlights of comic cinema Directed by Ernst Lubitsch the master of sophisticated comedy Trouble in Paradise 1932 is the most accomplished example of the Lubitsch Touch for stylish innuendo and sly wit. With a script by Samson Raphaelson and Grover Jones Lubitsch derives sparkling humor from the lusty PreCode love triangle among two jewel thieves Lily and Gaston and their intended victim Mme. Colet. From the opening image of a garbage gondola's gliding through the picturesque Venice canals Lubitsch makes light of the notion that amorality lies beneath the glossy exteriors of the rich. Elegantly sending up idealized movie romance Gaston and Lily fall in love as they attempt to rob each other blind over an intimate dinner sealing a bond between two scoundrels. Such Lubitsch details as a hand's hanging a Do Not Disturb sign on a doorknob and the shadow of a couple cast on a bed neatly communicate the nature of Gaston's relationships with Lily and Mme. Colet complementing the clever dialogue spiked with nimble comeons and ripostes and delivered with aplomb by Herbert Marshall Miriam Hopkins and Kay Francis. Praised for its smoothly imaginative technique and comic invention Trouble in Paradise burnished Lubitsch's reputation as Paramount's premier purveyor of 1930s Continental class and it is still considered one of the best adult comedies ever made.";

It is an injustice that this film is shown so rarely. I would recommend to TCM that they show their classics less frequently and a number of less wellknown films such as this more often.Trouble in Paradise is a comedy counterpart to a melodrama it is a romantic melocomedy. It is unlike any other Lubitsch film with which I am familiar. In fact it is difficult for me to think of any film with which to compare this masterpiece. The cast is outstanding each delivering dialog in mock melodramatic style. The soundtrack the editing and especially the sublime writing all combine to produce a unique satirical melodrama parody. Perhaps this film was the model for many later films that hoped to attain the same comic irony but seem humorless to me. The key seems to be that the actors do not take themselves seriously but they portray characters who do.Everything about this film is fabulous. I cannot fathom how anybody could suggest this film is outdated in any manner because it captures the ambiance of an era so perfectly. The era is past but not this film! Do period films made today seem outdated to them? I do not need to heap redundant praise on a film that other commentators have described so well. So that you know where I'm coming from  I admit to being a HUGE Lubitsch fan. The Shop Around the Corner and Ninotchka are also among my very favorite films.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the height of the depression while one half of Hollywood was making movies devastatingly close to home the other half were breezily European in their settings and sensibilities. This was the case at Paramount in particular who imported many of their directors from the continent and deliberately cultivated that sophisticated European flavour. German maestro Ernst Lubitsch was the most treasured of their acquisitions and during the early 1930s fulfilled the studio's expectations for urbane comedies set among the idle and relatively carefree rich of faroff Europe.Lubitsch is  and was  best known for his socalled touch a subtle tasteful and very intelligent manner of hinting at the various sexual shenanigans that his characters continually get up to. But it is doing the man rather a disservice to focus so much on this as there was a lot more to his style and to his career. Besides a lot of the credit for the touch should go to writer Samson Raphaelson as it was in the Raphelsonpenned works when this clever innuendo was at its sharpest. The humour in Trouble in Paradise is all of a bytheway fashion with bizarrely comical phrases slipped neatly into the dialogue. What Lubitsch really does is match up with Raphaelson's sauciness on the visual side of things dissolving from Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins canoodling on a couch to the same couch now empty to a Do not disturb sign being hung on a door. But it's not all about sex. What's nice about Trouble in Paradise is that despite the protagonists being a pair of thieves we never see anything stolen. The thefts are just implied with a nonchalant revelation after the event.Consistently Lubitsch's visual style is throughout one of taste and elegance. Lubitsch's sound films up to now had mostly been musicals and although Trouble in Paradise is not a musical it is almost operatic in its stylised pace often alternating between slow and fast scenes like the movements of a work of classical music. Lubitsch doesn't use many elaborate techniques but simply manages the pace through careful coaching of the actors' motion and vocal delivery. The camera rarely moves but when he does it is generally a discreet flourish to maintain the necessary rhythm. An example is when we cut from Kay Francis nattering on the phone straight into Marshall and Hopkins arguing. The shot begins with the camera dollying in on the pair keeping the snappy pace going across the two scenes. The opening scene is smooth as a gondola on the water the camera languidly tracking from the rubbish of the city to the aftermath of a robbery over to an gorgeous shot of Herbert Marshall  gazing out from a balcony with a look of exquisite melancholy in his eyes.Which leads me onto the players themselves. It is always a joy to watch Herbert Marshall one of the best lead men of the 30s who has become something of an obscurity today. He is utterly suited to the style and pace of Trouble in Paradise his movements elegant as a violinist playing largo and his voice quiet yet commanding of our attention. He is superbly matched in an oppositesattract scenario by a vivacious Miriam Hopkins. These days Hopkins is often dismissed as an amateurish ham but as Trouble in Paradise demonstrates she did everything with a pinch of deliberate irony. I love the way she fires off angry tirades her face almost rigid except for the occasional fiery flash of an eyebrow. Kay Francis the third corner in the love triangle is stunningly beautiful but otherwise rather bland and forgettable although perhaps this is the point. As to the supporting players Edward Everett Horton is always nice to see although he is a bit underused here and clearly hadn't quite worked out his brilliant comic persona yet. C. Aubrey Smith on the other hand as familiar a face in thirties Hollywood as Ned Sparks is at his very best. Being a pompous villain seems to suit him far better than the venerable patriarchs he usually portrayed.Movies like Trouble in Paradise were popular of course because they offered escapism at a time of domestic strife. Today it remains a smart witty and very beautifully made confection. It is of course not nearly as touching as the raw emotion and sincerity of Warner Brothers' and Columbia's depressionera offerings but it is nevertheless utterly enjoyable undemanding and treats us to the same delicate atmosphere of continental wit that it did to audiences of the time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Trouble In Paradise was the first talkie romantic comedy that Ernst Lubitsch made for Hollywood. Prior to this he made many very funny silents and a couple of dramas and musicals. But it was on Trouble in Paradise where his directorial strengths came into play. With Noel Cowardlike sophistication and Howard Hawkslike timing Lubitsch rewrites the rules of romantic comedy. While this film may not be as wellknown as his Ninotchka or To Be Or Not To Be it is certainly funnier and more sexually suggestive.Lubitsch is at his best when he has his leads Herbert Marshall Miriam Hopkins and Kay Francis just banter between themselves. His suggestive actions and subtleties are far funnier than straight slapstick.Marshall and Hopkins are a couple of con artists who meet while trying to con each other. They fall in love and get married. They then fall into an opportunity to con Francis. Francis and Marshall fall in love and you can probably guess the rest of the plot.The cast is first rate. Marshall walks through this film never losing his sense of sophistication even when he knows the jig is up. Hopkins turns on the charm as needed and is hilarious in a small bit with Eva McKenzie at the top of the film. Francis is beautiful as their high spending foil.Nice work is also turned in by Charlie Ruggles Edward Everett Horton and C. Aubrey Smith. And when is it not nice to see Robert Greig play another butler? I must admit that until I saw this film the other night I was not too familiar with it. I had heard and read about it but never seen it. I'm so grateful that after 35 years of movie watching that there are so many gems out there that I can still discover and enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why isn't this film out on Video or DVD? It is a masterpiece of subtlety and wit that has to be out there for people to study and learn from instead of being 'out of circulation.' Can you imagine Chaplin's 'Gold Rush' or 'Modern Times' being out of circulation? No. Well this is a better overall film than anything Chaplin ever put out and mawkishly undermined with sentimentality but only film buffs  who go to rare screenings get to see it. It is not so much a laugh riot like Chaplin's best bits as it is extremely clever to the point of being transcendent. Its tone reminds me very much of Jean Renoir's 1939 'Rules of the Game' and Bunuel's comedies although it doesn't have Bunuel's 'cruelty' as master critic Andre Bazin would put it.  It is just a work of art which most 'nonartsy' people will dismiss as 'just another clever comedy' because works of art annoy them and they don't see why they should be bothered with applying the energy needed to understand them while 'artsy' people will overrate it and rightly so. Overrated or not Lubitch's film is a joy to behold you are glad it exists. As you're watching you know you're being hit with valuable notnecessarily verbal information left and right. You know it's worth reseeing many times because you will get a different blend of perspectives from it everytime much like a great piece of music. The essence of what makes it 'great' as opposed to 'just another comedy' is this  'Trouble in Paradise' completely destroys harmful romantic myths while affirming true romanticism think Stendhal Proust Lessing Nabokov in the very way it is made its style. This is what it does and it is an extremely important and purifying process for those who go through it and implicitly embrace its implicit principles. But as it is nobody'll get to see it anyway because it's not out on video so what the hell am I writing for? To get all 3 of the people who will read this page in the next year to demand that it be put out for public consumption. Long live democracy!".

I contend that Miriam Hopkins and Kay Francis in this film are sexier and more alluring than any of the hotties on the screen today. Today's hotties are great but belong in the softporn category  they have to show a lot more skin to achieve half the effect that a Hopkins or a Francis or a Bergman could achieve with a well placed subtle smile or glance.Kay Francis steals this film and that's hard to do when competing with Miriam Hopkins.

	schema:reviewBody "To heap more phrase on this film seems somewhat superfluous in light of the previous viewer comments...but I just can't resist!  I saw this film for the first time this past May thanks to TCM.  I have not been able to stop watching it since.  It's such a pleasure to see a film where the special effects do not become the entire reason for its existence.  The dialogue is snappy and fast like a backandforth tennis volley with a bite and a sharpness sadly lacking in today's movies.  The cast is superb.  Kay Francis is typical Kay Francis with an understated sadness about her.  Miriam Hopkins is terrific both sharp and perky usually I hate that word but it does describe her here!.  And Herbert Marshall is simply superb...both suave and enjoyable.  The essence of a great cast to me has always been an ability by the actors to make you really believe that they are who they are playing  a task which everyone here accomplishes!  Again it's just such a pleasure to see a film that doesn't insult one's intelligence that doesn't play only for the suburban teenager or the lowest common denominator moviewatcher.         A test for me has always been whether I leave a film wishing there was more.  Well two minutes after seeing Trouble I found myself wishing that there had been a sequel showing Gaston's and Lily's adventures on say an early 1930's transatlantic crossing.  Oh well.  I hope that the forthcoming DVD version does justice to this great comedy.  If you like movies intelligent movies with a slyness please see this film. And the last scene of Trouble in Paradise has become one of my very favorite endings in cinema!!".

There's something about his films that's common to all of them but is very hard to describe. It has something to do with tone  all of his films feel like they're perfectly balanced between humor sentimentality pathos and melancholy. They're funny but none of them feel like insignificant fluff there's an underlying strain of melancholy running through all of them yet none of them make the mistake of taking the world too seriously.

It may come as a surprise to some but the film bears a lot of resemblances to Hitchcock films particularly Rear Window. Miriam Hopkins is absolutely delightful here and the film is also a strong influence on Billy Wilder's work particularly Some Like It Hot! Trouble in Paradise is a precode film and Ernst Lubitsch is brilliant enough to let A LOT slip under the radar. I love the Harem sequence.

	schema:reviewBody "For cinema of this era I go to Pabst for ecstatic hovering out of self the self that finds itself at the mercy of narratives a true master that filmmakers like Lynch are still tapping into the potential of what he showed. Sternberg gives me feverish exaggeration of the same a kind of grotesque sculpting in emotional air. Pabst seeks to transcend the constraints imposed by fictitious reality on self Sternberg gives into the anguish they create. Lang turns these same constraints into monumental machinery that strike awe but his way is much less interesting overall I think. And then there's this other maker who made the leap from Germany to Hollywood. Yet another way of dealing with fictitious reality here. With Lubitsch I come for the joyous dismantling of expectation the constraints of fictions our expectation that story plays out a certain way are marvelously upended opening us up to paradox and surprise. Here fictions are fanciful guises we put on to push each other the constraints are opportunities for improvisation. There's this famed thing people call the Lubitsch 'touch' often in vague terms of exaltation as any synonym for mastery. It's a specific thing he masters spontaneous illogicality. You'll see a great demonstration in just the opening sequence here. It's one I'll keep with me when needing to discuss Lubitsch. A man lies unconscious in a dark empty apartment at night something sinister has happened. Now cut to a man and woman meeting in another place. They're both royalty we find out baron and countess. She had to sneak in there to meet him improper mischief is implied a desire to conceal. Soon we understand that neither is who we thought they were and the place where they meet is right next door to the unconscious man.It's a small masterstroke in pushing back horizon with just a few gestures. Like when the man gets up angry at having been found out locks the door draws the curtains we imagine violence is coming. But they sit right back to eat kindred souls delighted in each other's brilliant boldness of playacting. The rest of the film flows by with much the same playacting. We see a woman being set up to be conned a rich Parisienne who scoffs at the men who desire her but falls for his suave charm. He insinuates himself into her home and begins controlling a story fictitious reality. The suave charm of the film lies in seeing him ever the cunning narrator con his way out of difficult situations that might expose him while the noose tightens around him. Eventual unmaskings come with a certain largesse of heart that can only come by the hand of a filmmaker who sees fictitious reality as one large stage play and revels in the illusoriness of it all. It beats sulking into a corner taking the caprices of human behavior to heart. So no hard feelings on her part at having been set up with fictitious romance. She shoos them out like mischievous kids. In turn he regrets that he couldn't split himself in two and leave one self behind to live a life with her. Herbert Marshall has more ruthless eyes than needed to convey longing here or perhaps the point is that he cannot resist feigning to the end but he's superb as wily narrator.But how about this notion as well. His girlfriend partner in crime has been in on the con all along disguised as secretary in the same house. Had she not caved in to jealousy at the last moment they would have pulled their plot clean off. It's this outpour of impulsive self that destroys the fiction and allows us to have the generous letting go of.".

Of course I taped it and of course I've practically worn the tape out by now a month later.Point 2 something is terribly wrong in Paradise if the peak era of his work 2933 remains in shadow today. Where are the VHSDVD releases of these wonderful films? Nowhere that I can find them hopefully the good folks at Turner will continue reviving the early sound Lubitsches. I waited 25 years to see this one again and the wait was not in vain. Those 25 years put a bit of snow on my roof but they also allowed me to drink in the ambrosia that is this film with a bit more appreciation than I had at 16. And what intoxicating ambrosia it is! Script performances directorial vision are all exquisite. The leads are inspired oh for a night with Kay Francis! the supporting players expertly calibrated farceurs. The utilization of music as ironic counterpoint to the visuals rivals Clair the title song sung over the opening credits will make your heart race and break at the same time. And the look of the film Art Deco lovingly handrubbed to a burnished glow will linger with you forever.Again and again Lubitsch pulls rabbits out of hats scenes like the deepening of Herbert Marshall and Kay Francis' relationship from business to pleasure 'seen' in a clock face are emblematic of what makes this such a special film. Its story is slight frothy very nearly silly yet Lubitsch's knowing observation of small telling details makes it magical. TROUBLE is not a timeless film anchored as it is to a very specific time Long Ago and place Far Away which only deepens its charm and its seductive tugging on the audience's sleeve. I've watched it three times in a night and three times more the following night  not behavior I usually exhibit. But the siren call of its lively civilized wit is such that I'm hitting 'rewind' the moment it ends  I don't want to break the spell and return to reality just yet. As fertile as the preCode era is as many classics as that golden period continues to yield up to those willing to discover them...TROUBLE IN PARADISE is the most glorious of them all.".

If there's a message to be derived from the movie it's probably Gay people have problems too! Incidentaly that would've also served as a better title for the film as well!Daniel did seem a bit ill at ease during some of the more gayer scenes. But then again who wouldn't with an entire film crew and possibly his girlfriend on the set watching your every move. Give the guy a break. Of course Daniel wasn't the only one in the film. The other actors I felt played their parts to a tee! PS Daniel Letterle... do some more musicals!! ".

Incidentaly that would've also served as a better title for the film as well!Daniel did seem a bit ill at ease during some of the more gayer scenes. But then again who wouldn't with an entire film crew and possibly his girlfriend on the set watching your every move. Give the guy a break. Of course Daniel wasn't the only one in the film. The other actors I felt played their parts to a tee! PS Daniel Letterle... do some more musicals!! ";

George Bamber takes on his first directing role and uses a comic strip Eric Orner translated for the screen by David Vernon and populates his movie with an attractive cast of men and women and ably manages to make the individual frames of a comic strip almost become a smooth storyline.Ethan Green the talented Daniel Letterle has problems with relationships he has been in many from Juarez Ramon De Ocampo who still lives with Ethan's gay boy loving mother Harper Meredith Baxter to previously closeted baseball player Leo Diego Serrano to Kyle David Monahan to the very young Punch Dean Shelton. The crux of the story revolves around the difficulty of selling Leo's house and the ways in which the various exlovers interact provides the somewhat frustrating line of dialogue.Comic relief is supplied by two elderly gentlemen known as the Hat Sisters Joel Brooks and Richard Riehle as well as the shenanigans of the real estate people. Of course we know from the beginning who will end up with whom but the getting there is fairly fun. The cast obviously has such a good time with the film that they forget to enunciate and so much of the dialogue is swallowed. But they are all fun to watch so it matters little that the superficial aspects of the story remain sub rosa. Grady Harp October 06".

	schema:reviewBody "In THE MOSTLY UNFABULOUS SOCIAL LIFE OF ETHAN GREEN there is one great laugh As two of the characters argue with each other in a bookstore all the shelves are packed tight except the one marked Lesbian Humor which only has one volume. Okay it's not a great laugh but it is a nice little chuckle. And the viewers should be grateful for that because otherwise as a romantic comedy ETHAN GREEN is pretty skimpy with both the romance and the comedy.Based on a cult gay comic strip of the same name ETHAN GREEN seems to be trying to say something socially relevant about contemporary gay relationships. And while the film isn't wanting in imagination or even inspiration it regrettably reflects its comic strip source by being strangely flat and two dimensional. The jokes are there but like Eric Orner's artwork in the original comics they are drawn with little style or depth or skill.Ethan is an unluckyinlove selfproclaimed serial monogamist. At 26 an age when most men  whether gay or straight  are searching for anything other than a lifetime romanticsexual commitment Ethan is going through a midlife crisis worrying about his biological clock and a fear of dying an old maid. Despite his almost desperate desire to find his soulmate the has an equally desperate need to find something wrong with every potential Mr. Right. Both things seem to preoccupy his every waking thought but then again Ethan doesn't seem to have anything else going on his life such as a job. And even his strangely anonymous suburban home is devoid of evidence of his existence without so much as a MOULIN ROUGE! movie poster or a Streisand album in sight to indicate a gay man is on the premises.As played by Daniel Letterle with an almostcampy almostswishiness Ethan is clearly a gay stereotype yet he remains curiously devoid of a personality. Surrounded by nonstereotypical characters who nonetheless have obvious personality quirks that define them Ethan is arguably the least interesting character in the story. His lovers past and present include a hot Latino boytoy to whom Ethan's mother plays fag hag a nerdy bookstore owner a freshoutofthecloset professional jock and a 19yearold sexually adventurous twink all of whom are hung up on Ethan to some degree  though God knows why. There is also a gay Republican which the story treats as a perpetual joke and the less said about The Hat Sisters a pair of burly aging transvestites the better. We are supposed to wonder which of these guys Ethan will ultimately pick though we also might rightly wonder which one will ultimately get stuck with Ethan. Ethan's focus seems to be on avoiding the wrong choice and not making the right one a subtle but telling difference.The strangest thing about the film is that Ethan is this unfunny dead weight at the center of everything. Virtually everybody else is almost joyously upbeat like Meredith Baxter as Ethan's mom whose acceptance of her son's homosexuality has inspired her to be a wedding planner for civil unions. Even Rebecca Lowman as Sunny Deal a chronically depressed lesbian real estate agent manages to make her character's suicidal depression amusing. And an especially bright light in the film is Dean Shelton as Punch Epstein the twink who is still high on being out and sees gay sex as a game with few rules and endless possibilities. If someone in the film has to be deemed fabulous Shelton's performance earns him the right. It's just a pity the film isn't THE MOSTLY FABULOUS SEXUAL LIFE OF PUNCH EPSTEIN. It is not just that Ethan is such a sadsack  the whole point being that his pessimism is an island in a sea of optimism. But Letterle who made such a winning impression in CAMP brings no charisma to Ethan and thus no focus. And I don't think it is entirely Letterle's fault since he seems to be playing the part as written. For instance when Ethan decides at the last minute to break up a wedding he stops midpoint to browse a catalogue and place a phone order. Funny? Yeah sorta. But at what cost to the story? Despite a few discreetly suggestive sex scenes there is no passion let alone urgency to the story or between any of the characters. For a movie filmed in less than two weeks ETHAN GREEN is surprisingly well made technically but firsttime director George Bamber can't conjure up any eagerness to please. Likewise in the end Ethan doesn't seem to find Mr. Right so much as Mr. Alright. If neither Ethan nor the film are fabulous it is because neither have made the effort.".

David Vernon's writing was creative. Acting by all was real and sometimes surprising even the Hat Sisters were believable. Rebecca Lowman played a convincing basket case. Dean Shelton playing Punch was hilarious he did a impressive job portraying every persons young impetuous self. I loved Meredith Baxter she plays such a remarkable non judgmental mom. This is a entertaining fun night out at the movies. I saw it first in New York and can't wait to see it again.";

Well writtenacteddirectedproduced  the only trouble for me is that the film isn't consistent. Starts out as regular comedy with asides then tries to add grand farce and bouffe elements and it never really comes together. Plus if you want to have farcical elements you need a speed and intensity in cutting that this film doesn't quite get to. And there are a few non sequiturs which may be because my hearing isn't the best and there are no subtitles. On one hand I liked the playing with the stereotypes e.g. elevator scene towards the end yet found slightly irritating the glasses on  glasses off clich. Loved the treatment of the Hat Sisters. I also like the constant references to characters who never appear.On another level I liked the film because it said something to me on a personal level at this time in my own life The Ethan Reflex. Not that there's a message per se but there happened to be a message for ME in Baxter's words of wisdom to Letterle.A possibly shallow comment from me is that while the actor playing Punch is a wonderful actor and nails the character totally he doesn't quite physically match my expectation. Sorry but then I'm as shallow as they come sometimes.If you're looking for Letterle nude shots or suggestive shots or looking for soft porn forget it. Though there are some underwear shots for the desperate. But if you're looking for a decent movie that stands on its own check it out.".

For starters Green has black hair in the striphe's light brown here. Also the actor playing him was clearly NOT gay and seemed very nervous and unsure of how to play it. He's also the most annoying whiny guy I've ever seenhalf way through the film I wanted to slap him to shut him up. His friends are even more annoying then him and his romantic complications are predictable and stupid.The only bright spots in this mess are the Hat Sisters the only ones who give a performance and seeing Meredith Baxter she's not good but that's not her fault. So basically the script is terrible you get a character you could care less about and most of the acting is lousy. I saw this at a Gay Film Festival and the audience sat there in dead silence. It's no wonder this isn't getting released. I give it a 1.".

The problem was that they picked the wrong material to make a movie from and the wrong actor to build a movie around. Daniel Letterle is just plain wrong for Ethan he comes across as too nelly and too stupid and his body type and hair coloring are also wrong. The rest of the performances are adequate or what you would expect from a low budget movie put together in a few weeks. Again the problem is both the script and the direction. It's basically a bad sitcom level plot strung together over a 2.5 episode arc to make it into a movie level movie.Some of the other aspects in the movie the interstellar romance Ethan has or the Hat Sisters would have made a better full length feature but the producers probably felt that what limited audience it could get would be with the hints of nudity and romance. Unfortunately they just leave you cold especially in this day and age when porn is so readily available and better romance can be viewed for free in short films on Logo to name just one outlet.Frankly given that they were able to make something as unfunny as Queer Duck into an animated feature which actually was helped by a full length story it would have made far more sense for Ethan to also have been an animated feature and also would have allowed for far more opportunity for the more interesting aspects of the comic strip to be filmed.".

	schema:reviewBody "This sensational 1931 precode classic is the first of three films based on the play by Pulitzer Prizewinning playwright Robert E. Sherwood who felt the film had improved on his play. Carl Laemmle Jr. charge of production since 1929 son of Carl Laemmle founder of Universal Pictures bought the rights to Waterloo Bridge in early 1931 and initially felt none of the director's under contract with Universal could pull off a film adaptation of the play. However he had seen the littleknown film based on a play by playwright R.C. Sheriff entitled Journey's End 1930 which featured a volatile setting and theme of World War I. It was the first film directed by the then relatively unknown James Whale who had directed the play in New York and London as well. He was hired by Laemmle to direct Waterloo Bridge however Whale found himself uncertain about the original screenplay which he demanded for a new screenwriter. Benn W. Levy and Tom Reed wrote a new screenplay bringing the story back to a drama film instead of a war movie. With Universal having serious difficulties financially Laemmle reportedly gave Whale an insignificant budget of 250000 and only 26day's to shoot the film.Rose Hobart a Universal contract player had been originally given the part of Myra Deauville a chorus girl but when she discovered that the studio was not renewing her contract she regrettably refused to do the film. Whale chose then Columbia contract player Mae Clarke to replace Hobart. Laemmle agreed to cast Clarke from her recent popularity in The Public Enemy. Her costar would be Douglass Montgomery appearing as Kent Douglass as the roll of Roy Cronin an American soldier under Royal Canadian Forces. Even though they were filming on a tight schedule with Montgomery being heavily inexperienced Whale would take three days out of production just to work with him. The film also features a 23year old Bette Davis in a small roll as Cronin's sister Janet. It would be Davis' third and final film with Universal before signing a sevenyear deal with Warner Bros.Waterloo Bridge opens with a fantastic shot of a stage show and the individual shots of the chorines are brilliant with each looking smutty and profane. Afterwards Myra backstage singers and dancers making lots of noise in their underwear saids goodbye to her gig as a chorus girl. Myra becomes stranded in England after her show closes at the beginning of World War I. A couple of years past Myra is on the streets selling her body to the soldiers who spill out from the Waterloo Station. During an air raid in London Roy meets Myra and falls in love with her unaware she is a prostitute. Montgomery's Roy is a handsome blonde but in many ways is clueless. He's certainly a likable heartfelt young man who is much too dull to identify a prostitute when he sees one. Clarke plays Myra as a intelligent woman but frightened secretly unhappy and susceptible to outbursts. Really Clarke amazingly complies Myra's conflicted emotions and impulses in a courageous portrayal of a woman horribly suffering. She believes herself to be nothing but trash and she's wrong  just as Roy's mother Mrs. Mary Cronin Wetherby Enid Bennett believes herself to be a fine woman.Whale's direction was truly incredible as he added a delicate mixture of realism and impressionism but what makes Waterloo Bridge is Clarke's astonishing performance and the very real chemistry between her and costar Montgomery Whale stages the dialogue with great sophistication and slyness. Clarke will always be remembered as the wife Elizabeth of Dr. Henry Frankenstein in the 1931 Frankenstein also directed by Whale and for the girl that received half a grapefruit in the face by James Cagney in The Public Enemy 1931. However in Waterloo Bridge she proves to be more than just that as she gives a striking performance that even twotime Academy Award winner Vivien Leigh herself couldn't come close to matching in the restrained 1940 remake. Of course she was never a staple name like Leigh however she is simply a pleasure to watch as the main character  without question the finest performance of her unfortunate career. James Whale's 1931 Waterloo Bridge is vastly superior to the 1940 remake as well as the 1956 remake Gaby.".

	schema:reviewBody "I never thought I would enjoy this production of Waterloo Bridge more than the 1940 remake with Robert Taylor and Vivien Leigh.  For one thing this version is a straight narrative which is more suspenseful than the flashback construction of the remake.  Secondly Kent Douglass has that boyish quality which makes his naivet much more believable than Robert Taylor's.  And finally the pacing and casting of the supporting actors by James Whale couldn't be beat. Ethel Griffies as the heartless landlady Enid Bennett as Douglass' sympathetic but forceful mother and Doris Lloyd Clarke's practical but unfeeling prostitute friend were all standouts. I had never seen Mae Clarke in such a strong dramatic role which she handles more beautifully than I ever thought she could conveying her anguish at loving a man but being ashamed of having become a prostitute. And of course there is Bette Davis in a small inconsequential role very early in her career she was still a pleasure to watch.  By all means see this film!  You won't regret it.".

This  precode version holds up beautifully and is better in many ways because of its frankness and because of Mae Clarke's ferocious performance. Kent Douglas plays the 19 year old soldier who falls in love with the prostitute not realizing her true profession.The movie seems more realistic than the remake because Douglas looks  and acts like a callow 19 year oldand Clarke is very believable as the prostitute who tries to protect her soldier  lover from the truth about herself. Neither Clarke nor Douglas became major stars and you can see that they lack the larger than life glamour of Vivian Leigh and Robert Taylor who starred in the remake.However Clarke and Douglas add a touch of realism which  was  a hallmark of many of the precode movies and which wouldn't be found in American movies in abundance until the 1970's.".

Set in London during World War I directed by the man who directed the original and also amazing Frankenstein and with photography by the less known but first rate Arthur Edeson Frankenstein yes but also Casablanca no less. And throw in an astonishing actress Mae Clarke and you can see why it doesn't falter. She plays a struggling chorus girl and prostitute with snappy lively believability. The lead male Douglass Montgomery playing a sweet hearted American soldier is also a surprise face totally charming a perfect complement to Clarke. As characters the young soldier's bright optimism brings out the best in the struggling but good hearted street girl.The story is fast and not completely predictable and has a blowout of an ending really nice. Though set in the teens it feels modern maybe too modern historically. I never knew that London had a kind of Blitz experience in WWI just as they would a decade after this film was released and looking it up I found the Germans used zeppelins over London in the first war much the same was as they did with planes in WWIIto demoralize the civilian population. It adds tense excitement to the film throughout and to the last scenes in particular even if it isn't completely realistic for some reason people don't scramble for cover even as the bombs are being dropped maybe to portray that stiff upper lip thing. Is this just a silly romance? No no way not when the two actors in it are so fresh and convincing giving sparkling nuanced performances miles away from the stiffness we associate with early sound films or with many silent movies. This is a first rate and fast movie and honest only 79 minutes long with fully formed soundtrack and solid supporting cast including a young Betty Davis who is already confident and familiar as the sister of the leading man. The LeRoy remake of 1940 is a testimony to the strength of the story and it is also really good. But if you want to see an early gem on its own terms here it is. Highly recommended.".

What I appreciated most is that the story is not about a conflict between bad and good characters. Rather it's about the inner conflict of Myra who hates herself so she can't accept the love of another man. The mirror scene when she puts on her make up before she walks the streets is amazing in that respect. In the mirror we see her on one hand through the look of the others of her 'clients' as well of us the spectators who see in her only the prostitute. On the other hand it is also her own look at that part of herself which she hates. So one could say that she sees herself through the others. I like this 'lacanian' logic though it may seem presumptuous.As well the final scene where they kiss while in the background London is bombarded by a zeppelin is great. There seems to be a relation between the war and the strange love affair which is only possible in a world which is out of control.The second thing I noticed was that there are many long shots and just a few close ups. So it has an incredibly realistic look. It reminded me somehow of the films by Ingmar Bergmann who as far as I remember also tried to explore the torn subject.The ending is erratic. Why is she killed? Is it a punishment from god? For me it seems a bit like it because we see in the last scene the fur again which Myra had received from a 'client' in the first scene. So it could be read as a symbol for her greed or her morally wrong decision leaving the theater that led her astray. But her death could be also read as a 'carpe diem' motif which points again at the war that confronts the human being with the possibility of a sudden unexpected unjustified death by accident.It is exactly this moral ambiguity which makes this a great movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Turner Classic Film network was showing several before the Hays Code films from the 1930s last night and I was able to watch this 1931 version of the Robert Sherwood play WATERLOO BRIDGE. Actually this version is closer to the original written with the background of World War I in mind than the classic 1940 Robert Taylor  Vivian Leigh version. But the latter has gotten exactly that status  it is a classic film because Leigh was the star of the horizon at that moment in 1940. She just won the Oscar for Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND and this gave the studio the impetus to pull out the stops. Top notch cast and director as well as better film productions assets. Ironically looking at the cast for the 1931 film it suffers. Yes it is by James Whale...but his best recalled films are FRANKENSTEIN THE INVISIBLE MAN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN  hardly love stories. He did do the 1936 SHOWBOAT but that seems an accident to his career. Such is the damage a good reputation can sometimes do to fully appreciate everything that the person did to earn his or her reputation.The stars of this are Douglas Montgomery here named Kent Douglas and Mae Clarke. Mae is immortal for one moment on film. In the middle of an argument over breakfast with her bored boyfriend Jimmy Cagney in PUBLIC ENEMY he pushes a grapefruit into her face! She was a fine actress but hardly of star quality. As for Montgomery he was an above capable performer too but his smooth blond bland features did not go very far. I suppose his best known part was in Katherine Hepburn's LITTLE WOMEN as Laurie the boy in the house next door who falls for Jo. I feel his best performance is in the 1935 MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD. He also played Stephen Foster whom he resembled a little in the forgotten early biography MELODY LANE.Two other performers in the cast are worth noting. One is old Frederick Kerr here playing Montgomery's stepfather a doctor and major in the British Army who spends most of the film in the countryside enjoying his fine old port and going through one of those What...what characters which were supposed to represent the kindly old eccentric British upper classes. He played a similar role albeit as a German as Baron Frankenstein Colin Clive's father in FRANKENSTEIN so I take it Whale liked his screen personae. The other ironically is Bette Davis. She is Montgomery's sister and aside from shouting into her deaf stepfather's ear to repeat what he claims he did not hear she has little to do. It was her third film. Davis later said in her partial autobiography MOTHER GODDAMN that she would have loved to play Myra. She did  more memorably  as Mildred the waitress turned prostitute in OF HUMAN BONDAGE.Actually Clarke is very appealing as Myra. At the start of the film she is shown on the closing night of a West End Musical she was in the chorus and Whale is clever enough to show her yawning at one point it does add to the realism of that moment. In the remake Leigh was a promising ballerina whose romance with young Taylor causes her teacher Maria Ouspenskaya to throw her out of the troupe. The idea of chorus girls apparently was not classy enough for Leigh's screen personae in 1940. Myra can't find another show to get into it's wartime and there have been cutbacks in productions. Ironically she tells her friend Kitty Doris Lloyd she could have been in the chorus of CHIN CHIN CHOW but chose the other show. It's like having the chance to do HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS but opting for MR. PRESIDENT. CHIN CHIN CHOW set a West End record in the late teens and early 1920s.Because she can't get back into a show Myra  facing financial necessity  turns to prostitution. She is at Waterloo Bridge when she meets Montgomery during a zeppelin air raid Waterloo Bridge is a favorite spot to pick up Johns. The two of them end up going to her apartment by taxicab shades of Eliza Doolittle there. And they fall into love over a dinner of fish and chips. But Myra can't bring herself to confess what she does for a living  Montgomery is a naive American whose mother married an English country doctor. He does not have any idea about whores. Myra is somewhat older and she too is American her parents were two alcoholics in East St. Louis which is also the area Barbara Stanwyck comes from in the next film BABY FACE. She's more aware of the uglier side of life.Myra's moment of realization that she can't marry Montgomery is when she visits his mother stepfather and sister in the country. His mother Enid Bennett gently explains that she would not be fit for Montgomery. Bennett does not push Clarke away and she does apparently sympathize with her but she brings Clarke back to that reality that she tried to avoid. Clarke flees back to London but Montgomery follows. Myra can't bring telling him. Instead it is her landlady Ethel Griffes in a moment of selfinterest who reveals the truth  and gets Montgomery's best moment of reaction in the film in her face as a result.There is an element of melancholy in this that Whale succeeded in maintaining to the end and then some. I won't ruin the end of the film but suffice it to say the love is as doomed as a flowering plant that is transplanted to a desert. It is a worthy film  not up to the later film's production and star quality  but well worth seeing.".

It is a worthy film  not up to the later film's production and star quality  but well worth seeing.";

It is clear what Myra's job is right from the start and Clarke looks the part.

It's an old story but done well here.Despite a few histrionics and a relatively short running time this film is entertaining an old woman loses potatoes in an air raid and won't move off the bridge without them and poignant Myra feels at home at last with Roy's country folks but we know it won't last.It can be found on the DVD set 'Forbidden Hollywood volume 1'.".

	schema:headline " Mae Clarke is Unforgettable!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Mae Clarke is right up at the top of the list of most under rated actresses. No matter how small the role or how over shadowed  her role in Three Wise Girls was put in the shade by Jean Harlow's bigger and flashier part but Mae definitely gave the best most poignant performance in the film. Did she ever give a bad performance??? Compared to the glossy shallow 1940 remake this 1931 version of Waterloo Bridge has an elegant simplicity. In the 1940 version Vivien Leigh is a brilliant ballerina who only takes to prostitution when she thinks her Officer sweetheart has been killed but in this earlier version Mae Clarke except for a fleeting opening scene is already a hardened prostitute who tries to discourage soldier Roy from a relationship she knows will only end in disaster.Unfortunately chorus girl Myra decides to try out for The Bing Boys instead of Chu Chin Chow and two years later Chu Chin Chow is still running and Myra is working as a prostitute. Walking along Waterloo Bridge her usual haunt she meets Roy Kent Douglass an impressionable soldier who helps her pick up an old woman's vegetables. He falls instantly in love with her and wants her to meet his parents but she is not so sure. They are very welcoming  Frederick Kerr is just so right as Roy's almost deaf step father and Bette Davis in a very small role as Janet is charming and effective. That evening Myra confesses her past to Roy's mother Enid Bennett and while she is sympathetic and admiring of Myra's honesty agrees that she cannot marry Roy. Myra flees to London and by the time she and Roy are reunited  he knows about her past but doesn't care. She sends him back to the front with a promise of marriage happy and secure knowing she loves him then as the camera pans away she walks right into an exploding bomb.James Whale more than confirmed his importance as a new major director. There are some wonderful scenes of powerful emotion and the outdoor scenes of the bridge in an airraid with the search lights and hurrying people are pictorially beautiful. Mae Clarke has so many moments a touching scene where she picks up an Officer Billy Bevan then in a moment of conscience rejects him. Moments later realising she has been rude to him and also that she needs the money  I'm sorry Mister I didn't mean it but it is too late. Another scene  trying to discourage Roy she laughs hysterically at him all the while hiding her face in her arms. She was so outstanding that it makes you wonder why she wasn't given better parts. Almost matching her was Kent Douglass soon to be Douglass Montgomery  he was just heartbreaking as the innocent soldier who loves Myra whatever her past. the scene where Mrs Hobley Ethel Griffies tells him the truth about Myra's occupation is extremely emotional but Douglass carries it off and makes you really believe in him.A word about The Bing Boys  it wasn't quite the dud the film made out. The Bing Boys Are Here were a series of revues that opened in 1916 with George Robey and Violet Lorraine. It introduced the song If You Were the Only Girl in the World and the production lasted 378 performances. There were two other revues  The Bing Boys Are There and The Bing Boys on Broadway  all in all the three revues clocked up over 1000 performances. The Bing Boys and Chu Chin Chow were the two biggest musical hits of World War 1.Highly Highly Recommended.".

	schema:headline " Change will do you good";
	schema:reviewBody "The coming of sound to Hollywood was such a mighty upheaval as far as the mechanics of filmmaking went that those years from 1928 to 1931 were in many ways a testing ground for new approaches and a trial for directors. Of those that succeeded there were old pros like Michael Curtiz Raoul Walsh Ernst Lubitsch and John Ford who were able to make incredibly smooth transitions simply by weaving sound in as another layer in their existing technique. And then there were the newcomers from theatre backgrounds people like George Cukor Rouben Mamoulian and of course James Whale who were accustomed to directing dialogue but completely unused to the world of movies. Cukor and Mamoulian got off to shaky starts and their earliest films are rather poor. Whale however seems to have had taken instantly to the talkie medium picking up film grammar with ease and yet with the unique approach of the outsider.In Waterloo Bridge Whale's second picture we open with a sweeping tracking shot reminiscent of those with which the aforementioned Mr Curtiz often opened his pictures both before and after the sound barrier. Whale isn't yet savvy enough to use this to key us into the setting and introduce ideas as Curtiz would but his complex and vibrant arrangements show his understanding of the movement and unlimited scope of cinematic space with a shot ironically inside a theatre! In dialogue scenes Whale has a distinct way of framing actors often from the knees up with their heads very close to the top of the shot which seems emphasise the height of the frame as being equal to the width. The camera is constantly moving round often giving us 360degree coverage of a location. It's as if Whale freed from the limited proportions of the stage is now striving to give us a sense of the real world spaces that motion pictures can take place in.Another great thing about Whale is that he makes very abrupt and effective changes in focus. Take the moment when Mae Clarke and Kent Douglass both realise that the other is American. Up until that point the whole scene had been in long midshots with a lot of movement in the frame but then we suddenly cut in to these bold closeups with no intermediary ground and the moment is given great weight as the point at which the couple clicked. There's an even better example in the scene when Clarke and Montgomery get to know each other in her apartment. Again this is mostly in midshot with the occasional head and shoulders shot. However once Douglas has left and Clarke slips into character for her night job there is again this very jarring cut to a closeup this time of Clarke in her dressingtable mirror. It's a sudden and very deliberate stepping from the carefree world of the courting couple to the very private space of Clarke and it makes the shift in tone at this point all the more palpable.The leading couple Clarke and Douglass later credited as Douglass Montgomery in pictures such as Little Women were two of the many stars who were fairly noticeable in the early sound era but would soon fade into obscurity for one reason or another. I have seen them both in a number of other roles but never has either of them been as good. Clarke has a really natural feel for the dialogue and shows great understatement with her neardeadpan facial expressions. Douglass too is very restrained managing to give a believable portrait of Roy's naivet his one break into powerful emotions very credible. Restraint and understatement are not words that could be applied to the rest of the cast who by and large are a delightful rogues gallery of hammy oddballs. We have some sharptongued cockneys like the potato woman and the landlady played by Rita Carlisle and Ethel Griffies respectively both of whom would roughly reprise their roles for the 1940 remake. Best of all however is Frederick Kerr in one of his unfortunately small number of film appearances doing his typical blustering aristocrat act. Many of his curmudgeonly mutterings were no doubt written specifically for if not by Kerr himself. Players like these add spice to the production and give contrast to the subtlety and seriousness of the leads.Waterloo Bridge is one of those pictures that have been revived today by the magic wand of the precode era label. This tends to be a bit of a doubleedged sword because while on the one hand it allows for DVD releases of pictures that would otherwise be nighon impossible to see it means they also tend to get remembered and analysed for their sauce and sass more than for anything else. But aside from the somewhat frank handling of prostitution that marks it as a product of its time Waterloo Bridge is a fine stirring drama which thanks to the efforts of its cast and director has a sense of realism immediacy and intimacy rarely seen in pictures of that age.".

There is no need to compare her performance to Vivien Leigh's later remake because that film had no real grit and Clarke's performance was one of the best I have ever seen from a performer despite her youth. The film was shot soon after talkies began and her screen presence and non theatrical emoting was astonishingly on target. The director Whale must have had a good rapport because her scenes with all of the players came off honest and not a bit dated. I can see that Davis would have liked to play the part as someone mentioned but she could not have done a better job. I just discovered it on the Turner channel and became so engrossed in Clarke's performance I called people to get a copy and watch this actress' work. Quite remarkable.".

Potential pulp trash like Frankenstein Bride of Frankenstein and The Old Dark House were elevated to nearmasterpieces and in the case of the latter a true masterpiece in my humble estimation thanks to brilliant screenplays and Whale's wonderful tasteful direction and sensibilities. The Invisible Man is still one of the best science fiction films ever made and quite possibly the best Wells adaptation around with the possible exception of Island of Lost Souls. Remember Last Night? is a daring hilarious fascinating slice of unexpected social satire in the guise of a mysterycomedy and remains woefully underseen.Waterloo Bridge is yet another immensely satisfying Whale film and while this being his second film his technique is not at the same level as some of his later films the film is still directed tastefully and often creatively and is very wellshot as well. This was a precode film and hence I imagine is less sanitized than the 1940 Vivien LeighRobert Taylor version of the story. Mae Clarke is absolutely incredible here as a chorus girlturnedprostitute who meets a naive 19 year old Canadian in wartime London. The writing is fantastic and the film while melodramatic is also subtle and tasteful in many regards. The humor which is present in nearly all Whale films is a lot of fun and doesn't clash with the otherwise serious tone of the film.Waterloo Bridge avoids the pitfalls of many melodramas by remaining a very human story about love at its core. The ending is really overthetop perhaps even a bit laughable but it doesn't ruin what came before a really great precode melodrama and another exceptional film directed by James Whale. It's a good production although the Waterloo Bridge set is not very convincing now of course with excellent direction good cinematography great writing and a wonderful cast especially the two leads Mae Clarke and Douglass Montgomery but also the wonderful character actor Frederick Kerr in a smaller more humorous role.".

	schema:headline " Early triumph for Whale Clarke and Bette Davis";
	schema:reviewBody "Though it's rather obscure largely due to its remake the original WATERLOO BRIDGE is worth seeking out as an early success for James Whale Mae Clarke perhaps her career high and for a small but delightful bit part for Bette Davis. No doubt the film betrays its stage origins but Whale working with two writers with whom he'd work again Levy and Sherwood opens the film up enough to bring the tragic WWI story to the screen. Whale was one who didn't let the bulky early sound equipment lock his camera down like so many others of the time. But it's the acting which makes the film worth reviving. Clarke in particular is called upon to express a range of emotions that would be daunting for any actress and she pulls it off in her relationship with a young soldier Douglass Montgomery. Davis and Enid Bennett as a compassionate mother are fine but Frederick Kerr steals the show amongst the supporting cast. Kerr foreshadowing his Herr Frankenstein role in Whale's FRANKENSTEIN is amusing as the young soldier's doddering Major father. The film's tragic ending is not so much out of left field as it seems to be rushed. Too bad because the tearful last exchange between Clarke and Montgomery is staged with remarkable truth and feeling. Hopefully Universal will be persuaded to put the film out on DVD perhaps on a double disc with its remake so that it can be more widely seen.".

	onyx:emotionText "Though it's rather obscure largely due to its remake the original WATERLOO BRIDGE is worth seeking out as an early success for James Whale Mae Clarke perhaps her career high and for a small but delightful bit part for Bette Davis. No doubt the film betrays its stage origins but Whale working with two writers with whom he'd work again Levy and Sherwood opens the film up enough to bring the tragic WWI story to the screen. Whale was one who didn't let the bulky early sound equipment lock his camera down like so many others of the time. But it's the acting which makes the film worth reviving.

	schema:reviewBody "Two Americans fall in love in WWI London in this first film adaptation of the play by Robert Sherwood. Mae Clarke plays a chorus girl who turns to prostitution when she's unable to find work. During an air raid she meets soldier Douglass Montgomery and the two take a liking to each other. She agonizes over whether or not to pursue the relationship with the innocent young man who has no idea what she does for a living.A wonderful PreCode tearjerker with Mae Clarke giving her finest performance from any movie of hers I've seen at least. Wonderful direction from James Whale as well. He certainly made good use of the limited budget Universal gave him. Love the sets especially the apartment building rooftop and the bridge. Whale and Clarke would reunite that same year on a little movie you might've heard of called Frankenstein. The actor who played Baron Frankenstein in that picture Frederick Kerr also appears in this one. Leading man Douglass Montgomery billed here as Kent Douglass is largely forgotten today but does a fantastic job in a role he reportedly struggled with so much Whale had to shut down production for three days. You wouldn't know it from watching though as his acting is so natural and believable. The biggest name in the cast Bette Davis appears in a small role as Montgomery's sister. This was just her third movie.This was remade a couple of times most notably at MGM in 1940 with Robert Taylor and Vivien Leigh. That version is more famous than this one and I enjoy it a lot. Both are great films for very different reasons. The remake is a glossy tragic romance and this one's more gritty and character driven. The romance in this one is in some ways more believable than in the later film. I also enjoy the ending to this one more. Both movies end sadly but this one isn't quite as contrived. This is a real winner with some wonderful acting and directing. If you've seen the TaylorLeigh film you should give this one a look. It's very interesting to see the same story told in two different but effective ways.".

It starred Glenn Hunter and June Walker and I daresay this is probably close to the original stage version that Robert Sherwood wrote if not an exact transfer.Bette Davis had a small supporting role as Montgomery's sister in this film. Certainly Davis would have been outstanding in the lead but I have no complaints with what Mae Clarke did with the role. Also outstanding is Ethel Griffies as Clarke's mercenary and realistic landlady who has no qualms about gentleman callers.If you like the classic MGM version this original screen version from Universal is worth a look to contrast.".

The fact that she's less than a picture perfect beauty suits the part well and she comes off successfully in her favor.

Directed by James Whale before he peaked with Frankenstein and Showboat this film is set in WWI London and stars the longforgotten Mae Clarke an actress best known for being the recipient of James Cagney's grapefruit attack in The Public Enemy. She plays Myra an American chorus girl who turns to prostitution when her show closes. Unlike Leigh's ethereal ballerina in the later film Clarke's Myra is all bitterness with a shaft of hope in the form of an American soldier named Roy whom she accidentally meets during an air raid. He comes from a wealthy family who find out about her profession which leads to the inevitable consequences.Clarke is solid as Myra though she does go overboard in her breakdown scene. Kent Douglass is rather wooden as Roy though he certainly captures the soldier's callow nature. Done on the cheap by Universal and at only 81 minutes it's an interesting and sometimes poignant curio thanks mostly to Whale's dexterity with melodrama. A freshly scrubbed 23year old Bette Davis shows up in the inconsequential role of Roy's sister.".

Whale has always been considered one of the greatest horror director's but after seeing this film he certainly should be considered one of the greatest directors ever. No matter which genre he was working in Whale managed to bring out every sort of emotion and that talent is on full display with this rather heartbreaking precode. I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but I might go as far as to say it's better than Frankenstein which was released the same year. The way Whale manages to get drama and laughs is once again quite remarkable although we've seen him do this in countless horror films. The most shocking thing for me about the film is the performance by Clarke who in my opinion gives one of the greatest performances from any actress. The way she handles all of her emotions is a real treat to watch. Everything from her characters pain to the humiliation of having to tell the guy's mother what her real job is. There are countless great scenes in this film and they all work perfectly. Douglass is very good as the young man Bette Davis is nice in her few scenes and Enid Bennett is terrific as the mother. It was also nice seeing Frederick Kerr who also appeared in Whale's Frankenstein.".

	schema:headline " MUCH earthier and seamy than the 1940 remakethis is really not a romantic film at all";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1940 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE is so different that you really need to look at these completely different films. While the later version is much more romantic and polished it suffers from some plot problems that keep it from being a great filmand this is all due to the sleazy elements of the 1931 version being chopped out to please censors.The 1931 version was directed by James Whale and yes this is the same guy who directed all the great early horror films at Universal. Because of his style AND the PreCode era's tendency to focus on the seamier aspects of life it is so very different from the later film. Instead of being a struggling ballerina driven to eventually sell her body out of desperation and hunger 1940 the heroine is a prostitute when the film begins. So with the PreCode morality the story is essentially about a man who falls for a whorenot realizing her lifestyle. This must have been seen as pretty hot stuff back in its day and even today would probably make a few eyebrows raise! Because of this element the film is much more of a tragedy than a romance. In fact having a character be a hooker is a pretty sure way to keep the film from being romantic. So if you are looking for a romance see the later version.Overall this version of the film is more coherent and makes a lot more sense than the remake. In the remake Ms. Leigh marries Robert Taylor and then becomes a prostitute even though she knows he comes from a rich familythis just doesn't make sense. She easily could have let them know of her plight and avoided all the mess that ensued making Vivian just too dumb to live. Instead Mae Clark is a basically decent person but she's still a hooker who can't allow herself to either admit to her man what she is nor can she allow herself to marry himthis is a much better plot and DOES make sense. However aside from the nonromantic aspect of this the ending of the film is just terrible in this original film. Frankly although I generally prefer this earlier film the 1940 version ended much better. So overall this is a very interesting film due to its subject matter but the film does suffer a bit from the lousy ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Malone family move to a military base to help contain a toxic spill. Many of the soldiers and families are behaving strangely but is it the toxins or something more sinister?I'm not a fan of remakes many try to just copy the success of other films while some lift the original scene for scene to poor effect.  However this at least tries to do something slightly different with it by setting it in a military base and bringing the drama into the family setting.  In fact this setting creates some of the best scenes  my favourite being where Carol tells her daughter Marti that there's no one like you left'.  The greater effects are good but really I preferred the paranoid tension of the 50's original rather than the horror of effects.However I still think this is a very workable horror from a good director. Of course it suffers with comparison with the original  that's because the original is a scifi classic.  But as it's own film it is pretty good. Indeed the ending is what director Siegel intended  but he was forced into having a more hopeful epilogue ending.  Naturally it has it's weaknesses  the effects overpower the story at times but really I found this to be enjoyable as a horror.The cast are one of the weak links.  I love Kinney because I'm a big Oz HBO fan but here he doesn't really make a mark.  Tilly has all the good lines and she is actually quite good.  Anwar is also very watchable.  But Ermey is type cast in his usual military role and Whitaker is far too calm and reasoned to do the job  he needed to be more like McCarthy in the original.Overall this should be watched and not compared.  In it's own right it is a good horror with only a few weaknesses that spoil it slightly.  And if you do want to compare it to the 50's version then please remember than this is the type of ending that Siegel wanted and to me is one of the strengths of this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Normally I try never to watch any remakes before I had the chance to see the originals...So watching this movie really was an exception for me since I never saw Don Siegel's version from 1956 and neither did I had the chance so far to catch the Philip Kaufman remake from 1978 starring Donald Sutherland. But this movie came on TV the other night and I watched it anyway. Besides there were a few very interesting and respected people involved in this production. First of all there's director Abel Ferrara of course. He already delivered a few true masterpieces before and some of them are personal favorites of mine  like Driller Killer Bad Lieutenant and The Addiction . But I wasn't completely convinced about watching this movie before I noticed that both Larry Cohen and Stuart Gordon took part in writing the screenplay. All three are very talented and influential men in the field of horror and I figured a collaboration between the three of them could only lead to something good. Well it certainly is a decent movie and it provides the viewers with several scares. But  in general  I have to admit that I expected a bit more of it. The whole movie looks unfinished from time to time and the basic plotidea isn't explained well enough I think. I also had the feeling that everything moved too quick...Body Snatchers only lasts 87 minutes and that's a bit short for a rather complicated story like this. I would have preferred it to be a little longer and more detailed. Because of the fast storytelling the ending also looks really fake and too abrupt. That was my biggest disappointment about it I guess. Nevertheless Body Snatchers contains multiple memorable scenes and it actually has the ability to raise the hair on your arms...That's quite an achievement too I may say. Especially the sequence where both the daughter  an adorable Gabrielle Anwar  and the father  a terribly boring Terry Kinney  are being bodysnatched is really frightening and a beautiful example of suspensecinema and building up a tight atmosphere. This terrific scene ends with a powerful monologue by Meg Tilly's character. The entire movie is in fact recommended if it were only for this scene !! The further cast of Body Snatchers also contains a washed up Beverly Hills star  whose name I don't remember  and very enjoyable little roles by first class actors like Forest Whitaker and R. Lee Ermey. I guess this last one is doomed to play the authority figure ever since his outstanding performance in Full Metal Jacket but what the heck. He's brilliant every single time. In conclusion Body Snatchers contains a few very bloody and explicit sequences so horror fans won't be disappointed completely. It could have been a lot better that's a fact. But on the other hand..it could have been a lot worse as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone knows the plot of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS because theyd already been two adaptations before the 1993 remake . The same basic plot had also been done in the 1955 television serial QUATERMASS 2 which was also remade by Hammer films in the late 1950s and weve seen DOCTOR WHO stories like Spearhead From Space that uses a very similar premise . In short the idea had been done to death by the 1990s On its own BODY SNATCHERS isnt a terrible film  it is moody and dark as it should be  but it does have a rather mechanical script with a scene featuring some teen angst followed by a mysterious scene followed by a scene featuring teen angst followed by a mysterious scene followed by a scene featuring teen angst . Everyone knows that the plot revolves around alien infiltration so do the audience get to find out why the aliens come to Earth ? Not really  unlike the 50s original theres no real ambiguity as to the aliens motive or subtext either . I should also point out that aliens taking over military bases makes perfect logical sense if they want to nullify humanity but unfortunately setting the story on a military base where through necessity human individuality is disallowed and where the newly introduced protagonists dont know the other characters means we have a story that lacks compelling and terrifying drama . We find it somewhat difficult to care about the people involved because they lack individuality to begin with .As I said its by no means terrible but BODY SNATCHERS  fails alongside the 1978 version which I rate as the greatest paranoid thriller ever made".

In a gas station bathroom on the road she is scared by a soldier that advises her to not sleep because they get you when you sleep. Once in the base she becomes friend of Jean Platt Christine Elise the daughter of the general in charge of the base and the helicopter pilot Tim Young Billy Wirth. Marti and her father see that people are acting strange and sooner they find that aliens are cloning the human beings in the base and invading Earth.Abel Ferrara's remake of Don Siegel's 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers is more violent than the original movie but is also very good. There are three particular moments that I like very much the first one is certainly when Marti throws Andy from the helicopter. I believe very few directors would have the courage to make such scene. The second one is the scary screams of Carol and Jean later. Last but not the least is the scene in the hospital when Gabrielle Anwar is naked and partially shows her breast. Although the end of this version is happier than the original one it is open with the helicopter landing and Carol's voice saying Where you gonna go? Where you gonna run? Where you gonna hide? Nowhere cause there's no one like you left. And then THE END is highlighted with uppercases probably meaning that Marti and Tim would be the last human beings on Earth.

It's not a bad film per se but with the pedigree it sports it should have been much better. Some of the names credited with the story and screenplay are Larry Cohen Stuart Gordon and Dennis Paoli. Those three names can be seen on some of the most famous horror posters of all time. And with a director like Abel Ferrara the film should have been more interesting. This time the invasion takes place solely on a military base witnessed through the eyes of outsider Gabrielle Anwar. Forest Whitaker is playing the paranoid role and Meg Tilly is the main face of the aliens. There are some good moments to be found and the pod effects look good because they are still practical at this point. The problem is once the pods become people. The aliens are supposed to be completely devoid of emotion yet I think they show a lot in this film. I also think they blew the scream out of proportion for this one. It's not nearly as haunting as the previous film. I still think it has its own merits and is far superior to the latest Nicole Kidman retread.".

	schema:headline " Just Another Remake...";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't know why Ferrara did it. I suppose just to add incremental touches to bring the story up to date. The original directed by Don Siegel was set in a small California town in which everyone knew everyone else and featured as its protagonist a doctor who was on familiar terms with his patients and made house calls. That world has disappeared of course. The 1970s remake more whimsical in its own way was set in a city and featured a Public Health worker. It added special effects that weren't available in the 1950s and were creepy. It also added a piglike squeal of betrayal when one of the podpeople discovered a human in their midst. This business of the pod people deserves more attention than it gets in these movies the human seem to turn into a kind of dirt after their absorption by the pods. They should be scientifically explicated but I'm afraid podzology would be claimed as a Russian invention. This one from 1993 brings the old story even more up to date. Not only do we have the special effects from the 1970s version but they are accompanied by foleyedin sounds that are a cross between sizzling bacon and a Yellowstone mud hole of moderate magnitude. This version also adds the obligatory apocalyptic fireballs at the end  not that they accomplish anything just that the times call for them nowadays. The novella by John Finney first appeared in I think Collier's Magazine now defunct and was far more reasonable and comprehensible than any of the movies that have been made from it. In the book we learn where the seeds come from what happens to the humans and how the pods are defeated. They just give up and float away. The first movie is by far the best just a black and white rendering of the tale with a blandly handsome Dr. Binnell and his immaculate girl friend. People shake their heads and groan because of the happy ending that the studio insisted be tacked on but I liked it.There's nothing wrong with tragedy when it grows out of something  human weakness as in Othello or hubris as in Oedipus Rex. But no one in any of these movies has done anything truly wrong! They don't deserve to be robbed of their humanity for however much that may be worth. The acting here is okay not much more than that. Meg Tilly has interesting features. Like Merle Oberon's her flaring cheeks seem to be tucked up just under her eyes which slant upward and outward at an alarming dihedral. She has plump rounded lips and one or two moles scattered around her face and it all adds up to a beautiful woman. But her voice is difficult to believe. Gabriel Anwar is likewise attractive with wideset eyes a long gentle nose and a generous mouth. Anwar has the innocence of one of those young virtuous maidens with long floppy hair that sit around pools staring wistfully into the ether in PreRaphaelite paintings. She radiates adolescent nubility. Any normal man glimpsing her visage would immediately be prompted to pinch and bite her. And she acts as good as she looks. The guy who plays her Dad is a familiar face in TV movies better as a heavy than a hero and he's up to snuff. The darkhaired savior is just somebody's idea of a handsome movie star. If the first movie was supposed to be an analogy with the pod people being Commies or was it an anticonformist tract there seems to be some confusion  this one looks like an antimilitary analogy. It's set on an army base and all the pods are being trucked out for placement on yet other army bases  Fort Bragg Fort Bliss. Meg Tilly at one point after her conversion to podness asks her still straight husband Where will you go? Where will you hide? There is nobody left like you. How about a Navy base? How about the U. S. Coast Guard Light Station at Point Reyes? And the direction. If Blake had been writing about Body Snatchers instead of Tygers he might have asked Did he who made The Bad Lieutenant make thee? Bad Lieutenant is a truly shocking movie far more powerful and scary than this one. Ferrara seems to have done nothing to perk this tired story up. It's craftmanship and it's up to date but nothing more than that. See the original. Read the novella better yet.".

S. Coast Guard Light Station at Point Reyes? And the direction. If Blake had been writing about Body Snatchers instead of Tygers he might have asked Did he who made The Bad Lieutenant make thee? Bad Lieutenant is a truly shocking movie far more powerful and scary than this one. Ferrara seems to have done nothing to perk this tired story up. It's craftmanship and it's up to date but nothing more than that. See the original. Read the novella better yet.";

	schema:reviewBody "Body Snatchers is the fourth in the quasifranchise based on Jack Finney's 1955 novel The Body Snatchers about an alien invasion where people die and their bodies become podversions of their former selves. The entries in the series are as follows Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956  Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1978  Body Snatchers 1993  The Invasion 2007 The first one is in Black  White and is probably too dated and tame for most modern viewers but it's still worthwhile it takes place in small town California. The 1978 sequel switches the setting to the big city of San Francisco. This 1993 sequel switches to an army base in the deep south. And the 2007 version switches back to the big city of Washington DC. I suppose they could all be viewed as progressive steps in the invasion particularly the first three I say this because the 2007 entry changes some aspects and might be better viewed as a variation on the story rather than a sequel.I think this 1993 entry is the best followed by the original and then the 1978 and 2007 installments. What I like about Body Snatchers is the cast and the setting. The Army base naturally makes it easier for the alien imitations to go undetected as they spread through the community.Although she was 22 during filming Gabrielle Anwar plays the 17 yearold protagonist the daughter of an EPA inspector Terry Kinney who's assigned to inspect an Army base in the deep south shot in Selma Alabama. Meg Tilly plays his young wife while Christine Elise plays Anwar's friend on the base the daughter of the commanding general and Billy Wirth costars as Anwar's chopperpilot beau Wirth by the way looks like an early 90s version of Robert Pattinson from the Twilight films. Forest Whitaker is also on hand as a military psychologist at the base.Although Body Snatchers is a horror film it's a creepymysterious type of horror film and not a slashergore film. The gore you see is pretty much limited to the podpeople and is therefore more like vegetablegore lol. Anyway the film has a nice haunting ambiance and everything works together for a standout film of this genre. The acting is superb and the swamplands of the deep south are utilized.Gabrielle has a beautiful face but she's too skinny for my tastes Elise too. As such the female eye candy is limited to curvy Meg Tilly and her bodydouble Jennifer Tilly. Don't expect much on this front.Despite my fairly high opinion of Body Snatchers it bombed at the box office and so did the 2007 entry. It goes without saying we probably won't see another stab at this story for some time.The film runs a short but sweet 87 minutes.GRADE A".

The acting is mediocre at best and often overactedWhich I stated earlier. The direction is sloppy with no real suspense or irony. Sorry I just could n't adhere to this film. The plot contains a group of family members being victimized while at the same time terrorized by a large system of abductors disguised in the form of military ground. The parasites are going around rather quickly with no one suspecting fast enough to stop it. With the supposed drama being dispersed the victims never become involved in trying to figure how what has happened and what's causing it. Not very exciting but rather preposterous. I saw Body Snatchers of 1956 and 1978 and found both to be creative with the remake merely the best piece. The third outing did not live up to neither one. Rated 12".

Despite its many treasures and iconic status there is just a bit too much emphasis placed on Siegel's version when it comes to considering the various remakes. Kauffman's 1978 version is my personal favourite as it turns San Francisco the flowerpower capital of late 60s free love and counterculture into an Orwellian metropolis where mental health is precarious individuation is outlawed and an absence of passion is normalised. I'm also a fan of Denny Zeitlin's creepy synth score Kevin McCarthy's winkwink cameo knocked down by taxi driving Siegel no less and the introduction of that iconic otherworldly scream when a human is spotted  which was so effective it was incorporated in to the two subsequent remakes.Abel Ferarra's subversive version came hot on the heals of Operation Desert Storm where we saw invasion and counterinvasion televised pretty much 247 as the nation rallied around its troops and televisions. Ferrera's film is perhaps the most incendiary version as it dares to question USA's ubiquitous military culture driven by intense paranoia. No longer do we see the occasional man in uniform on an urban street. Rather Ferrara reverses things staging the action on an army base so that now we only see occasional citizens among scores of soldiers  and this creates a creepy usandthem atmosphere from the outset. This invasion does not come from without but from within as the line that separates soldier from citizen is erased. This makes Ferrara's film nothing like the original but a wholly unique and original work that stands on its own. Ferarra's version provides such a damning critique of a rarely challenged aspect of American culture that it's no wonder so many have dismissed it picking on superficial elements and dated production values in preference to actually taking it seriously.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the third version taken directly from Jack Finney's story and it is just as successful as the other two. One reason is because it's just a hella great horror story. Another is because the way to approach this material and just about any horror story is straight forward with little mucking about and little whining.

	schema:reviewBody "Body Snatchers is a good horrorthriller with excellent special effects. I can't speak as to whether or not it's a remake that stays faithful to the original but my gut says that this Is a worthy adaptation. The ending isn't as strong as the scenes that precede it but overall it's an enjoyable scifi paranoia film. The premise is basically that there's an alien invasion going on right before our eyes. The extra terrestrials wait until you fall asleep and when you do you get sucked up Inside of a weird pod and replaced with a doppelganger. There's a lot of potential there and I bet you can already see why this premise has endured over the years. How do you know who you can trust how are you going to convince the others that something is amiss and how are we supposed to win? I found that the picture takes a bit too long to set up. I understand that every plot point needs to be introduces thoroughly and all but considering this is the third version of the film and the material has been imitated and ripped off countless times you probably already know where it's going in the beginning and you'll grow restless waiting for everyone to catch up to you. Once it gets started there are a lot of tense parts that will keep you on your toes and some real surprises as friends and foes become indistinguishable from each other. The film really convincingly portrays the body snatchers and their pods and the special effects alone make the movie worth a watch even though the very end of the film is anticlimactic and contains one very bad special effect that's embarrassing to see. There's a really chilling moment when you realize really how dire the situation Is that's permanently ingrained in my mind. Just thinking about it makes me uneasy and no matter how many times it's made fun of it still gives me the shivers. It's worth seeking out. On DVD November 6 2012".

The scene changes from night to day to night the spaceship is a hubcap you can see the string it hangs from catch on fire at one point I could do a better job acting etc. ad nauseum. But it takes a hell of a lot to be almost universally considered the worst movie of all time and here is Plan 9's true strength. There are many horrible of movies but most of them are so bad because they are too bad to be truly bad and therefore sink into mediocrity. Plan 9 however has no redeeming quality's and so it stands out. Few will recognise a movie such as The Medallion but every moviegoer knows Plan 9.As I said before it takes a hell of a lot to be the worst. Because of this Plan 9 is some of the most fun you'll EVER have watching a movie. Almost every scene is so bad I broke out laughing. Few other movies achieve that kind of humor whether intentional or not. For that I give it a very intentional 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "First things first  anyone who calls 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' the worst movie ever made needs to watch more movies! To me the worst would be one that was dull and has no entertainment value whatsoever. 'Plan 9' is the complete opposite of dull and is it entertaining? You bet! It's still one of the greatest beer'n'pizza and have a bunch of your pals over movies ever made. Hell it isn't even the most inept and bizarre movie Ed Wood ever made that would still have to be 'Glen Or Glenda' which for some strange reason still doesn't have a tenth of the cult following 'Plan 9' does. Speaking of cult in some ways 'Plan 9' is almost THE definitive cult movie if you consider that it virtually vanished without a trace when it was first released and it still lives on because it was subsequently rediscovered by thousands of enthusiastic movie nuts collectors journalists cartoonists rock musicians e.g. The Damned and other film makers Joe Dante Sam Raimi Tim Burton. I think 'Glen Or Glenda' is Wood's most amazing achievement myself but I still love 'Plan 9'. I've lost track of how many times I've seen it over the years. I wouldn't go so far as to say I have it memorized or anything but it's always in the back of my mind. It's like part of the collective pop culture unconscious that I carry around with me at all times. As much as I love Bela Lugosi I think the three main reasons this movie is truly unforgettable apart from the obvious   silly aliens laughably bad dialogue and those flying saucersetc.etc. are Criswell Vampira and especially Tor Johnson. Any three of those people being involved would have made this something special but all three! Man! This is trash heaven! It's hard to believe there's anyone left alive who hasn't already seen this movie but if by some strange twist of fate you are one of the uninitiated you MUST I repeat MUST watch 'Plan 9' as soon as possible! And remember my friends future events such as these will effect YOU in the future!".

The very first time I saw Plan 9 in a NYC revival house just hearing Tor Johnson's struggle with English pronunciation and watching him wriggle out of the ground was worth the price of admission! It was probably the hardest I'd laughed in a movie theatre in many years. I don't know what kind of movie the actor who plays Eros thinks he's in but he seems to be having a lot of fun. We all know that the comedy of the film was unintentional then why do we laugh? We laugh because Mr. Wood does everything conceivable to mask his nonbudget to give the illusion of a grand scifihorror epic. And he does it with such unabashed gracelessness with so little concern for time continuity or any other kind of logic that we laugh at just how absurd the medium of film can become if used in incompetent hands. Ed Wood gives new meaning to the word schlock. The cinematic legacy he has left to enjoy should be called popschlock. If the point of the film is to ultimately entertain this is one of the best films of all time not the worst.".

The first 8 plans by aliens from some planet that doesn't really matter fail so they employ their ninth plan for taking over Earth. At least I think they are taking over Earth they say they are taking over Earth to save the Earthlings. All I know about the aliens is that they are dedicated to their cause you would have thought they would have given up taking over Earth after 6 tries. You will have a good chuckle during the movie with the cheesy special effects and the silly acting and cheap props but the entertainment value does make it better than some movies out there. Maybe 2 or 3 movies at least.

	schema:reviewBody "Although this movie got famous for having the reputation of the worst film ever made I really do disagree. Sure there are many continuity mistakes including shots shifting between day and night in the same scene and the unrealistic dialog and silly looking sets but it all adds to the fun. The story revolves around UFO sightings happening in a Los Angeles town. The police and eventually the army step in to blast them out of the sky but can't hurt them. The martians who run the UFO'S look and sound like regular people but with silly uniforms. Their mission is to release Plan 9 on the humans which is a plan involving bringing the dead to life to get everyones attention. The martians want to bring peace to earth by communicating with the humans but all the humans want to do is destroy the UFO'S making it hard for a peace talk. How this weird plan is supposed to work to bring peace is silly in itself. There are so many mistakes and silly scenes in the movie I would take up too much space writing it all. When Gregory Walcott one of the lead actors read the script he told director Ed Wood it was the worst script he ever read but he needed the work. Bela Lugosi appears in some footage shot just before his death with no project in mind. Ed incorporated it in this movie so he can include him in the film. Lugosi was doubled by Tom Mason Woods Wife's chiropractor who was inches taller and played the part with a cape covering most of his face. The movie stars Wood regulars Paul Marco and Conrad Brooks. This movie reinforces my belief that the only bad film is a boring film!".

Besides most criticism goes out to the lousy scenery and the goofy decors. Well excuse Mr. Wood for not disposing over a huge budget or funds! He did what he could and sure the jet cockpit looks amateurish and the Pentagonoffices have the image of being build by a kindergartencrew but so what? I have a lot more respect and sympathy for this film than for those overbudgeted uninspired blockbusters! Like in ALL of his films Ed Wood proves that he's full of good intentions creativity and a strong will to proceed and purchase his dreams. The only thing you can reproach him here is the silly and pointless screenplay. Aliens are desperately seeking contact with humanity and in their ninth attempt to achieve this they even resurrect the dead. Why?!? To make humans aware of their existence and to figure as prophets with a message. This is where the silliness comes in. But it all remains pure fun all the time! What also makes this film legendary is the fact that it contains the last onscreen appearance by Bela Lugosi. Lugosi died during filming and another guy in a Dracula outfit who constantly hides his face behind a cape ! replaces him. Am I the only one who thinks this subtle castchange is absolutely charming and nicely tried? Vampiria and Tor Johnson are credited as main performances but all the have to do is stumble around and look ghoulishnot a difficult thing to do if you have the posture of Tor Johnson. Overall Plan 9 from Outer Space remains the absolute toprecommendation to watch with a group of people when there's beer and snacks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clearly this is a very difficult film judging from the multitude of critics that have failed to comprehend its intricate fabric of multilayered symbolism and rich evocative imagery. That Ed Wood was an authentic American genius is altogether beyond dispute and like most geniuses he has continued to be subjected to the rancorous attacks of tiny minds unable to grasp the sheer enormity of his conceptions. That those conceptions so lovingly crafted and nurtured to fruition were largely ignored by the hormonecrazed drivein theater audiences to which they were usually consigned might have claimed the sanity of a lesser man. But for the peerless and indomitable Wood it was always truly arse gratia artis and it was this passionate commitment to artistic perfection that set him apart from his contemporaries. Even the inscrutable Federico Fellini was apparently so moved by Wood's work that he was reported to have cried out from his deathbed Merda! Son Morto! Certainly there can be no greater tribute than this from one dying artist to another.Plan 9 From Outer Space is unquestionably the shining centerpiece of Wood's creative efforts. From the incisive opening comments by the impeccably urbane Criswell we are transported into an unparalleled realm of cinematic poetry. The perpetually fogshrouded cemetery is a metaphor for the murky depths of the human soul while its cardboard tombstones evoke the fragility of man's earthly fame even as the rapid transitions from day to night proclaim the transience of his earthly existence. And moving silently in the midst of this cosmic desolation the always elegant Vampira is like the primal earth mother gathering her wandering children to her bosom while the brooding figure of Bela Lugosi strides endlessly to and fro wrapped in unanswerable questions.Veteran Swedish actor Tor Johnson fresh from a string of triumphant performances as Charles the Wrestler in the Stratford Festival production of As You Like It is a standout in the technically demanding dual role of Inspector Daniel ClayFat Zombie. Who else could have injected such pathos dignity and depth of meaning into such seemingly trivial lines as I'm a big boy now Johnnywho but the man that on two separate occasions graciously declined the part of Antonius Block in The Seventh Seal thereby effectively launching the career of his hitherto unknown countryman Max von Sydow? And who else could have risen so magnificently from the grave as a symbol of man's eternal quest for redemption and resurrection a theme which is carried forth in the subtle Grail connotations conjured up by the Arthurian garb of the alien leader? However in the end it is Wood's acerbic wit that propels this film to true greatness. Boldly rejecting the vision of his contemporaries born of human vanity that superior aliens would actually wish to conquer and possess our ridiculous little planet Wood shows us that the only aliens that would waste their time on such an unpromising venture would have to be even more ridiculous. Hence he presents us with aliens who having presumably bungled their way through eight previous plans for world conquest have arrived at the ninth without even grasping the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs. Their supposedly superior technology is constantly malfunctioning most of their pilots appear to be flying while intoxicated and they actually have to tie strings to their flying saucers so they can find their way home again. Sadly many unperceptive critics have dismissed these brilliant satirical touches as mere shoddy special effects. Little wonder then that the ninth plan fares no better than any of its predecessors. In a burst of flame the aliens are gone and it is just as if they had never been. One may well imagine that the fire that consumes their spacecraft travels all the way up the string to their home planet and incinerates the whole dreary lot of them thus effectively bringing to pass their own worst fear. The earth continues on its sad course seemingly impervious to Criswell's final angstridden plea for divine aid and we are left with the distinct impression that contrary to the mindless optimism of the fifties all may not be well after all.".

Being listed there is a hard thing to reach as well as being listed in the worst 100 where Plan 9 surely belongs .Ed Wood is all about a young wannabeproducerdirector who is so fascinated and driven by the idea of producing movies that he does everythingsets every wheel in motion to make his dreams become realitydoing movies with a leastcost budget simply because he couldn't afford anything elsebut he gave his whole heart to that movies and dedicated his whole life to them .O. K.  Maybe that movie glorifies Ed Wood a bit.I don't know.Ed Wood is by the way the director of Plan 9.Having seen the above mentioned movie before I just cannot help enjoying Plan 9. And for the record  I was not LAUGHING about it  I have been SMILING nicely about a film that has been done in a time when computereffects were not yet invented and I enjoyed it. And there have been definitely worse movies.Maybe the director wasn't so bad at all but simply didn't have the money to make it bettermaybe he had the talent to do better but not alone as writerproducerdirector? At least he DID a movie. And I don't know whether I might be childish here but that guy at least did what he wanted to do and here we are  50 years later still discussing his movie. The keyword is fantasy. If you put a little fantasy into the story  you might as well believe in it. A book doesn't give you any special effects at all and you can still enjoy it can't you??? On the other hand if you are so cool and so good in discovering any movies weakness and every leak of special effects that even the major 21st century Hollywood movies hardly get to you anymoreyou will surely find a lot to complain about in this one. Or you can simply take it as an eyewitness of a time long time gone when life wasn't so perfect and peoples' brains weren't so oversaturated yet that some guys still went to cinemas to see flying saucers...".

Wood is to be commended for his ambitious if not inappropriate attempt. What really makes the illusion crumble is Legosi's hilariously obvious standin who not blessed with much resemblance to the deceased actor compensates by inexplicably covering most of his face with a cape.The Legosi gimmick may get all of the attention but the truth is PLAN 9 would have been just as horrendous without it. Take the dialog which must be heard to be believed. When a laser ray suddenly morphs Legosi's zombie into a skeleton a bystander is heard to note He wasn't like that a minute ago! Very observant. Then there's the head alien henchman smirkingly reminiscent of a '50s TV announcer who tries hard but is about as convincing as Pauly Shore as Al Capone.

Thankfully one of the good guys then proves how intelligent we really are... by punching the alien's lights out!.Other absurdities abound. There are times when it appears Wood had to stop the camera so he could think of what to do or have the characters say next. A woman being chased by the zombies trips over nothing not once but twice. Presumably sturdy tombstones fall over. After being brought back to life burly Inspector Clay can't climb out of his grave. Policemen belittle a woman for not wanting to be alone with murderous creatures roaming the grounds. The same footage of Legosi walking out of the graveyard is used over and over again. No other film has given the viewer such little credit. Wood simply shrugged his shoulders at the glaring errors and must have thought Well heck who pays attention to these things?What really allows PLAN 9 to succeed to some degree despite itself is the fact that it's so damn innocent. It doesn't seem Wood was trying to be campy he really thought he had a winner. To his eternal credit he did create something truly memorable just not in the way he intended.".

Director Edward D. Wood Jr. didn't intend to make a comedy but he's given us some of the funniest scenes and characters ever filmed. It would be impossible to intentionally make a movie as funny as Plan 9 from Outer Space. Pick any character they're all equally ridiculous. Tor Johnson Swedish exwrestler as Inspector Daniel Clay. I'm a big boy now Johnny.Dudley Manlove as Eros the alien who gives the side splitting Solaranite speech. Take a can of your gasoline. Say this can of gasoline is the sun. Now you spread a thin line of it to a ball representing the earth...The standin for Bela Lugosi who appears holding a cape over his face so no one will notice. Lugosi died after filming only a few scenes.John Breckenridge the effeminate alien ruler who at one point reads his lines directly from a script he is holding. Plan 9? Ah yes. Plan 9 deals with the resurrection of the dead. Long distance electrodes shot into the pineal and pituitary gland of the recently dead.Criswell as the narrator. Greetings my friends. We are all interested in the future for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives. And remember my friends future events such as these will affect you in the future. Vampira the TV monster movie show hostess as a zombie who doesn't speak. All the sets are ridiculous. The infamous airplane cockpit with two chairs and a curtain. The inside of the alien ship with a table and assorted radio parts. The alien ruler's desk complete with pen set. The graveyard where headstones routinely fall over. The pie plate flying saucers on wires. You'll either fall asleep during this movie or you'll enjoy making fun of it probably depending on your mood. See it with friends and get ready to ridicule it.Forget the other Ed Wood films. They are really boring and not funny. Instead rent Tim Burton's Ed Wood after you've seen Plan 9.

There's a lot of fifties flair in this film That suppose to take place some where in the 1800's.like the Valentino Story it's not accurate it's tailored to Johannes personality.The real Suppe was bald headed with a beard and was fat.i alps recently recognized one of his composition to be internationally recognizedIt was used in a Looney Toon cartoon I think with Elmer Fud. or was it Tom and Jerry?after I saw the movie I had to research the story since I did not under stand Austrian.Another composition was used in many comedy films as a back dropLeichte Kavalleithe earlier an overture from Ein Morgren Ein Mittag Und Ein Abend in Wein.Well more info this movie was not accurate at all.It did not have his series compositions also it did not show him as a singer too.It did have some good dance numbers with Friedel Hardt in them.This was more of a Heimat type film.It was still entertainingGretl Schorgwho also appeared in Germany's first Heimat filmappears once again with Walter Mullerbut she plays Jopies first love of his lifehelping him to achieve his career as a composer by appearing in his first operetta.Although it did have some series sidenot muchwhen he finally got wealthy and successfulthen he got board of Gretl and Start having an affair with the countess Coralieplayed by Margit Saad.When the Kaiser shows up for his new opera and gives Suppe and medal of Honorthat when Jopie realizes that Gretl is his first love and drops Corralie.Gretl makes a surprise appearance in his opera.As I said this version of Suppes autobiography was rather sugary and melodramaticbut still entertaining.Eduard Von Barsody who directed Request concert in 1940 also directs this musical 121413".

There's a lot of fifties flair in this film That suppose to take place some where in the 1800's.like the Valentino Story it's not accurate it's tailored to Johannes personality.The real Suppe was bald headed with a beard and was fat.i alps recently recognized one of his composition to be internationally recognizedIt was used in a Looney Toon cartoon I think with Elmer Fud. or was it Tom and Jerry?after I saw the movie I had to research the story since I did not under stand Austrian.Another composition was used in many comedy films as a back dropLeichte Kavalleithe earlier an overture from Ein Morgren Ein Mittag Und Ein Abend in Wein.Well more info this movie was not accurate at all.It did not have his series compositions also it did not show him as a singer too.It did have some good dance numbers with Friedel Hardt in them.This was more of a Heimat type film.It was still entertainingGretl Schorgwho also appeared in Germany's first Heimat filmappears once again with Walter Mullerbut she plays Jopies first love of his lifehelping him to achieve his career as a composer by appearing in his first operetta.Although it did have some series sidenot muchwhen he finally got wealthy and successfulthen he got board of Gretl and Start having an affair with the countess Coralieplayed by Margit Saad.When the Kaiser shows up for his new opera and gives Suppe and medal of Honorthat when Jopie realizes that Gretl is his first love and drops Corralie.Gretl makes a surprise appearance in his opera.As I said this version of Suppes autobiography was rather sugary and melodramaticbut still entertaining.Eduard Von Barsody who directed Request concert in 1940 also directs this musical 121413";

	schema:reviewBody "Kindergarten Cop is a great film. It contains some of Schwarzenegger's best work showcasing his innate likability and comic timing in a piece which allows them to accentuate his more often seen action star persona. The lightening of this persona works in the film allowing us to follow Arnie's Kimble into what could easily be a weak and twee concept. Fortunately Arnie doesn't lose his balls in the transition and Reitman directs the action very well as well as showing the same skill in comedy as he did with previous hits such as Ghost Busters. Ricky Tyson makes a brilliant villain not in his being an equal to Schwarzenegger but in his portraying a drug dealer with a grudge as a three dimensional character who will stop at nothing to get his son back. Schwarzeneeger also gets to get have some romance and although he at times looks ready to kill his very beautiful love interest Penelope Ann Miller he manages to be a very charming lead who the audience are helpless but to root for. The screenplay by Salem Harris and Weingrod is both touching and funny with memorable lines such as the deadpan interrogation scene Who is your daddy and what does he do?. The kids also are great featuring a diverse group who almost steal the show with lines such as Boy's have a penis girl's have a vagina. The film also contains some classic Arnie one liners such his I'm the party pooper kiss off before shooting down some low lives. Such lines refer to Arnie's tough guy persona and shows that he is not afraid to poke fun at himself. The difference in Kindgarten Cop is that he is playing a vulnerable human character and the audience does not want him to be hurt not just because he is the hero but because they like him. The score too is exceptional being appropriately sweet and upbeat as well at sometimes hitting darker more sinister tones. They truly don't make them like this anymore just see awful modern examples such as Vin Diesel's The Pacifer for proof or rather don't see them watch Kindergarten Cop again and see a great action star and comedy director team up to make a most enjoyable work.".

Penelope Ann Miller Pamela Reed Linda Hunt Richard Tyson Joseph Cousins Christian Cousins and all the children in the film do great jobs with their roles.  I would imagine that a film like this would be a nightmare to direct with all those little kids running around.  So I've got to give some extra props to Ivan Reitman for a job well done.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone and everyone.  I didn't think there was anything to dislike about the film.

Miller sports wholesome looks and except for the end when things get tense a clean mouth.The star of the film Arnold Schwarzenegger shows a good flair for comedy as the tough guysoftie. This might be Arnold's most likable role. It was interesting to see Carroll Baker again an actress I hadn't seen since the 1960s. I'd like to have seen her smile but she frowned throughout her minor role in here.Storywise this is typical Hollywood in that it depicts family life in a poor way. I know there are many single mothers out there today but in this movie  which is 17 years old  ALL of the kids in the class come from single homes except one and that kid is being beaten up by this father! Excuse me  not one normal family out of 25?? Come on! Somebody should inform Hollywood there ARE happily married people in the United States....or at least outside the sick confines of Tinseltown.Anyway the positives outweigh the negatives in the film and the unique mix of humor and suspense make this interesting for the full 111 minutes.".

Those big words don't mean anything to everyday people they want the truth not some quaffed up proposals from someone who takes things way too seriously. I suppose you're entitled to your opinion but don't give up your day job to be a critic! Here's the lowdown this movie is just that a movie. It has a lot of funny characters and it's really funny in some scenes. It's fantasy and it gives the viewer a chance to escape. Arnold might never have gotten an Oscar for this but this is not that kind of movie to begin with! It's about a cop who tries to find a Criminals ex wife as a witness and ends up being a Kindergarten teacher who brings a lot of goodness to the community whilst saving the damsel in distress. It's fun to watch and goes well with anyone who's building an Arnie collection. rent it buy it you'll enjoy it.".

The scenic area of the Pacific Northwest also was a plus to the film. Caroll Baker as Mother Tyson is a great villainess. Wish I had viewed some of her work. The white streak in her hair was a great flash back to Cruella De Ville. Richard Tyson as Crisp also plays a smarmy character. Love the contrast of short Linda Hunt's Principal to tall Kimble. Yet Linda proved she could project herself as more formidable than Arnold Schwarzenegger. I also loved the comic timing Broadway's Pamela Reed brought to the film. Her character's pragmatism to Kimble's take it all on made for another good contrast. Overall the film is good for the whole family or a solitary rainy afternoon escape.".

When he finally catches him the case requires the testimony of Crisp's exwife who has disappeared.  Kimble and his partner O'Hara follow the only lead they have to find the wife  the name of a school in Oregon where she has been seen.  When O'Hara gets sick Kimble has to fill in on his hardest undercover assignment yet  as a kindergarten teacher.Looking back on it this was one of several films that saw Schwarzenegger opening up his resume to become more than just an action star.  Here the film plays on his personae as a tough guy as all his comedies do and it works pretty well all said.  The plot mixes comedy and a thriller element reasonably well without doing either that well.  The comedy relies on cute kids doing things and Arnold looking out of place in the school.  While it is rarely laugh out loud funny it is still inoffensive and amusing.  The thriller element is average and never really convinces as bookends on a comedy.While neither strand works that well they both shine like stars when viewed next to a romantic subplot that at best is unconvincing and at worst is lazy and smaltzy.  It is written with so much convenience and ease that it never convinces and the film stutters for it's inclusion.  Schwarzenegger is OK in the lead role  he doesn't need a real comic touch here because he is just playing his usual role but in a different setting that brings the comedy such as it is rather than his performance.  Reed is cheeky and pretty funny Miller is just quite plain and never really makes me believe the romantic subplot.  Tyson is a pretty poor baddie while Baker is just plain poor.Overall this is a pretty average film that has just about enough going for it to be entertaining even if it doesn't really excel itself as either a comedy or a thriller.  Some reasonable laughs and the chance to see the Governor of California sending himself up.".

	schema:headline " Enjoyable fun sweettough natured comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Its normally every other day you see Arnold in a tough guy role e.g. The Terminator series and here he portrays a professional cop until he is forced to go undercover as a kindergarten teacher an absolute genius move from the director of 'Twins' Reitman. Schwarzenegger is very convincing in this new role as a man who has to live two very different lives and the sheer humour of seeing him in this position is an essential watch for anyone. His character here is amazing a real laugh with or at character living humorously seriously and emotionally throughout a reflection of a real person's lives reflecting society traits. It is hard to accept him as a great actor sometimes which to many stubborn fans is emphasised here. He performed well as the toughsentimental guy. The story is very well crafted and thankfully always believable maybe apart from the ending. It is very consistent with different ideologies thrown around to add up to a slow moving story completed with a fast flowing ending. The use of encoding ideologies involving parenthood crime jobs relationship loyalty drugs and friendship etc are all well used to emphasise society's most important factors. As a comedy the main method used was for the tough guy to be creamed into a sweet natured role which was great to watch. The children all convey a menacing iconography which is also enjoyable to watch.I loved Pamela Reed's character. Reed Junior was fantastic as the sarcastic partner to Arnold and was very enjoyable to watch watch out for one of her last lines. There are many twists used which add to the tension of the film mostly conveying a comedy element which justifies the genre. The use of a stereotype villain allows younger audiences to appreciate the character always aware of who he is and what he is planning to do. The dark distinctive music playing is always associating with him creating a conventional but good feel to the nature of the character. The story is built up well because nothing is rushed. Context is always believable. Arnie's relationship with the children is definitely the key part of the film and is a must watch. if you like Arnie's tough guy roles the this is a complete opposite  he is a class act here as a sentimental teacher!8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Los Angeles police officer John Kimble has been after drug lord Cullen Crisp for years and finally arrests him after he murders a man who told Crisp that he's seen his estranged wife. Apparently when she left she took their soon and three million dollars and now she is living in Astoria Oregon. Kimble heads north with partner Phoebe O'Hara it is planned that she as a former teacher will go undercover at the local school to identify Crisp's son and thus his exwife who they hope will testify... they have no idea of the boy's current name and there are no decent pictures of him or his mother. Unfortunately Phoebe gets ill so Kimble must play teacher... how hard can it be? He soon finds out that six year olds are much harder to deal with than criminals! He must figure out how to deal with the children while trying to identify Crisp's family. Inevitable before long Crisp is bailed and heads to Astoria looking for his son.One might think that because this is a comedy set in a kindergarten class it will be a family film suitable for all ages... it isn't. There are scenes of violence at the start and end as well as scenes of sustained threat to a child that are too intense for children. The sight of Arnie struggling with a class full of sixyear olds is pretty funny he does a fine job in the role. Pamela Reed also really impresses as his partner Phoebe. There are also notable performances from Linda Hunt as the school principal and Penelope Ann Miller as a fellow teacher who has a son at the school and provides a possible love interest for Kimble. The children of the class feel natural and provide many of the film's laughs. The identity of Crisp's wife and family aren't too obvious as there are a number of possibilities... that said when we do learn who they are it isn't a huge surprise. The early parts of the film and its ending are the best it did drag a little in the middle as Kimble gets control of her class. Overall I'd recommend this to Arnie's other films just don't expect the action to be as full on as his earlier '80s films.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Kimble Arnold Schwarzenegger is a cop assigned to put a killer named Crisp behind bars for good. To do so Kimble needs to find Crisp's son and exwife. All he knows for certain is the name of the small Oregon town where the live and that the boy is kindergarten age. Kimble goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to try to find the boy. Even though he's a tough cop on a mission Kimble realizes to his amazement that he enjoys teaching the kids. He also finds a love interest in one of the other teachers Joyce Penelope Ann Miller  a single mother whose son is in Kimble's class. And as luck would have it Kimble discovers that Joyce is Crisp's exwife. How convenient! Kimble will have to act fact though because Crisp is on his way to collect his son.For the most part Kindergarten Cop is an enjoyable movie. Schwarzenegger seems naturally unnatural around the kids but that works in the film's favor. Kimble should be awkward around his class. There are a number of humorous interactions between the unhumorous Kimble and the kids  my favorite being his reaction to the kid obsessed with death. Good stuff. As awkward as Schwarzenegger is around the children it's the exact opposite when it comes to his costar Miller. There's a nice chemistry between the two that really shows onscreen. I would have loved to see the pair make more movies together. Another plus for kindergarten cop is Pamela Reed playing Kimble's partner. Reed is always good and gives a solid performance here. Throw in some nice action toward the film's conclusion and Kindergarten Cop ends up being a nice experience. I do however have two complaints. First the film is too long. I really think that if just 10 to 15 minutes were cut from the runtime it would be a better tighter movie. Cut the scenes with Cathy Moriarty for example. They add zilch to the final product. Second baddie Crisp and his mother aren't threatening enough. They're jokes. Had the pair been played with a more menacing tone the final showdown would have been even better. Still it's a solid film as is.".

Like that one this is a film that is so highconcept that you should be able to work out a large part of the plot just by looking at the poster. The film does one of those things that lots of comedies from the late 80's  early 90's did and that is set up a lighthearted comedy framework and then throw in a crime subplot into the mix. To this end we have Arnold playing a disillusioned cop who is trying to hunt down that other staple of the era  the criminal with a sharp suit and power ballad haircut. Arnie travels to a small town in Oregon where he knows that Power Ballad's exwife and son live. In order to find them he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher. Needless to say this unlikely primary school teacher gets into a series of toddlerrelated japes while falling in love with Power Ballad's exwife who also works at the school. Before long things turn nasty when Power Ballad turns up and tries to steal his son back leaving Arnie with no alternative but to deal with this ponytailed suitedandbooted ponce.This one shouldn't work but it does. Its story is almost charmingly moronic but it gets by on account of a highly likable and often somewhat hilarious performance from Schwarzenegger who really can play comedy really well. He is ably supported by Pamela Reed who plays his partner who at one stage hilariously pretends to be his sister replete with amusing Austrian accent and Germanic gestures. Then of course there are the little kids themselves who are often very funny and who Arnie works extremely well with and has great chemistry. The result is a movie which transcends its paper thin basic idea and results in a genuinely charming chucklefest.".

The couple has nothing to do with politics and spend their days happily with their 3 year old daughter and their TV despite the clamor of guns clashing outside every night. One Friday morning they wake up and hear the voice of Hasan Mutlucan on radio and observe soldiers marching through the streets the very confirmation of the military coup that has taken place. Arrests begin instantly in workplace and neighborhood. Yet Mustafa far from being disturbed assumes that all apprehensions must have rightful reasons. Until the night he's taken into custody charged with the crimes of a militant code named Sehmuz.";

	schema:reviewBody "If all you ask is the Turkish film you intend to watch tonight be about something and unless exchanging glances with full screen speechless faces turns you on HOME COMING EVE DONUS is clearly among your eligible choices.The infamous 1980 coup d'tat of Turkey is one of the least filmed subjects in Turkey. Only for having dealt with this unspoken atrocity Omer UGUR deserves a good rating. All that happens to the main character is by no means fictional or an exceptional error and having this film produced by a Turkish team is surely a step towards a better Turkey. Although I would love to have this film shot as stunningly as GARAGE OLIMPO of Marco BECHIS I acknowledge the value of the attempt.The script The frantic communist hunt of the September 12 junta was not conducted in a refined manner not only the army took everybody as a suspect but many daily disputes among ordinary people ended up with reporting each other as communists as well. And what was worse than this was that all informants were being taken seriously and providing misinformation was not penalised. The script demonstrates the chilling reality of the era and describes the shortcut to torture cells. It has been pertinent to the matter to base the script on a few months of an apolitical textile worker's life.My analysis divides the script into 3 and names them as before during and after torture parts. The before torture part serving as character introduction and locale presentation also is properly handled without any unconvincing or misrepresenting details. Ages professions friends of the main characters and the quarter the events take place are successfully workedout components. His landlord's persistent attempts to collect the unpaid rent and Mustafa the hero overlooking the old guy and underestimating the severity of the matter was a wellchosen hint of the upcoming disaster  at least for all tenant Turks of the era. The downside of this part is its 28 minutes of approximate length housing a lot of todonothingwith scenes. A solid example is the preceding scene of Mustafa cheating on his wife scene. When was that cheating thing??? you say? Well it is among the deleted scenes in the extras folder! This coincidentally initiated chatting that starts at 930 of the DVD timer and ends at 1017 is incomplete and therefore should have been found in the deleted scenes section which itself needs another deletion as a whole. Also the frequently occurring discussion between Mustafa and Esma about their sexual activities' frequency is another discrepancy that has no contribution to a political movie. UGUR probably inserted the recurring MustafawantingEsmarefusing conflict along with a Mustafa chasing Esma in a jerrybuilt house thrill in order not to neglect the eroticism aspect. To my opinion a more suitable destination for the whole idea is the recycle bin.The night Mustafa is taken to the custody centre is where the film begins for me. A very realistic arrest ends up in a carefully selected basement. The reason why Mustafa is tortured is elegantly simple He is mistaken with someone codenamed Sehmuz. The police were capable of making anyone confess any crime then and this during part as I put effectively demonstrates how. The way Mustafa befriends with Professor during custody days the killing of real Sehmuz the confrontation of Mustafa with a real anarchist and finally his release are all presented convincingly.Final part life after torture or home coming is also realistically handled. Fired characters the loss of the home to come reverberating voices Mustafa's risky assignment of telling the Professor's family where Professor is and the balance sheet of the September 12 junta that flows in the ending were all spectacular. Mustafa's home coming part is a perfectly planned part with no excess material.The Cast The lead actor Memet Ali ALABORA shines as the brightest star of the production whereas the lead actress Sibel KEKILLI forming the weakest link of the chain is a letdown. Perhaps as a native Turkish speaker I am posting a biased comment with too much emphasis on dialogues here but cannot help acknowledge ALABORA's firstrate control of his voice and his success in conveying the fear. Given that the plot was not the immortal concept of Berliner Turks adapting to Berlin I think this just is not KEKILLI's script. Her peasant accent with some German flavour is awkward the least to say for the daughter of those Istanbulite parents. Apart from a number of brightly performed instants thanks to her innate talent in desperate screams there are more than a few scenes in which more relevant performance than flirtatiously smiling would work better. I guess the lead actress could tolerate some compromise in the beauty axis in return for a little gain in the suitability axis but Miss Orange folks evidently disregarded the latter axis. The torture team has also a vital role and the captain Civan Canova might be particularly brilliant if this detail was overcome they are not scary at all. Again the issue of wording and dialect! Any Turk knows the police cannot speak such a good Turkish with no grammar mistakes and this is the reason why Canova continuously reminds this is only a film. Esma's parents are doing their part perfectly. Perhaps the landlord and the watercannoned anarchist guy had minor roles but the two were so gorgeous that not mentioning their contributions would be a gross negligence.Setting and props I cannot detect any major mismatches with the era and the notion of the film. One erroneous feature may be too dirtfree an environment such as extraordinarily clean streets or excellentlooking props like that sparkling red Anadol taxi taking Mustafa to his fatherinlaw's home.This film fills a gap.Written by Armagan TEKDONER".

	schema:reviewBody "Washizu is a brave samurai who helps his lord to fight off a violent rebellion.  Washizu and his friend Miki are riding through Cobweb Forest when a spirit appears to them and makes predictions which fire their ambitions.  When Washizu explains this vision to his wife Asaji she urges him to murder his lord and rule in his stead.  Thus the tragedy begins.Kurosawa's interpretation of Macbeth is visually fascinating. Swirling mist colossal trees dripping with rain rich black volcanic soil and bulky fortress architecture provide the imposing dreadladen backdrop against which the humans move in superbly stylized patterns.  The director chose to shoot the action on Mount Fuji precisely because of the volcanic soil  and even had truckloads brought to the studio for pickup shots.Westerners unfamiliar with Noh are missing a huge part of the film's meaning.  This thousandyearold theatrical tradition corresponds broadly to our Elizabethan Tragedy and Kurosawa shows how the two cultural strains eastern and western interlock and interact.  The one illumines the other.The Noh stage must have on it three pine branches and a symbolic Shinto templearch.  In the film shots are carefully composed to include tangles of branches in the foreground and the vast entrance gate of Washizu's fortress serves for the temple arch.  And yet Kurosawa is not including these details redundantly for mere form's sake  the ubiquitous branches framing the human action remind us all the time of the forest nemesis awaiting Washizu.  The arch is Washizu's interface with the world  open in the early stages but gradually less so as the protagonist retreats into his own diseased inner self.A Noh play features a doer Shite and a companion Waku who plays a subordinate role.  Washizu and Asaji are the Shite and Waku respectively. Elements in the Noh include a battledrama we get one here and a socalled wig drama in which a female character dominates the action.  This is the central portion of the film in the quiet of the fortress quarters when Asaji ruthlessly manipulates her husband's ambition.  Every Noh play has a ghost which appears to the Shite and the spirit in the forest fulfils that function.  Noh plays are never original works in that by a venerable convention they are reworkings of ancient legends.  Kurosawa follows tradition by quarrying his tale from Shakespeare's play.There is no western term to describe the stylized striking of poses so important in Noh.  Our word dance is a crude word which approximates to but does not convey the grace of the Japanese artform.  Asaji alone with the bloodstain gives us a glimpse of this delightful ritual.Finally Noh contains an aural richness almost totally absent from western tragedy  the complex rhythms of stamping and percussion which accompany the spoken word.  In the film the rhythmic patterns of horses' hooves on soil and Washizu's bare feet on the boards of the banquet hall are meant to reinforce the mood as they creep into our emotions by subliminal insistence.Isuzu Yamada is terrific as Asaji.  Her stillness absolutely oozes determination contrasting strongly with her husband's hollow bluster.It seems that Kurosawa cherished the concept of a Noh Macbeth for some years before committing it to celluloid.  Apparently the project had to be scrapped in 1952 because Welles' Macbeth was nearing completion and Kurosawa did not want the two films to suffer by being endlessly compared. This version then had to wait until 1957 to be realised.The director is not afraid to add his own flourishes to the wellknown story.  We hear of the notorious traitor Fujimaki who disembowelled himself in a room of the fortress.  The exact spot is now known as the Forbidden Room a place of evil omen with its indelible bloodstain on the floor.  It is a symbol which encapsulates the spirit of the film interweaving the related themes of treachery blood and guilt.  In a brilliant transition we are taken to a change of scene by the ripping down of a banner by galloping horsemen.  Washizu at the pinnacle of his arrogance is filmed from below with severe foreshortening conveying his vainglory more effectively than words ever could.  The death scene with its railing hysterical protagonist and relentless volleys of arrows their grouped shafts recalling the fateful forest has enormous power and lives long in the viewer's memory.".

Not for nothing is Akira Kurosawa regarded as Japan's greatest director for this is the best cinematic version of any Shakespeare play and also one of Kurosawa's best films. Kurosawa had the advantage of working in a different language Japanese so he didn't have to agonize over the usual dilemma  whether to use Shakespeare's rotund oratory and blank verse which is glorious but goes badly on screen. Kurosawa essentially translates Shakespeare's poetry into visual images while keeping dialogue to a minimum. He also had the good fortune of accessing two great cultures  European literature and Japanese visual art he was originally a painter before entering cinema as a setdesigner. There are many painterly images reminiscent of Ukiyoe e.g. Washizu full of arrows.The Noh style of acting like Kabuki but more refined seems stilted and exaggerated for the first few minutes then you realize that is ideally suited to a story like this  more natural acting would seem out of place as other Macbethmovies go to prove. The Japanese title of this film translates as Cobweb Castle or Spider City and this really should have been the title in English. The film is full of the notion of spiders spinning webs and plots in secret. It is worth noting that the witch or monster is first seen with a ghostly spinningwheel. This symbolizes the thread of fate but also reflects the cobweb theme.The story is sometimes slowmoving but you have to realize that this is a story of insidious slow rot hence the references to spiders and cobwebs. The decay is punctured by occasional bursts of violent action as befits the story. The blackandwhite picture adds to the creepiness and the atmosphere is so thick that the movie works more effectively than Ran Kurosawa's more polished Shakespeareadaptation.Macbeth is the greatgranddaddy of the entire horror genre and Kurosawa is a worthy descendant.".

	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion 'Throne Of Blood' is almost as brilliant as Kurosawa's more celebrated 'Rashomon'. It's almost impossible to fault this brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth'. It's the most compelling version of the story I have seen even better than Polanski's outstanding film of the early 1970s which until seeing 'Throne Of Blood' was my favourite. Kurosawa is without doubt one of the greatest film makers of all time and watching this movie is experiencing a master at work. Toshiro Mifune gives another brilliant performance and Isuzu Yamada who plays his wife the equivalent of the Lady Macbeth character is absolutely chilling. The stylized acting combined with the superb cinematography gives this movie a frightening nightmarish feel yet the characters are always human. This makes it a very powerful and haunting movie. I don't seem to see 'Throne Of Blood' mentioned a lot as one of Kurosawa's best but I was incredibly impressed by it and it comes with my highest recommendation. This is a brilliant movie and to call it a masterpiece is no exaggeration.".

	schema:reviewBody "A great deal has been made of the fact that THRONE OF BLOOD also known as SPIDER'S WEB CASTLE is drawn from one of Shakespeare's most celebrated plays. This is both a blessing and a curse for while it gives western audiences a point of reference it also invites all sorts of comparisons that viewers familiar with the Shakespeare play feel honorbound to makeand that can get in the way of seeing the film as it is rather than what we expect it to be. And that would be a great pity because what it is in and of itself is quite fine indeed.The cast is a very strong ensemble with frequent Kurosawa star Torshiro Mifune leading the film with a remarkably fine performance as the ambitious warrior Taketori Washizu. To my mind however the most memorable performance is offered by Isuzu Yamada as Lady Washizuwho plays the role with a demonic stillness that cracks into physical action only when she is completely sure of herself or in utter desperation. It is one of the most disturbing characterizations I have ever encountered.As usual in any Kurosawa film the imagery involved is extremely powerful and the moody tone of the film quickly draws viewers inand once ensnared there is no escape the film holds your attention with considerable ease throughout. Even so I would not recommend THRONE OF BLOOD to western audiences who have never seen a Kurosawa film for it is so completely Japanese in aesthetic that some may find it hard to grasp. It is best seen after you are already familiar with both Kurosawa's work and Japanese cinema in general.The film is available via Criterion DVD which is quite good with a nicely restored transfer and bonus features that include the original trailer a choice of subtitle translations I prefer the Hoagland translation and a somewhat awkward but ultimately rewarding commentary track by Michael Jeck. If you're a Kurosawa fan and you've never seen THRONE OF BLOOD this is your opportunity if you're looking to replace an existing video with a DVD this one is likely as good as it gets. Strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:headline " Another ambitious film from Akira Kurosawa.";
	schema:reviewBody "Throne of Blood is in fact ambitious as a film as well as in its meaning. It suggests that ambition when based on whimsical motivation can sometimes lead to the destruction of very close relationships and even one's own ruination. Throne of Blood begins with a series of messengers bringing news to their daimyo about an invasion of North Castle by the Fujimaki which is led by an enemy samurai named Inui. The invasion is broken and then bravely retaliated against by two armies which are led by two samurai Washizu and Miki. As they are returning to the daimyo they come across a ghostly spirit in the woods who predicts leadership positions to be attained by each of them that very day. These predictions come true to the last detail which sets off a destructive chain of events.Miki becomes the leader of Fort One as predicted and Washizu becomes the leader of the North Castle as predicted but it is also predicted that Miki's son will rule North Castle after Washizu which causes problems later in the film. Despite their good fortune Miki and especially Washizu must keep their encounter with the fortunetelling spirit in the woods a secret because if word gets out Washizu is likely to become endangered because people will want him dead out of suspicion that he will try to kill Yoshiteru Miki's son to keep him from taking over Washizu's position. In an effort to prevent any of this Washizu decides to name Yoshiteru as his heir but Asaji his wife forbids this saying that she is pregnant. It is Asaji who pressures Washizu into having Miki killed so that he can be the sole ruler of all of the provinces but when this happens the other castles turn against him and seek to avenge the leaders who have been killed under his orders. In the end he is killed by his own army which has lost all faith in him and has also turned against him.There was a very interesting use of symbolism in Throne of Blood that is worth pointing out here. From literally the beginning to the end of the film the setting is covered in thick fog. One scene that comes to mind that quite clearly communicates the meaning of this fog is early in the film just after Washizu and Miki saw the spirit in the woods and had their futures revealed to them. As they are riding out of the woods and back to the castle they begin to cross large flat plains that are covered in this stiflingly thick fog. There is literally a couple of minutes of footage of them riding their horses into the fog then back toward the camera then into the fog in another direction and then back toward the camera and so on. This fog seems to symbolize a natural inability to see ahead or to see the future as it were. This technique is especially effective this early in the film because much of the two men's decisions later in the film are founded on what the spirit told them yet the fog symbolizes a type of foreshadowing that suggests that this premonition cannot be correct.Throne of Blood is also structured in a very unique way. The film starts off showing a desolated castle as well as its surroundings in which there is a sizeable gravestone marking a burial site. While this is being shown there is a song being sung by an unseen choir about a brave warrior who once ruled this nowdeserted castle but who was murdered by ambition.' At the end of the film we see this same montage and the same song is heard and this is where we learn that the gravestone marks Washizu's burial site.Kurosawa used different camera techniques to communicate parts of the story or to emphasize it in various ways much more than he did in other films like Ran Kagemusha and High and Low. One particularly noteworthy example occurred late in the film as Washizu is standing over his army. Washizu stands on an elevated walkway and his army is crowded on the ground below looking up at him. There is a low angle shot from amidst the men and while Washizu is small in the shot itself he is high above the other men looking down at them and they are all looking up at him in unison. However it would seem that rather than use this shot to convey a sense of superiority or of dominance Kurosawa probably meant to emphasize his position of power because this is the scene in which his army turns against him and he is shot with dozens of their arrows. The low angle shot would contradict Washizu's descent into madness if it was meant to show superiority but to emphasize his position of power at this point in the film it makes his downfall much more dramatic.This is usually not the case with Akira Kurosawa but Throne of Blood reflects more of a formalistic style of direction. For example his use of high and low angle shots as well as the extensive symbolic use of the fog suggest more formalism here than realism. Besides that and probably more obviously is the way that the strange spirit in the woods was presented. She was in a radiantly lit hut in the middle of the dark woods and Washizu's encounter with several other spirits later in the film was presented among an extensive use of cutting and editing. The extensive use of very long takes and slow action seen in Ran and Kagemusha is definitely seen here but not nearly as much. There are scenes in which these long takes are seen but in addition to them there can be found many more short takes and highly edited sequences which were largely absent from the previous films. But having done this with the same skill Kurosawa has fashioned another samurai masterpiece.".

	schema:headline " not Kurosawa's best but a dark overtone and a terrific performance by Mifune as a bloodthirsty madman makes it worth your while";
	schema:reviewBody "Akira Kurosawa is one of the most celebrated and renowned of all filmmakers not only because he created some of the world's greatest visionary masterpieces such Seven Samurai 1954 Rashomon 1950 and Yojimbo 1961 but because he had the nerve to draw in on formulas and elements from all around the world and not just those of his native Japan. He is considered the most Western of all Japanese filmmakers having owed a lot of his influence to men such as John Ford. But there also came times when Kurosawa would tend to the realm of William Shakespeare and the influential plays that he created so many years before.The Shakespearian play Macbeth is considered one of the playwright's classics so it wasn't a surprise when Akira Kurosawa decided to film his own adaptation of the story and blend it with his own shocking twists and ideas. His 1957 film Throne of Blood while not entirely faithful to Shakespeare's play and not alluding to any of the original dialogue is ranked one of the greatest Macbeth adaptations of all time. And remember this is a story that has been modified and reconstructed over and over again through the centuries.The basic plot remains the same. Toshiro Mifune stars as the Japanese equivalent to Macbeth a war heroturnedruler who upon being egged by his vindictive and cynical wife Isuzu Yamada and being told a strange prophecy about his future plots to murder his own master and anybody who stands in his way. Once the murder is committed peace does not follow but rather a long chain of bloody killings until the position Mifune holds is exactly what the title personifies.Although I strongly feel that Kurosawa did a better treatment of the Shakespeare play King Lear with Ran 1985 and that this film does not rank on top with some of his others Throne of Blood is still a very good and very visionary and creative opus. And part of the reason why I like it is because of its inherently dark nature. Unlike Yojimbo 1961 which made a sort of glory out of violence Throne of Blood has an atmosphere of terror and intensity around it. Right from the beginning when we hear Masaru Sato's chilling opening score we know this is going to be a dark film. Toshiro Mifune was perfect casting as the bloodthirsty Washizu. Although he is far less evil that Macbeth from the play Washizu is in his own way more intimidating due to his viciousness and again those eyes. Mifune maintains the impression of a madman throughout the course of the film and gives us the impression of a wild animal hungry for human flesh and blood. I was also very fond of the performance by Isuzu Yamada as Lady Macbeth's equivalent. Although her performance is mainly a onenote ordeal it still works out well and there was something about her that reminded me not of a snake like one would expect but a rat. I do not know if Kurosawa did this intentionally but when she walks the lower garments of her robe rubs against the floor with a kind of squeallike wisp. And like a rat she spreads her disease the thirst for blood.Throne of Blood is not a perfect film however. The music score by Masaru Sato save for the opening theme and a few cues here and there is rather forgettable. Some of the supporting cast members such as those by Akira Kubo and Takashi Shimura seem very underdeveloped. However any weaknesses that become noticeable are soon forgiven when Kurosawa's original and terrific ending scene comes into frame which was a major improvement over the disappointing climax from the play.So overall Kurosawa's Throne of Blood is again not his best film but certainly a very unique and entertaining one and a great vision of the Japanese perception of Shakespeare's classic.".

	onyx:emotionText "Akira Kurosawa is one of the most celebrated and renowned of all filmmakers not only because he created some of the world's greatest visionary masterpieces such Seven Samurai 1954 Rashomon 1950 and Yojimbo 1961 but because he had the nerve to draw in on formulas and elements from all around the world and not just those of his native Japan. He is considered the most Western of all Japanese filmmakers having owed a lot of his influence to men such as John Ford. But there also came times when Kurosawa would tend to the realm of William Shakespeare and the influential plays that he created so many years before.The Shakespearian play Macbeth is considered one of the playwright's classics so it wasn't a surprise when Akira Kurosawa decided to film his own adaptation of the story and blend it with his own shocking twists and ideas. His 1957 film Throne of Blood while not entirely faithful to Shakespeare's play and not alluding to any of the original dialogue is ranked one of the greatest Macbeth adaptations of all time. And remember this is a story that has been modified and reconstructed over and over again through the centuries.The basic plot remains the same. Toshiro Mifune stars as the Japanese equivalent to Macbeth a war heroturnedruler who upon being egged by his vindictive and cynical wife Isuzu Yamada and being told a strange prophecy about his future plots to murder his own master and anybody who stands in his way. Once the murder is committed peace does not follow but rather a long chain of bloody killings until the position Mifune holds is exactly what the title personifies.Although I strongly feel that Kurosawa did a better treatment of the Shakespeare play King Lear with Ran 1985 and that this film does not rank on top with some of his others Throne of Blood is still a very good and very visionary and creative opus. And part of the reason why I like it is because of its inherently dark nature. Unlike Yojimbo 1961 which made a sort of glory out of violence Throne of Blood has an atmosphere of terror and intensity around it. Right from the beginning when we hear Masaru Sato's chilling opening score we know this is going to be a dark film. Toshiro Mifune was perfect casting as the bloodthirsty Washizu. Although he is far less evil that Macbeth from the play Washizu is in his own way more intimidating due to his viciousness and again those eyes. Mifune maintains the impression of a madman throughout the course of the film and gives us the impression of a wild animal hungry for human flesh and blood. I was also very fond of the performance by Isuzu Yamada as Lady Macbeth's equivalent. Although her performance is mainly a onenote ordeal it still works out well and there was something about her that reminded me not of a snake like one would expect but a rat.

Afterwards they are invited to the lord's castle. On their way there they come across a spirit in the forest. the spirit tells Washizu that he will soon become in command of a castle but that he will not rule long and Yoshaki's son will soon takeover. Washizu is soon convinced that these predictions will come true and becomes consumed with greed and evil in order to make sure that they do indeed come true.In this film Kurosawa uses a more still and quiet filming style than was used in his previous films with the exception of Ikiru.

It's also drenched in grim weather  the everpresent fog is a stunning metaphor for the moral dilemmas which constantly confront Washizu almost as if the cloudiness of his thoughts have seeped out to surround him. Immediately after meeting the ghost Kurosawa uses an amazing ten wordless shots  count them ten  of Mifune and Chiaki riding around lost in the fog. Anyone else would have used one or two but the ten are astonishing this director loved bad weather. His use of camera is also brilliant in its simple powerful elegance with so many clever shots to mention the ghost's sudden dramatic disappearance Lady Washizu swallowed by blackness as she fetches the poisoned saki the famous Banquo's Ghost dinner scene not to mention the incredible finale as the treasonable Mifune is tortured by a rain of arrows from his own men.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay the warriors Washizu and Miki ride back from a victorious battle through a magic forest and run into a wispy specter that tells them that Washizu will become king while Miki's son will inherit the kingdom. Coaxed by his wife Washizu assassinates the king and takes his place. Again coaxed by his wife he has his friend Miki killed as well. Well Washizu Toshiro Mifune has made a lot of enemies by this time and they gang up on him attack his castle and kill him  whereupon Miki's son takes the throne thus fulfilling the prophecy.That's it in brief. Can I skip the rest of the plot? Read Shakespeare's MacBeth for the whole story. It's one of my favorite plays by WS partly because it's the shortest that he ever wrote.I was led to believe Kurosawa's version of the tale deviated considerably from Shakespeare's and that it might be almost unrecognizable but that's not the case at all. It's far from a filmed play of course. In the play we only hear about the woods creeping up on the castle. Here we see the Spider Web Forest in full creepy motion. And if MacBeth is finally killed off stage by Duncan here Washizu winds up with more arrows sticking out of him than a porcupine has quills. And of course Shakespeare's poetry is missing. Or let's say whereas Shakespeare's poetry was verbal Kurosawa's is visual.And what a visual delight it is too in inexpensive black and white full frame. A terrific use of fog lighting spare sets minimalistic acting punctuated by outrageous ham. Toshiro Mifune overacts to the extent that at certain points it becomes a miracle that his eyeballs stay in their sockets.There are however some differences. I think the editing might be off or else I missed the part where Washizu gives the order for Miki to be killed. They bring Washizu Miki's lopped off head missing in the play. If I remember Madam MacBeth doesn't become pregnant and have a stillborn child either as Washizu's wife does here. Also in the play she dies for reasons unexplained. Here she seems to just disappear from the story like the Fool in King Lear unless I looked away from the screen at the wrong moment and missed some subtitles. Just listening to it is no help because I only understand a few words of Japanese and all of them are unprintable. Is this a dagger that I see before me? is missing naturally but the Banquo's Ghost scene is kept just about intact. It includes the intrusion of Washizu's wife trying to explain to the guests that her husband sometimes has these fits and spells when he's liquored up. How many ordinary wives have made the same apologies for their ordinary husbands? But Washizu's wife does more than try to patch over her husband's gaffes. In the play she merely propped up her husband when his ambition weakened urged him to screw your courage to the sticking place. In Kurosawa's film she's the INSTIGATOR of the whole thing. She's truly Machiavellian. Next to her Washizu is a guileless moron who takes too much for granted and is too dumb to concoct her kinds of intrigues. Her emoting throughout is highly stylized and seems somehow artificial to Western eyes but probably more accessible to those Japanese who are in the noh.I admit I found myself a little confused now and then. Especially during the first half I couldn't keep the Lord's Castle the Garrison and the First Second and Third Fortresses straight. The play dealt mostly with titles  the Glames or the Glans or whatever they were  but in the film the prizes are places as well as titles.It's a dark film darker than the play that begat it. The three witches with their bubbling cauldron seem to be figures of fun but the spectral old man who sings a tale of life is positively depressing though spookier than the witches. The imagery in this scene is really notable.I keep hearing that Kurosawa was influenced by John Ford but it's hard to see how. Kurosawa was attracted to umberous humorless stories. Ford rarely went without a dance or celebration of some sort. And Kurosawa tried suicide whereas Ford was never in any such danger except for maybe drinking himself to death. I wonder if it had anything to do with Kurosawa's having fought on the losing side of a war and Ford's having been on the winning side.In any case don't miss this.".

But as one who appreciates the beauty of the language in Shakespeare's Macbeth it is difficult not to be disappointed by the mundane subtitles. Instead of poetry we get an uninspired narrative. Compare Commander of Fort 1 with thane of Cawdor and Cobweb Forest to Birnam wood.There is much sound and fury in Mifune's performance but I found his rantings harsh to the ear. I recognize that what is histrionic to me may be sublime to a Japanese but I felt the need to turn the volume down as the movie went along. However I thought that Isuzu Yamada in the Lady Macbeth role was impressive paradoxically her quiet restraint accentuated her dominating authority. The scenes between Yamada and Mifune in the bare room are powerful. But Yamada seemed so unwavering in her ambition that her total reversal in the Out damned spot scene seemed unmotivated.There is some engaging black and white photography but often director Kurosawa appears to be too much in love with his own brilliant technique. When Washizu and Miki get lost in the Cobweb Forest they ride in and out of the fog for a good two and a half minutes when thirty seconds would have been enough the scene where Washizu accompanies the murdered lord's coffin to Miki's castle seems to go on forever. As spectacular as the final scene is where Washizu is inundated with a barrage of a thousand arrows it was unbelievable that 99 of them missed him by only a few inches. I suppose this was in order to allow him to die a more dramatic prolonged death. A single arrow through the neck might have been more effective.It may be that a culture gap is greatly responsible for my reaction to this film but I cannot give it high marks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Macbeth is a haunting play and Kurusawa is always such an interesting character to make Japanese recreations of his work. Of course in the process he does change them a bit creating something that is not Shakespearian anymore it's Kurusawa. Some themes are altered mostly thanks to the images that Kurusawa takes his time to study.Here however there is a problem. It is quite lengthy. It's almost forgivable because Kurusawa really sets the dark mood to a point when it becomes unbearable it's so haunting that you almost feel sick. Mifune is incredible his performance as Washizu the loyal warrior who kills the king to take over his throne. It's excellent whether you know Japanese or not. I didn't really like the other performances however they were all pretty cartoonish and at that static and monotoned. Again I must say though that Mifune does a great job because he has got an evil face.The cinematography is overwhelming. The emptiness of the rooms the majesty of the noble samurais and the mystique of the sinister and magical characters and plot developments. The apparitions are quite admirable. The second time he sees the witch the apparitions become scary. The way people appear and reappear it's all mad and you can understand why Washizu has become insane. And in the scene where during a dinner where Miki was invited but had been killed Washizu sees his ghost and it's an unnatural vision that is edited excellently on the spot. The camera moves around the set as it we were following Washizu's own destructions at the end of all that is evil and himself.As I said the photography is beautiful and overwhelming. And example of this is when Asaji now collapsed under the pressure of 'the deed' keeps scrubbing her hands because she can't get rid of the smell of his Lordship's blood off them. It's a very dramatic sequence made even more dramatic by Mifune's brilliant performance particularly when he hopelessly calls out her name. It is the prelude of the end here isn't Throne of Blood whereas in Macbeth by Sakespeare it's a secondary even that almost comes as a relief to Macbeth.The film drags on a little too much is a few sequences. The dialog is repetitive and sometimes that can be frustrating. This happens quite a lot when Washizu and Asaji talk about the reasons why he should kill his Lordship. This is the only point where Kurusawa heavily relies on dialog and it's a misstep.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT  Miki's apparition at Wasizu's dinner. His public breakdown. The clear beginning of his insanity and selfdestruction. And Kurusawa's brilliant camerawork aided by a great Mifune.".

	schema:headline " By the pricking of my thumbs something wicked this way comes. Macbeth has come to Japan and it was somewhat amazing! Throne of Blood is worth checking out!";
	schema:reviewBody "Set in feudal Japan during the 'Sengoku Jidai' civil war era of 1477 with stylistic elements drawn from Noh drama. Director Akira Kurosawa's radically retelling of author William Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' was wonderful. 'Throne of Blood' Kumonosu J Spider Web Castle has an intense  spooky atmosphere with great emotional tragic haunting characters. Fame Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune stars as General Washizu a Japanese warlord whom receives a prophecy from a strange spirit who foretells his future in which he was consumed by ambition and spurred to action by greed murders his lord and takes the throne for himself only to find out that he has gone mad with power. Without spoiling the movie too much 'Throne of Blood' is a far more effective haunting story compared to most of the earlier English Macbeth films not only because it follows many of Aristotle's rules of tragedy but also it made great use of the natural looking outside locations in which the plays live on rather than being limited in a fakelooking stage studio. Akira Kurosawa is known for his use of weather and it somewhat shows here with all the scenes filmed in the rainfall as well in the fog. It's amazing that they were even able to get pretty good shots out of it seeing how they were filming in the harsh volcanic slopes of Mount Fuji  in the creepy forest of Aokigahara AKA the suicide forest. It's also cool to hear that Kurosawa's film crew brutally built a real faade castle for this film in this location giving the film a feel of isolation. As a result the film has a definite coldness as it gives the audience chills noticing the castle come out of the fog. Another thing this movie does so well is mixing Shakespeare's tale with that of old Japanese folklore. It really does give it a very unique kinda frightening feel. A good example of this is how Kurosawa made the three witches or fates into a Yamauba old demonic hag with cannibalistic tendencies. Another is how it relate to reallife history. Indeed the 'Sengoku Jidai' era was marked by internecine conflicts among rival Japanese clans due to the absence of a central political power during the Onin War 1467 to 1477. It wasn't until Tokugawa shogunate took power that the kind of treachery prevarication and murder that Kurosawa dramatizes in 'Throne of Blood' has ended. I kinda like the ending of this film showing that the struggle for leadership in the end leads those who seek power closer to the grave. It's way different than the whole political conservatism idea of good vs evil of the original play. Since the Macduff subplot was left out in this version it lead to somewhat way different but more thematic end for the Macbeth figure with the shots of walking trees. For a Kurosawa film the violence is surprising pretty tame compare to his other earlier works like 1950's 'Rashomon'  1954's 'Seven Samurais'. A lot of the harsher violent moments were mention after the face done offscreen or mention through texts in some really badly edited moments. The only thing I can say was really intense was the famous arrow scene near the end of the film. It was surprising done with real arrows. No wonder why Toshir Mifune looks like he was crapping his pants. I like how Kurosawa was able to get Mifune to have a facial express of reallife fear. His acting throughout this film was great even if he sounds a bit over the top angry at times. While Mifune might had been a little bit overdramatic the actress Isuzu Yamada that played his wife Lady Asaji was not. She was very limited with her facial expressions lines and movement in this film. I know a lot of people like her Nohlike mime performance here but I found it to be not as villainous as other versions. She barely moves or blinks during the entire first half of the film and always takes a polite tone with her husband. I guess it's to show that she can be sinister without speaking much but I found her acting to be too robotic and unhuman to be taken seriously. Her repetitive comments wouldn't convince me to commit murder and that's the bad thing to have in a movie because it's the plotpoint that drives the film forwards. Because of that this movie really drags at points during pacing. Even some of the supporting cast members such as those by Akira Kubo and Takashi Shimura seem very underdeveloped. Yet I do like the idea of all the actors in the film being caked with makeup that looks like Nohlooking spiritual masks. I just wish they add this much effect to the deadlord ghost sequence during the middle of the film. Another thing the Japanese music by composer Masaru Sato that went along with this movie was earbleeding noise. I really couldn't stay that high pitch flute sound at all. It was really distracting me from the rest of the film as I had to cover my ears whenever it came on. It really did ruin parts of the film for me. Yet the Japanese with English subtitles does not. It was a lot easily to understand this film with the Japanese with English subtitles than the Old Shakespearian English language playing on its own. Overall As good as the aesthetics and philosophy are in the film. I just wish some parts of the film like the psychology would be better. Still I have to say I kinda enjoyed this film. It was awe inspiring just need a little more work.".

It's amazing that they were even able to get pretty good shots out of it seeing how they were filming in the harsh volcanic slopes of Mount Fuji  in the creepy forest of Aokigahara AKA the suicide forest. It's also cool to hear that Kurosawa's film crew brutally built a real faade castle for this film in this location giving the film a feel of isolation. As a result the film has a definite coldness as it gives the audience chills noticing the castle come out of the fog. Another thing this movie does so well is mixing Shakespeare's tale with that of old Japanese folklore. It really does give it a very unique kinda frightening feel. A good example of this is how Kurosawa made the three witches or fates into a Yamauba old demonic hag with cannibalistic tendencies. Another is how it relate to reallife history. Indeed the 'Sengoku Jidai' era was marked by internecine conflicts among rival Japanese clans due to the absence of a central political power during the Onin War 1467 to 1477. It wasn't until Tokugawa shogunate took power that the kind of treachery prevarication and murder that Kurosawa dramatizes in 'Throne of Blood' has ended. I kinda like the ending of this film showing that the struggle for leadership in the end leads those who seek power closer to the grave. It's way different than the whole political conservatism idea of good vs evil of the original play. Since the Macduff subplot was left out in this version it lead to somewhat way different but more thematic end for the Macbeth figure with the shots of walking trees. For a Kurosawa film the violence is surprising pretty tame compare to his other earlier works like 1950's 'Rashomon'  1954's 'Seven Samurais'. A lot of the harsher violent moments were mention after the face done offscreen or mention through texts in some really badly edited moments. The only thing I can say was really intense was the famous arrow scene near the end of the film. It was surprising done with real arrows. No wonder why Toshir Mifune looks like he was crapping his pants. I like how Kurosawa was able to get Mifune to have a facial express of reallife fear. His acting throughout this film was great even if he sounds a bit over the top angry at times. While Mifune might had been a little bit overdramatic the actress Isuzu Yamada that played his wife Lady Asaji was not. She was very limited with her facial expressions lines and movement in this film. I know a lot of people like her Nohlike mime performance here but I found it to be not as villainous as other versions. She barely moves or blinks during the entire first half of the film and always takes a polite tone with her husband. I guess it's to show that she can be sinister without speaking much but I found her acting to be too robotic and unhuman to be taken seriously. Her repetitive comments wouldn't convince me to commit murder and that's the bad thing to have in a movie because it's the plotpoint that drives the film forwards. Because of that this movie really drags at points during pacing. Even some of the supporting cast members such as those by Akira Kubo and Takashi Shimura seem very underdeveloped. Yet I do like the idea of all the actors in the film being caked with makeup that looks like Nohlooking spiritual masks. I just wish they add this much effect to the deadlord ghost sequence during the middle of the film. Another thing the Japanese music by composer Masaru Sato that went along with this movie was earbleeding noise. I really couldn't stay that high pitch flute sound at all. It was really distracting me from the rest of the film as I had to cover my ears whenever it came on. It really did ruin parts of the film for me. Yet the Japanese with English subtitles does not. It was a lot easily to understand this film with the Japanese with English subtitles than the Old Shakespearian English language playing on its own. Overall As good as the aesthetics and philosophy are in the film. I just wish some parts of the film like the psychology would be better. Still I have to say I kinda enjoyed this film. It was awe inspiring just need a little more work.";

	schema:reviewBody "Kurosawa takes the Scottish play and turns it Japanese. This was something of a departure for him as for the first time he neglects the humanist warmth that was his trademark up to this point to make a film that his overwhelmingly dark dismal and cold.Not only does Kurosawa transfer the setting of the story from Scotland to Japan he also keeps the theatrical roots of the story in mind but transfers them to oriental theatrical tradition. The music pace movement and mood is reminiscent of Japanese Noh performance. There are piercing reed flutes slow deliberate movements and guttural voices. Kurosawa even frames much of the action between doorways gateways and trees as if they were the edges of the stage. With all this theatrical exaggeration it was also his most stylised and unnatural picture to date.Kurosawa appears to have been heavily influenced by Laurence Olivier's Hamlet 1948. Like Olivier he uses a wide range of cinematic techniques to inject an atmosphere of despair and dread that could never be conveyed on the stage. An even more direct influence is the horror aspect  the meeting with the witch in Throne of Blood is particularly similar to the appearance of the ghost in Hamlet right down to the eerie distant voice.While it follows the story of Macbeth fairly closely perhaps the biggest deviation is that it is Washizu's own men  not the approaching rival army  who kill him in the end. That puts a new spin on the study of power making the point that a corrupt leader could just as easily be brought down by the people he commands. And there's another theatrical reference that deepens the point  the army assembled below the balcony in that final scene is more than a bit like an audience gathered in front of a stage or a screen. In other words it's us who've got rid of Washizu! Kurosawa's technical direction was at its peak here and Throne of Blood is an incredibly fine and polished work. The creation of an atmosphere is really well done. You can almost feel the cold dampness of the fog that dominates the outdoor scenes. A particularly strong scene is the first one after Washizu has been made master of North Mansion. We see Washizu's men relaxing outdoors in bright sunshine one of whom remarks that the lord and lady must be very happy now. We then cut to see the reality as Washizu and his wife Asaji are sitting motionless and brooding in a dark bare room. This probably was an influence on Francis Ford Coppola in his construction of the opening wedding scene in The Godfather.The camerawork in Throne of Blood does annoy me a little. There's too much dollying in and out in some scenes. Having said that the dollying is used as quite a clever device in the scene where Washizu sees Miki's ghost. The ghost appears and disappears each time the camera returns to the point where it is sitting as the point of view we are supposed to be seeing changes from Washizu's to that of the other characters.Throne of Blood is another finely crafted work from a master director. The only trouble with it though is that it doesn't have any fun or warmth to it making it incredibly depressing to watch. Sure it can be appreciated and it's occasionally mesmerising to watch but overall it's nowhere near as enjoyable as many of Kurosawa's other pictures of this period.".

	schema:reviewBody "When discussing Kurosawa most fans point to his three masterpieces Ran Rashomon and Seven Samurai.  Without disputing the validity of any of the films on the list Throne of Blood certainly belongs with the Holy Trinity on any retrospective of the director's greatest works one could also argue for the inclusion of High and Low but that's a different discussion altogether.Visually Throne of Blood will be immediately recognizable as a Kurosawa film to anyone who has seen Ran.  He utilizes the same epic scale to represent the relative smallness of these otherwise largerthanlife characters when placed in nature presenting all human ambition as the highest form of folly  a theme that appears in much of his later work and that meshes perfectly with Shakespeare's own moral in Macbeth.  The filmmaker's ability to express grand themes without extensive dialogue is already welldocumented but is usually seen as a skill developed later in his career sometimes noted by pointing out the differences between the dialoguedriven narrative in early works such as Rashomon with the more visceral storytelling in such films as Dersu Uzala and of course Ran. While it's certainly true that the more visual style was a hallmark of his later films Throne of Blood clearly shows us that this was not exclusively a talent that grew with age and experience.Even without the amazing visual aspects of the film including but not limited to cinematography Throne still stands as a grand example of a master storyteller surrounding himself with the ideal cast and crew to produce that rarest of films  the personal epic.  In contrast to other attempts Gladiator Titanic et al to personalize wellworn epics Kurosawa never loses sight of the human qualities that drive the action in Macbeth.  Cupidity machismo and the manipulation of others others to achieve an evil end are all explored in even greater detail than in the original play.Interestingly Throne of Blood also makes the Macduff character here called Miki complicit with MacbethWashizu's schemes  perhaps the most profound deviation from the original.  This probably had much to do with Kurosawa's own view of postwar Japan and the silent majority that allowed what he saw as the dehumanizing effect of corporate cultural dominance to take hold another recurring them in Kurosawa's later works.  Miki is not excused through ignorance  he is fully aware of what has transpired as are all of the soldiers on both sides of the battle.  This adds an interesting twist to the old story nobody is innocent and none are excused from culpability.A few final notes each deserving more consideration  the acting while highly stylized I jokingly refer to the film as Kabuki Macbeth is often brilliant.  Minoru Chiaki was outstanding as the conflicted Miki and Toshiro Mifune was of course outstanding.  Special consideration has to be given to Isuzu Yamada's Lady Washizu by far the finest portrayal of Lady Macbeth that I've seen  and I can't imagine one better.  She dominates the film in every scene she's in and her every word drips with venom and duplicity.  Also notable is the climactic scene in the movie spoiler if you've been living in a cave for the last 400 years and don't know the story where the source of Macbeth's death elicited an audible gasp from the audience when I saw the film  this 46 years later in the postExorcist age.  In the end Throne of Blood is easily the finest film version of Macbeth and even surpasses the original in many ways.  For any fan of Kurosawa this belongs on any list of his finest films.".

Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. Christopher Walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love. This is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener. All in all a truly gripping film from beginning to end. Highly recommended!".

The set up is absolutely NOT boring although it takes time  it is involving and takes us on a little journey into the characters  including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as the mother. This all serves to make the action so much more effective as we are so invested in the characters for all their all too obvious weaknesses. This film has you on the edge for its entirety and doesn't cop out at the end either.The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there I can only really think of one Daniel Day Lewis who has more onscreen power these days. This film should have been huge given his status and the strength of his performance and the quality of the film. It just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't back a film to the hilt it ends up going straight to video. I wish I'd got the chance to see this on the big screen.".

It's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse. It angers me to read in the news how killers kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy Denzel Washington's character. A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante. Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here at least in the big cities. I actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's Creasy did his fine job upon. That would be so marvelous Sorry I am THAT resentful!. MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you can't miss. It might be hard on some of you if you aren't used to reading subtitles Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies but the effort will be well worth it. Some of the editing is a bit fuzzy...kind of like TRAFFIC remember? another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is. The movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half. I swear you'll be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers. His performance is nothing short of Excellent. The ending no spoilers OK!!! is a bit sad but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the year's best movies. A must own for a DVD collection! 9 out of 10".

It stars Denzel Washington Dakota Fanning Marc Anthony Rachael Ticotin Radha Mitchell Christopher Walken Giancarlo Giannini Mickey Rourke and Jess Ochoa. Music is scored by Harry GregsonWilliams and cinematography by Paul Cameron.Mexico City and kidnappings are rife. Enter exmilitary operative John Creasy Washington. Often drunk and with no discerning aims in life Creasy is hired by the Ramos family to act as bodyguard to their young daughter Pita Fanning. After initially being cold and distant Creasy starts to form a warm relationship with Pita but tragedy strikes and Pita is kidnapped. This sets the wheels in motion for Creasy to go on a one man war of revenge against anyone involved in the snatch.Directed with a raft of deliriously ace neonoir flourishes by Tony Scott Man on Fire is 145 minutes of fatalism. From the outset it's evident that this sweaty part of Mexico is home to a tortured soul a man in desperate need of redemption. John Creasy will get this redemption by hook or by crook we know this the narrative structure quickly pulls us in to impress this fact upon us. How he finds it both emotionally and physically is what drives the picture on. This is no ordinary tale of revenge an excuse for pyrotechnics and inventive deaths it is about one man's journey to said redemption his trawl through hell his personal sacrifice is his calling.The catalyst is the kidnapping of young Pita Ramos but where it would have been easy for Scott to jump in early and unleash Creasy hell the director shows great restraint by affording time to the relationship of John and Pita. Most of the first hour is spent building a bond between them the child softening the edges of the Creasy exterior to then enter into his heart as he becomes not just a friend but a surrogate father as well. It's a very real relationship a natural one so when things go pear shaped in the second half of the piece we care what is happening.Yet constantly that air of fatalism and pessimism hangs heavy as the plot thickens the unfolding story pulsing with betrayal at almost every turn classic neonoir and Scott amps up the disorientation as we enter a hellish world of social decay. His box of tricks contain jumpcuts film stock reverse process oversaturated colours kinetic camera work stepprinting and slowmo all used to create the perfect tonal discord a marrying up of the antihero's state of mind and that of the realm he has entered.The film can be accused of pandering to stereotyping Latino baddies especially irksome since the source novel was based in Italy and that is a misstep that could have been avoided but Man on Fire remains one of the most important neonoirs available to view. It refuses to take easy options particularly with the jet black finale it has a grasp on what is required for quintessential neonoir. Backed by stunning work from Washington Scott and Cameron it's a film equally of high technical merit as it is of narrative bite. 910".

I pay money to go see a revenge movie I want revenge  not some tough guy learning that killing is bad etc. Seriously if I wanted a sermon on the importance of turning the other cheek I'd either go to church or rent an ecofriendly Steven Seagal movie.I'm a big fan of the revenge genre there's something about the buildup that gets my blood boiling. I love getting attached to characters and feeling their vengeance which is why I love revenge movies that go allout and feature TRUE revenge.COLLATERAL DAMAGE is a good example of a movie that just backed itself into a wall. It starts as a revenge movie and ends as a message against terrorism war and violence. In an Arnold Schwarzenegger film? Give me a break.So I had never expected to see such hardcore material in MAN ON FIRE  it's an allout action thriller that takes no prisoners. When Denzel stuck a stick of dynamite up a man's anus then blew him up I thought Wow this movie really isn't afraid of offending people.Washington's character isn't likable which is part of the reason this succeeds. Most revenge movies feature heroes who magically don't seem to want to kill anybody. However in this Creasy Washington is a bodyguard who avenges the death of a little girl Dakota Fanning and he does so with more than mere vengeance. I'm going to kill everyone he says and then does with no pity and no remorse.In fact this actually reminded me of the Tom Clancy novel Without Remorse only it's even better. Scott is at the top of his game here revolutionizing subtitles along the way and adding an unmistakable grain to his movie that only helps it become more memorable as a gritty revenge flick.It also features both Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke  the Kings of Cool  in the same film together. That right there makes the film worth seeing.I agree with Quentin Tarantino. This is one of Tony Scott's best films and a great hardasnails revenge movie  I had expected little and got back a lot. A definite mustsee and an Oscarworthy performance by Washington.One of 2004's most underrated films. How did this get 30 positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes?!4.55".

	schema:reviewBody "Although released among a flock of revengeminded action flicks KILL BILL VOL. 2 THE PUNISHER WALKING TALL MAN ON FIRE works as well as it does thanks in large part to the alwayswatchable Denzel Washington one of the best actors around today.In MAN ON FIRE based on A.J. Quinnell's 1980 novel first filmed in 1987 with Scott Glenn Washington plays a downonhisluck exmercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of Jack Daniels until his old partner Christopher Walken offers him a chance at redemption.  He is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 yearold daughter Dakota Fanning of a Mexican businessman Marc Antony and his Americanborn wife Radha Mitchell. While he and Fanning work like oil and water first not mixing very well he really gets to form a bond with her encouraging her to do better at swimming while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past.  It is that very bond that will force Washington back into his old line of work when Fanning is kidnapped and held for a 10 million ransom and he is nearly killed.  With almost any other stock action hero Schwarzenneger Segal etc. the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before.  But Washington's character though he's killing for a reason does not particularly enjoy doing what he does.  Still he gets help from a very intrepid Mexican newspaper reporter Rachel Ticotin out to expose La Hermanidad The Brotherhood the kidnap gang responsible for Fanning's abduction.MAN ON FIRE is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work nearly headacheinducing montage editing and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director Tony Scott TOP GUN CRIMSON TIDE but which are not necessarily unique to him witness Oliver Stone's use of montage in JFK or Sam Peckinpah's in his classic 60s and 70s films.  Still Scott gets a very good performance from Washington as well as Fanning who comes across as far more than a typical moviebrat kid.  Harry GregsonWilliams' southoftheborder Spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack splashes of Chopin Debussy and even Linda Ronstadt's classic 1977 countryrock version of Blue Bayou.  Although the film overall is quite violent it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years and overall it is much better than most.".

Dakota Fanning just by 10 years an excellent actress has become and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie was of marvel I have it in my collection. I hope that they are happened to those producing of Hollywood to make a movie completely in Venezuela where they show our reality better with regard to the delinquency the traffic of drugs or the political problems. They have been few the movies that they play Venezuelan land for example Aracnophobia Jungle 2 Jungle Dragonfly they should make more as well as they make in Mexico.The song Una Mirada I hope that it leaves in the soundtrack it is excellent.

When she gets kidnapped the movie turns into an intense story of violent revenge as Creasy hunts down all the criminals and even police who are in on this kidnapping scandal as he searches for the truth about Pita. This movie is absolutely riveting It's practically two and a half hours long but the story is so compelling the time just flies by.The ending of the movie could have been better but overall this movie is worth watching. As I said earlier Man on Fire reminds me of episode 35 of Beast Wars titled Code of Hero where Dinobot just like Creasy is a troubled person with a dark past who goes on a seemingly hopeless rescue mission with a whole lot of revenge thrown in the mix.If you haven't seen Man on Fire watch it you won't regret doing so.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one film which i was really excited about and believe me it did not disappoint. Denzel Washington is on great form as usual. his portrayal of Creasy a very distraught man is maybe not enough to be considered for an Oscar but it is still up there with his best work. the storyline is fantastic and the stock which Scott chooses to use really gives one a sense of that sweaty gritty and corrupt atmosphere of Mexico. For some the beginning of the film may drag on for a bit too long however it is essential in establishing Creasy's character. The action really starts when Cristopher Walkens who by the way is brilliant in his supporting role says Creasy's about to paint his masterpiece. one by one the culprits meet in their end in ways which even the most spontaneous and inventive killer would not even dream about.

	onyx:emotionText "This is one film which i was really excited about and believe me it did not disappoint. Denzel Washington is on great form as usual. his portrayal of Creasy a very distraught man is maybe not enough to be considered for an Oscar but it is still up there with his best work. the storyline is fantastic and the stock which Scott chooses to use really gives one a sense of that sweaty gritty and corrupt atmosphere of Mexico. For some the beginning of the film may drag on for a bit too long however it is essential in establishing Creasy's character. The action really starts when Cristopher Walkens who by the way is brilliant in his supporting role says Creasy's about to paint his masterpiece. one by one the culprits meet in their end in ways which even the most spontaneous and inventive killer would not even dream about. A brilliant film with a touch of class form both Washington and Scott.";

	schema:reviewBody "You know you're in for something different when a movie has Christopher Walken playing the part of a professional hit man  and he isn't even one of the bad guys! Although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there Man on Fire is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal  and just about every tone imaginable in between.Denzel Washington stars as Creasy a former CIA assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he's committed. So far he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the Bible and not doing all that well with either. As the movie opens Mexico City has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and welltodo possibly perpetrated by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community. Creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety. The first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between Creasy and his charge Pita a sweet little girl who slowly but surely works her way into Creasy's initially hardened heart and affections. The last twothirds of the film turns into an Avenging Angel melodrama as Creasy systematically seeks out and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story.Based on the novel by A.J Quinnell Man on Fire astutely written by Brian Helgeland and flashily directed by Tony Scott is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter. It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is for all intents and purposes achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering admittedly disreputable people. These scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful even if they do at times border on the exploitative. Even better are the quiet intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie. Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.Washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually. In addition to the two leads there are solid performances from Walken Marc Anthony Radha Mitchell Mickey Rourke Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini. But it is Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.Man on Fire would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time but this is still a betterthanaverage crime thriller.".

Regardless of pain or suffering and without personal gain Creasy takes on battles with enemies oncefriends and even himself in order to not let the death of his friend lie in vain.During and after watching this movie I have the overwhelming sensation of cold loss paired with the warmth of friendship and devotion  a devotion that eventually led to death.

I am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof with most of their movies but in this case there was WAY too much. It seems like the jumpcuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end. For a movie that pretends to be violent ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development. That is another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to watch an over the top action flick I do not need any justification but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of Denzel Washington's character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances. The first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clichs are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens. So the movie does not work either on the level of a believable dramathriller  nor as a pure action movie. Of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years but I absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool. For a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance.".

	schema:headline " Why Are The Winds And The Waves So Restless?";
	schema:reviewBody "On Sunday 7 December 1941 the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the US Pacific fleet in its moorings at Pearl Harbor Hawaii.  At the time no state of war existed between the two nations.  An ingenious preemptive strike as the Japanese 'hawks' saw it was condemned by the world as one of the greatest acts of treachery in modern history.Tora! Tora! Tora! meticulously traces the buildup to Pearl Harbor by examining the diplomatic military and intelligence events and developments on both sides.  The film is unimpeachably evenhanded telling both sides' stories simultaneously and interleaving the Japanese and American versions with intelligence and an almost total absence of jingoism.Japan's warmongers considered their country to be trapped by history and geography.  As the industrial nations surged forward in terms of prosperity and military might Japan was in danger of being outstripped having few natural resources of her own.  If Japan was to compete with the USA and USSR she would have to 'reach out' for the raw materials available in southern Asia and the Pacific but this would mean confronting the USA the great maritime power in the Pacific.The film explains all this very well.  We learn that the Japanese have an ageold tradition of striking against their enemies without warning and that air superiority is the new doctrine.  The brilliant Japanese planners such as Genda played by Tatsuya Mihashi have grasped the lessons of the European war and know the vital importance of naval air power.  By 1941 battleships have become a liability  slow lumbering dinosaurs which invite attack and cannot defend themselves against aircraft.  The way forward is mobile air power and that means aircraft carriers.  If the Japanese can catch the American carriers at Pearl Harbor and destroy them then the war will be won before it has properly started.The Americans take a fateful decision to send out their carriers on reconnaissance missions.  This strips Pearl Harbor of protection but paradoxically ensures that Japan cannot win the war  no matter how spectacular the success of the surprise attack the mission will fail if the US aircraft carriers survive.Throughout the buildup the Japanese navy chiefs such as Yamamoto So Yamomura have a snippet of classical Japanese poetry on their minds If all men are brothers why are the winds and the waves so restless?  They take this to mean that it is the rule of nature for man to attack his fellow man.  By the end of the film Yamamoto has abandoned this view and now believes that We have aroused a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve.The film catalogues the accidents and mistakes which combined to make Pearl Harbor a worse disaster for the USA than it need have been.  American aircraft are bunched together in the middle of the airfield in order to reduce the risk of sabotage near the perimeter fence but this helps the Japanese bombers to destroy them on the ground.  Radar equipment cannot be placed in the best locations to give early warning and in any event the radar data are misinterpreted when they predict the attack.

	onyx:emotionText "On Sunday 7 December 1941 the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the US Pacific fleet in its moorings at Pearl Harbor Hawaii.  At the time no state of war existed between the two nations.  An ingenious preemptive strike as the Japanese 'hawks' saw it was condemned by the world as one of the greatest acts of treachery in modern history.Tora! Tora! Tora! meticulously traces the buildup to Pearl Harbor by examining the diplomatic military and intelligence events and developments on both sides.  The film is unimpeachably evenhanded telling both sides' stories simultaneously and interleaving the Japanese and American versions with intelligence and an almost total absence of jingoism.Japan's warmongers considered their country to be trapped by history and geography.  As the industrial nations surged forward in terms of prosperity and military might Japan was in danger of being outstripped having few natural resources of her own.  If Japan was to compete with the USA and USSR she would have to 'reach out' for the raw materials available in southern Asia and the Pacific but this would mean confronting the USA the great maritime power in the Pacific.The film explains all this very well.  We learn that the Japanese have an ageold tradition of striking against their enemies without warning and that air superiority is the new doctrine.  The brilliant Japanese planners such as Genda played by Tatsuya Mihashi have grasped the lessons of the European war and know the vital importance of naval air power.  By 1941 battleships have become a liability  slow lumbering dinosaurs which invite attack and cannot defend themselves against aircraft.  The way forward is mobile air power and that means aircraft carriers.  If the Japanese can catch the American carriers at Pearl Harbor and destroy them then the war will be won before it has properly started.The Americans take a fateful decision to send out their carriers on reconnaissance missions.  This strips Pearl Harbor of protection but paradoxically ensures that Japan cannot win the war  no matter how spectacular the success of the surprise attack the mission will fail if the US aircraft carriers survive.Throughout the buildup the Japanese navy chiefs such as Yamamoto So Yamomura have a snippet of classical Japanese poetry on their minds If all men are brothers why are the winds and the waves so restless?  They take this to mean that it is the rule of nature for man to attack his fellow man.  By the end of the film Yamamoto has abandoned this view and now believes that We have aroused a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve.The film catalogues the accidents and mistakes which combined to make Pearl Harbor a worse disaster for the USA than it need have been.  American aircraft are bunched together in the middle of the airfield in order to reduce the risk of sabotage near the perimeter fence but this helps the Japanese bombers to destroy them on the ground.  Radar equipment cannot be placed in the best locations to give early warning and in any event the radar data are misinterpreted when they predict the attack.  Because the attack falls on a weekend it is difficult for middleranking officers to contact military and political chiefs and the contingency plans are inadequate.  Radio Honolulu broadcasts through the night to guide a fleet of B17's to Hawaii inadvertently acting as a navigation beacon for the Japanese warplanes.If the painstaking buildup to the attack is a little slow and ponderous it is certainly epic in scale and when the action erupts it comes as a mighty climax.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie reigns supreme over it's 2001 version Pearl Harbor which is really a fictional love story confined within a true conflict. Tora Tora Tora is based on actual events leading up to this avoidable tragedy notably the bureaucratic bungling and complacency from the top down which allowed the Japanese attack to succeed.Throughout this well done production the story in true chronological sequence shifts between the two opposing sides with full subtitles giving the role played by each leading actor.The viewer is given a clear concise unfolding of events with the part of the codebreakers importantly emphasized. The attack is quite breathtaking in parts with several scenes closely resembling or being actual footage taken.Ironically the breaking of the Japanese naval code by U.S. Intelligence gave the Americans every opportunity to correctly contemplate the next move of their adversary but a desire for utmost secrecy by the Roosevelt Administration and the top brass of the Navy and Army restricted the transmission of clear and proper communications necessary for the Pearl Harbor commanders Admiral Kimmel and General Short to make sound objective judgments regarding their respective commands.Both men were treated shabbily by their superiors in the aftermath of the attack were relieved of their command and for decades thereafter had to endure the shame and responsibility placed on them in allowing this occurrence to happen.This movie does a lot to exonerate them from their part in this terrible disaster.P.S. I had the great honor of meeting bugler Richard Fiske personally USS West Virginia with a colleague of mine when we visited Pearl Harbor in March 1997 plus autographand had our photo taken with him. It is one of my enduring photos of this great sailor who gave his time unselfishly as a volunteer survivor at the base to give two second generation Australians the respect of knowing that we met a man who belonged to a nation which contributed to the success of winning the Pacific War.".

I do not personally care for films that warp an important historical event to suit a formulaic dateflick format a certain travesty involving a big steamship comes immediately to mind. If I go to the movie theater to watch a historical account then that's what I want to see. Tora! Tora! Tora! is exactly that and more it very nearly puts you right in the middle of the conflagration.It continues to be a source of total wonder for me that Tora! Tora! Tora! a movie made nearly thirtytwo years ago is so expertly presented.  The reason for this is twofold usage of lesserknown character actors to keep plot distraction to a minimum and the usage of vintage working ships and aircraft to keep the realism to a maximum. These two elements merge together to produce what amounts to a cameraman in a time machine filming the actual events on site.Since this was a collaborative effort between both US and Japanese film studios the numerous switches between scenes will give you a good look at the differences between directing and acting styles. I am constantly amazed at the boldness of the content for a film released in the US during the Vietnam War and only 25 years after the Pearl Harbor attack itself compared to the rather wooden Martin Balsam and Jason Robards Takahiro Tamura's Lt. Commander Fuchida is replete with a charisma I would never have expected from The Enemy. The Japanese side of the tale is laid before you so well that one is sent into the minds of the people involved a rarity for American war films. Sometimes it goes a little bit over the edge  Admiral Yamamoto's comment I know the Americans are a proud and just people is a mistranslation  but the general mood is accurately conveyed overall.And then there is the beautiful and sometimes chilling scenery. The attack scenes themselves are eyepopping and brazen enough  an awesome effort given the technology of the period  but my personal favorite scene is the Japanese lead strike force's departure from their aircraft carrier. Those of you who purchase the DVD version of the movie should crank up the volume at this point. This is a piece of film that most probably can never be shot again REAL aircraft flooring their REAL engines and taking flight from a REAL ship of war against the backdrop of the early dawn one after another until the sky is alive with what looks like waves and waves of warplanes. Although the aircraft and ships used were modifed American stock the flags uniforms and color schemes are all authentic... resulting in a spinetingling spectacle of Japanese pilots plunging headlong into what was ultimately a disastrous mistake. They are depicted as human beings as they should be.It is an astoundingly accurate presentation of a dark moment in history for both the US and Japan free of pretense pandering to the audience bigbucks megastars loveydovey sappiness and computergenerated pixels. You don't need any of these things to create a fantastic movie all you need is history which we all know is stranger  and scarier and more engaging  than fiction. Tora! Tora!

The storyline begins pretty much with the decision by the Japanese government that unless negotiations with the United States were to take a decidedly different direction there would be no choice but to go to war. It then follows the planning of the attack by Admiral Yamamoto and his staff. Concurrently it shows that the negotiations between the two countries was not going well at all from the Japanese standpoint. Depicted are sadly the absolutely dreadful decisions made by the US Commanders at Pearl Harbor the ignoring of evidence that an attack was imminent the lack of coordination in communications that resulted in huge delays in receiving crucial information and lastly ignoring the incoming Japanese raiders after they were spotted on American radar on their way in. The actual bombing and combat footage is very well done. The acting is superb by the entire stellar cast. Overall if you want to know how a tragic event came to be this film will explain it. It is historically mostly correct although some artistic license was taken for sure. Overall an excellent production!".

	schema:reviewBody "The real story of Pearl Harbor may have begun in 1853 when a squadron of U.S. frigates under Matthew C. Perry forced open the isolationist Tokugawa shogunate that governed Japan to take a reality check and open trade with the outside world. In less than 100 years Japan became an industrial power every bit as formidable as any western country and was able to attack the country that forced it open.Our Far eastern foreign policy from then until 1941 was simply trading concessions with both Asian powers Japan and China. When they became rivals in Asia we and other countries had to choose up sides. Alternately we favored China and Japan but in 1941 U.S. sympathies in Washington and in public opinion was favoring China. The island chain of Japan is notoriously lacking in natural resources. Even the United Kingdom which it is often compared to has deposits of coal and iron and that created the British steel industry. Japan has to import and in the age of imperialism they became every bit as imperialistic as any of our western countries maybe more so because their need was greater.Note during the film of Tora Tora Tora it is remarked that the U.S. Fleet in Hawaii was like a dagger pointed at Japan. When the island country of Hawaii was formally annexed to the United States and the Phillipines acquired after the Spanish American War at the end of the 19th century we became rivals in the Pacific to the Japanese. And imagine if the Japanese who were most anxious to annex Hawaii themselves had done so. The dagger would have been at our West Coast. Of course the poor Hawaiians had little to say about any of this.All that has to be factored into what you are seeing in Tora Tora Tora. That and more is what led up to the events that are meticulously recorded in documentary style. Unlike the later film Midway which spoiled a good account of the battle with a personal story Tora Tora Tora does not waste any of the viewers time in that regard.The participants are there in all their flaws. Admiral Husband Kimmel who made the fortunate choice of sending out the aircraft carriers which was an act that may have eventually won the Pacific War for America is played by Martin Balsam. Nevertheless he took the fall for the attack as did Chief of Naval Operations Harold Stark played by Edward Andrews.One very luckless man was Army commander in Hawaii General Joseph Short played by Jason Robards Jr. who was in real life in the Navy and at Pearl Harbor. Short made the fatal decision to put all the aircraft at Hickam field in the center of the field because he was afraid of saboteurs. The better to bomb them from the air.Three members of FDR's cabinet are portrayed George MacReady as Secretary of State Cordell Hull Joseph Cotten as Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and Leon Ames as Frank Knox the Secretary of the Navy. Franklin Roosevelt being the wise leader he was and knowing that our eventual entry demanded bipartisan support chose a pair of Republicans in Stimson and Knox. Would that our current president had that kind of foresight.George MacReady who usually portrayed polished villains is a good guy here and has one of his best screen moments as the Japanese envoys are ushered into his office AFTER the attack has begun to issue Japanese diplomatic demands. Tora Tora Tora should be shown in schools as a great piece of well acted documentary film making if that's not a contradiction in terms. It won an Oscar for Special Effects which are out of date compared to the later Pearl Harbor movie but still done well. Catch it if you can by all means.".

Tora! again.This is a great movie and immaculately accurate down to the last detail such as how the Japanese trained for the attack on Pearl Harbor at Kagoshima City on Ryukyu Island. The book describes how the pilots in crews of three zoomed down over the mountains behind the city over the pier and dropped torpedoes at a breakwater 300 yards away. The movie had all these details. Throughout it was accurate even down to the exact wording of communications and quotes from the various people involved.I loved how the Japanese directed the Japanese parts and vice versa for the Americans. It really told both sides of the story.Technically as a film though it has limitations. Some of the models used are kind of cheesy but some are actually pretty good. But hey it was 1970 this is before Star Wars even. And a lot of the acting is pretty wooden.If you're looking for great special effects and not much substance see Pearl Harbor. If you're interested in the story the why and figures involved in this historic event definitely see Tora! Tora! Tora!.Better yet read the book I referenced above  it won the Pulitzer Prize and you won't be able to put it down  and you will be spellbound by this movie knowing all the background and reasons for the Japanese attack and all the details about the characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "In pure movie terms this film is pretty light. As a historical drama it is almost perfect. Based on Gordon Prange's book of the same name the film draws on Prange's 30 years of official USN research to draw some interesting and thoughtprovoking questions about the mistakes made by both sides in the lead up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.For the history buffs it even raises some questions which are not part of most people's understanding of how and why it happened the way it did. For the general public it puts all the basic points of the attack into one neat interesting package. Some characters have been combined and events changed slightly to aid production but nothing of any real significance is altered.The Japanese sequences were originally intended to be directed by the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa but when the producers realised that those parts alone made up four hours of screen time the trouble started and Kurosawa was replaced. The acting is solid but unremarkable as one would expect from a film of this type.The battle sequences are for the most part beautifully done. The producers spent cubic dollars converting old trainers to look like Japanese fighter and attack aircraft and succeeded brilliantly. Only the real oficianados can tell them apart. The flying is fantastic and it looks brilliant against the Hawaiian scenery.About the only thing missing and probably a salient reason for its lack of real commercial penetration was the lack of a love angle.By contrast it is amazing to me that Pearl Harbor made some 30 years later was so bad in comparison. Had the producers actually watched this film before making such a turkey they might have actually learned something. Tora Tora Tora! is a film which could be shown to any history class with few concerns as to its authenticity. Pearl Harbor should never be shown again.Considering the amount of information which had to be conveyed in such a small amount of screen time Tora Tora Tora! is remarkably successful.".

That's how accurate it is!Expenses were not spared at all in doing this recreation. The aircraft used are all faithful reconstructions a rarity!.All the actors involved American and Japanese have played their roles with outmost accuracy and sense of drama.The watcher is taken in and left wondering what next even if he already knows the story.

Having read a number of books on the subject Day of Infamy At Dawn We Slept etc. I believe this is the most accurate depiction of the events. There is an incredible tension in watching fallible human beings  not plastic heroes  cope with momentous events. In some ways it reminded me of 13 Days2000 but without it's successful conclusion. Richard Fleischer has had a spotty career but this is one of his best combining his documentaryrealistic style as in The Boston Strangler1968 Compulsion1959 10 Rillington Place 1971and his taste for spectacle as in The Vikings 1958. Fukasakus work I am not so familiar with but it can be compared to sympathetic treatments of the Imperial Army by other Japanese directors Ichikawa's Harp of Burma1956 and Kobayashi's The Human Condition1959. There are a number of British and American  war films that attempt to show the Japanese troops as more than Tojo and his band of bugeyed monkeys a quote from a John Wayne film such as Lean's Bridge on the River Kwai1957 John Boorman's Hell in the Pacific1968 and Spielberg's Empire of the Sun1987.Just as TTT was criticised for it's evenhanded approach so too were these films. Here in Australia the Pacific War also causes much angry debate mainly due to the Australian POW's who died in Japanese captivity  the Japanese bombing of Darwin our Pearl Harbour. I think TTT was unpopular at the time for another important reason. TTT was a film about an unprepared world power  the USA  being defeated by an underestimated and implacable Asian foe in a daring sneak attack. TTT was released 2 years after the Tet Offensive 1968 in the Vietman War and must have seemed uncomfortably close to home. Hollywood in the late 1960' early 1970's shied away from films depicting the Vietnam War too divisive too downbeat too controversial etc. but were OK on films set in another time tackling similar themes and questions. Films that are obvious metaphors for Vietnam include Altman's MASH1970Korean War as Vietnam War Penn's Little Big Man1970Washita River as My Lai Little Big Horn as the Tet Offensive Robert Wise'Sand Pebbles19661920's China as Vietnam Ralph Nelson's Soldier Blue1970Indian Wars as Vietnam and even British films like Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade1968Crimean War as Vietnam. I guess people can only watch so much defeat which is why Patton1970 was welcomed. Even though it begins with an American catastrophe Kasserine Pass it ends in victory.".

Films that are obvious metaphors for Vietnam include Altman's MASH1970Korean War as Vietnam War Penn's Little Big Man1970Washita River as My Lai Little Big Horn as the Tet Offensive Robert Wise'Sand Pebbles19661920's China as Vietnam Ralph Nelson's Soldier Blue1970Indian Wars as Vietnam and even British films like Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade1968Crimean War as Vietnam. I guess people can only watch so much defeat which is why Patton1970 was welcomed. Even though it begins with an American catastrophe Kasserine Pass it ends in victory.";

	schema:reviewBody "Tora Tora Tora is my favorite war movie and objectively one of the best documentarystyle accounts of an historical military event.   Told equally from the Japanese point of view actually more it reflects a joint JapaneseAmerican effort to stage the events leading up to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and the attack itself.  Martin Balsam plays Admiral Kimmel supported by a good cast portraying the key U.S. figures but closest to a central personality there really is none is Admiral Yamamoto So Yamamura the architect of the strike.  Tora contrasts his views on navalair strategies with those of the Japanese Old Guard and emphasizes his doubts about the notion of war with the U.S.From the American side apart from Kimmel and U.S. Army General Short Jason Robards the principal characters are decoders Colonel Rufus Bratton E.G. Marshall and Lieutenant Commander Alvin Kramer Wesley Addy  actually in both cases more so than Short.  Tora gets straight to the point  no good love stories From Here to Eternity or inane ones Pearl Harbor get in the way.  The only mention of the subject comes when Kramer as the ability to trust anyone is being questioned is asked whether he trusts his wife and states as a matter of fact I do.  Good let's get down to business.Unlike in the plastic Pearl in which oil is the 10second explanation for the bombing the Japanese are treated in depth.  The warlike spirit is shown but Japanese are not all saberrattling fanatics and are willing to consider peaceful alternatives.  Aside from Yamamoto  important figures are strategist Admiral Genda naval task force leader Admiral Nagumo and air strike leader Lt. Fuchida.  I won't bother to name other Japanese actors but suffice it to say none is Toshiro Mifune for whatever reason many including myself at one pointwell I was once his neighbor in Tokyo seem convinced he is in Tora.Tora being chiefly a chronicle of military facts there is no appearance from symbols of state President Roosevelt though his advisors figure prominently and Emperor Hirohito and only a brief one of hawkish Prime Minister Tojo his predecessor Prince Konoye whose desire not to have war with America is eclipsed is given more focus.  The issue of Roosevelt's advance knowledge was rudimentary in 1970 and is not the sort of thing the film sought to treat anyway.  Amen read that last clause again those who criticize unfairly some aspects of the movie.Kimmel is portrayed more sympathetically than Short who comes across as somewhat brusque and brassy and makes a major strategical error by keeping U.S. planes together in the airfields to guard against sabotage in Hawaii by Japanese locals.  From the navy's viewpoint problems were perceived but a principal difficulty was simply that there were not enough ships to go around aside from the problem of generally underdeveloped mechanisms of defense such as radar.  However the movie also shows more subtly that Kimmel was not up to the task.The earlier part of Tora focuses on piecemeal strategic points without completely tying them together.  However there is much to cover so it is difficult to provide contexts and explanations for everything.  What we do get is presentation of the most important strategic issues and America's unpreparedness.  As the time of the attack approaches Tora takes advantage of its better opportunity with events as opposed to strategies the Japanese submarine the radar warning the telegram other communications failures bad luck with weather.  It clearly sets forth the nearterm facts behind America's failure of preventionjust tell us what happened.  But ultimately the biggest blunder is on the Japanese side separate from the attack itself.  Admiral Yamamoto's and Admiral Halsey's contemplations fittingly wind down the dramatic recreation of the shock and surprise of the attack.There are beautiful scenes of Hawaii too indeed Pearl edges out Tora only in sunsets.   The sea and blue sky islands and mountains Hawaiian music at military clubs.  The Japanese planes take off in dark early dawn nice aura then a striking rising sun precedes beautiful dawn settings and the attack.Sorry to be so narrative but to do so is fitting in reviewing this very narrative movie.  There are no dash and elan no good guys or bad guys and in fact no protagonists or antagonists.  Expressions of anger are not terribly intense and are fleeting no intense passions are worked up.  The closest thing to a hero is Colonel Bratton whose importunations to accept his warnings are legitimized only too late.Tora turns the trick for viewers with a more straightforward than sensationalistic approach who want to see a good intelligent story uncontrived people an excellent extended battle staging yet no cheap special effects no blood and gore good flow.  I am a big fan of Lawrence of Arabia and tho I ultimately see all its scenes as justified I admit it had moments of drag in both the first and second halfs.  Some people think Tora drags at times but it never drags for me.  Besides it is much shorter than Lawrence and many other epics.  Fair enough some simply do not like this type of movie as much as I do.  But the attack on Pearl Harbor itself is one of the most dramatic events in military history and certainly U.S. history and that helps carry the day.  Geopolitics strategy unpreparedness codebreaking issues miscommunication before a war then a sneak attack  John Wayne not needed.10 out of 10.".

In contrast many war films such as Midway are shoddy when it comes to the detailssuch as using stock footage of planes or tanks which didn't even debut until well after the battle. And very very few war films try to explain the events leading up to it. This drives exhistory teachers like me nuts! However Tora! Tora! Tora! is an amazing film because they tried so hard and the film feels so complete. Of course the filmmakers had to make a few adjustmentssuch as converting American T6 airplanes to look a lot like Japanese planes and recreating Japanese ships because they'd all been lost during WWII. But they TRIEDand I appreciate that. And again and again the film stresses detailsdetails that might bore some viewers but make history nuts salivate!So why am I giving this movie a 10? After all I almost never give such a score to a movie. In addition to the two huge pluses above the movie excels because it does not burden itself with superfluous love stories such as in The Battle of Britain nor does it give way to sentiment. It is almost like an actual recreation of events as they unfolded brought to the big screen in epic fashion. All in all probably the best war film of all time because of its attention to detail scope and accuracy.Apparently Roger Ebert HATED this film for the reasons I loved it. He hated the detail and wanted to have the characters fleshed out more like a typical Hollywood production. I didn't mind its documentarylike style and as a certifiable history nut it's the sort of film I adore!".

Little thing like the submarine trying to sneak into Pearl Harbor and how our ship saw it and blew it up. I never knew that happened. And the aftermath in which a call is made to the base commander and all he can say is ask for confirmation because these things happen all of the time. I wanted to smack him. It is incredible how a lot of middle men actually prevented word about the attack getting to the right person. Such as the guys who pick up a plane formation heading for Pearl Harbor and the men who received the message just brushing it off and not conveying it to the correct person. Or how the Wesley Addy character had to run around DC trying to talk to anyone who would listen to no avail. Or the man who has direct access t the Commanders after getting concrete evidence and decides not to call the commander at Pearl Harbor but wants to run it by the President first. It is amazing how middlings actually held the fate of PearL Harbor in their hands and blew it. I also admire way they show the Japanese perspective. I love movies like that because it shows that the other side are soldiers like we are and are committed to their cause too right or wrong. It humanizes them as it should. All Quiet in The Western Front was one of my favorite novels and movies because it was told through the eyes of a very young German recruit. I see how they are all psyched into going to war as they do here to young men and when they fight they see this is not what they signed up for. There was no side stories thank you because they ruin all war movies. This is a very good war movie. And it gave us a inside view of the steps leading to the Attack. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see good movie about Pearl Harbor without an foolish love story or side stories.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been watching this film since I was ten years old and it had just come out. I was fascinated then and not even a military history buff as I am now. but over the years I've come to appreciate an effort welldone. On the scaled of this film to have built fullscale mockups of Nagato and Akagi and huge models of Arizona Nevada West Virginia and all the rest is stupendous work and it really shows in the finished film. My comment based on having seen that turkey Pearl Harbor which from this point on I shall refer to as PHew one can really understand the difference between full scale models and CGI for special effects. Sure CGI can give filmmakers incredible abilities to create anything they want and make it do everything but it's so obvious that CGI is used it's very transparent and forgettable. The blowing up of USS Arizona in TTT was far and away more stunning and realistic than a computergenerated one in PHew. Remember 'Titanic?' A real fullscale ship is what did the trick and made it come to life. PHew was a waste of film and money and an insult to the men and women show survived and died that December day. As for the few shots of 'John Finn' the intrepid lone machine gunner who shot down a Zero and damaged others at Kaneohe Bay NAS the depiction is a bit off. Finn wasn't behind a sandbag revetment and he wasn't bandaged up during the fight. How do I know? John Finn is my neighbor here in East County San Diego and I've talked with this fascinating old veteran many times. Even at over 96 years of age he's sharp and interesting to talk to. He too prefers TTT to PHew. BIG surprise. This film also shows a cautious reluctant Admiral Kimmel Martin Balsam and acerbic General Walter Short Jason Robards as being unable to save their commands in the weeks prior to the attack. They had tried to be prepared but failed to take the right action despite their correct intentions. Washington's diplomats politicians and senior military are depicted as being complacent and not taking the threat of Japanese aggression in the Pacific seriously. This is partially true and FDR is said in some accounts to have been holding back on critical information which could have warned of the impending attack. History is still debating this. But the truth is Kimmel and Short were made the scapegoats for the attack. They didn't deserve that fate and I see them as casualties just as the more than 1200 other men and women killed that day. Soh Yamamura who portrayed Isoroku Yamamoto does a credible job of handling the role of a man who was targeted by US forces during the war as the leading villain in the attack. Yet he wasn't totally in favor of such action. He was forced by the General staff particularly Hideki Tojo to hit the American fleet and keep the US out of Japanese aims in the Western Pacific. Yamamura's brooding scenes give the admiral emotional weight. BTW did anyone notice not one of the P40 fighters flown by Lt. Welsh or Lt. Taylor flew in the streets of Honolulu? And they didn't bring down the entire Japanese Naval Air Service? Funny thing even though it's not as visually exciting as PHew it's far better and more believable. My feelings about this film are this It's not perfect but no one has ever done better since. Nine out of Ten.".

	schema:reviewBody "This definitely beats PEARL HARBOR all to pieces. I remember when this movie first came out in Birmingham. It was advertised as a special event you had to special order tickets for it. My mother and I went to see it on a Saturday afternoon and even though I knew what was coming I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. Based on the books THE BROKEN SEAL and if I'm not mistaken by a book of the same title as the movie it tells the story of Pearl Harbor very well from all the events leading up to the attack to the day of infamy itself. This is not historical fiction this does not try to juice things up with a tear jerker love story. This is an unsentimental meticulous look at actual events leading up to the attack as told from both the American and Japanese perspectives. Jerry Goldsmith's score to this movie is the most emotionally gripping I've ever heard. For soundtrack buffs it's available on CD on a double bill with the soundtrack to PATTON.I have seen several movies about the attack on Pearl Harbor. There is PEARL HARBOR which is a piece of crap IN HARM'S WAY and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. There is even a Pearl Harbor sequence in THE WINDS OF WAR. These latter three movies are good in fact I have DVDs of IN HARM'S WAY and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY as well as TORA TORA TORA. But this is by far the best of the lot and it gives you the straight scoop without any politically correct BS thrown in. One emerges from this film emotionally drained as you feel the fury of watching our airplanes getting bombed while trying to take off. Your heart aches as you watch a lone American airplane in a dogfight with a whole squadron of Japanese fighter planes. An excellent film. 10 out of 10. I don't give that lightly either. By the way check out the cinematography as the Japanese planes take off from their aircraft carrier. It is absolutely beautiful watching the sun rise while those planes are taking off one by one.".

	onyx:emotionText "This definitely beats PEARL HARBOR all to pieces. I remember when this movie first came out in Birmingham. It was advertised as a special event you had to special order tickets for it. My mother and I went to see it on a Saturday afternoon and even though I knew what was coming I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. Based on the books THE BROKEN SEAL and if I'm not mistaken by a book of the same title as the movie it tells the story of Pearl Harbor very well from all the events leading up to the attack to the day of infamy itself. This is not historical fiction this does not try to juice things up with a tear jerker love story.

Tora! even more and prompts me to recommend it as the best dramatization of the events on the island of Oahu and on the Pacific Ocean of December 7 1941.Critics have panned Tora! Tora! Tora! as an overblown spectacle. They are wrong. The immensity of the film is perfectly in keeping with the immensity of the logistics required for the attack and the immensity of the attack itself. The production values are high the colors vivid and crisp and the special effects 30 years after the film's release are still state of the art. There are scenes from the attack on Hickam Field whose realism and spectacle are astounding.The casting is wonderful with Jason Robards and Martin Balsam playing the starcrossed General and Admiral who would have to play the patsies for the negligence of higher ups. There are few truly secondary roles in this film for almost every element of the story is crucial to the progression of events. Thus secondary roles like those of E.G. Marshall and Wesley Addy are riveting because of the extraordinary situations in which their characters are placed.We are also given intimate access to the Japanese side during planning and preparation. Because this is a coproduction between Americans and Japanese the latter are portrayed without caricature as people who believe in the cause which is inspiring this dastardly attack. I don't know any of the Japanese actors beyond a few familiar faces but they are every bit as engaging as the Americans.We know what is going to happen  that Pearl Harbor will be successfully attacked by the Japanese  but so skillful are the direction and the characterization and so authentic is the historical reconstruction that we are easily transported into the moment rather than being dangled above it as if we we watching a documentary. Unlike Pearl Harbor which insults every man and woman who served in World War II Tora! Tora! Tora! in its powerful unadorned way pays them tribute.".

So his shock and bemusement as the irascible rogue relates these tales is genuine particularly when Fang describes his narrowlyavoided decapitation by the Japanese They cut off nine heads! The neck shrunk into the body! accompanied by graphic stills.The film's narrative often becomes overwhelming as it encompasses decades of political upheaval caused by the SinoJapanese War World War II and the Cultural Revolution during which entire families were torn apart. But the emotive moments as the disbelieving star comes to grips with his heritage render the historical immensely personal.

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Attenborough returned to acting after 14 years behind the camera in Jurassic Park and followed it swiftly by daring to challenge comparison with Oscarwinner Edmund Gwenn in this remake. As a heartwarmer for those inadequates who won't sit through a 60yearold monochrome movie albeit one which rivals It's a Wonderful Life as Hollywood's answer to A Christmas Carol this John Hughes revamp will probably serve. Anyhow there are plenty of copies on sale at the checkout of my local supermarket. But it is a bit too laidback and latterly too bogged down in argument for younger kids or older boys. It may warm more cockles among the grandparents.The main thematic interest is how Hughes chooses to tweak the original screen story as adapted unusually for the time by the director George Seaton. Whether he sought to or not the remake has thrown up some intriguing twists for a more skeptical and secular time.The oldie caught the mood of an America yearning to get back to normalcy amid the perils of the postwar Cold War world. Location shooting in New York City with much cooperation from Macys gave a touch of realism to the fantasy whereas in 1994 it's an imaginary store and for Americans at least an incongruously veddy British claimant to the chair of Santa Claus although his nationality is not the issue when the legal meanies of the State of New York try to get him confined to the bughouse.What is striking is the judge's rationale for allowing Kris's plea for freedom. Because US bills have In God We Trust on them he reasons it means New York is allowed to have blind faith in the existence of a supernatural being who lays presents on 1.7 billion children in one night operating from invisible workshops with reindeer which cannot be made to fly in a courtroom demonstration of his powers because it isn't Christmas Eve. Besides the sneery prosecutor's kids were raised to believe in him so there case closed.In real life the ACLU would be appealing such a judgement all the way to the Supreme Court for allowing too much religion into the law and the public square. In God We Trust was only put on the money during the Cold War to cock a snook at Godless bolshevism but this film is refreshingly disrespectful to the newer orthodoxy of playing down most Americans' beliefs in their films.Kris asks if he should swear in the Bible the Pope's ruling on Nicholas's sanctity is debated and the ethos is quietly but unmistakably Christian. No spiritual Santa or Happy Holidays here. In a very light fashion the film does revolve issues of how far it is legitimate to maintain a metaphor as a source of inspiration when rationalism of the Dawkins and Hitchens strain is sniping at it. The screenplay also looks quite beadily at the way commercial operators use holy myth to make money even if the message comes muted from Hollywood.That is the good news. There's plenty to carp at as well.Attenborough's quiet gentle but firm performance most atypical of one who spent his previous acting time mainly playing unreliables or martinets suffuses the film. He gets little competition save from the contrasted crustiness of Windom. Most of the support is soso on the level of a Yuletide TV special and not excluding little Wilson as the girl who has faith in Mr Kringle's claim to be St Nicholas. She is no Margaret O'Brien if no worse in her way than the kewpiedoll Natalie Wood. In fact she's a John Hughes moppet who did little later and nothing since 2000.The narrative's departures from the well shaped original are no help. Once off the legal hook Kris wearing a brown suit just disappears we don't see any triumphal sleigh ride to bid him adieu while attention shifts to a ridiculous postmidnightmass impromptu wedding in a Catholic church. Then follows a trip out to a dream house in the snowy country ushered by a silly salesman. The film does not seem to know when to call a halt and there's not so much as Clarence's tinkling bell to bring back Kris at the close. It's as if the whole object of the exercise was to unite two bland characters in matrimony.".

	schema:headline " Humbug!";
	schema:reviewBody "On a normal level of cinema this film is only mediocre. Where it fails is that it is a terrible remake of a wellknown wellloved film. And even worse for this film it's a lousy remake of a wellknown wellloved film that just happens to be my favorite Christmas film of all time.It has a few positives. All right it has one positive and that is Richard Attenborough. He brings a genuine delight to the role of Saint Nick and it is not hard to believe this guy could be the genuine article. Unfortunately his performance highlights the lousy performances of many of the principles.Dorey Walker is played by Elizabeth Perkins with none of the sympathy given to her by Maureen O'Hara. It's impossible to even dream of her getting married to anyone. Some of this is to be blamed on the script though which spends so much time establishing Dorey's cold heart that it forgets she's supposed to be getting our sympathy not our scorn. Which brings us to the flat performance of Dylan McDermott. He could be replaced with a cardboard cutout without affecting the flow of the movie. Then we have Mara Wilson. She tends to be more snobby and overconfident than confused but Wilson is up against Natalie Wood. To be fair we never get to see Wilson chattering like a monkey for comparison purposes. That delightful scene was excised from the modern version.A rather ridiculous subplot has been added to this remake with a rival store Shopper's Express trying to put Cole's out of business Macy's refused to have their name put in the film. It is headed by the popular 90's villain of choice the Greedy Evil Mean CEO Victor Landbergh. He doesn't play much of a role yet he is supposed to be the encompassing bad guy evoking images of Lex Luthor plotting the demise of Superman. He even has his own flunkies who attempt to sabotage the department store skittering around almost like Boris and Natasha. This subplot tends to weigh down on the film feeling forced in rather than meshing with the film. The pompous psychiatrist of the original works because it was simply one guy with a chip on his shoulder instead of a wicked retail overlord. The former is funny while the latter is overkill.Actually that addresses another problem with this film  it takes its subject matter far too seriously. The original film was an enjoyable farce. This one is a somber story filled with the right glurgy turns to renew our souls or something. Basically it's way too serious considering the subject matter an old guy who thinks he's really Santa Claus. The original had some laugh out loud moments of sharp humor  this one instead attempts to force you to shed tears of sadness and joy. It usually just shed tears of boredom from me.The court decision at the end of the film is not only anticlimactic but doesn't really address the actual issue  Kris is on trial for lunacy. The only decision to save him is to prove he's REALLY Santa Claus thus making him sane. This movie can't seem to make up its mind why he's on trial and its ultimate answer for Kris obvious acquittal would fall upon under the lightest of legal scrutiny where the original film made a compelling legal argument. I can't answer that but I will say that this film's answer is far off the mark. Please I beg of youif you have NOT seen the 1947 Black and White original then please correct that. This is not an adequate substitute to a film that didn't need one in the first place. They even colorized the old one so if you hate black and white then you still have a color option without wasting your time on this.".

It lost me right from the beginning with juvenile humour making the bad Coles Santa the butt of jokes and never won my interest back. I was particularly disappointed in the ending. The original ending drew the necessary distinction between proving that Santa existed and proving that the gentleman known as Kris Kringle was Santa. For some inexplicable and unjustifiable reason the remake glosses over that distinction. This cheapened the rest of the film for me. I also preferred the ending in the original version. While I like the direct GodSanta comparison in the remake suggesting that Santa works through others his miracles to perform I prefer the manner in which the family obtains their house in the original version. It's a lot more meaningful if they have never seen the house before that minute as the randomness factor hints more strongly at Kris's actually being Santa.In the same vein I thought Kris acted too mentally inadequate in this version talking about the Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny as if they were real and addressing a local reindeer as if it were one of his own. Santa becomes less a person than an ideal of behaviour and attitude as the overly sentimental script keeps reminding us. He inspires other people to do things instead of being able to do them himself. I suppose that's the point the film is making but all the same I prefer the less heavyhanded approach of the original.".

The children made comments about him that were surprisingly uncomplimentary. I'm sure the comments were not intended to be commentary on him as a person but almost everyone thought that another actor could have played the part better than he did.

Mara Wilson is fantastic as the young Susan Walker. I feel that even though she is the smallest of the cast members she leads them perfectly. If Chritmas films do nothing for you then show it to your kids because i am positive that they will love and cherish it. While some disagree i would say that this movie was a great remake of the 1934 film. If this movie wasn't remade i don't think i would of even heard of the original. I think the movie was in much need of a revamping so that younger people like myself would be able to addapt the movie more and to understand it a little bit better. I felt Richard Attenborough was a great Santa who was believable. I would recommend this movie 100.".

This is a must movie for all Christmas lovers out there who just want a tale told to them which will make them as warm as that eggnog they drink that night unless you drink it cold like in Australia. Brilliant movie which I watch every Christmas. In conclusion it is a movie which once watching it and allowing one's self to be captivated by its charm one finally feels like a kid again.

I don't see why people are so against it. There are many versions of A Christmas Carol and yet few seem upset by that. I liked the dollar bill evidence much more than the post office evidence near the end. I loved the scene in which the citizens of NY city showed their belief in Santa Claus. I also felt that the reason why Kris Kringle struck out at the man was much more realistic in this version than in others. Maureen O'Hara is one of my favorite actors.  yes the screen actors guild uses the term actor meaning one who acts for males and females.  The 1947 version is well acted and charming. The 1994 version is a movie that stands on it's own and is delightful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few things are more amusing that reading the comments from the crybaby dishrags who whine about remaking a classic like Miracle On 34th Street 1947. How are these weepy rants helpful? Did it need to be remade? No. But the source material is good enough that any number of professionally done remakes would still be entertaining. If this 1994 version had been the original people would already be crowning it with the classic tag.But it is not the original. It strikes a decent compromise by keeping many of the original story elements deleting some updating others and making a few generally illadvised additions. There are even some clear improvements. Elizabeth Perkins and Mara Wilson are a much better mother and daughter match than Natalie Wood and Maureen O'Hara. There is a real chemistry between them and the producers appear to have grasped this connection. This Miracle is told much more from their respective points of view and in that sense is much more their story than in the original. Wilson brings a focus and intensity to her roles that few child actors can match. She gave a similar performance the next year in Matilda. Perkins is one of those actresses you don't really notice at first memorable in Big and Speak for performances filled with subtle nuances.It is no surprise that Richard Attenborough falls short of the Edmund Gwenn standard but that was Gwenn's signature role and as much a part of cinema history as Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch. But look for the sequence where Wilson pulls his beard and discovers it is realthis is one of the great alltime scenes.As long as Perkins andor Wilson are being featured the film works quite well. And it really only stumbles seriously during the courtroom scene and during the subplot elements featuring James Remar and Jane Leeves. The film staggers along a bit but recovers itself in time for an original and very effective conclusion. As Roger Ebbert said while it will never replace the original this is a sweet gentle goodhearted film that stays true to the spirit of the original and doesn't try to make everything slick and exploitative. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

If you watch it as a kid and then watch it as an adult you may learn more about it. This is one movie I want on DVD because it shows that like others have mentioned it's not a happy ever ending but a realistic ending. David learns some valuable lessons as he is trying to deal with his guilt of his baby sister's death. Remember when he wanted to save a toy of hers and Clara tells him no.

But guess what it is fun by the truckload  at least if you have a pitchblack sense of humour and you do realise what this film is and what it wants to achieve.Paul Verhoeven was a master at making SciFi films which worked both as perfect mainstream popcorn cinema and as very intelligent social commentary on the direction  he felt  society was headed. And despite the fact that the overthetop satirical elements and highly political undercurrents in his two previous scifi extravaganzas Robocop and Total Recall were only appreciated by a few critics at the time those two films became huge hits at the box office because they also offered great action amazing special effects and overall great entertainment.My guess is that Verhoeven felt encouraged by that success and so with Starship Troopers he didn't just sneak in some subversive parts he went fullblown satire. Sadly that didn't go down too well with audiences and critics alike apparently most viewers didn't get the film at all the  seemingly  good guys wear Nazi uniforms? What the heck?. Verhoeven even got accused of being a fascist and it took the director's commentary on the DVD to finally make it once and for all clear what Starship Troopers is about and what the writer's and the director's intentions were. I wonder whether the studio execs realised what Verhoeven was up to with that film maybe the director just took their 100 million dollars and ran with it. The result in any case is a unique oddity that I personally feel is on par with films like District 9 or even Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. It's a masterpiece. And much like another glitch in the Hollywood machine David Fincher's Fight Club films like that rarely get made and not with such budgets because more often than not they end up as flops.Apart from the underlying themes on the surface Starship Troopers also has a lot going for it amazing effects that still hold up very well and insanely intense battle scenes with more blood and guts than even the meanest gorehound could wish for. So no matter how it came about that a studio ever greenlit this and gave Verhoeven a 100 million dollars  I for one will forever be grateful for this unique subversive masterpiece.

It really is a shame that despite the squeakyclean heroes plucked straight from the soaps the Mormon extremists the multipleamputee mobile infantry retirees and the propaganda shorts masquerading as news the vast majority still seems to regard Starship Troopers as a stupid action movie and for some reason absolutely refuse to consider that it might be something more.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the famous Robert A. Heinlein novel Starship Troopers is set in a world of the future where militarism is the norm largely because we've discovered alien civilizations of huge insectlike creatures and we're at war with them. The film follows a quartet of high school friends as they make their varied ways through the military.Starship Troopers is both a tongueincheek satire of society and an intense scifiactionwar film filled with horrorlike insect monsters and a healthy dose of graphic gore. That's a genre combination that will not please all viewers especially if the tongueincheek humor goes over their heads. For those more in tune with the genre melding Starship Troopers promises a quick edgeofyourseat ride from the first moments to the last.The film can be looked at in three sections with slight crossovers from one section to another. The first is focused on the social satire. The cultural differences of the future are given in mostly indirectly and occasionally the point is what hasn't changed or perhaps what is currently per the film's setting in vogue as a retro element. The second and third sections could be seen as a scifi Platoon 1986 with the second section focused on military basic training and the third focused on wartime. Like Platoon the basic training scenes show order and a clear sense of purpose while the wartime scenes show comparative chaos.That the film could be compared to something like Platoon shows that although director Paul Verhoeven and screenwriter Edward Neumeier are aware that the material could easily be seen as absurd they have the chops to make it believable and suspenseful at the same time.This is not to say that Starship Troopers is a ripoff of any other movie. The filmmaking here is highly original and we could almost see the entire film as a computerbased CNNstyled collection of wartime newsreels of the future. It remains quick witty and intense throughout. My only regret is that they didn't incorporate Yes' song Starship Troopers in the score somehow.".

Our heros are beautiful whiteteethed Americans firm of body and morals our villains are decapitating stick insects cockroaches and giant maggots.Yet who are the real heroes ?The whiteteethed Americans are vacuous shallow thugs. They are thrust into a war with the Bugs whose planets we are told have been invaded by the Americans. The Bugs are justifiably annoyed. I couldn't help but laugh at some of the Nazi parallels drawn by other reviewers. What Verhoeven is putting across in this film is not a polemic against Nazi ideology but an attack upon American Imperialism in the latter part of the last century. He is satirising American crusades against other countries whose inhabitants are portrayed in the American press as no better than Bugs. Had Verhoeven wished to attack Nazism he could have given the good guys German accents he didn't he gave them American accents. The Nazi symbolism as commented upon by other reviewers is not Nazi symbolism at all  it is totalitarian symbolism full stop. It is rightwing bomb them back to the stone age American totalitarianism.Why do I believe this ? Check out the scene where American kids are encouraged to stamp on cockroaches by an overly excited parent. Check out the high fives.Verhoeven has done a mighty job here. He has made a film which has great action great cinematography very cute women and boys and yet the film still manages to take the mickey out of the New Order in a very funny and effective manner.1010".

It can be enjoyed at both levels though obviously it is much richer when the viewer comprehends the satirical and critical level as well.It's not as if the satire is so subtle it's hard to get. If anything it hits you over the head with it. But at the same time it is very disciplined and consistent in not tipping its hand and giving the game away which to me makes it much more successful and enjoyable than if the satire and social critique were blatantly broadcast. That's the strange and wonderful thing about Starship Troopers and Robocop  one viewer might totally not get it while to another the criticalsatirical level is totally in your face and is what the film is really all about.I don't know if I'm describing it well but watch it with the filmmakers' commentary turned on on the DVD version and director Paul Verhoeven and writer Ed Neumeier lay it all out very clearly the film is about how war makes fascists of us all. Very timely today 2004 with US imperialism wreaking havoc in Iraq  Afghanistan.On a technical level the film is excellent. The bug special effects are top notch and the whole bug society and hierarchy is deeply thought through as is the future Earth society's politics and technology. The acting is excellent and the balance between the characters' interpersonal story line the bug war story line and the underlying political satire and critique is perfectly handled.A truly exceptional film Verhoeven's best so far topping even Robocop in my opinion and fully deserving a 10 out of 10 score which I rarely give.".

Nothing more to say really.However this isn't a pure scifi action film this is military scifi in all its fascist glory. Guns warriors alien scum and pretty explosions rendered in a disciplined manner. I wouldn't call it tongueincheek its too hardened for that. I wouldn't call the satire in your face or subtle its more... subliminal. Sublety by another name perhaps. I don't read so far into films as others do maybe I'm right for it maybe I'm not. You just cant get it so wrong. Certainly people spend less time actually reviewing films.Uncharacterized enemies a one sided view the situation rampant jingoism those are the trademarks of militarism. This film catches them well in a futuristic setting. A little slow to start but still enjoyable with just the right sense of innocence and its loss replaced with the hardened edge that invariably lies within success. When the action finally gets going it really gets going. The effects are stunning for 1996 when they were made and even 10 years on they'll still be impressive. I thought Casper van Dien was more impressive than the film really shows certainly the screen test on the DVD seemed to show a greater depth IMO. Denise Richards was a little too wide smile for the film but Dina Meyer pulled off the 'chick with a gun' more convincingly than any other woman I've seen on film they always seem uncomfortable with it but Meyer carried herself naturally. Her character was pretty good too  . Clancy Brown clearly enjoyed himself hamming up the stereotypical drillinstructor pleasingly and Michael Ironside was wonderful as the hardnosed and competent Leiutenant. The cheesiness beloved of action films was there but it never became too cheesy to detract from the work unlike say 2004's King Arthur. Another thing that takes this to the level of military scifi.Basically brilliant. As clever as the others here say depending on the level you watch it but maybe not subtle in the way some like to think. If you want a working definition of the military scifi I've been harping on about this the one i refer you too. I just wish there were more examples like this.".

More than that Starship troopers it's that kind of science fiction films with great a big special effects but at the same time a terrific script. A shocking story more realistic and cruel than many movies about real conflicts where you can feel the havoc and the pain of any battle. The acting it's good the soundtrack it's one of the best works of Basil Poleoduris. After this you can read the book of Robert Heinlein founding how far goes Paul Verhoeven in every scene and every character creating. But the best of all is how everything has a reason there's no word or scene without a meaning even the promise of the beginning remain intact making clear some disturbing things about some characters. An movie to watch more than two times.".

I agree with Leonard Maltin the professional movie critic that everything is directly modeled on WWII battles and WWII movies.The enemy is irrelevant and characterizing the enemy is not important. That is why we never get any explanation for why the bugs are attacking us how their weapons work etc.The movie is extremely gory to make the point that war is hell and war consists of a lot of blood and guts.  It is also making the point that our tolerance for violence is constantly accelerating.  In this future world it is no big deal to get stabbed through any part of the body it is even a part of military training.  Pain is of no concern you simply call for Medic! and get on down the road.The movie does not try to be cute or funny.  The viewer does not have to listen to the aliens being called all sort of combinations of cuss words by the heroes.The characters are realistic. They sometimes do the right things for the wrong reasons and vice versa.  At times we are not sure who is good and who is selfmotivated.I also liked the shower scene. Just the concept of 19 yearold physicallyfit men and women casually showering and bunking together is fascinating.It is obviously one of those movies that you either love or hate.".

	schema:headline " Am I the only one who thinks Verhoeven hates Heinlein?";
	schema:reviewBody "Most of the reviews of 'Starship Troopers' on this site seem to fall into one of three groupsa. Those who hated it because of the silly 90210 look mediocre acting goriness poor science or infidelity to Heinleinb. Those who say Give it a break it's a fun beer  pretzels movie andc. Those who applaud the antimilitarism theme.I disagree with all of the above. Actually I somehwat agree with group a. but for different reasons.Criticising a movie for infidelity to a primary source or technical inaccuracy is like criticising it for being in colour they are very few mainstream movies not like that.In this case however any dismay by Heinlein fans is deserved. There are huge differences between script and novel and where a resemblance does exist the movie seems to mock the book. In fact I became convinced that either Verhoeven or Neumeier strongly dislikes Heinlein  in particular his social beliefs  and deliberately parodied his work.'Real' science fiction is about exploring the possibilities of actual and plausible future science and technology and its effects on us and our society. Hollywood's version of 'scifi' is often an action movie decked out with bizarre gadgets blaster guns and slimyskinned humanoid villains. Scifi fans call this 'science fantasy' to emphasize the difference. To a scifi fan 'science fantasy' is derogatory  just as 'scifi' is to a 'serious' novelist!! Heinlein was a science fiction author and both sociological and technological details in his books are important to the plot. The movie is pure science fantasy. Of course it's rare for Hollywood to produce a nonfantasy scifi movie but when seen from the viewpoint of the antiHeinlein theory the bad science in this movie does seem needlessly exaggerated. Heinlein was careful with his science and even included physics calculations in his work this movie has starships piloted by kids staring out the windshield and being shot down by the farts of giant bugs. A parody perhaps?Forgetting the times in which Heinlein lived people have sometimes accused him of revealing fascist traits. One idea from 'Starship Troopers' was of extending suffrage only to military veterans. Bizarre extremism to present day readers but remember the context Heinlein was writing just after the vast armies of WW2 saved the world from the Nazis when national service was still nearly universal and the Cold War was just hotting up. Anyone advocating the abolition of compulsory military service looked suspiciously like a commie fellow traveller. But there was Heinlein a naval veteran suggesting a novel compromise path make military service voluntary but with suffrage as an inducement  while those who refused service to the nation didn't get to run it. So the fascist Heinlein claims are somewhat shallow. Compare The Moon is a Harsh Mistress  admittedly a much later work but distinctly liberalleftist it's about an ingenious and inclusive popular revolution overthrowing a repressive colonial government. Now we seem to have the movie 'Starship Troopers' taking the Heinlein was a closet fascist theme and ramming it down our throats. The Mobile Infantry are dressed in SSlike uniforms instead of power armour the Terran government uses Nazi propaganda techniques and an intelligence officer is dressed as a Gestapo agent. It's so blunt noone could miss it  but many did. When some viewers asked about the strangely fascist newsreels we were told it was a parody of WW2 Nazi newsreels. Huh? Why parody 1940's Nazi newsreels in a movie set in the future? Unless it was a comment on the social ideas being parodied at the same time...I'm surprised the 'beer  pretzels' crowd didn't notice the blatant antiviolence antimilitary 'messages'. It almost seems as if the makers are offering their eyecandy science fantasy and sex as a lure to get the 'beer  pretzels' types to watch their messages'. If so it is rather erm ironic that a movie parodying Nazi propaganda techniques should employ slightly subtler but essentially similar methods itself...Finally a couple of particular gripes Some people have lauded the special effects. I believe that when it was first released this movie had the greatest number of synthetic images realistically interacting with human actors. Bravo for that. However the point of special effects is not to rack up statistics it is to create astonishing images not otherwise possible to film. In this respect 'Starship Troopers' was ok but not anything special. Compare the pedestrian starship combat to the breathtaking starship battles in 'Babylon 5'. Or look at the scene of crewmen on the exterior of a spaceship hull in 'Star Trek First Contact'  as the 'camera' slowly panned away and revealed the massive grandeur of the scene it really evoked a feeling of hanging by your bootstraps above an infinite void. That was an inspired effect. Anything like that in 'Starship Troopers'? Nah.Some people were also impressed by the battle scenes. WHAT?!?! You get more convincing battles in the average cowboysandindians flick. Case in point 90 zillion bugs packed into a broad canyon are swarming toward you. You have tactical nuclear rockets and a radio link to a star fleet. So you pull out your assault rifle and try to shoot them one at a time!Overall I neither loved nor hated this movie. I'm not sorry I went but I won't see it again. My strongest impression is a mild annoyance that Verhoeven seems to have thought he could mess with a whole bunch of heads and mostly they didn't even notice him doing it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Verhoeven disguises this queasy ode to gore as an antimilitary cautionary tale.  It's kind of like watching a prude drooling over pornography while protesting to the world how evil it is.The combat scenes are laughable.  The soldiers have the tactical acumen of a heard of sheep with assault rifles.  The movie doesn't just ignore significant aspects of the book it goes out of its way to deliberately distort them.  A single example one of many.  The protagonist of the novel Johnny Rico was a Filipino.  Verhoeven casts stereotypically Aryan Casper Van Dien as Johnny.  Is this a cynical distortion of the book to prove' that the author wasn't honoring diversity?'  Or is it a cynical marketing ploy to appeal to a particular demographic?  Or didn't Verhoeven care?The movie's supporters seem to fall into three main categories.

It's kind of like watching a prude drooling over pornography while protesting to the world how evil it is.The combat scenes are laughable.  The soldiers have the tactical acumen of a heard of sheep with assault rifles.  The movie doesn't just ignore significant aspects of the book it goes out of its way to deliberately distort them.  A single example one of many.  The protagonist of the novel Johnny Rico was a Filipino.  Verhoeven casts stereotypically Aryan Casper Van Dien as Johnny.  Is this a cynical distortion of the book to prove' that the author wasn't honoring diversity?'  Or is it a cynical marketing ploy to appeal to a particular demographic?  Or didn't Verhoeven care?The movie's supporters seem to fall into three main categories.

The title if anyone has ever read the book Starship Troopers they will understand that the title of this movie was used for nothing but marketing purposes the book and the movie have almost nothing in common with each other.The acting is horrible Dawsone's Creek has better actors then this movie. The movie is supposed to be a parady of a violent society and does a very poor and obvious job of sending this message. The plot line is somewhat pridictable and doesn't have any great twists or turns in it.The movie is also just plain stupid the soldiers are armed with assault rifles and travel on foot while battling giant insects they run in a mob and then just stand up in a line completely exposed and start fireing into the ranks of insects after a while of this some random soldier yells retreat and the order is followed the soldiers run away in the same mob fashion. Lets think about this if you are battling giant insects wouldn't a tank be better then a foot soldier? Their is no artillery no armour no heavy weapons no air support the soldiers simply run around as one big mob. A child playing Command and Conquer on his PC knows more about military tactics then the person who wrote this script.I give this movie a 1 because it has a horrible plot horrible actors and is a poorly written film. If you like action movies and don't care much for the details then this is an appropriate movie while it lacks many things their is no shortage of bloody and action packed combat.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film had fantastic potential. Anybody can tell you that this was based on a book written by Robert Heinlein. In truth however all Verhoeven got right was that the main character was named Juan Johnnie Rico and the enemy was the Bugs. To give this more context let me add that the book was originally published in 1959. Keep this in mind. The story was written before Vietnam only six years after the Korean Conflict had drawn to a close...only four years after the publishing of The Return of the King. Remember that when you read all the commentary here about how this movie is a Social Commentary. That is all Verhoeven not Heinlien. According to the DVD commentary Paul Verhoeven never finished reading the novel claiming he read through the first few chapters and became both 'bored and depressed' the movie's message is War makes fascists of us all and that he sees the movie as a satire of American militarism. Great background research there Paul... The overall theme of the book is that social responsibility requires individual sacrifice. It is the only science fiction novel on the reading list at three of the four United States military academies. The novel was filled with life lessons and examples of the importance of civic duty. More importantly though it had a REALLY cool element that would have translated very well on film. POWER ARMOR!!!! The book spends loads of time explaining the power armor that made the infantry the Mobile Infantry. Soldiers didn't ride down in boats they were shot from tubes in capsules hence the term cap trooper and their suits looked like a kind of giant mechanical gorilla. Rather than utilize one of the best ideas in the history of sciencefiction warfare Verhoven decided to create Space 90210 and add in his own sophomoric commentary on soldiering and society. Pretty boys and girls in shower scenes might bring in the highschool money but it certainly doesn't make a good movie. If you enjoyed this I strongly recommend that you read the book. You'll know immediately why those of us who did were very disappointed. Fantastic potential never even close to becoming realized.".

A brief overview of any of the spate of horrible Zucker Brothersclone movies churned out over the last decade or even some of their own later films for that matter should prove conclusively that is is very possible to make a bad satire and this is an awful one.  It is neither funny nor profound and I would even argue that this is that worst of possible satiresa completely insincere one which pretends to mock the subject matter it in fact sensationalistically exploits for sales and cheap shock.  I will admit that I liked Robocop and even Total Recall but Verhoeven's direction is getting lazier sloppier and more contemptful of his audience with every film to the point where he now clearly no longer cares at all whether he is insulting that audience's intelligence or not.

To me this is Verhoeven's finest work  a real achievement of what in Europe is known as enlightenment a way to make citizens more aware more conscious more autonom.Starship Troopers is Verhoeven's ultimate assault on Hollywood on Social Media on totalitarian Societies in general  and the USA in particular. You can love it if you appreciate freedom of mind in any way or hate it if you identify with systems outside of yourself  but you just can not miss the huge ironic dimension that this very expensive movie was financed by a system that the movie attacks with everything at its proposal.

However if you are looking for a light entertaining movie I would definitely recommend this film. While the previews were intriguing I was thrilled to find that not every plot element was revealed before I even entered the theater. I completely enjoyed Kate Winslet as hopelessly devoted Iris. She was neurotic a bit spineless and absolutely winning. Although I do wish that her story had been developed more thoroughly. I felt a bit like her relationship was rushed through and the film spent a majority of the time focusing on Amanda Diaz Graham Law and their developing relationship. Despite the fact that I am not a huge Cameron Diaz or Jude Law fan I was pleasantly surprised with their part of the story! Jack Black kept his character to an energetic hum rather than an explosion of crazy antics. You've just got to love that eyebrow! The scenery was beautiful! The supporting cast was hugely entertaining. I laughed out loud. The ending is fairly predictable. This is a romantic comedy after all. However The Holiday is a great film for those of us who would like to suspend reality for a while and just enjoy. Go see it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Two beautiful women Amanda Woods Cameron Diaz and Iris Simpkins Kate Winslet both find themselves at the end of failed relationships just before Christmas. Amanda decides to take a two week vacation and surfs the internet. She meets Iris online and they agree to swap their homes for the holidays. Amanda lives in Los Angles and Iris lives in the countryside of Surrey England. Even though they now have a change of scenery and want no contact with men they are both still depressed and lonely. But things are about to change when Iris' brother Graham Jude Law drops by Iris' house and meets Amanda. On the other side of the world Iris meets Miles Jack Black a film composer. Romance is in the air and sparks are about to fly.My Comment If you want to see a romantic comedy with real chemistry especially between Cameron Diaz and Jude Law this is one chick flick you must see. This movie is a good date movie that is actually entertaining and sweet. You are actually seeing two love stories instead of one. There is a great subplot of the friendship between Kate Winslet and Eli Wallach's character that will touch your heart. Actually I enjoyed that part of the movie the best. Overall the movie was enjoyable to watch with touching and funny scenes throughout the movie. The ending is predictable but what do you expect it is a romantic comedy. You will leave the movie feeling good and isn't that what movies are all about. Columbia Pictures Run time 218 Rated PG13810".

	schema:headline " The Holiday";
	schema:reviewBody "The Holiday is about two women who each have recently had problems with the men in their lives. Amanda lives in California and Iris lives in England. Neither of these women have ever met before but they both want to escape for the holidays so they talk online and decide to swap houses and automobiles for two weeks so in other words Amanda would be staying at Iris's house in England and Iris would be staying at Amanda's house in California. Once they both reach their destinations they are both pretty bitter about men but each of them soon meets different men in their lives who mean a lot to them and may make their holiday something to remember. The Holiday has good direction a good script good performances by the entire cast and good original music. At first I wasn't really getting into this film and thought it would be a film that would probably appeal more to a woman than to me. Also the Amanda character played by Cameron Diaz annoyed me at first and I found her kind of artificial and ego centric. However as the film played on I found myself really liking this film. The characters grew on me and I found quite a bit to like about this movie. The chemistry between all the different characters works very well and their parts are all quite well written and the actors playing them each do a good job. I found that the film also developed and showed a lot about these characters which I enjoyed because the more I got to know about them the more I liked them and they were able to grow on me more. Each character in this film brings something unique to the table by being different and by really making this film more interesting than perhaps it sounds. The really rewarding thing about this film is how well the characters work with one another and that they are well written and well acted. This film is a romantic comedy and for the most part a lot of romantic comedies do not do a whole lot for me because I find them silly and more for the female viewer than the male viewer but this movie offers a lot of humour heart and is just generally a pleasant feel good film that I think both male and female viewers will enjoy. One of the better films of the year and one of the better romantic comedies of recent years as well.".

But once you can go along with the ridiculous plot it is very funny and totally charming. It's a bit like eating liquid chocolate and somehow manages to last for 2 hours and 10 minutes without you feeling sick.At the start of the film the acting is very hammy but this removes your desire for believability enough to carry the film. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law look absolutely lovely. Kate Winslett really pulls off her comedic role brilliantly. The are some beautiful touching moments about Hollywood history and a couple of famous faces appear in cameo roles. The English countryside is lovely. Lots of laughter and tears in the audience.The nutritional value of chocolate is limited. This film will uplift you though if nothing else. Excellent Christmas movie from a bloke!.".

	schema:headline " Is Physical Assault Really Funny??";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie on a 14 hour plane ride from San Francisco to Hong Kong and believe me I can't imagine any other circumstances in which I would have sat through the entire thing immobile. I'm not a great fan of Romantic Comedies which I find are rarely very romantic and even less frequently funny. Possibly I'm just too old and cynical. But there wasn't much choice as a combination of boredom and a very efficient Cathay Pacific stewardess had tied me to my coach class seat. And I started about a third of the way into the movie which I realized later was definitely the best place to start.This is a movie about two young women Amanda Cameron Diaz  not one of my favourite actresses and Iris Kate Winslett  I adore Kate Winslett so I'm almost prepared to forgive her this dire interlude who swap houses on a whim one Christmas to escape their various romantic entanglements. Of course they meet new men and fall in love as one always does when swapping houses in this case with Jude Law and Jack Black. And I can't even recall the name of their characters Graeme and Thingy? Ben and Jerry? Amanda who owns her own film promotion company and is a skinny over achiever portrayed as a bitch of course because she is successful trots off first class to the English countryside where she wrestles with every British clich in the book such as driving on the left and stumbling across snowy meadows to reach the quaint idyllic but chilly Rose Hill Cottage. Iris an under achieving journalist wronged in love by a classic British cad legs it economy to LA where she finds herself living next to a curmudgeonly old screen writer who turns out to have a heart of gold  no surprises there then. I came in where Iris arrives in LA and Amanda arrives in the UK.Amanda falls for Iris' brother Jude Law widowed tragically and left with two sweet children. We never find out how he was widowed so young but I spent most of the movie hoping that it would turn out he had murdered his wife and wishing he would do the same to Diaz. This would have cheered me up enormously but I guess Cathay Pacific wouldn't have shown it on a long haul flight? This script has definite possibilities as a horror movie. Isolated cottage stranger knocking at the door at night etc. In Surrey no one can hear you scream. I have rarely seen a worse matched pair than Cameron Diaz and Jude Law. She is all sharp angles and a whiplash tongue playing the crazy LA stereotype and he is wildly miscast as stoical Graeme or Thingy? Diaz here reminded me of a piece of barbed wire. Meanwhile Iris is getting up close and friendly with Jack Black's character in LA who has himself been wronged by some actress or other. I actually found Winslett and Black a much more convincing couple than Diaz and Law although it looked briefly like she might get shacked up with the curmudgeonly old screen writer. Jack Black is actually very good here playing it very straight and his character won my sympathy even if I can't recall his name. I found myself warming to them both by the very predictable end. I could see why she found him appealing. Then as the film looped back to the start I saw the first third. Oh dear. Truly awful. Diaz' character Amanda is just appalling. Can she seriously enjoy playing this kind of stuff? Or does it fill the time between surfing? Does anyone really find this offensive portrayal of modern successful young women entertaining? Is it me or is this just so unfunny? At one point Amanda actually physically assaults her ex lover with two right hooks to the chin which knock him flat. This is presented as amusing entertainment. Just imagine if you can the reverse a couple splitting up so he decides to go out on a high note by punching his ex girlfriend to the ground. Would we still be expected to laugh? We have spent years trying to convince the world that men assaulting women is wrong and here we have a woman assaulting a man presented as light entertainment. Is that really OK with everyone?Yes I know this is just a popcorn movie and I'm not the target audience  far too old and boring. But it matters it's insidious. I don't want my teenagers watching this trash. And the worse part? It was written and directed by a woman. She should be ashamed of herself.".

She goes online and has soon swapped her Christmascard pretty but cramped Surrey cottage with a mansion in Bel  Air owned by Amanda Cameron Dias the ebullient head of a company that makes movie trailers who has just thrown out her latest useless partner. The girls swap places and in no time Amanda is romancing Iris's dishy brother Graham Jude Law. Meanwhile in Hollywood Iris is getting to know Miles Jack Black a workmate of Amanda's and a 90 year old neighbour Arthur Eli Wallach who happens to be one of Hollywood's forgotten great writers.One can of course dismiss this sort of stuff as glossy fairy floss because basically despite all the money and talent expended in making it that is what it is  Love Improbable. This film is rather long for its genre over two hours and it does drag a bit as if the scriptwriters couldn't decide how to end it. However it must be admitted that Kate Winslett and Jude Law are always interesting to watch on screen and Cameron Diaz has a nice line in parodying some of her earlier performances. Rufus Sewell shows he can outact Hugh Grant any day not hard I guess. Jack Black on the other hand seemed strangely out of place as Ms W's love interest  romantic comedy doesn't seem to be his forte he's more of your grossout guy. It was nice though to see Eli Wallach a great Hollywood tough guy of old who at 90 seems to have the market for nice old buffers sewn up as the neighbour.Perhaps I am setting my standard too high but compared to Four Weddings and a Funeral Notting Hill Bedrooms and Hallways and even Love Actually this was a pile of mush far too sweet and sticky and nice. Good comedy needs a certain bite a reality bite a bit of astringency whereas what we are given here is pure fairyland escapism. WriterDirector Nancy Myers has a record of light entertaining stuff The Parent Trap Father of the Bride and she certainly is not trying to extend her range here.".

None of us thought anything good of this movie. After the first scene I found myself regretting choosing this movie. Before half the movie was over I found myself busy talking to my boyfriend about all the ridiculously bad acting and terrible scriptwriting that was going on. The Cameron Diaz story seemed to be the main focus of the film even though it was the worse of the two stories. Every scene between Diaz and Law was awkward and contrived. Law falls in love with Diaz after having sex with her on the first meeting. My boyfriend told me he would think she was a whore not fall for her. I agree. Someone said there was GREAT characterization in this film which is an opinion I personally do not hold. Jude Law's character starts out as a man who sleeps with a different woman every night then with little to no transition becomes a loving father falling for Diaz a materialistic career woman with no maternal instincts and no desirable traits as a longterm partner and finally ends as a pussy boy sobbing to himself when Diaz leaves. Diaz's character was anything but a character. The Winslett story was slightly better but not much. She interacts with Jack Black usually hilarious but in this movie it seemed like the producers must have killed his dog or something because there was nothing funny about him and their story also involves some old man who miraculously is able to walk without his walker within a week and I'm not sure about what the point of having this old man in the movie is at all besides to insert a Jewish celebration of Hannukah. I don't have time to go into more detail but I can tell you this if you like your movies to have a single bit of wit make any sense resemble anything like a story that could actually happen and are not retarded you will not enjoy this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "OKPrevious comments on this film have already said it as well as I can but I really want to save people from wasting time and money and try to persuade them to see something else instead. If you're convinced of this already but you're being dragged along by your girlfriend stop her because she'll dislike this movie too.The movie doesn't even live up to its genre. There is no romance in it  any sexual frisson having been replaced by awkward moments badly acted and there is no comedy in it  just cringey moments delivered by you guessed it more bad acting. I could go on about the script being predictable and tired. Indeed most failed movies go back as far as script or storyline calibre but not as far as the initial premise which in this case is okay if not a little familiar to Hollywood punters.However the main thing you'll find is you don't care for the plight of the characters because they're badly drawn do unrealistic things and we see neither enough of their backstory or their relationships developing with each other.I'm a real fan of the cast top actors such as Law and Winslet a great comedian in Black and when well cast a huge talent in Diaz. I really felt for the actors combined career lowpoint and hope they will recover. The movie business seems to be driven by money rather than storytelling and in this the movie will no doubt succeed. But there are many examples of strong RomCom scripts so I don't think we should excuse the producers. Meg Ryan or Hugh Grant is practically a seal of approval and then there's Bridget Jones Forget Paris If Lucy Fell to name a few.I was laughing in the wrong places cringing at the assumed intended jokes planning my week in my head during most of it and feeling utterly tortured and cheated out of 2 hours of my life afterwards.Sincerely hoping Meyers doesn't write any more screenplays. Failing that sincerely hoping no more of Meyers screenplays are made into film. Craig".

Indeed most failed movies go back as far as script or storyline calibre but not as far as the initial premise which in this case is okay if not a little familiar to Hollywood punters.However the main thing you'll find is you don't care for the plight of the characters because they're badly drawn do unrealistic things and we see neither enough of their backstory or their relationships developing with each other.I'm a real fan of the cast top actors such as Law and Winslet a great comedian in Black and when well cast a huge talent in Diaz. I really felt for the actors combined career lowpoint and hope they will recover. The movie business seems to be driven by money rather than storytelling and in this the movie will no doubt succeed. But there are many examples of strong RomCom scripts so I don't think we should excuse the producers. Meg Ryan or Hugh Grant is practically a seal of approval and then there's Bridget Jones Forget Paris If Lucy Fell to name a few.I was laughing in the wrong places cringing at the assumed intended jokes planning my week in my head during most of it and feeling utterly tortured and cheated out of 2 hours of my life afterwards.Sincerely hoping Meyers doesn't write any more screenplays. Failing that sincerely hoping no more of Meyers screenplays are made into film. Craig";

In fact I was actively cringing for most of the film. I thought Kate Winslet's character was excessively stupid for being in love for three years with a cardboard man that used her when he needed to and then ran back to his fiance. And to get over him she decides all she needs is two weeks in LA? And he still doesn't leave her alone then but she never outrightly tell him to F Off which really really got my goat because if she had the film might just might have been worth the 9.20 I paid to waste 2 hours of my life on this dire atrocity. The only thing I liked about the film was Jack Black but he was woefully underused. It was also as if the director told him  OK we're going for completely formulaic here NO IMPROVISING no offthecuff funny stuff nothing just work from the script. And they probably cut any bits out that he did do on the spur of the moment. In conclusion if you want to numb your brain and do have a few hours and a bit of money to waste by all means go and see this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since seeing this dreadful heap of muck last night as a favour to a young relative I have racked my brains for a reason this garbage was made. Thanks to IMDb I now know why there are clearly enough utterly and completely stupid people in the world to make it some money. But shame on all of you IMDb users who have boosted The Holiday right here shame on you for being lame brained feckless and dim. This movie is less intelligent than a Lassie movie and I tell you this far less entertaining.The word 'money' has also been revolving around my brain as in this sentence 'Why did these stars do it? They don't need the money surely?' What in the name of all that is an actress with the talent of Kate Winslet who I last saw in Extras for goodness sakedoing in this dogmuck? And Jude Law also? Their careers deserve a couple of years of freefall after this. And Jack Black? The magnificent tyro of School of Rock? Your cred is in the shredder baby Mind you he did come to think of it at times look embarrassed so perhaps there is hope for him after all. Did someone threaten to kill their parents or children if they didn't do it? It must be that or something like that there is no other rational explanation.I was in physical pain whilst watching it in Chesterfield last evening. If the extraordinary cynicism of its religious adherence to every immoral and unethical strand of formulaHollywood drek in here isn't bad enough if the fact that the script that could have been written by a 12 year old dewyeyed girl weaned and educated on every piece of schlock Disney every produced or some kind of parodist with nothing better to do but was apparently written by an adult isn't bad enough if the torrent of clichs isn't bad enough  including the intensely vomitinducing utterly laughable inclusion of oldetyme Golden Age of Hollywood writer winning a lifetime achievement award scene  AND CAN I TELL ANY American READING THIS THAT IT HASN'T SNOWED IN THE COUNTY OF SURREY BEFORE AND AROUND Christmas FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS? if the complete lack of verisimilitude to real life like the fact that women of thirtyodd don't make love in bratops isn't bad enough if the fact that Jude Law's character begins as a womananight beerslugging rogue then by half way becomes a winsomely sincere widowed single Dad who adores his two girls and one is called 'Miffy' in real life for God's sake what next?!isn't bad enough if the fact that Cameron Diaz's 'performance' was the most embarrassing I've ever seen isn't bad enough if the woolly mammothesquire touch of the miserable shoddy direction isn't bad enough if the fact that the studio thinks this pathetic nonsense is so good they let it stretch on for over two hours isn't bad enough then the fact that these filmmakers actually gave this evil monster of a movie pretensions to intelligence and relationshipprofundity most certainly is.I was going to say that The Holiday is an insult to anyone who ever went to school and earned a single GCSE pass or a 25metre swimming certificate until I logged on here and found that people presumably over the age of 12 actually liked it. Tell me again you actually liked this film? And to pass off Cary Grant as coming from Surrey  I know! pipes Kate ecstatically when the old geezer tells her this  is mindnumbing is what is tells us about the attitude of studio producers and for good measure this director and screenplay writerto all of us factual accuracy in movies Forget it it doesn't matter because you numbskulls chuckleheads mimbos and bimbos chewing popcorn and sucking down Coke won't notice and don't matter. For the record just in case noone else has mentioned it in this review section  and do forgive me for not reading every single one because to me suicide is immoral  Cary Grant was brought up or 'raised' for you USA'ers in Bristol which is a port in Gloucestershire which is in the west of England and therefore nowhere near bloody Surrey.So The Holiday takes its place in my pantheon of the absolute and utter crap where it joins Orlando The Piano and Cronenberg's Crash. It makes for a very strange bedfellow. I suppose this proves that if there's one thing worse than a supposedly intelligent arthouse movie that stinks the place out from sheer badness and pretentiousness it's a movie which by all that is sacred should be presented as being as dumb as it looks and which doesn't so much insult the intelligence and good nature of the audience as trample up and down on it with hobnail boots with sharp nails sticking out of the sole pointy end down. I came home switched on the TV and watched an hour of House. All thankfully is not lost. Yet.PS Since more and more people have logged on to the website to sing the praises  supposedly  of this film I have become completely convinced that all of them especially the one's saying 'Phew thank Heaven for romance' are kidding. No one intelligent enough to press the 'On' button on a computer can possibly like this movie it is simply the worst movie ever made.".

	onyx:emotionText "Since seeing this dreadful heap of muck last night as a favour to a young relative I have racked my brains for a reason this garbage was made. Thanks to IMDb I now know why there are clearly enough utterly and completely stupid people in the world to make it some money. But shame on all of you IMDb users who have boosted The Holiday right here shame on you for being lame brained feckless and dim. This movie is less intelligent than a Lassie movie and I tell you this far less entertaining.The word 'money' has also been revolving around my brain as in this sentence 'Why did these stars do it? They don't need the money surely?' What in the name of all that is an actress with the talent of Kate Winslet who I last saw in Extras for goodness sakedoing in this dogmuck? And Jude Law also? Their careers deserve a couple of years of freefall after this. And Jack Black? The magnificent tyro of School of Rock? Your cred is in the shredder baby Mind you he did come to think of it at times look embarrassed so perhaps there is hope for him after all. Did someone threaten to kill their parents or children if they didn't do it? It must be that or something like that there is no other rational explanation.I was in physical pain whilst watching it in Chesterfield last evening. If the extraordinary cynicism of its religious adherence to every immoral and unethical strand of formulaHollywood drek in here isn't bad enough if the fact that the script that could have been written by a 12 year old dewyeyed girl weaned and educated on every piece of schlock Disney every produced or some kind of parodist with nothing better to do but was apparently written by an adult isn't bad enough if the torrent of clichs isn't bad enough  including the intensely vomitinducing utterly laughable inclusion of oldetyme Golden Age of Hollywood writer winning a lifetime achievement award scene  AND CAN I TELL ANY American READING THIS THAT IT HASN'T SNOWED IN THE COUNTY OF SURREY BEFORE AND AROUND Christmas FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS? if the complete lack of verisimilitude to real life like the fact that women of thirtyodd don't make love in bratops isn't bad enough if the fact that Jude Law's character begins as a womananight beerslugging rogue then by half way becomes a winsomely sincere widowed single Dad who adores his two girls and one is called 'Miffy' in real life for God's sake what next?!isn't bad enough if the fact that Cameron Diaz's 'performance' was the most embarrassing I've ever seen isn't bad enough if the woolly mammothesquire touch of the miserable shoddy direction isn't bad enough if the fact that the studio thinks this pathetic nonsense is so good they let it stretch on for over two hours isn't bad enough then the fact that these filmmakers actually gave this evil monster of a movie pretensions to intelligence and relationshipprofundity most certainly is.I was going to say that The Holiday is an insult to anyone who ever went to school and earned a single GCSE pass or a 25metre swimming certificate until I logged on here and found that people presumably over the age of 12 actually liked it. Tell me again you actually liked this film? And to pass off Cary Grant as coming from Surrey  I know! pipes Kate ecstatically when the old geezer tells her this  is mindnumbing is what is tells us about the attitude of studio producers and for good measure this director and screenplay writerto all of us factual accuracy in movies Forget it it doesn't matter because you numbskulls chuckleheads mimbos and bimbos chewing popcorn and sucking down Coke won't notice and don't matter. For the record just in case noone else has mentioned it in this review section  and do forgive me for not reading every single one because to me suicide is immoral  Cary Grant was brought up or 'raised' for you USA'ers in Bristol which is a port in Gloucestershire which is in the west of England and therefore nowhere near bloody Surrey.So The Holiday takes its place in my pantheon of the absolute and utter crap where it joins Orlando The Piano and Cronenberg's Crash. It makes for a very strange bedfellow. I suppose this proves that if there's one thing worse than a supposedly intelligent arthouse movie that stinks the place out from sheer badness and pretentiousness it's a movie which by all that is sacred should be presented as being as dumb as it looks and which doesn't so much insult the intelligence and good nature of the audience as trample up and down on it with hobnail boots with sharp nails sticking out of the sole pointy end down. I came home switched on the TV and watched an hour of House. All thankfully is not lost. Yet.PS Since more and more people have logged on to the website to sing the praises  supposedly  of this film I have become completely convinced that all of them especially the one's saying 'Phew thank Heaven for romance' are kidding. No one intelligent enough to press the 'On' button on a computer can possibly like this movie it is simply the worst movie ever made.";

	schema:reviewBody "I think this film deserves a better rating than the current 6.9 on IMDb. I to expected it to be just like other rom com's but it was much better than i expected and very enjoyable.The story starts with Amanda Cameron Diaz and Iris Kate Winslet fed up with their love lives Amanda's boyfriend has been cheating on her and the man Iris loves has just got engaged to someone else. They both decide to switch houses for Christmas for an escape from their complicated lives so Iris jets off to Amanda's place in sunny L.A and Amanda goes to Iris' quaint cottage in snowy Surrey England if only it really did snow at Christmas! Amanda soon meets Iris' handsome brother Graham Brilliantly played by Jude Law and Iris meets musician Miles Jack Black and you can guess the rest...The acting is strong and well handled. At first i found Cameron Diaz hugely annoying but as it went on i warmed to her character she and Jude had lots of chemistry and their relationship was handled well and Graham's secret was a good twist.I thought Jack Black was great in this different role he and Kate also had chemistry and he was totally believable. I wish their storyline had been a bit longer though as they spent way more time on Cameron and Jude's part.Kate Winslet as usual was funny and touching as Iris and maybe one of the best parts of the film was her relationship with the old man Eli Wallach they both seemed to have a connection and it was nice to hear his stories of when he was a writer in the good old Hollywood days when he knew Cary Grant and co! If you want beautiful scenery escapism from the millions of horror and action films out there and good characterisation than this is for you. It's not as soppy as other romcom's and it's easy to identify with the characters it's also very festive and my dad even liked it and he hates romantic films!".

This is one of his first films that he plays a father in and he does it so well. He is fun loving and so sweet. The first scene that he is in with Cameron Diaz in which he kisses her eyes is so romantic. It makes all of us single girls just want to keep Jude on our couch and not let him get away. The kitchen scene is just a heart melting gut wrenching make your husband look out.Jack Black is displaying a different role as Miles. This shows that he has a softer side and is willing to step out a traditional role that we are so used to seeing him in. He still does display the comedy that we are used to seeing but it is downplayed.The music helps set the mood in this movie. It is all tamed down and helps to set the feeling of again I must say romance. It makes it so easy to watch and if you can find a guy that will sit down and watch this with you it will create feelings that may lead to something else.Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet make this movie great. They both shine equally and neither tries to steal the limelight. This is one of the first roles that Kate has done as a comedy and it she does it very well.".

It's been a month or two maybe since this movie passed on our cinemas but I was not able to see it on the big screen and here I am  at home playing it on the DVD player. I like Jack Black  this is the reason I got the movie. Like Cameron Diaz Jude and Kate too but of all those four Jack is my favorite and what I was expecting to see was something more like The School of Rock 2003 or Nacho Libre 2006  I wanted something funny to release the Friday work stress. Well... I got something else. Different is the actual word. I remember I saw the trailer few times months ago but as I now remember it was little misleading. Jack Black plus Cameron Diaz should be equal to whoknowswhat similar maybe to There's Something About Mary 1998 I though to myself and that's exactly what I need this Friday night! Today is one week since I work for another company some more stress as You may guess and I prepared for a little fun. First of all to say  it was not funny. There were some amusing moments but this movie for me was not funny at all and not a bad one at all either! It just was not comedy no matter how some label it. Surprisingly for me this is one of those movies who really could make You think of the world around You and the way we live our lives. This is like ordering a sausage with fries and getting a fine fillet au champignons instead or however some would like to compare it because in this movie we see Jack and Cameron in very serious situations. It's not all credit for Jack and Cameron of course  Jude and Kate did great too as well as the director and writer did. I almost cried in few moments. It is a long movie  my player stopped at credits at 2h and few minutes time now is 240am but I wanted to write this anyway. As my girlfriend sleeps next to me and I was watching the movie it really made me thinking and recalling different moments of my life with her. I do not know  maybe I am just too emotional please tell me Your opinion. Anyway I totally recommend the movie to everyone really. In brief story is not bad at all actor play at the end is great music is great great level of originality make you recall of movies like The Cable Guy 1996 a little. Great work guys! Now all of You go and see it!".

They cram more clichs into Jude Law than I thought possible.I enjoyed 'What Women Want' and expected an awful lot more from this.

But then we lean that the likable and amiable Benigno has raped Alicia the woman who is in love with her European art cinema has a great tradition but an uncertain future in the world increasingly dominated by Hollywood Almodvar is an ornament of European culture which proved that the form still has much to say about the human condition and can say it with charm elegance and attractiveness";

	schema:reviewBody "I had a hard time getting around this movie right after seeing it. Something was not quite right something disturbing.  But after sleeping on it I think I have it figured out.I know people read these to find out if a movie is good or not.  It is good. It's an effective piece of art which has an interesting and original inner voice.  It's thoughtprovoking.But it doesn't leave you with anything to hang your hat on.  You are not going to come out relating to the characters or situations.  Not right away not until you've digested the whole and figured out what part of it is universal to you.spoilers galoreThe key to Marco  Benigno's relationship is that they both don't listen to women  the title of the film can throw you off this trail a bit.  They don't listen  and they don't want to.Marco didn't want to know that this woman wasn't really in love with him. After all he swept in when she was on the rebound and he knows desperate women by his own admission  or does he not really know them rather always swoops in like this?  That would explain a lot  he has a hard time with normal relationships.  He likes a girl on the rebound or desperate for some reason.  He doesn't really want to cope with real love he just want s his own thing. He is selfish.  This is not the way one loves.  Love is something that is not for you it is for the one you love.Does he then gain anything from his friend's problems  suicide?  I don't know.  But I think in the end that he doesn't.  Maybe this is why it is a disturbing film.  He is back to crying at this experimental dance.  He has already gone back to traveling around on his own instead of leading a life with people.  He is back to getting involved with a girl who has problems girl coming out of a coma counts I'd say.Meanwhile his friend Benigno is the ultimate in doesn't listen. He idolized this girl from afar then found the perfect relationship when she couldn't communicate at all.  But she was communicating  she was saying nothing at all and he was projecting for her.  He knew that in fact but that didn't matter to him.Finally he rapes her under the pretense that she has actually been communicating with him in the way he wants.  Rape is of course the ultimate in selfish love.  It is an act which defines how selfish love is really an oxymoron  it's not love at all.  He feels his half of the relationship is enough to make a whole.  This is the ultimate loner I'd say.  And we know he never learns never grows nothing.  He ends up committing suicide. The ultimate in despair.One might say that Benigno was good bc he had cared for this girl all this time.  But that is not what good is.  He is not caring for her out of dedication to his profession.  He is not caring for her out of love.  He is doing it bc he needs it for his own selfish purposes  that is how he feels love.  I suppose bc that is what he had with his mother.So there is a reason seemingly  his mother.  That would be too easy though to just let him slide bc of that.  And to do so one would have to project something not in the film  we never actually know what the relationship was with this mother.So then it's not black  white but still definite I think all reasons aside in that he is not good.  In fact I think he has severe problems.And Marco relates to him...Perhaps it's hopeful in that ultimately it lays the blame on the characters themselves and doesn't say this is some bigger unresolveable problem. But from what I saw it's still pretty depressing.".

After recently viewing Almodvar's stupendous film All about my Mother I was anxious to see his subsequent work. While the films stories are unrelated the curtains that fall in the end of All about my Mother are present in the opening scene of Talk to Her something audiences may not pay mind to if not watching in sequence. The film is filled with art ballet is woven throughout and in the opening and ending scene. The Miseenscne is breathtaking from intricate matador costumes to the vivid colors and a haunting somber score. Reminiscent of Almodvar style the film ranges from a soap opera to immense tragedy. There is the highly melodramatic scene in which the women matador character fights with a talk show host yet overall the film has a solemn premise. We see surrealism in a silent film within the film's peculiar sexual symbolism later ensuing in rape. The film captures Spain's time honored masculine Bullfight yet there is a woman matador stretching the mind's eye in regard to gender roles aptly Almodvar's grand craft. Almodvar is also known for female cast compilations yet the director changes course with the two men who share loneliness and pain provoked by passion. We see attributes in the male characters generally deemed feminine namely embroidery crying nurturing devoting. The bond that in the end unites the two men is that they share these abilities. There are numerous flashbacks which show how the men meet their now comatose women and the evolution of the relationships. The title of the film Talk to Her reflects a literal meaning as well as broader premise of communication in relationships. Nothing is simple says the ballet instructor in the last line of the film a comment on the complicated emotional paradigm of the story. Almodvar's script is original and captivating great acting with daring direction the viewer is indubitably moved.".

It is not a film you will forget and no doubt will think about a lot after watching it. Also unlike a lot of critically acclaimed films you will not be cogitating over the events that took place in the film you will be asking yourself how they apply to your life and relationships with others. Despite Talk To Her's tragic story it is an incredibly fun film to watch and discuss with others and a film I am extremely glad I added to my collection having heard little about it at the time I bought it. 910".

The film starts and finishes in a theatre and two characters who eventually meet and create a bond are sitting in close proximity of each other moved by the drama playing itself onstage. Javier Camera and Dario Grandinetti play Benigno and Marco. As TALK TO HER begins they are both watching a play about two women both mimicking each other's actions both looking disheveled and with white night gowns. What neither of them know is that they will meet through the most unlikely of ways.Javier is a loner a man who lost his mother and has an ambiguous sexuality who works as a nurse in a hospital. He spies at Alicia a young dancer played by Leonor Watling and we see his desire. He bumps into her on the street walks her home and notices her father is a psychiatrist who consults from home. So he sets a session in which he sort of declares he is a homosexual while Alicia takes a shower. Before he leaves he takes an object from her room not before he bumps into a naked Alicia and makes up a flimsy excuse as to why he is there. However he will lose her to an accident which will leave her in a coma.Marco is a reporter assigned to interview the famous bullfighter Lydia Rosario Flores right at the moment she is going through some tough moments since her exboyfriend another toreador called El Nino de Valencia Adolfo Fernandez has left her the object of media fodder. They become close but a fateful match with a bull leaves Lydia also in a coma hovering between life and death in the hospital where Benigno works and takes care of the also comatose Alicia. Marco while taking care of Lydia wonders if his interview could have broken her concentration and led to her situation.It's here when Benigno and Marco meet and their meeting becomes the fulcrum of HABLE CON ELLA. Benigno opens Marco to the idea that love needs not have a response to be true  he confides his love for Alicia  and one sequence is truly disturbing Benigno's fantasy sequence in which a shrinking man penetrates his wife's vagina shown in black and white betrays what can amount to a pathology and its eventual denouement something I won't reveal creates a series of events that accelerate both the moral of the story. Love sometimes can create actions we would deem as monstrous even when we may not see them as such.

He has nursed his mother for 20 years without any semblance of a normal life or interaction with other women. He then spies on someone across the street and follows her home. He finds out that her father is a shrink and goes along to see him for the chance to see her little realising that the Doctor's concerns for his fragile mental development are well founded and when he gets in he steals something from her room and surprises her naked. This I felt was very disturbing behaviour and the fact that he then nurses her and washes her for monthsyears does not seem kindly to me but that it is the only way he can have a relationship with her. One that she would never condone based on his previous behaviour. He then loves her so much that he wants to marry her and rapes her whilst she is in a coma portrayed by the Bw clip. Then gets sent to jail and commits suicide after finding out that his lovechild didn't survive. I can't understand why people are so moved by this film as I always felt that the male characters were ultimately unlikeable if pitiable. Why does the uncommunicative reporter become such good friends with Benigno? Maybe because he is also very repressed as can be seen with his lack of reaction over finding out that the bullfighter was cheating on him and his unwillingness to move on from his previous relationship.An interesting movie but one that should be discussed rather than raved about.".

It seems like the director doesn't believe 35000 bulls tortured and killed every year in spain is enough. He needed more for the sake of a stupid movie. Or to satisfy his ego perhaps.I find the fact of taking a creature life for the purpose of shooting a film simply disgusting. I can tell you most spaniards hate bullfighting. It's movies like this that give a bad name to the country I was born. And I'm not from Catalunya.";

	schema:reviewBody "MANY MANY SPOILERS Like many people when I watched this film I was left with a very unsettling feeling.Normally especially in my case when you choose to watch a film you pick something that's emotive and will leave you with a desired feeling. Whether you choose to watch a film that will leave you sad laughing or frightened to death etc. But with this film it left me more questioning my moral perceptions I felt like my conscience had been troubled. Day's later I was still thinking back on it trying to come to grips with the concluding sensation I was left with.WriterDirector Pedro Almodovar Is fantastic at making the viewer emotionally attached to his characters. I found this when watching all about my mother. You become part of their lives although the situations in his films are so obscure you still feel like you can understand or relate with how they are feeling. And I felt he once again mastered that in talk to her. As the relationship between the two men grew so did the viewers. Both men were trying to cope with feelings of unobtainable love and it was very moving to watch how each perceived the situation and dealt with it. To begin with I was a little weary of Camera the male nurse you were made aware very early on that his feelings for Watling girl in the coma were not just nurse and patient so throughout the film your feeling a little uncomfortable with how he treats her washing her changing her constantly talking with her. Then as the film develops you are show just how much he loves her and you begin to feel empathy for him though you know he has never know this girl until she was unconscious so you are still left with these undertone feelings of discomfit.BIG SPOILERS Then when you find out that he rapes the girl your left feeling completely bemused by the whole situation. You know you should be feeling disgusted sickened and angered by what he has done but instead you just pity him feel real empathy compassion and just sorry for the whole situation. Because you know that what he did he did out of love for her and he felt that those feelings were being reciprocated by her.This film really makes you meditate on how you perceive such extremely moral right and wrongs. Because humans commit such awfully shocking deeds all the time we tend to throw them all into the same category and don't take time to look at the individuals and their reasons behind their acts. You want Camera to be treated differently you want him to be help you don't want him to be punished. And it's that feeling that will trouble you. Because in the end you have more sympathy for him than the girl because you grow a real relationship with him.".

I watched the entire movie without really feeling anything but I was entranced and intrigued by the visuals and the plot line and the backgrounds of the characters ...SPOILER So I would normally give it 6 out of 10 but then I learned that animals were actually truly harmed in the making of this film  not something you hear about anymore I think. I wasn't too impressed either by the response of the production company when the film was protested we had permission to kill the bulls and the activists are just trying to get attention. Are we threeyearolds? SPOILER The story was told so delicately in the film that I was surprised that Benigno's character actually was guilty of rape. I watched the whole conclusion of the film waiting to find out he was innocent and by the end I still wasn't convinced it was only when I read the reviews that I realized that that really was the plot. The writing of this behavior for this character just didn't fit for me. It was completely not believable.SPOILER Those things bothered me a little but it was tolerable. I was ready to go to sleep when I read some other reviewers rationalizing the rape of Alicia it was in the name of love he really loved her he believed she loved him back she was there naked in front of him everyday.SPOILER Alicia was comatose. She could not speak or move. She had no voice no say in what she was experiencing. She couldn't tell Benigno if his breath smelled or if she liked his cologne she couldn't tell him if she enjoyed his stories or if she found him selfobsessed and rambling she couldn't tell him I'm in love with you or I'm not ready to make love to you or Please put some clothes on me you pervert! As another reader said onesided love is not love. Benigno's love affair was a delusion that was fueled by the circumstance of coma but that's no excuse for his behavior.I want to make sure that its romance is removed for everyone reading this review SPOILER MAJOR SPOILERS Imagine that you are a woman waking up from a coma. You are told that a year of your life has passed. That you were in a car accident and have very little chance of dancing again something that was your life's passion. You have been caressed and fondled and had your body trespassed upon in innumerable ways without your knowledge or permission in the name of good medical care. You have been pregnant in fact you have given birth by a man who you did not love someone who revolted and frightened you. This stuff is not romantic it's rape.So now then I'm going to submit this for review. Good night folks. I wish you all some wonderful movieviewing in your future and hopefully no more movies that paint rape in beautiful colors.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am really sorry to say this film is an example of an auteur's ego preempting fundamentals of good movie making namely character and story development.  The movie was interesting yes but that is about it.  It is sad but it appears that the hip appeal of the modern art' film has once again suckered in some critics into believing they will shunned by their artsy brethren should they say what they really know about this flick  overall its average.Since everyone else has managed to discuss how great Talk To Her' is I feel obligated to herein enhance the negative. sorry IMDB staff  I saw you loved itThe movie evoked little sympathy for either of its main characters. Another review I read points out that 'o great' Almodovar's  effortless way he engenders sympathy for them. I call b.s. here.  I seriously doubt if anyone watching this movie care much about what happened to Benigno in the end. No one in my group did.Further the relationship between Marco and Benigno is not at all convincing.  We are not given a reason to think they should be friends other than the fact that the director tells us so.  The relationship between Marco and Lydia is also poorly developed if developed at all.

The movie was interesting yes but that is about it.  It is sad but it appears that the hip appeal of the modern art' film has once again suckered in some critics into believing they will shunned by their artsy brethren should they say what they really know about this flick  overall its average.Since everyone else has managed to discuss how great Talk To Her' is I feel obligated to herein enhance the negative. sorry IMDB staff  I saw you loved itThe movie evoked little sympathy for either of its main characters. Another review I read points out that 'o great' Almodovar's  effortless way he engenders sympathy for them. I call b.s. here.  I seriously doubt if anyone watching this movie care much about what happened to Benigno in the end. No one in my group did.Further the relationship between Marco and Benigno is not at all convincing.  We are not given a reason to think they should be friends other than the fact that the director tells us so.  The relationship between Marco and Lydia is also poorly developed if developed at all. One minute they are meeting and the next they are lovers.

This of course does not bode well for the United States and to appease them in order to stave off a potential boycott by the US and her allies the Germans had to pass off a show to rescind their decision for the Jews exclusion. This means that the world's best high jumper of the time the German Jew Gretel Bergmann Karoline Herfurth had to be persuaded to return to the Fatherland for representation and competition.This drama directed by Kasper Heidelbach not only tackles the issue of the kind of extreme discrimination and belief in the superiority of the Aryan race but poses a more thought provoking examination at the macro level issues as faced by Gretel in tackling and addressing prejudices from all angles being the lone athlete in a training village treated like an outcast by fellow citizens. She finds it near impossible to show love and pride in being able to represent her country that doesn't love her back what more to earn honours for it? Like any authoritarian regime they function on the basis of threats not only to self but family and is able to shape outcomes as desired through silence and misdirection.And the worst was of course in handpicking Marie Ketteler Sebastian Urzendowsky to become Gretel's chief rival both in training and the eventual competition not that there was any intent anyway to allow Gretel to make it all the way to the Olympics proper. Marie is seemingly able to challenge Gretel one on one which is quite expected should you read the synopsis or know the background of Marie's deep dark secret. Like Gretel Marie was also forced to be in the limelight to do as told and deviations to the established plan was going to be frowned upon severely. What once began as a cold rivalry soon paves the way toward firm friendship as both Gretel and Marie find themselves under the same circumstances of being played as puppets and both harbour hopes of somehow being able to break away from the bonds that shackle them.It is precisely the chemistry between the cast especially the leads that pull this film off in providing an engaging and engrossing premise for their cooperationcompetition. Production values for this historical story is kept high and also provided room to boast some fantastically designed sets and effects used to recreate 1930s Germany as well as the impressively recreated Stadium used for the Games featuring huge Zeppelins flying overhead. These money shots at the finale will put you smack in the middle of the propaganda festivities where important decisions will be made by the leading two athletes and one can imagine just how the actual mood and feel would be like on the streets and at the venue.I have a penchant for films about sports from the yesteryears because when documented and portrayed accurately allow the modern audience a glimpse into how the sport of today have evolved from time past. The high jump here is slightly different from the techniques and styles employed now so that should pique your interest enough as one of the points to watch this film. There may be some quarters grumbling about how much the YOG budget is costing us but let's not mix politics with this platform for our youths to have a go and competing with their peers representing the best from countries around the world.".

Maybe it's her curly hair maybe it's her somewhat sultry look or maybe it's just her demeanour as a lady but we managed to continue watching all 107 minutes of the movie thinking that she is one of the girls.What seems to be a predictable storyline turns out to be a multifaceted display of human emotions thanks to the all rounded and competent performances of the cast where the most basic human feelings of pride honour humility and respect are exhibited through the characters' objectives and motives. There is always a looming feeling of dread as the film proceeds as you fear something ominous for our heroine who deserves so much more than being chucked aside due to political reasons.But history has already inked its place in time and what already took place cannot be reversed. Some may call it a lesson of survival some may call it a reminder of what cultural and historical conflicts can bring about while some others may call it a tale of human instincts. So when the 96 year old Gretel Bergmann appears at the end of the film for an interview on the rather unfortunate incident that happened 74 years ago you may just forget the unfairness of the world dishes to us and feel the real human emotions that are genuine and heartening.".

	schema:reviewBody "Berlin 36 2009 is a German film directed by Kaspar Heidelbach. As the name implies the action is set before and during the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany.German politicians were caught on the horns of a dilemmasome of their finest athletes were Jewish. The Nazis would rather lose a medal for Germany than admit that Jewish athletes could be among the world's greatest.When it became obvious that German Jews were being systematically kept out of the competition progressive U.S. citizens called for a U.S. boycott of the Olympics. However Avery Brundage the U.S. Olympic President would have none of this. Not only did he want U.S. athletes to compete which at least is understandable but he was a known Nazi sympathizer and antiSemite. Not just my opinioncheck out his Wikipedia entry. So the problem was solved by having the Germans give assurances that German Jewish athletes could indeed compete at the Olympics and then making sure that they didn't actually compete.Caught in this sick volatile situation is Gretel Bergmann played by the lovely Karoline Herfurth who is certainly the best woman high jumper in Germany and possibly the best in the world. The Nazis were determined that she would not compete and one method they chose to assure this was to bring onto the team an untried but gifted athlete named Marie Ketteler. Both Gretel and Marie understand what's going on but they nonetheless form an unlikely friendship and alliance. In the ghastly situation present in Nazi Germany in 1936 whether or not an athlete competes in the high jump may seem extremely trivial. However the movie gives a good sense of how thoroughly Naziism pervaded the entire fabric of prewar Germany and how readily nonGermans with fascist tendencies played along with Hitler's plans.Incidentally although this is not portrayed in the film Brundage also saw to it that some American Jewish athletes were removed from Olympic competition because he didn't want to embarrass the Nazis. He was just a great allaround sportsman. We saw this film at the wonderful Rochester Jewish Film Festival. Some of the effects of the largescale stadium productions will be lost on the small screen but the intense parts of the film will work well on DVD.For some reason this movie has earned a ridiculously low IMDb average of 6.5. Hard to believe and to me inexplicable. Ignore the rating. Find this film and see it!".

	onyx:emotionText "Berlin 36 2009 is a German film directed by Kaspar Heidelbach. As the name implies the action is set before and during the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany.German politicians were caught on the horns of a dilemmasome of their finest athletes were Jewish. The Nazis would rather lose a medal for Germany than admit that Jewish athletes could be among the world's greatest.When it became obvious that German Jews were being systematically kept out of the competition progressive U.S. citizens called for a U.S. boycott of the Olympics. However Avery Brundage the U.S. Olympic President would have none of this. Not only did he want U.S. athletes to compete which at least is understandable but he was a known Nazi sympathizer and antiSemite. Not just my opinioncheck out his Wikipedia entry. So the problem was solved by having the Germans give assurances that German Jewish athletes could indeed compete at the Olympics and then making sure that they didn't actually compete.Caught in this sick volatile situation is Gretel Bergmann played by the lovely Karoline Herfurth who is certainly the best woman high jumper in Germany and possibly the best in the world. The Nazis were determined that she would not compete and one method they chose to assure this was to bring onto the team an untried but gifted athlete named Marie Ketteler. Both Gretel and Marie understand what's going on but they nonetheless form an unlikely friendship and alliance. In the ghastly situation present in Nazi Germany in 1936 whether or not an athlete competes in the high jump may seem extremely trivial. However the movie gives a good sense of how thoroughly Naziism pervaded the entire fabric of prewar Germany and how readily nonGermans with fascist tendencies played along with Hitler's plans.Incidentally although this is not portrayed in the film Brundage also saw to it that some American Jewish athletes were removed from Olympic competition because he didn't want to embarrass the Nazis.

	schema:headline " One Of The More Interesting Movies About Nazi Germany I've Seen";
	schema:reviewBody "There hasn't been a lot done in movies about the 1936 Berlin Olympics  at least not that I've come across. Those Games of course are now famous as the Nazi Games. Hitler and the Nazis having come to power three years before were determined to use the Games to demonstrate Aryan superiority. What most people remember about those Games is that theory being blasted out of the water by AfricanAmerican sprinter Jesse Owens. This movie deals not so much with the Olympic Games themselves but with Germany's preparations for the Olympics and in particular with the selection of the German Ladies HighJump team.The United States was threatening a boycott of these Games if German Jewish athletes weren't allowed to compete for Germany. On the one hand the Nazis had no intention of allowing Jews to represent Germany on the other hand the Nazis couldn't risk an American boycott of the their Games. So they developed an elaborate ruse. A Jewish female high jumper Gretel Bergmann had emigrated to Britain and become British champion. She's convinced to return to Germany to train with the German team. With her family still in Germany she has little choice but to comply or have them face the consequences. As she's told this is also the perfect opportunity to expose the myth of Aryan superiority. All she has to do is win  except that she's not going to be allowed to do that. To make sure the Nazis plant a ringer on the team a young man raised by his mother as a girl. Named Maria Ketteler heshe and Gretel develop a bond and a friendship each of them being forced by the Nazis to do something they'd rather not be doing. Gretel would have preferred to stay in London Maria wants to end the charade her mother has forced her to live all her life and simply live as a man. The character of Maria is problematic. That wasn't her real name. Her real name was Dora Ratjen and it wasn't simply that her mother wanted a girl and so raised a boy as a girl. Dora was born with ambiguous genitalia. I don't know why the producers of this would have chosen to change those facts.This movie isn't as harsh as some movies about Nazi Germany. The overt prejudice against Jews isn't as violent as we usually see of course the Olympics were held before Krystallnacht and before the Holocaust had begun in earnest. Gretel isn't liked by her teammates. She's isolated she's lonely German officials will come up with any excuse to prevent her from competing and yet she'll be forced to train and go through the motions as if she might. She becomes a definite object of sympathy. You do feel sorry for her. Actress Karoline Herfurth brought forth that sympathetic reaction very well. You also feel for Maria Sebastian Urzandowski. None of this is hisher fault. Their bond after Gretel gets over the shock of discovering Maria's secret is real and understandable. Nothing really tragic happens to either of them. In that sense this isn't a Holocaust movie. Both survived the Holocaust. But it's a sad movie of two people caught up in an insane system in an insane country in an insane period of time.As the movie ends we're introduced to the real Greta Bergmann this is a true story who answers a few questions about the Games and about Maria. Greta and her family emigrated to New York before the War. Maria was discovered to be a man but survived the War unfortunately becoming a recluse finally dying in 2008. This is a well done story of a little known event in Nazi history. It's neither brutal nor violent. Instead it's interesting but sad. For those interested in the era it should be seen. 910".

	schema:headline " A wellrounded movie with one exception";
	schema:reviewBody "The title of Kaspar Heidelbach's Berlin '36 gives away basically already what this is about the Berlin Olympic Games 1936. Well this is only true to some extent. It is really more about the fate of high jumper Gretel Bergmann Karoline Herfurth before the actual event. She is a Jew which leads to difficulties in terms of her getting nominated for the team. However it was really the Nazis who got her back from London in order to show the world that religion does not matter in the grand picture when it comes to an event like the Olympic Games. Of course it is all makebelieve and in the end she is not allowed to participate. But this film is also about a second athlete Marie Ketteler who is brought in by the Nazis to take Bergmann's place in the squad. She is played by Sebastian Urzendowsky and I must say this is also my biggest criticism about this film. Maybe it was because I knew the actor before but I never saw something in him that people would think he is a woman. The long hair and not too masculine face weren't too bad for the role but his deep voice destroyed it all. Apart from that I think he is not a particularly gifted actor.Luckily the other male older actors made up for this. Thomas Thieme is great fun as always and his reaction when he reads Ketteler's medical file is priceless. Axel Prahl is reliable and likable as usual and Robert Gallinowski was a positive surprise played his part very well. Back to Thieme's character I also liked the scene in which he shakes hands with the athletes not only because he ignores Bergmann but also because of how he lacks all enthusiasm when he shakes Ketteler's hand the enthusiasm that he had before when he shook the hands of the nondegenerate athletes. Ketteler is basically just a tool for him to get rid off Bergmann but he still somewhat despises her for her imperfection.All in all this 6yearold movie was a pretty good watch. It is not historically accurate on many occasions for example the names except Bergmann but it takes on a truly interesting subject and proves that it is still possible after all these years and films to bring something new to the screen in terms of Nazi Germany. Bergmann by the way is still alive today over 100 years old in 2015. I recommend this film. It's a good mix of political thriller and historical context with smart dramatic elements. If you want to see a bit of a boys' version I suggest you check out Napola about a couple boxers training for the Olympic Games 1936 as well. But back to this one I can totally see why Herfurth is among the most famous German actresses right now. She plays her part well and carries this film nicely despite her young age.".

The big question will he be able to go straight using his talent? The dancing is what makes this movie work but Sammy Davis Jr. gives a wonderful performance as a washedup dancer and Sandman Sims makes an impact as a cynical former dancer who doesn't think much of today's music and dance. Gregory Hines does a capable job too. Savion Glover is also quite good as Amy's son. Suzzanne Douglass is good as dance teacher Amy.At the time this movie was made Gregory Hines must surely have been the best living tap dancer. If he wasn't one of his costars probably was. In one of the movie's most memorable scenes Max comments that the old men don't have the ability any more. They take this as a challenge and display incredible talent. Little Mo and Max actually have a duel of sorts much like the Arthur Smith composition adapted as 'Dueling Banjos' for 'Deliverance'.Another great scene is the one where Max shows where he got his ideas for routines by dancing in the streets of New York while construction is going on.And there is the scene where 11yearold Lewis is teaching Amy's dance class above Sonny's.There was plenty of good music here but surprisingly a lot of the dancing was done without musicthough what I like most about tap is the music made by the dancers much like the percussion style of Buddy Rich. I especially liked the arrangement of 'Cheek to Cheek' which started out as elevator music when Max and Amy were dancing ballroom style but changed over to jazz when they switched to tap. I wasn't crazy about attempts to make tap more hip by adding special equipment to shoes so the dancing could be heard with rock music but it made the movie interesting.This was worth seeing.".

The script is not the best either.What this REALLY is  and this part I like  is an excuse for Hines and fellow hoofers to strut their stuff. In fact Hines puts on one of the best exhibitions of tap dancing I have ever seen. What's really fun is to see him and a some old men former great dancers in their day all together in a number or two. That's great stuff.So if want to enjoy some super dancing check this out but if you want a good story pass it up.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's strange and a bit sad to watch this movie now.  Earlier this week the world heard that dancersingeractor Gregory Hines had passed on at the age of 57.  In his obituary there was a comment that while multi talented Hines always considered himself first and foremost a dancer.  This movie from the late 80s shows that to be true in all it's wonderful glory.Possible Spoilers.....The movie opens on a man in a cell.  The darkness surrounds him and he looks pained.  Slowly he begins to listen to the noise around him.  Before you know it the man in on his feet and dancing to the rhythms and sounds of the life in prison.  The dance is one of pain but also as it goes forth brings out relaxation as anger is spent but most importantly the man begins to feel joy.  Jump forward to the man Max Washington Gregory Hines being released on paroll.  He has just spent a few years in Sing Sing.  Originally he was sentenced for Grand Theft but time was added on for Assault  Battery of a prison guard. Max returns to his old neighborhood and takes a hotel room across from a run down building which houses the Sunny Side of the Street tap dance studio.  As  time goes on we learn that was his father's studio but first you see the various classes taught on the first two levels by an old love interest Amy Suzzane Douglas and her son Lewis Savion Glover.  The true joy of the building is the third floor where the old Hoofer's reside. Here we find a virtual who's who of the tap dance world with many of the old masters portraying themselves and of course Sammy Davis Jr. playing Little Mo. Max is not originally totally welcomed back by everyone except for Lewis who looks up to Max as a father which strongly portrays some of the real life feelings that occurred between Hines and Glover and Little Mo who has some big ideas of how to get the rock and roll world interested in the tap world.  Unfortunately for Mo Max has a chip on his shoulder regarding the life his father led and the lack of finances that he grew up with.  It seems that Max has another family one in which Max was a first rate secondstory man...until the night he got caught and ended in jail. The movie is one of conflict between the worlds of the alleged easy and plentiful money and the hard work no glory no money world of music.  As much as Max hates it this is the world that is within him and continues to draw him back time and time again. Hines was a supremely talented man.  He could act he could sing and man he could dance like no other.  He expressed himself in so many ways that it almost didn't seem fair to the rest of us.  Here his character of Max is full of rage and anger.  He bears a lifetime of resentment at what he perceived his father's life to have been worth and he knows what he has to do to make it better.  The anger is almost palpable as it floats off his body.  The look in his eyes and the set of his jaws tells people that he isn't going to take any more.  That same rage appears at first in his dance. He doesn't just lightly dance on the floor a la Fred Astaire.  He pounds the floor and lets it feel his frustration.  He attacks it with percussive beats and syncopated rhythms that make the listeners instantly step back...but then the joy appears.  First it come in the way he dives across the floor and moves free for all the world and then it reaches Hines eye's and you know at that moment that all will be well for this man. The dance sequences alone in this movie are worth sitting through.  Hines has most of them starting with the dance inside the jail cell but there are also moments such as the instruction at the construction site as well as the end sequence when he is working with the rock band that are almost hard to sit through.  For long time fans of the genre the Challenge segment is a treat as all the old greats get out and show just why they made the business what it was.  Also there is a brief flash of the style from Savion Glover's character at one moment that shows why he was a star at such a young age and gives hints as to his future success with Bring in the Noise Bring in the Funk! The world has lost a great talent this week.  But movies like this and Bojangles will be around for years to come and will allow fans to share one last time the joy of seeing a true talent at work in his field.".

I'm used to seeing the thirtysome odd year old with the long dreads and scraggly beard not the kid with short hair and nary a whisker 'bout his face. But even at this stage he's just awesome.I'll admit I've stolen a couple of steps from the people up there in this movie from time to time. I know I don't do them half as well as they do but I don't have as much experience as they do. I keep thinking that they're going to remake this movie one day with Glover in the Hines' role. That'd be just awesome. But then almost all the other hoofers in the film like Sims and Slyde are much to old to be doing film roles any more.

	schema:reviewBody "You sometimes come across a film that is made more for a gimmick rather than telling a very interesting story Tap is one of them. That's not to say that this movie is a flat out dud it's just that the story doesn't really hold a candle to the tap dancing shown here. Starring the late Gregory Hines the film revolves around a talented tap dancer named Max Washington Hines who must decide between embracing dancing at a new dance production from his girlfriend Amy Suzanne Douglass or becoming a criminal again with his old criminal buddy Nicky Joe Morton. From a premise like that the movie becomes rather predictable from its outcome alone and each beat becomes more obvious after another.So what elevates the film up to being above average? Well mainly the dancing as many of the characters in the movie display a versatile amount of dance moves that one could only wish to be good at. The dancers range from the likes of Sammy Davis jr. Jimmy Slyde Howard Sims Bunny Briggs Dick Anthony Williams and even a young Savion Glover. It's hilarious watching Max getting involved with the old curmudgeons in games of dancing and the choreography definitely deserves much recognition. One particular scene of Max demonstrating his moves to a crowd of people outside the dance production practically turns into a scene from a Broadway musical it's so much fun to watch. Even at that the most likable characters in the film are Amy and Little Mo Davis jr. as they cause much conflict with Max when it comes to deciding where he belongs as well as trying to get his act back together. Everyone else while not despicable are either just there or just give Max more problems yet they're not as interesting as they could be and they just come off as a forgettable supporting cast. That being said in spite of a majority of weak characters and a lackluster plot they're not what this movie is all about at the end of the day. This is mainly made to be a fun little dance flick with Gregory Hines busting moves and it does succeed in that aspect. If you're a Hines fan or you're just into dancing as a whole definitely give this a watch just don't expect a story with much substance or intrigue.".

There is a child whose role enhances the adult story. The gangster parts may seem weakthis is not Goodfellas. But they do the job to balance out the sentimental stuff. The water dripping...perhaps it is not quite a metaphor. But it is the foundation for a rhythm a rhythm that ties the sordid part of the protagonists life prison with an opportunity to break free from the underworld. Gregory Hines plays the role of a man who needs to decide what he really wants. He has an idea for a creative venture. He can have the meaningful relationship that has eluded him. That would be with the redoubtable woman admirably played by Suzzanne Douglass. Always there is the pull of his past criminal ties. I really identified with all of the characters in this charming film.".

	schema:headline " Interesting Blend of Elements  A Dazzling Performance By Anna May Wong";
	schema:reviewBody "With a very interesting blend of elements including a convincing Jazz Age setting effective expressioniststyle photography and a tight story filled with human passion Piccadilly would make for interesting viewing in itself. But it is Anna May Wong's dazzling performance that stands out even above everything else in the movie.Set in the Piccadilly night club the story ostensibly stars Jameson Thomas as the club owner and Gilda Gray as one of the club's star dancers. But it's Wong's character who drives most of the story and indeed as soon as Wong comes on screen it quickly becomes hard to pay much attention to the other characters except insofar as they interact with her and her plans. The rest of the cast is solid and there's nothing to criticize about their performances but they cannot compete with Wong.What makes Wong's performance so stunning is not only her obvious allure but also the way in which she plays the role. She communicates a great deal about her character's thoughts and feelings by the most economical and wellchosen of gestures and movements and by so doing she makes her dominance over the other characters quite convincing. Her little smirks can be devastating and her subtle encouragements can be nearly overwhelming.The story is told with good style making very effective use of lighting and settings to complement the fluid cinematography. The opening sequence is wellconceived both in pulling the viewer into the world of the characters and in setting up the story. This part also includes a brief appearance by Charles Laughton in an amusing role.From there things build up steadily to a melodramatic twistfilled final 10 minutes or so. The climactic series of events is made more effective by the careful buildup and by the way that Wong has made Shosho such a vivid and believable character one who is more than capable of creating strong feelings in the other characters. It all makes Piccadilly well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "An enjoyable film with some great characters and an interesting story. The version I saw has an inappropriate and often irritating score that sounds about forty years too modern and drastically takes away from the flapperage energy and dance scenes. The beginning of the film is tedious choosing to dwell a bit long on setting the scene but once the main characters are introduced and the story begins to unfold it captures and holds your attention. Anna May Wong contributes the film's best performance. She has that rare powerful aura that illuminates the screen like Greta Garbo or Louise Brooks. When her character ShoSho is in a scene you can only focus on her and she carries you away with intensity conveyed by only the merest subtle expression.The other actors were okay but nothing special. The characters of Victor and Mabel presumably popular and adored dancers failed to convince me that they had any charisma whatsoever. ShoSho's scenes with Valentine the club owner who wants to make her a star and his lover are mesmerising showing passion and titillating innuendo. But the really interesting relationship is that of ShoSho with Jim a Chinese fellow who seems to live with her  is he a brother? a lover? it is unclear but he is totally submissive to her and proud and jealous at the same time. She treats him like a dog but they obviously have a close bond and need each other.As a film in general Picadilly is lacking on a few levels but it is completely redeemed by Anna May Wong's presence. I can't give it a high rating overall but I highly recommend it to Anna May Wong fans.".

Right from the start I was instantly impressed with the costumes and settings obviously being a silent film set in the period it was made it felt like I was watching a piece of history like being put in a time machine for a few hours. The look and feel of the film are worth a ten on their own to be honest but in reviewing it I felt I could only give it a good review if it's other elements plot acting etc. were up to scratch and they were too. In the few silent films I've seen the acting has been very stage acting over the top and dramatic so I was expecting to see more hams than I'd see in a butcher but I got some really great performances I was really impressed especially by King Ho Chang who played Jim. Right plot summary then the film is about the Piccadilly Club losing it's main attraction a dancer named Victor and discovering his successor in the club's own scullery. What then follows is a typical love triangle plot between the new dancer Shosho the club owner Valentine and Victor's old dance partner Mabel. As simple as the plot sounds despite being made 77 years ago it manages to not come off clichd which is a remarkable achievement. The fact that it is a silent film I think helped it in my eyes. To be honest if this were made as a talkie I think I would have found it harder to like as the great constant score gave these images a beautiful dreamlike quality and to strip it away for just a few seconds to hear actors speaking dialogue would have certainly destroyed it. Maybe it was just that Piccadilly was the first really decent silent film I've sat down and paid attention to maybe it's that I was in the mood for it or maybe it is just a great film.".

I think the main star of the film is the Cinematography by Werner Brandes. It's simply breathtaking and unbelievable modern. There is a lot of influence from German expressionism and understandably so since Werner Brandes is German but it's much more than that. The shots are quite long for a silent film and the movement of the camera resembles what one would see in films a decade later It even reminded me in many ways of Tarkovsky.

	schema:reviewBody "Anna May Wong may have been one of the most beautiful women in film history. She should have been a huge star but obviously racial prejudices of the time prevented it and Hollywood certainly badly misused her. In this filmmade in England by the great E.A.DuPont she proves that she could act as well as look good. Notice her controlled facial expressions and body movements....they are very low key in a time when acting was often over the top and bordering on hammy.The story concerns the rise of Ms. Wong Shosho as a dancer and inamorata of nightclub owner Valentin Jameson Thomas....much to the distress of Mabel Gilda Gray as the featured act at the Picadilly and also a lover of the owner. Ms. Gray looks fat and frumpy and the line You're too old for him spoken to her by Shosho rings true. Things go from bad to worse and lead to the scene in Shosho's apartment which is the highlight of the film. Ms. Wong is absolutely terrific. Murder happens and the mysterious Jimmy gets involved. The resolution of that murder is unsatisfying and the ensuing trial mirrors the racial stereotypes of the times.But all that aside if you want to see a gloriously stunning woman and a wonderful performance see this film. And by the way.....if you can figure out exactly what the relationship between Shosho and Jimmy is let me know!".

She should have been a huge star but obviously racial prejudices of the time prevented it and Hollywood certainly badly misused her. In this filmmade in England by the great E.A.DuPont she proves that she could act as well as look good. Notice her controlled facial expressions and body movements....they are very low key in a time when acting was often over the top and bordering on hammy.The story concerns the rise of Ms. Wong Shosho as a dancer and inamorata of nightclub owner Valentin Jameson Thomas....much to the distress of Mabel Gilda Gray as the featured act at the Picadilly and also a lover of the owner. Ms. Gray looks fat and frumpy and the line You're too old for him spoken to her by Shosho rings true. Things go from bad to worse and lead to the scene in Shosho's apartment which is the highlight of the film. Ms. Wong is absolutely terrific. Murder happens and the mysterious Jimmy gets involved. The resolution of that murder is unsatisfying and the ensuing trial mirrors the racial stereotypes of the times.But all that aside if you want to see a gloriously stunning woman and a wonderful performance see this film. And by the way.....if you can figure out exactly what the relationship between Shosho and Jimmy is let me know!";

Piccadilly is set in the heart of Jazz Age London which had everything the American Roaring Twenties had without the inconvenience of Prohibition.They were a little more daring across the pond in depicting an interracial romance. Thomas as owner of the nightclub fires half of his club attraction of the dancing team of Mabel and Vic. Vic is played by Cyril Ritchard and he's got a roving eye which distresses Mabel who is Gilda Gray. It distresses Thomas even more who likes Gilda sort of.But when Gray as a solo act doesn't bring in the customers Thomas looks for a replacement and finds it in the slinky sexy sultry Anna May Wong. Wong had previously worked in the scullery at the club and got fired when she did a little impromptu dance entertainment for the staff and a customer complained about a dirty plate. But Thomas and his hormones remembered Wong and they begin an association professional and later personal.This interracial triangle ends real bad with one of them dead and the other on trial for murder.Two prominent people who had great careers in film had small parts. You have to look quick to spot Ray Milland as one of the tuxedoed bits during the nightclub scene. But it's impossible to forget Charles Laughton in his screen debut. He's the diner who complains about the dirty plate he was given spoiling Ritchard and Gray's dance and leading to Thomas's discovery of Wong. Even without Laughton's magnificent speaking voice to aid him watch how he milks that simple scene for all its worth. No doubt this man was going to have a great career.There is one other prominent role of significance that of King Hou Chang as Wong's original boy friend who carries a torch bigger than the one Jameson Thomas has. His performance is quite poignant I'd love to know what happened to him as Piccadilly is only one of two film credits he has.There are some nice shots of London in the Stanley BaldwinRamsay MacDonald era incorporated into the film. Piccadilly holds up reasonably well with a plot quite a bit more mature than the era normally would countenance.".

	schema:headline " Bennett's film";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is Anna May Wong's triumph but it's worth looking at for the qualities and themes that interested Arnold Bennett. There are quite a few Bennett's interest in and relish for ambition success work rising through the class structure material pleasure comes over strongly. Indeed in many ways these are more strongly emphasised than the racial elements. Shosho is just as firmly placed as workingclass as Chinese. When she succeeds she becomes Miss Shosho not Shosho in fact it is only through success that she can become Chinese. When we first see her she is drably and conventionally dressed with laddered stockings and her body and hands are awkwardly carried she lives in a squalid room when she has succeeded she can decorate her flat with Chinoiserie. I would not be surprised if the character of Shosho was not Chinese in the original script but was adapted to suit Anna May Wong. There is only one scene where the racial elements are emphasised where a black man and a white woman are thrown out of a pub for dancing together and the scene's sympathy is with the couple not morality. Equally Shosho's relationship with Jim makes it plain that he is important in her success as well as a strong personality in his own right. Valentine too is shown as someone who has worked for his success the first half hour of the film places him in the club he has made he first encounters Shosho after a complaint from Charles Laughton as the customer from hell which he deals with ruthlessly by firing Shosho from the scullery. Valentine's two sexual relationships are with women he has created. The dancing is disappointing Vic and Mabel are skilled enough but we don't believe they are the toast of London and Shosho's dance is no more convincing as an astonishing and fascinating contrast but if we suspend disbelief here it's worth doing so. The direction is welldone with skilled and delicate touches of characterisation and placing and the camerawork is good with virtuoso flourishes on the dance floor and the film ends with another touch of Bennett sandwichmen carrying placards for a show called Life Goes On past a newspaper with details of Shosho's and Jim's deaths.".

	schema:reviewBody "As others have stated Anna May Wong is the saving grace of this film. Whenever she's not on screen it drags. Jameson Thomas does give a nice performance as nightclub owner Valentine Wilmot. The rest of the actors not so much. The modernsounding music score is distracting in most places and some of the dialogue is horrendous.There's a very suspenseful wellacted scene when Wilmot invites Anna May Wong's character Shosho up to his office to discuss having her dance at his club. While they talk he draws a few caricatures of her on a piece of stationary. Then when Mabel  Wilmot's star dance attraction and erstwhile lover  shows up he crumples up the drawing and throws it away so she won't see it. Mabel spills water from a vase on Wilmot's desk and retrieves the paper from the waste basket using it to soak up the water. Shosho watches this unfold and smirks knowingly as Wilmot tries to hide the drawing from Mabel and keep his growing affection for Shosho a secret. I thought the scene was worthy of Hitchcock and follows his definition of true suspense The audience knows something that a character doesn't.The finale I felt tries to go a long way out of its way to exonerate Mabel a white woman for the murder of Shosho a Chinese woman by making Jim also Chinese guilty so that the film could have a happy white people ending. However logic dictates that Mabel should be guilty of this crime of passion. But then what do you expect from a film that didn't even allow Wilmot and Shosho to kiss on screen because they were of different races even though that was indicative of the time period in which this film was made?".

It saw a Wong retrospective here in NYC's Museum of Modern Art the first biography about Ms. Wong by Graham Russell Gao Hodges AND the rerelease of 1929's Piccadilly shown for the first time in decades. I so enjoyed this film when I saw it on the big screen that year that I decided to have another look at it on this fresh DVD and my how good it does look! A fascinating story of the rise of a young Chinese woman from scullery maid to feature dancer at a posh London nightclub Piccadilly is a good introduction to Ms. Wong's many charms for those who have not had the pleasure before or for those many who enjoyed her work in 1932's Shanghai Express and have found it hard to see her elsewhere. Piccadilly though a late silent somehow feels strangely modern and is beautifully shot and marvelously acted by all. The only disappointment for me regarding this DVD rental was with one of the many extras a panel discussion about Anna May hosted by B. Ruby Rich in 304 at San Francisco's Castro Theatre and including author Hodges AND another legendary Chinese actress Nancy Kwan. The sound quality of this extra was so extremely echoed and garbled that it was impossible for me to decipher more than a few words of what I'm sure was a fascinating discussion. Doesn't anybody do a quality check on these DVDs before they're released? Whotta disappointment indeed!".

I do admire Dupont's use of quick pans tints pointofview shots and other directoral touches. But the script is lame. One example the boss hires a fired dishwasher to be a star attraction without an audition because he remembers seeing her dance briefly on a table. It seems to take forever to get to the few points it is trying to make. Example Before the boss confronts the dishwasher we see him accosting the waiter the chef and other bits of business before a story takes shape.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film at the live premiere of Neil Brand's new jazz score everyone was raving about it but I felt I must be missing something and put it down to the music. Attractive jazz but not especially closely tied in to the action  I've heard Neil Brand do immeasurably better on the piano. Having seen it again I think I've worked out what's wrong and it wasn't the music at all. In fact with hindsight the new score had actually managed to improve the film.The trouble with this picture  apart of course from the handwaving explanation at the ending worthy of Agatha Christie at her most contrived  is its characters. Specifically the reason why I don't warm to this 'classic' for all its technical experimentation and fluid deployment of intertitles is that there are simply no characters whom I actually like andor care about so I find it very hard to get engaged in what happens to them.Mabel is a manipulative drama queen who only got where she is by sleeping with the boss she comes across as so artificial and dislikeable in the early scenes that it is impossible to feel much sympathy for her downfall. Jim the other character who is in some sense a victim of events is largely a background cipher and while his situation is unenviable we don't get enough sense of him as a person let alone of his relationship with Shosho to be able to empathise with his prolonged attempts at strangulation. Victor expertly played by stage dancing star Cyril Ritchard of whom we see too little is clearly a cad while Valentine Wilmot is a predatory middleaged employer. Shosho whom one might expect to be the heroine turns out to be as manipulative bitchy and grasping as Mabel. All in all they are none of them very attractive and the films fails to enlist audience sympathies to follow the fate of any one of them.Perhaps it's childish of me but I find that I need to become exercised over the outcome for the characters in order to find any emotional appeal in a film. Piccadilly I find a strangely unmoving spectacle.On rewatching I also find it hard to see the purpose of the lengthy 'interracial' sequence at the bar other than politics. If the intent is very obliquely to illustrate that it will not be acceptable for Shosho to have a public relationship with a white man then it's odd that this element turns out to be almost completely irrelevant to the events that in fact transpire. The barrier that Shosho has to overcome is that of her workingclass origin rather than her foreign face given the plot as written she could equally well be a little Cockney ballet dancer like Jessie Matthews busy starring at that time in This Year of Grace picked out of the gutter by a wealthy patron as a speciality act to put the established performers' noses out of joint.On reflection I think I'd revise my original vote downwards to 610 worth watching out of curiosity if it turns up but not worth seeking out. But watch for the background period detail!  including the famous Centre of the World sign on the London Pavilion...".

It would be some time before Hitchcock would mature into the master he would eventually become. In the meantime It's very hard for me to explain why Piccadilly is such pure film. First off the The acting is first class and very modern with perhaps Gilda Gray being the weakest link. Cyril Ritchard who would eventually play Peter Pan's Captain Hook on stage and TV Jameson Thomas and King Hou Chang as Jim are all superbly cool! As for Anna May Wong this is probably her finest hour! Her portrayal as a devilishly devious minx again is first class but she's so compelling and visually stunning in this film that's she's iconic! It's also a very cosmopolitan film but more importantly it's a film about London. Here we get a dual glimpse of a modern jazz age night club and an alter ego antediluvian world of Limehouse. I could witter on for hours about the merits and greatness of this film but suffice to say I'll just stop here and say that vision modernity and transcendence are the key to the success of this film and leave you with the words of Sam Spade from the Maltese Falcon that this film is indeed 'the stuff that dreams are made of'.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know who the clothing designer was but Anna May Wong looked simply fabulous as the sinuous Oriental dancer Shosho. It was ironic that Anna had to travel to England to be given a flesh and blood role that allowed her to give an indepth characterization. Of course after this it was back to America where apart from the title role in Daughter of the Dragon it was back to stereo typical Oriental temptress roles  and she even had to compete with Myrna Loy for a time. She was literally given the role of a lifetime in this superb film. Art direction by Alfred Junge has a very decadent 20s Art Nouveau look and the photography by Werner Brandes captures the high society of London's West End This Year of Grace is playing to the seedy cabaret life of my Piccadilly as Valentine says. Director E.A. Dupont can point to this as a career highlight in a mostly unsatisfactory career. Eventually ending up in Hollywood the director of the magnificent Varietie and Atlantic was given directorial assignments of the calibre of Ladies Must Love and even Hell's Kitchen featuring the Dead End Kids. Initially going to Hollywood in 1927 after his triumph with Varietie he left in disappointment after being given a sentimental melodrama to direct. He went to England and set up his own distribution company  World Wide Pictures  Photoplays Made Where the Story's Laid and the first movie made was Moulin Rouge. Even though it was filmed mostly at Elstree it was a great success and for his next movie Dupont turned to an actual locale in London with Piccadilly. The film was based on a novel by Arnold Bennett and the author also supplied his own scenario.Vic and Mabel Cyril Richard and Gilda Gray the top dance act are the talk of the town  so say the patrons of the Piccadilly Club. And what a club with an inhouse orchestra of the DeBroy Somers Band they were one of Britain's premier dance bands of the 20s it was a pity some of their music couldn't have been incorporated into the soundtrack instead of the rather cheesy score. With a curved balcony and arched staircase overlooking a magnificent ballroom the setting is super. Valentine Wilmot Jameson Thomas is the jaded manager is there any other kind???  as one diner says he started the club and he made it!!!An incident involving a dirty plate Charles Laughton has a cameo as a disgruntled customer leads Valentine to the scullery where he discovers Shosho Wong. Her tantalizing dancing on the tabletop distracts the dishwashers from their work so when Victor departs for America hoping to leave the club in the lurch Valentine brings in Shosho as his new dancing star. Mabel who has a secret yen for Valentine is horrified  She can't dance they'll laugh at her  and you!! Of course Shosho is a sensation her shimmering dance leaves the audience spellbound and Mabel distraught as she knows she will no longer be the toast of London!!!Valentine now begins an affair with Shosho  her intended Jim is unhappy he accidentally sees the mascot he gave her a tiny Buddha in Valentine's office  she said she lost it but someone else is not quite pleased about it either!!! The sensational ending is soon yesterday's news as an excited tipster in more concerned with his race winnings than the sordid headlines and as the new variety show says Life Goes On!!!Jameson Thomas was dissatisfied with his career in British movies so went to Hollywood where he was continually cast as a villain or lounge lizard Extravagance It Happened One Night. Gilda Gray had a patchy career  her private life was far more exciting but all her movies gave her a chance to dance the shimmy  the dance she made famous!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Devilishly debonair Valentine Wilmott Jameson Thomas a Ronald Colman type with pencil moustache and oilslick hair is the owner of Piccadilly London's top nightspot at which the glamorouslymonickered dance team of Clive and Mabel Cyrill Ritchard and the reallife queen of the shimmy Gilda Gray are the resident dance team. While Clive and Mabel might look the part they're no Fred and Ginger part of the reason perhaps being that Clive has a major case of the hots for Mabel who only has eyes for suave Valentine. Things turn sour for Mabel however after Clive dissolves the partnership in a huff after she rebuffs his advances once too often and then Valentine starts getting cosy with his new female dancer the sultry ShoSho Anna May Wong. Of course it's only a matter of time before emotions come to the boil.Piccadilly is a movie about sex. It's about the interaction of adults and the consequences of actions taken through selfish motives. While there are no real villains in this piece even though there is a murder nobody comes out of it untarnished by the events that unfold although one character emerges surprisingly unchanged. For all its melodramatic tendencies which are forgivable given the era in which it was made Piccadilly is quite a remarkable film. Presaging film noir by more than a decade German director E. A. Dupont's mobile camera makes wonderful use of light and shadow to illustrate the archetypal noir ambiance created by Arnold Bennett's account of the dark passions at play in the superficial environment of the swish Piccadilly nightclub. The camera sweeps across a limehouse saloon filled with rummies and whores with as much relish as it roams the nightclub crammed with bejewelled ladies in gowns and men in dinner suits. It is this rich canvas of sumptuously captured images that overcomes the shortfalls in acting and storyline to deliver a film that is really better than it ought to be. While there are some nice touches in the script  Wilmott for instance after watching Clive and Mabel's unconvincing dance performance travels from club to kitchen to scullery where he spies ShoSho performing a sultry shimmy on a worktop for the entertainment of her workmates thus linking most of the protganists and depictng their relative social status in one economical and effective sequence  once Bennett has to concentrate on driving the storyline forward he seems too willing to fall back on increasingly melodramatic plot points that must have been clichd even back in '29.Although thirdbilled Anna May Wong is far and away the star of this movie. Looking remarkably contemporary with her bobbed 'Louise Brooks' hair and her clever facial gestures she steals every single scene in which she appears and manages with the help of one of the screenplay's other strong points to present ShoSho as a femme fatale without making her out to be a ruthless schemer on the make. Gilda Gray the star of the piece  although Thomas gets more screentime than both of the ladies  gives a melodramatic performance by comparison. She looks a little like Garbo but that's the only resemblance between them.The BFI DVD comes with an optional fiveminute sound prologue that leaves the viewer thankful they are watching the silent version. The static camera shows Thomas and his coactor speak their lines like CholmondeleyWarner and pal in all those Harry Enfield sketches  evidence indeed that the cinema took a brief but major step backward with the advent of sound.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the kind of film that would have made a great early sound movie. If you get the DVD release you may be somewhat put off by the score  I know I was. There are two major musical numbers in the film and it would have really accentuated them to have the music of the times in the film rather than the modern score that just doesn't seem to fit. Unfortunately British films didn't convert to sound until 1930 so this film remains as a silent musical.It's a very good film that is basically about how life goes on and today's celebrities and scandals are quickly forgotten tomorrow. It also shows the flimsy basis in many cases for being considered talented. The female headliner of the night club is basically there because she is the owner's girlfriend and is being carried to a large degree by her dance partner. When he decides to leave England and try to make it on Broadway the owner knows the score and seeks a novelty to fill in what he has lost. He sees Anna May Wong's character dancing in the night club scullery and fires her for it but later he realizes that maybe an exotic act is what he needs to draw an audience. He rehires her as a dancer. He is captivated by both the girl and her act and at this point the film takes a sharp turn and becomes a bit of a crime drama and mystery.Anna May Wong is probably the only performer most American audiences will recognize with one fleeting exception. At the beginning of the film there is a heavyset customer of the nightclub who is complaining about a dirty dish. That complaining customer is Charles Laughton in a very small and very early role.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is the kind of film that would have made a great early sound movie. If you get the DVD release you may be somewhat put off by the score  I know I was. There are two major musical numbers in the film and it would have really accentuated them to have the music of the times in the film rather than the modern score that just doesn't seem to fit. Unfortunately British films didn't convert to sound until 1930 so this film remains as a silent musical.It's a very good film that is basically about how life goes on and today's celebrities and scandals are quickly forgotten tomorrow.

	schema:reviewBody "There are three reasons to watch Piccadilly a 1929 British silent backstage melodrama. The performance of Anna May Wong is primary. She's a knockout as Shosho a Chinese dishwasher in a posh London nightclub who gets a chance to show how she can dance and then becomes a star. Wong is so charismatic so fine a performer and so confident an actress that you might wonder whatever happened to her. But there's more to Piccadilly than Wong. Perhaps not too much but enough to enjoy the passing parade of dated movie choreography and the moody atmosphere of transplanted German expressionism. The downside is the story...one of those behindthescenes melodramas of entertainers and impresarios stilted and dated filled with tremulous glances suspicious glares clutched hankies and faces turned away. Valentine Wilmot Jameson Thomas owns the Piccadilly Club the poshest of the posh where the sophisticates of London crme de la crme dressed to the nines come to dance and dine and to watch Mabel  Vic London's Greatest Dance Attraction. Wilmot is a tough smooth perfectionist. He made the Piccadilly what it is. He discovered Mabel Greenfield Gilda Gray and made stars out of her and her dance partner Vic Smiles Cyril Ritchard. While he appreciates Mabel's talents his nightclub comes first. Mabel really loves the guy and Vic really loves Mabel. My dear I'm simply mad about you! One night a diner is given a dirty plate. He makes a scene Wilmot is furious and storms into the kitchen and scullery. There he sees Shosho dancing on a table for the other workers when she should have been washing dishes. He fires her. Then he has second thoughts. Shosho has something that the impresario in Wilmot tells him might make a star attraction...exotic sensuous unusual. It's not long before Shosho is a smash. By this time Vic has left Shosho finds it no trouble at all to delightfully snare Wilmot in probably the best scene in the movie and Mabel is jealous. Into this hot stew of fervid emotions a shot rings out scandal ensues a trial is held...justice both criminal and moral is served up. And in that great tradition of melodramatic showbiz...life goes on with a million more stories undoubtedly waiting to be told. The storyline is a slog. Still the big dance number with Mabel  Vic at the start of the movie is a delight of dated style. Mabel and Vic each come prancing down the two grand staircases that bracket the Piccadilly's elegant dance floor he in tails she in a swirling gown and off they go. It's one of those tricky rickyticky fast numbers where elbows and feet fly about complete with winking glances of mischievous fun. It goes on and on with Vic and Mabel each having a chance to shine. Mabel flirts and shows her legs. Vic with slicked back hair seductively grins with the silent nasal charm of Jack Buchanan or Nol Coward. It's the kind of wellmeaning classy dance that Fred Astaire drove a stake through four years later in Flying Down to Rio. However watch this number with affection. It does no harm and at one time held the paying movie customers in thrall. The look of the film is all moody atmosphere. This isn't enough to salvage the movie by itself but it gives Piccadilly a lot of visual class. And then there's Anna May Wong an actress of talent style and screen presence. She's featured in the billing but she dominates the movie. She comes straight through the camera to us sexy and innocent calculating and surprised whose dancing captures us and whose acting tells us here is a woman to pay attention to. As an actress of Chinese descent she hadn't a chance in Hollywood except as a stereotype. In the Twenties she finally left for Europe and had a few star roles in Germany and England but then returned to Hollywood with a contract that seemed to assure her of star Hollywood roles. The contract didn't say major star roles with star male leads. She lost the leads in The Good Earth and Dragon Seed because producers said she looked too Chinese. She had to watch as Luise Rainer and Katherine Hepburn starred both gussied up in some of the oddest Chinese eyelids and makeup Hollywood ever devised. Anna May Wong wound up playing characters with names like Su Lin Lin Ying Lan Ying and in an explosion of Hollywood creativity Lan Ying Lin. I'm not kidding Impact Bombs Over Burma Dangerous to Know and Daughter of Shanghai. Then there was Ling Moy Kim Ling Ahsing Lois Ling and of course Chinese Woman. Daughter of the Dragon Island of Lost Men The Barbara Stanwyck Show Ellery Queen's Penthouse Mystery and Producers' Showcase So put Piccadilly in the DVD player probably with your finger on the fastforward button to watch Mabel  Vic in their big number and most of all to watch a woman who could have been a great star if it hadn't been for Hollywood. The DVD restoration looks much better than one might expect. However you'll probably best enjoy the screen music written for the restoration if you also enjoy the incessant chatter of those golf announcers who can't keep their mouths shut. The music never stops. This is one DVD where it pays to watch the extras before you watch the movie. The audio is not good on Dangerous to Know The Life and Legacy of Anna May Wong but the feature is informative.".

This happened with the German composer Herr Richard Strauss who recomposed and adapted his famous and successful opera Der Rosenkavalier  The Knight Of The Rose  for the screen capturing the spirit of that musical comedy of three acts not to mention that the screenplay was written by Herr Hugo von Hofmannsthal the opera's librettist and last but not least the great German director Herr Robert Wiene directed the film version for the silent screen three German aces in the same silent project certainly.Obviously the German aristocrats prefer to watch  while catching up on their sleep  opera at the Opera House and not in a coarse theatre but it must be admitted that this silent film adaptation provides a good vehicle for lazy and modern youngsters to acquaint themselves with such an elegant musical spectacle.The story While her husband is becoming famous in the war the marshal of Werdenberg's wife consoles herself in the arms of the youngster Octavian and tries to arrange the love affairs of her cousin the baron Ochs by presenting him to young Sophie. This baron is taken with her and the Marschallin proposes Octavian to be his Rosenkavalier in order to present the traditional silver rose to his fiance. But youngsters are youngsters and sex hormones hold sway over the whole world so for that reason immediately Octavian and Sophie fall in love with each other This film adaptation of Der Rosenkavalier is one of the better of grandiose German costume films and Teutonic film operetta. It's an elegant and romantic film beautifully made in artistic terms  excellent and varied set design not to mention obvious soign costumes   technically excellent and wittily made  flashbacks and a Sibylline use of the ellipsis  in order to condense and adapt Herr Strauss' opera original story for the screen. This hard task is very well accomplished summarizing successfully three aristocratic love stories full of love conspiracies and maintaining intact the spirit of the opera on which it was based  it combines the theatrical and cinema virtues very well . It does not depend exclusively on its musical spectacle merits but works as an independent and original film production. The many classic court ceremonies and the elegant atmosphere makes for one of those delicious and decadent German exaggerated operettas that the aristocracy likes so much.Der Rosenkavalier was excellently and recently restored by the GermanFrench TV. Channel ARTE which reconstructed the missing end of the film with some stills and obviously includes the original Herr Strauss film score. The restored silent film was premiered at Dresden  that German city that some badmannered youngsters blew into pieces sometime ago  in the Semperoper that magnificent Semper Opera House in which in the year 1925 Herr Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier made its first stage appearance.And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must dance a waltz and sing an aria at the same time.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com".

Based on this one film the only Murnau comedy I've seen to date Murnau's comedic skills were far less developed than his flair for drama and melodrama. However there are some good points throughout this film.The plot is not especially credible nor especially funny and each chapter of the story is prefaced with an introductory title which except for the climactic one features a long long description of who these people are and what they mean to accomplish.The best performance in the film is given by Alfred Abel. I've seen Abel in a few other comedies and I usually find him stolid and stiff. Here surprisingly he's quite funny as a wealthy eccentric who resorts to various scams and false identities to enrich himself even more. Wearing long sideburns and an unusual makeup in this film Abel looks remarkably like Eddie Foy Junior! Abel also gets the funniest dialogue in the film courtesy of the silent intertitles. When beautiful Mady Christians wants to evade her pursuers Abel deftly makes her look extremely unattractive and then he remarks This is how I expect my wife to look. When she faints at Abel's table in a bistro he suavely asks the waiter for a glass of cognac apparently to revive her ... and then Abel drinks it himself. I anticipated as much but then Abel uses the cognac's lingering fumes to revive her.Although long stretches of this comedy are unfunny nevertheless The Grand Duke's Finances contains the earliest example I've ever encountered of a perennial sight gag that I call the punctuated stampede. We've all seen this gag in dozens of cartoons a mob of figures rush across the screen followed by a pause and then one last little straggler brings up the rear. In this film for no discernible reason a tophatted Abel contrives to send a pack of wolfhounds racing through his own mansion ... with a little dachshund bringing up the rear to punctuate the stampede.In the central role of Don Ramon the TwentySecond Grand Duke of the Mediterranean nation of Abacco Harry Liedtke is only vaguely amusing. Fans of Nosferatu will be intrigued to see Max Schreck's name in the cast list here. Schreck plays one of a quartet of political agitators. He wears a long straggly beard and looks impressively gaunt but has almost nothing to do except for one amusing bit of physical business when a maidservant chases him out of the Grand Duke's castle. A far more impressive and much more physical performance is given by Hans Schaufuss as Schreck's hunchbacked coconspirator. Schaufuss leaps capers goggles at the camera swings from a rope and gives a performance even more athletic than Lon Chaney's Quasimodo.The exterior photography is excellent and I felt a nostalgic twinge during a shot of a tram moving through a city's streets at night. Several sequences were shot on shipboard and I was pleased to see the horizon heaving up and down realistically unlike in so many Hollywood films which feature stationary cameras in shipboard sequences. Near the end there's a funny shot of a woman chasing a man into the distance ... but Leo McCarey would have done it better. Murnau was a great director of dramas but his comedic efforts fall very far short of Ernst Lubitsch's comedies. I'll rate The Grand Duke's Finances 6 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Grand Duke of Abacco  Herr Harry Liedtke  is settled on a Mediterranean island living an altruistic distracted and careful life. In reality he's full of debts but that's a situation that could change thanks to an unexpected sulphur deposit found on his small duchy. The Duke besides his financial problems is threatened by his villainous principal creditor who soon stirs up a plot. The dastardly plans count on some of his malicious subjects. Meanwhile other strange characters become involved in what and in will be a peculiar plot full of financial conspiracies and politics concerning the Grand Duke.Many geniuses in different Arts are also humans. So due to this they have virtues and defects. As it happens sometimes with inhuman aristocrats their major virtues are their defects and minor sins from time to time are revealed. And believed or not such human weakness was suffered also by the great German film director Herr Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau who directed in 1924 a comedy!!.Herr Murnau's only comedy Die Finanzen des Groherzogs it is certainly a rare oeuvre in his magnificent career  although it is possible to appreciate some slight signs of humour in previous films as Schlo Vogeld  others Herr Murnau's early film are not well remembered by this German count...  Die Finanzen des Groherzogs is a unique and special silent comedy piece stretching Herr Murnau's parameters in what certainly is a bizarre film dealing with idealized and romantic subjects developed in a caricaturized way.The story of the film is centered around the financial problems of the Grand Duke of Abacco. Together with the different characters involved in such odd story that Herr Murnau describes in a parallel way until little by little everyone comes together in what it is a special comedy of financial intrigue. It's a peculiar totum revolutum leading to an overelaborated story.After having directed Phantom 1922 from a script written by Frau Thea von Harbou  in turn taken from a dense novel by Herr Gerhard Hauptmann  this time Frau von Harbou and Herr Murnau considered it necessary to select a completely different literary option than the previous one. The choice was a light novel by Herr Frank Heller that in its adaptation to the silent screen has as a result a mixture of folkloric and stereotyped elements with an air of modern serial.The film deals with idle and bankrupt aristocrats a rich duchess angry servants  certainly nothing new under the aristocratic sun  blackmail swindlers and even a Revolution. Everything is filmed in beautiful Yugoslavian places that give to the film an aesthetic aspect paralleling the story of the film in itself. That is to say charming but at the same time irrelevant.. a Herr Murnau divertimento certainly.Die Finanzen des Groherzogs is a transitional experiment an exception in Herr Murnau's superb silent career than in spite of its flaws has interest for any silent fan. It should be watched and considered simply as a weird and peculiar comedy of financial intrigues a decadent passtime ja wohl!.And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must flee from his debts.

	schema:reviewBody "Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau born Plumpe is one of the most known filmmakers maybe the number 2 behind Lang from the glory days of German silent cinema and here we have a film from him that came out in 1924 so it's less than 10 years until this 80minute movie will have its 100th anniversary. Murnau is mostly known for his take on dramatic films with a large number of scary horror elements. But this one here is a completely different film be it in terms of story tone or plot development. Yes there is a scene when some people want to kill somebody else but this is nonetheless a really light movie with a couple somewhat funny moments during its entire runtime. So can Murnau deliver in terms of comedy too? Sadly I must say no. Even for a film that stays easily under the 90minute mark i must say that there just weren't enough entertaining moments and the entire story was not particularly interesting either. This is especially disappointing as the Frank Heller novel this film is based on was adapted by Fritz Lang's longtime collaborator Thea von Harbou. I am not saying this is a bad film and it is probably even better than most comedies from that era not a prolific genre in the 1920s in Germany but by today's standards The Grand Duke's Finances has not aged very well and that's why my final verdict is a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

I will not comment on it further than just to mention it here.The film specifically referenced paintings which is no surprise  Murnau was an art historian. It has been said some directors view film as artists and some as cameramen. Murnau was an artist. This works well and it is added to by the fact the sets were painted with shadows rather than using lights. A similar technique was used in Caligari by Weine's set designers... was this a strictly German invention? Allegedly only half the original film exists today. Yet the part that does exist still makes complete sense. Odd. Also allegedly the antiSemitism is toned down from the book even though the character of Markovitz remains. The book is not available in English so this would be hard to verify. The inclusion of any antiSemitism strikes me as odd though as I believe there were Jews working on the set.While the big name here is director Murnau pay attention to actor Max Schreck better known from Murnau's Nosferatu and notice this script was adapted by Thea von Harbou the wife and creative partner of Fritz Lang.David Kalat's audio commentary is brilliant and he ought to write a book on Murnau though he does play down the role of Oscarwinning cinematographer Karl Freund which is a mistake.".

Thus I cannot help oscillating whether silent films should fall into the latter category or not. This film actually is my second silent film I have watched since a rather long time the previous one is SUNRISE A SONG OF TWO HUMANS 1927 Murnau's work as well of which actually I am deeply fond. The major issue I cannot think highly of silent features is that without the voices from the characters I feel literally detached from the story involved which eventually will elicit some weariness of my attention on the screen if it's a comedy maybe the situation is better as long as all the gags function as expected otherwise if the plot is a tad complex it will lose me quickly. Actually this is exactly what this film has done to me but in a lesser extent I failed to distinguish each and every character no idea which one is the main villain no idea what's the relationship between the professor and the princess Olga just strangers or a couple indeed? Also the Chinese subtitle is lousy and not well acquired what actually happened to the letter what's its importance on earth?. The accompanying piano score overshadows the narrative outright I remember taking a short but comfortable nap with it.The twofaced hue of the film ochre and blackish green could be the product after the film being restored which serves favorably to remind audience be aware of the indooroutdoor milieu have no idea it's an intentional contrivance or something laterdecorated.Overall compared with the utterly earnest SUNRISE the film doesn't impress me too much the basic proof is that as a comedy I didn't generate any laughter from A to Z. Maybe the perversive but intriguing score should take the blame and at least I feel so blessed thanks to the progress of technology which has allowed the motion picture evolving into a more audiencefriendly status as it is now 3D technology is excluded.".

Max Shell was able to give us a glimpse of the woman behind the facade in this breathtaking documentary even though Marlene did not allow their conversations to be filmed a soundrecording is all we get from the 83 year old legend. It is certainly not a flattering portrait. Marlene is rude and impatient and she tells all kinds of lies. But at the end of the documentary there are a few extremely touching moments Her sudden joy when she sings songs from her Berliner Platte the Berlin album a filmclip from her last movie Just a gigolo 1978 and her emotional reaction to the favorite poem of her mother read by the director. When Shell finally breaks her defence mechanism we hear an old and tired woman tired of being perfect for more than six decades. And every time it breaks my heart to think how hard it must have been to keep up the facade that was Marlene Dietrich.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen that much of Marlene Dietrich's work. Not enough to get a comprehensive historical perspective. This film filled in some of the gaps and made me want to seek out more of her movies and to read more about her.Aside from everything else this documentary presented the dynamic between Marlene Dietrich and Maximilian Schell alone made it well worth watching.Schell is obviously a very impressive accomplished and charismatically attractive guy no doubt accustomed to getting his way. Especially with women. But even at the advanced age of 82 Marlene Dietrich not only held her own but prevailed against him.This film makes plain that before she agreed to do this documentary with Schell Dietrich had spelled out her conditions very specifically. But although she made sure that her terms were all there in black and white in the contract Maximillian Schell apparently believed that this contract was just a formality for getting his foot in the door. And he could then draw on his charms those that he had so often used to his advantage to make her drop her conditions to accommodate his vision of the documentary and his path to getting there.But Marlene Dietrich instead handed him a big surprise. Here was one woman who seemed immune to the Maximillian Schell Onslaught. He could not charm her he could not cajole her he could not pressure her he could not jolly her he could not dazzle her with his estimable intelligence and good looks.Dietrich stood firm. She did not appear on camera even though he kept stepping up his insistence that she do so. And at every point along the way she controlled the information. She told him as much as she wanted him to know and no more.And who can blame her. She had spent a lifetime of hard work creating this Marlene Dietrich persona and filling it with substance. It wasn't a mirage. Who was he to think that he had the right now at this point in her life to define her. She had already earned the right to define herself.There are a lot of interesting aspects to this documentary. The give and take between the two of them when she calls Maximilian Schell a prima donna and an amateur are more amusing than harsh. When he walks out on her and she spiritedly takes him to task about his wretched manners is quite funny too.The ending is also quite powerful. As the film proceeds you are left with a sense of Marlene Dietrich as this very pragmatic and practical person who mocks and seems impervious to displays of sentimentality. And yet she grows tearful and emotional when Maximillian Schell recites with her a poem from her childhood. Giving a glimpse into the complexities within.In fact that is what Schell's documentary accomplished IMO. It provided a valuable glimpse into the complexities dualities and contradictions within.".

	schema:headline " A revealing film about the most alluring actress in film history";
	schema:reviewBody "Today I watched a documentary on Marlene Dietrich titled 'Marlene'. It was produced in 1984 and directed by Dietrich's Judgment at Nuremberg costar Maximilian Schell. I don't know how many of you know this but Marlene agreed to do the film only if the director was in compliance with her wish not to be photographed and because of this she does not appear in the film. But her Paris apartment is recreated to give the illusion that the actress is really there. Her voice however is used as the narration through the film which is aided with various clips of her movies concert performances and newsreel footage.To begin with Marlene shows little interest in this whole film  it's obvious  and even less interest in the discussion of her movies  that's sadly even more obvious. I'm convinced now more than ever that she never enjoyed working on a movie. Still it's nice to discover that she is able to remember her experiences with a lot of clarity sometimes using the German word kitsch worthless to describe most of her film work although I may disagree with her on some. Marlene also talks about other things besides her films. Her singing career and personal life are briefly discussed as well as Jean Gabin Ernest Hemingway Josef von Sternberg and her marriage to Rudolph Sieber.It's a strange documentary that you can't help but like. And not everything you would like to hear even if you consider them important in her life is mentioned a whole lot in this such as the war years where Marlene's tireless efforts to entertain the allied troops stationed at the front seemed neglected. I remember hearing Schell saying to Marlene in the beginning of the film that he didn't want this to be a typical ABC from childhood to present interview. Well perhaps it would've worked better had it been that way. Much of it was a mess  not difficult to follow necessarily  just may have been easier on Marlene's temper had there been some kind of order to the whole thing. Maybe.It gets a little heated towards the end of the film. Schell seems to have angered Marlene at one point by pressing her for a comment on one of her movies. I don't know how serious it was after the tape stopped rolling but she evidently wasn't amused. In the end it becomes apparent to the viewer how cranky Dietrich is at this point in her life. You could argue that it might have something to do with her age but I think it has more to do with the fact that she was an incredibly disciplined woman who favored manners and intelligence over such common habits like idle gossip and unpreparedness. In fact her attitude during this film is so overwhelming to the point where it's just sad. She may sound bitter but she's a woman worth listening to regardless. Watching this documentary gives Riva's book even more credibility in my opinion especially in the final years of Dietrich's life where you wonder if all those incidents you read about were true.".

	schema:reviewBody "You won't believe it but the lady is extremely funny Maximilian Schell on Marlene Dietrich September 1982 the Paris apartment of Marlene Dietrich...contracted for 40 hours of talking the 81 yearold movie star at last agreed to take part in the documentary about her phenomenon. Mixed feelings various expectations surprises or disappointments contradictory emotions turn up in viewers of this! Ms Dietrich reluctantly talks to Maximilian Schell the most successful actor of German background in Hollywood. The two know each other thanks to their collaboration in the historic JUDGEMENT OF NUREMBERG 21 years earlier under the direction of Billy Wilder. Both became the expiating conscience for the post war period in motion picture industry. And both Marlene and Maximilian know that. Yet after all these years what pays off is getting to know the legendary movie star and encourage her to talk about MARLENE naturally. At this point she is too modest aging reclusive very much to the point in her answers and too practical to praise her own heyday. Just talk. However it appears that this little may appear too much for a great movie star. If people expect Ms Dietrich to reveal much of herself they had better put aside this illusion. Nevertheless among many of the documentaries MARLENE stands on its own being a must see for her fans. Why? Because of its wonderfully specific style! As a matter of fact all the aspects that have been criticized about the movie are its main pluses. Critical viewers are usually too much closed within the world of 'clear linear presentation.' When something sophisticated comes they tend to misinterpret. Soon we realize that it is not a conventional documentary about a celebrity but an absorbing chain of interaction sometimes contradictory impolite absurd quarrelsome interaction seemingly unendurable for an ordinary 'watcher.' It is all like a puzzle of hardly any information and viewers may easily be confused where the talks lead us. But isn't every human being a sort of puzzle which may only be harmed by 'conventions?' Considering Marlene's undeniably strong personality along with the director Maximilian Schell we try to figure out the personality the phenomenon of the silver screen star who obstinately does not let anyone into her private life which has always been as she puts it 'completely separated from her professional life.' This time she deliberately fails to do what the director says. The fact we do not see their faces but only hear their voices supplies us with inevitable imagination and empathy. To a greater extent we are with Mr. Schell whose pursuits and patience influence us and make us look forward to the climactic encounter with the star's personality. Despite its chaotic moments and highly unconventional style of a documentary the whole puzzle becomes meaningful only with the patience of the director and the patience of the viewers. Therefore MARLENE meets such radical and extreme impressions. Here Ms Dietrich is hardly clear to understand a hardly likable creature who smiles at everyone accepts every view and nods like a politically correct 'parrot' She is not 'exciting' forget it! that is not what she was contracted to be. She is honest about the hard work that the 'snotty kid' inevitably needed for the success she is no dreamer with sentimental 'kitschy' feelings she is not fond of past she is no 'amateur improviser' but a very practical woman who seems to have known the business as hardly anyone has. Most importantly she is herself at the grave of her career and the twilight of her life...still before... revealing to us the timelessly high standards in art and style.That is why Schell's MARLENE being least conventional makes it a documentary she truly deserved paradoxically so reluctant from her side. But let me highlight one more thing that appears of highest importance when you see this documentary. That is Ms Dietrich's striking modesty and practical attitude when she reacts to Schell's 'comments' on her films and certain scenes.Alfred Hitchcock having worked with Marlene Dietrich on his STAGE FRIGHT said a very simple yet an extremely meaning sentence about her She is a professional. Here lies the key to understanding her persona. Although she is sometimes so pretentious while talking to Mr. Schell her ideas are deeply rooted in her very professional attitude. She is not happy about being shown the things she had done. Consider her notes on certain people she had collaborated with in particular Orson Welles Burt Bacharach Fritz Lang and foremost Josef Von Sternberg. Moreover her 'interpretation' of the scenes she had played including the ones in MOROCCO DISHONEST and THE SCARLETT EMPRESS are purely constructive and objective with the healthy distance and criticism. With this true professionalism comes her modesty I was an actress. I made films. Period. Elsewhere she denies her sex appeal and erotic magnetism evoked in certain films. Enigmatic?...Complexed?....Reclusive?....Sad? .......I meant no harm! We meant no harm! Our curiosity has led us all to a dangerous spot to the encounter with melancholy and emotions. Nevertheless Ferdiand Freiligrath's poem allows us all for a genuine tear something all human beings no matter if great cinema stars or simple viewers deserve. A moment of Human Phenomenon for humans who should 'love as long as love they can.' No 'blind idolatry' but a very realistic glimpse of Marlene who had her significant moment in the cinema history and won world acclaim. 810".

One of the most haunting heartbreaking films ever made.Never has there been as deep a glance into any other screen Goddess' life as this.Ironic. The most private iconic of early screen actresses extends her career for nearly sixty years  including live performances around the world unlike say Greta Garbo and culminates in one of the more enigmatic yet fulfilling performances of the century with her voice alone in Marlene. Thanks solely to Maximillian Schell whose genius as a film maker rose to Dietrich's genius as a tart risen to lady and finally to goddess.Maybe. Indeed.";

Yes there are little moments when Dietrich says things that seem to be truthful and seem to actually matter. But there are a very few seconds or minutes of the whole. Much of the film has Schell cajoling and annoying the poor woman.At first you think Dietrich is just posturing and full of herself saying how she isn't interested in digging up her past. But as it goes you realize how right she must be and how appropriate especially with such an up and down life with WWII in the middle of it. But Schell just keeps pushing with his hautiness as if we the viewers appreciate his relentlessness.I did not. It left a terrible taste in my mouth and I for one want to be a dreamer and enjoy both the real woman whatever she was willing to show of her and the star which we know from her movies. This documentary does little for either side of her life. It's mostly about the ambitions of a comparatively small person the director Max Schell.".

I was interested in this one for a bizarre reason I once sat on the New York subway next to someone who had the script of this documentary with him. Being a big fan of Maximilian Schell's I wanted to see it.Schell who appeared with Dietrich in Judgment at Nuremberg was able to convince the actress to do this documentary but she would not permit herself to be shown on camera. She was last seen in the 1978 film Just a Gigolo heavily made up and behind a veil but still looking mighty good to me. But if one reads her daughter's book it's easy to see that as she aged she became a little eccentric. She spent the last 11 years of her life bedridden and allowed very few people to see her.So the famous Dietrich voice supplies a narration of sorts to the glorious film clips clips of her in newsreels and film of her doing her onewoman show. It is all glorious showing how she evolved over the years her excellent acting in films like Judgment at Nuremberg Witness for the Prosecution and Touch of Evil and the incredible charisma and beauty she shared with the audience in her show. At one point Schell offends her and she lays into him. making a remark about him being a Swiss and telling him she'd sat at tables with politicians and dignitaries and no one had ever spoken to her like that. She went on for a while. Schell punctuates her words with images of flying film strips and a whizzing distorted background.She could be abrupt but also emotional as she recites a favorite poem of her mother's. Dietrich talks like she hated making movies didn't do much to get into a role her private life was private. It's hard to say now. One thing that wasn't gone into was her passion for Jean Gabin nor was much of the documentary focused on her war work. Marlene Dietrich was a magical personality an exotic beauty a wonderful actress and a magnificent performer. This documentary gives us plenty of examples of her magic and if you don't appreciate her now you will after seeing this. She was the kind of star we won't see again  androgynous earthy and very much of her time. In her eighties when this was made her attitude is very much like her final words in Touch of Evil What does it matter what you say about people?".

	schema:reviewBody "Marlene Dietrich was notorious for her unwillingness to be seen once she retired. Yet somehow this very secretive actress and singer was convinced by Maximillian Schell to make a documentary. But because she was so secretive she imposed conditions on the film that made making it very very difficultpractically impossible. They were not allowed to show her at any time nor any of the pictures on the walls. And while agreeing to being interviewed it could only be done with a tape recorderforcing the use of lots of irrelevant footage old photos and film clips.Now all this sounds very confusing and difficult for Schell...but it gets worse. As he asks her questions about her old films or her life she keeps responding by saying cranky things like 'I already spoke about that in my book and don't want to talk about it' 'that film is kitsch and I hate it' and other dismissive comments. Despite this Schell tried to engage her throughout the filmmostly to be rebuffed. In fact you learn almost nothing about Marlene other than the fact that she doesn't want you to learn much of anything! It's really a waste of time and fans of this enigmatic actress should just do as she says....READ A BOOK!

	onyx:emotionText "Marlene Dietrich was notorious for her unwillingness to be seen once she retired. Yet somehow this very secretive actress and singer was convinced by Maximillian Schell to make a documentary. But because she was so secretive she imposed conditions on the film that made making it very very difficultpractically impossible. They were not allowed to show her at any time nor any of the pictures on the walls. And while agreeing to being interviewed it could only be done with a tape recorderforcing the use of lots of irrelevant footage old photos and film clips.Now all this sounds very confusing and difficult for Schell...but it gets worse. As he asks her questions about her old films or her life she keeps responding by saying cranky things like 'I already spoke about that in my book and don't want to talk about it' 'that film is kitsch and I hate it' and other dismissive comments. Despite this Schell tried to engage her throughout the filmmostly to be rebuffed. In fact you learn almost nothing about Marlene other than the fact that she doesn't want you to learn much of anything! It's really a waste of time and fans of this enigmatic actress should just do as she says....READ A BOOK! Very disappointing and I have no idea why this film was nominated for an Oscar as there is not category for Most Frustrating Picture! My feeling is that folks who love Marlene Dietrich are best served with their memories and should probably just avoid this strange film.";

Aussies and Kiwis made a great deal of the army that General Wavell was commanding from Cairo. They have always had a reputation as an informal people and it's with a bit of surprise that spit and polish Scots officer Richard Burton is put in charge of a batallion in a forward area of the defense perimeter surrounding Tobruk. The men and Burton don't take to each other too readily but gradually the troops grow to respect Burton as a courageous fighting man.Burton as it happens gets a bit of assistance from an unexpected quarter. His old schoolmaster Robert Newton had immigrated to Australia and enlisted in their army at the start of World War II. When not focusing on the battle sequences The Desert Rats is about the relationship between Burton and Newton. All the rules about army discipline and separation of officers and enlisted men go by the boards here. Burton who's been under a strain like everyone else under siege at Tobruk gets a safety valve in Newton. An old friend from the past a father figure if you will gives Burton someone he can confide his innermost thoughts and fears to. Sad to say the alcoholic Mr. Newton gives a refrained and dignified performance as a middle aged alcoholic schoolmaster. A role he could understand all too well from real life. He complements Burton's performance every step of the way in this film. Look for some good performances from Australian actors Charles Tingwell and Chips Rafferty. Though this is a film about the Allied forces at Tobruk in 1941 and no Americans were officially fighting this is an American production. So these two guys made their American cinema debuts. Tingwell never made another American film but Rafferty came back a few times and his presence makes every film he's in just a bit better.You might recognize Michael Rennie's voice doing the offscreen narration for The Desert Rats. The Desert Rats is a timeless wartime classic about the strain of command at every level of the Armed Services.".

A motley band of commonwealth troops of mixed personalities led by  Captain MacRoberts played by Richard Burton. Through the fire and hell of battling the Desert Fox and his warhardened troops MacRoberts by lifting their spirits and their morale eventually melds his men into a fighting fit group of warriors. Enough said.Although the story has neither the forced authenticity of 'The Longest Day' or the Hollywood panache of 'Where Eagles Dare' I believe it still manages to stand out in a special place on its own. Prior to a host of many other war movies it was the first to concentrate exclusively on the common soldier in the trenches his anxieties for the present and hopes for the future. I also liked the side story of the young captain who is surprised to have under his command a favourite old school master Bartlett played by Robert Newton. It causes some quizzical looks amongst the men especially when he insists on continuing to address the old private as sir. Here the Desert Fox is played with dignity and respect by James Mason. The other german characters are also portrayed benignly perhaps in view of the fact that very few atrocities were committed by Rommel's troops unlike their counterparts in Eastern Europe. History records accurately what eventually happened to Rommel in the aftermath of the plot to assassinate Hitler but here that is all in the near future. I recommend this b  w film to all war movie buffs of this English made genre but if you're looking for 'Saving Private Ryan' perhaps you should give it a miss.".

Of course Hollywood liberties were taken it is a movie not a documentary. The interplay between Richard Burton and Robert Newton was excellent with Newton's performance the proper balance for Burton's sometimes hysterical scenechewing.

The Desert Rats is a very realistic war movie presenting strategies battles action scenes and a great duel between James Mason and Richard Burton.

It's amazing that they used Thompson machine guns instead of MP40's when for the next 30 years everybody from The Man from U.N.C.L.E. to James Bond would use the MP40 all over the place.

Americans are accused and sometimes rightly so of thinking WWII began and ended with America's involvement. But it didn't. The Desert Rats is the story of the Allies last stand in Northern Africa at Tobruk. Rommel and the Nazis would have clear sailing to the important Suez if Tobruk fell. It's up to Capt.

Is The Desert Rats true to history? I'm not a student of history so I wouldn't know. Furthermore I don't really care. To me it's about the entertainment I get from a film and I've always found The Desert Rats entertaining. The authentic looking sets the tremendous ground shaking explosions the plot that focuses on a small band of men and the action sequences are all highlights of the movie for me. Robert Wise's direction and Lucien Ballard's cinematography put the viewer in the middle of the action. You can all but feel the rocks pounding down as each Nazi shell hits. It's very well done.My only complaint about The Desert Rats is in the overall construction. I realize that it's a result of attempting to be historically accurate but history doesn't always put events in the most exciting sequences. The film opens with its best moments. The battle scene between the dugin Aussie's and Rommel's tanks is as exciting and well filmed as I've seen in a war movie. Unfortunately the movie as dictated by history cannot keep up this pace. The ending as the now battlehardened Aussie hold a hill waiting for replacements is anticlimactic.".

Tobruk gets surrounded by German and Italian troops as the Axis tries to take Egypt and the Suez Canal. The British high command order the Australian General Leslie Morshead to hold Tobruk for 2 months to disrupt the German supply lines. Morshead was a clever commander trapping German tanks to make them useless and made his troops fight a tough guerrilla campaign. The main focus of the film is on a British officer 'Tammy' MacRoberts who is given command of a fresh batch of Australian troops including his former school master. He has to train his troops to get them ready for the battle and first the bitter war.The acting isn't that good the Australian accents were awful and it would have been easier if their casted Australian actors. As well their seem to be an American officer with the British and Australians ones I don't know why? What makes the film work is the war scenes. They are well done and you get to feel the action and sweat of battle. The film is also a short tort experience. Also there is an historical inaccuracy the Desert Rats was the name for the 9th Armoured Division of the British Army not the 7th Australian Army. However Rommel did call the army the rats of Tobruk.Personally I would like to see a new film about the war in North Africa because their are many interesting stories and battles from the Battle of ElAlamein the story of Rommel and Montgomery Operation Touch the Birth of the SAS etc... The Siege of Tobruk would also make an interesting story for a modern film.".

On top of that Robert Newton is in his company and Newton was Burton's old schoolmaster now turned into a semicoward.Tobruk at the time was a crummy seaport surrounded by the Afrika Corps. Rommel was dashing all over the place more or less at will except that his attack on Tobruk had failed. Rommel would eventually take Tobruk too but by then the Allies had landed in Rommel's rear and he was now facing two front instead of one. To his further disadvantage the German code had been cracked by the British so they knew when ships with Rommel's supplies were to leave Italy. Few of the supply ships got through to the German and Italian troops in Africa. By El Alamein Rommel was losing twothirds of his supply ships. It was not just an inconvenience. At times the Germans had to drain several tanks and abandon them in order to fuel another. Not knowing the code had been broken the Germans blamed the Italians for blabbing after they were taken prisoner. Rommel distrusted the Italians and their generals one of the more operatic of which Ettore Bastico Rommel nicknamed Bombastico. Anyway Burton is quite good and his support is too including James Mason as Rommel. I admire Burton a lot and it may be heresy to suggest this but I wonder if he was the great actor everyone seemed to think. It was his voice that did it for him. My name is Richard Burton  and I've bean through hell. His Hamlet was misconceived.

Come now MacWooberts I shushpect dzat you alweady know dzah answer. A year earlier he had given us an unimpeachable Rommel in The Desert Fox. Rommel was so humanized that there were objections from the critics. Mason was TOO NICE. So here playing the role a second time he goes back to World War II stereotypes and plays Rommel as formal condescending and sneaky. He listens to Wagner while snapping out orders.This is still a good war flick within the limitations of the genre at the time. The action scenes are exciting. The dialog is crisp and believable mostly. There are some chronological goofs. Planes attacking the German trucks in Africa are TBFs from the Pacific Theater. And the Germans seem to be using American watercooled Browning machine guns. And makeup has failed. The desert rats don't look like desert rats they look like sewer rats  oily and pale. And instead of dust dirt is indicated by a smear of grease on somebody's cheek. It's a retrogressive flag waver that commits an easily avoided sin it doesn't even TRY to capture the majesty of a vast and empty desert.".

I think this is the most honest look at the REAL Newton on film.  The rueful man who clearly understands his inability to stay sober but still has enough control to see his own and everyone else's situation clearly.  He is the kind timorous brilliant failure who in one burst of glory upstages his more successful juniors.  Newton delivers a truly magical performance.James Mason also delivers a balanced and multilayered Rommel.  Of course he practiced playing this brilliant German General in the betterknown film The Desert Fox.Burton comes across as pure ham in The Desert Rats but there IS one scene he has where he is honest and effective.  He explains to Bartlett that the picture of the young woman in his wallet is his wife.  The picture actually IS Burton's wife preElizabeth Taylor.Otherwise although Burton is billed as the star the film belongs to Newton and Mason.  See it for the pleasure of their company.".

	schema:headline " More accurate than most";
	schema:reviewBody "There are more than a few inaccuracies in this movie starting off with the fact that 'The Desert Rats' was  and is  the nickname of the British 7th Armoured Division and comes from their mascot the jerboa. I wouldn't try to comment on the technical points of equipment but on the strategic side the producers did a better job with their research than many other WWII movie makers.The garrison of Tobruk at the start of the siege in April 1941 consisted of 9th Australian Division the 'Rats of Tobruk' not the 'Desert Rats' 18th Australian Brigade and a British Army Tank regiment equipped with infantry tanks. The artillery and anti tank regiments at this stage were all British as the 9th's artillery was still training at Gaza in Palestine.Of Wavell's other forces three infantry divisions were in Greece and one in Ethiopia. 7th Armoured was in Egypt at only around half strength. Several independent regiments were also scattered around the Middle East.Rommel's forces consisted of the Afrika Korps  15th and 21st Panzer armoured Divisions and 90th Light Division  and the Italian forces one armoured division one motorised infantry division and four infantry divisions. This force of around 100000 men was all the High Command would allow him for most of the campaign because of the supply problems.So at the start of the siege the allies were heavily outnumbered just as the movie shows. With so little to hold Egypt Wavell knew his best chance was to deny Rommel the use of the deepwater harbour of Tobruk ninety miles west of the Libyan border. Without it Axis supplies had to come overland from Benghazi over two hundred miles further west. As the movie says he asked for two months. True to his word he launched his counteroffensive in June but it was heavily defeated. It would be another five months before his successor Auchinlek could launch the successful Operation Crusader which relieved the siege in December 1941. By this time only a single Australian battalion the 213th was still in Tobruk. By October the Australians had been on reduced rations for six months and at the insistence of the Australian government they were gradually replaced by British and Free Polish troops.The film is also accurate in the depiction of the final engagement of the siege with 213th holding El Duda just east of Tobruk. Rommel made a final attempt to take Tobruk which he nearly did before withdrawing on 5th December 17 days after the offensive began.The battle scenes are fairly well depicted. The key to defeating Rommel's main attack on 1 May was for the infantry to hold the perimeter allowing the German tanks through onto the antitank guns but stopping the German infantry from following them. Not mentioned in the film two weeks later Wavell launched a minor attack on the Libyan frontier forcing Rommel to move forces east to garrison Sollum Capuzzo and Halfaya. Also not mentioned is the role of the RAF on Malta slowing down Rommel's attempt to build up forces and supplies for a new attack. Of course the main reason he was not able to attack again before the Crusader offensive was the German invasion of Russia on 22 June putting Africa a distant last on the priority list for supplies and reinforcements.Rommel did finally take Tobruk in his Gazala offensive of MayJune 1942 at which time it was held by inexperienced South African troops. This allowed him to advance into Egypt as far as El Alamein where the rest as they say is history. Nevertheless the defence of Tobruk in 1941 was a bright light for the allies at time of general gloom and disaster and well deserving of a film that I consider quite entertaining. Just don't get me started on the 'Aussie' accents of most of the minor characters!".

The artillery and anti tank regiments at this stage were all British as the 9th's artillery was still training at Gaza in Palestine.Of Wavell's other forces three infantry divisions were in Greece and one in Ethiopia. 7th Armoured was in Egypt at only around half strength. Several independent regiments were also scattered around the Middle East.Rommel's forces consisted of the Afrika Korps  15th and 21st Panzer armoured Divisions and 90th Light Division  and the Italian forces one armoured division one motorised infantry division and four infantry divisions. This force of around 100000 men was all the High Command would allow him for most of the campaign because of the supply problems.So at the start of the siege the allies were heavily outnumbered just as the movie shows. With so little to hold Egypt Wavell knew his best chance was to deny Rommel the use of the deepwater harbour of Tobruk ninety miles west of the Libyan border. Without it Axis supplies had to come overland from Benghazi over two hundred miles further west. As the movie says he asked for two months. True to his word he launched his counteroffensive in June but it was heavily defeated. It would be another five months before his successor Auchinlek could launch the successful Operation Crusader which relieved the siege in December 1941. By this time only a single Australian battalion the 213th was still in Tobruk. By October the Australians had been on reduced rations for six months and at the insistence of the Australian government they were gradually replaced by British and Free Polish troops.The film is also accurate in the depiction of the final engagement of the siege with 213th holding El Duda just east of Tobruk. Rommel made a final attempt to take Tobruk which he nearly did before withdrawing on 5th December 17 days after the offensive began.The battle scenes are fairly well depicted. The key to defeating Rommel's main attack on 1 May was for the infantry to hold the perimeter allowing the German tanks through onto the antitank guns but stopping the German infantry from following them. Not mentioned in the film two weeks later Wavell launched a minor attack on the Libyan frontier forcing Rommel to move forces east to garrison Sollum Capuzzo and Halfaya. Also not mentioned is the role of the RAF on Malta slowing down Rommel's attempt to build up forces and supplies for a new attack. Of course the main reason he was not able to attack again before the Crusader offensive was the German invasion of Russia on 22 June putting Africa a distant last on the priority list for supplies and reinforcements.Rommel did finally take Tobruk in his Gazala offensive of MayJune 1942 at which time it was held by inexperienced South African troops. This allowed him to advance into Egypt as far as El Alamein where the rest as they say is history. Nevertheless the defence of Tobruk in 1941 was a bright light for the allies at time of general gloom and disaster and well deserving of a film that I consider quite entertaining. Just don't get me started on the 'Aussie' accents of most of the minor characters!";

	schema:reviewBody "I had the pleasure of watching this intense small movie the other night and what a fine depiction of war and responsibilities of command it indeed is. Burton expresses most eloquently the burden that those who must order attacks and order death face every day. This is a timeless message. The action is gritty and realistic particularly given the time it was made. Not one missed beat. It can also be called cousin to THE DESERT FOX also with James Mason as Rommel a very similar film with a broader and longertime element story. Interestingly both films carry noncredited narration by Michael Rennie. So they are a pair and quite fine together.Next I put TOBRUK into the player the 1967 Universal film with Rock Hudson George Peppard and many others. This epic is entirely different from RATS and the feeling is very much the BIG SCREEN Hollywood film. And yet some things are similar  blown up fuel and ammo dumps. Lotsa trucks and desert. TOBRUK in particular has always had a spectacular explosive ending indeed one of the largest in cinema history in my opinion.Given the comparison THE DESERT RATS is more interesting film certainly the more realistic. It is smaller and touches upon profound subjects and has Richard Burton at his best. You cannot ask for a better evening than the company of this great actor.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the decade following the close of World War 2 there seems to have been a need to document on film every significant allied operation at least every successful one to give every hero a movie they could identify with. A worthy aim but the sheer volume of these pictures meant there was a vast variety in quality and approach.This one was produced at Fox and directed by Robert Wise who had only recently joined the studio after having cut his teeth in the RKO Bunit. During the 40s RKO was making literally the darkest pictures in Hollywood and much of that shadowy style seems to have rubbed off on Wise. He and cinematographer Lucien Ballard who certainly knew a thing or two about shadows having taken his earliest assignments alongside Josef von Sternberg have created a war picture which is not exactly noirish in story but is certainly full noir in looks. The gloomy undefined edges of the interiors give a feeling of entrapment suitable to the situation of the beleaguered troops.There is little opportunity for darkness in a desert but the outdoor scenes also carry on that feel of confinement. The landscape is often obscured by smoke or sandstorms. We see silhouettes that could be friend or foe and glimpse enemies through gun sights. There are few clear shots of the action more often just midshots of the soldiers which make it hard to tell their position in relation to the combat. The impression we get is  quite accurately  that in the heat of battle the ordinary foot soldiers can rarely tell exactly what is going on whether they are winning or losing or how to proceed beyond the execution of the latest order. It was things like this  a bit of lateral thinking to give us a feeling for the protagonist's plight  that Robert Wise was really good at.The postwar period had seen the rise of the UK film industry and unsurprisingly the best British stars were being poached for Hollywood productions. So here we have Richard Burton at his most inappropriately theatrical and unshakeably serious how often have you seen Burton smile? and yet somehow he is very enjoyable to watch. James Mason had gone in a few short years from dashing male leads to slightly sinister middleaged types but he could pull it off and perhaps even enjoyed villainous roles like this a bit. Speaking of enjoying villainous roles what have we here? Robert Newton playing  of all things  an alcoholic exschoolteacher. He always showed some potential in his straight roles but to be honest he is just a bit boring without snarling and eyerolling.The original music is by exDisney intern Leigh Harline he wrote When You Wish upon a Star you know. Actually there isn't very much original music to be heard in the Desert Rats the score being mostly snippets of Waltzing Matilda but there is one interesting point about the music. Take a closer look at that opening credits sequence. At one point you see a soldier with a trumpet pick up the tune. This kind of makes sense  sounding the charge and all that. Then a shot or two later a soldier dives into a shell hole and pops back up playing a clarinet! What is going on there? I actually whizzed the tape back and forth a few times to check if any more of the orchestra appears but sadly they don't. I would have liked to see Richard Burton come on at the end playing a trombone.Anyway enough of that. It's odd in a way that Hollywood put such a lot of energy into honouring the heroes of the recent combat because by and large the veterans themselves stayed away from these pictures. The target audience was more often the younger generation who hadn't been old enough to fight at the time. Grim authenticity was becoming less of a priority and while the Desert Rats is certainly gritty and respectful it does once or twice strain credibility and historical accuracy and the antiwar mood had not yet caught on although this picture is certainly far less gungho than was the norm a few years earlier. The most a war picture really needed to be at this point was entertaining and the Desert Rats is victorious on this front. It is neither deep nor spectacular but it is a good and easy watch for your eightyfive minutes.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the decade following the close of World War 2 there seems to have been a need to document on film every significant allied operation at least every successful one to give every hero a movie they could identify with. A worthy aim but the sheer volume of these pictures meant there was a vast variety in quality and approach.This one was produced at Fox and directed by Robert Wise who had only recently joined the studio after having cut his teeth in the RKO Bunit. During the 40s RKO was making literally the darkest pictures in Hollywood and much of that shadowy style seems to have rubbed off on Wise. He and cinematographer Lucien Ballard who certainly knew a thing or two about shadows having taken his earliest assignments alongside Josef von Sternberg have created a war picture which is not exactly noirish in story but is certainly full noir in looks. The gloomy undefined edges of the interiors give a feeling of entrapment suitable to the situation of the beleaguered troops.There is little opportunity for darkness in a desert but the outdoor scenes also carry on that feel of confinement. The landscape is often obscured by smoke or sandstorms. We see silhouettes that could be friend or foe and glimpse enemies through gun sights. There are few clear shots of the action more often just midshots of the soldiers which make it hard to tell their position in relation to the combat.

As our TV was BW then it fit right in.I just watched it again last night this time on DVD. A very good period film proving that Hollywood's current obsession with overpaid superstars and overwrought CGI special effects is no way to make a decent film.I want to thank Fox for releasing this and several other older films as part of their FOX WAR CLASSICS on DVD where the picture and sound are for the most part excellent and at a reasonable price. Most of these films will never be digitally restored so these budget DVDs are a great way to enjoy them.".
