	schema:headline " A Jolly Good Show";
	schema:reviewBody "J. Arthur Rank's NORTH WEST FRONTIER is a classy British adventure yarn that can stand proudly beside the best efforts that Hollywood could offer. Also known as Flame Over India it was produced in 1959 by Marcel Heilman for the Rank organization and was directed with great gusto by the underrated J. Lee Thomson. No expense was spared on this colourful production. Filmed on actual Indian locations it was photographed in Cinemascope and glowing colour by the late great Geoffrey Unsworth and was adapted from a screenplay by Frank Nugent by Robin Estridge which derived from a story by Patrick Ford. Curiously there is a marked similarity with the narrative of NORTH WEST FRONTIER to that of John Ford's classic 1939 western Stagecoach.Since Patrick Ford was the son of the great director that similarity is hardly surprising. Both stories concern an assorted group of travellers trying to safely reach their respective destinations and running the gauntlet of attacks by hordes of fierce horsemen intent on stopping them. With mostly British players the cast in NORTH WEST FRONTIER had an international mix led by Kenneth More. From Hollywood there's Lauren Bacall from India I.S. Johar and the rest of the personnel was fleshed out with the cream of British character actors such as the brilliant Herbert Lom as a shady newspaperman the delightfully fussy Wilfrid Hyde White as a diplomat Ian Hunter as the British Governor the lovely Ursula Jeans as the Governor's wife and Eugene Deckers as an arms dealer who detests firearms I've never had one of those things in my hands in my life.It is 1905 and the feud is raging in India's Northwest territories between Moslims and Hindus and their British masters. Six year old Hindu Prince Kishen's life is in grave danger. As heir to the Hindu throne the Moslims must annihilate him at all costs and it falls to the British to protect the little prince. After rescuing him from the palace British Captain Scott Kenneth More must now secretly sneak the boy his governess Lauren Bacall plus a motley collection of escapees out of the British Embassy at Hasarbad and make a dash by train to Kolapur three hundred miles away in Delhi. Almost from the moment they begin their journey under the cover of darkness the action never lets up. From then on there are well executed action scenes throughout the picture particularly exciting is the siege of the British compound by Moslim forces with hundreds storming the ramparts. Such scenes are as good if not better than anything Hollywood could conjure up.Performances are excellent from all concerned. Kenneth More  always an appealing actor  gives another personable portrayal just like he did playing legless pilot Douglas Bader in Reach Fot Sky three years earlier. Lauren Bacall though seems a little out of place in a British movie but was obviously cast to give some appeal to the American market She has top billing on the American prints and the publicity. But the standout performance comes from the great Herbert Lom whose real name  you wont believe  happens to be ......wait for it... Herbert Angelo Kuchacevich Ze Schluderpacherm. Ouch! How about that? Thankfully his name in the picture is simply Van Layden. Also of interest is the splendid music score by Russian composer Mischa Spoliansky which boasts some great action cues a nice love theme for the pictures softer moments and to point up the British presence in India good use is made of the rousing Eton Boating Song which is interpolated into the score and in one scene is vocalized by Mr. More.NORTH WEST FRONTIER is the quintessential British adventure story. Its high production values puts it that bit above others of the genre. It's hard to go wrong when you have a well told story well directed beautifully photographed and well played out by a good cast.Yes indeed NORTH WEST FRONTIER is a jolly good show!".

Full of excitement with strong moments of pathos and uncringeworthy moments of sentiment.I have to comment on those who feel this is an imperialist romp. It is far more intelligent than that. The British characters may express imperialist sentiments but Van Leyden is allowed to refute them. That Van Leyden is revealed as the villain does not negate his arguments  he is not presented as a fanatic just as a man on the other side for every bit as good reasons as the British are on theirs. Remember that whatever its setting this film is very much POSTRaj. Scott is also made hopelessly sexist as his character would be while Bacall's character is allowed to refute him. Its a subtle script  and shouldn't be underestimated! Several reviews have referred to I.S.Johar as Gupta. It is a very fine performance. His character may be 'cringing' but forelocktugging hadn't got a colour bar at the time when this movie is set. When roused Gupta is quite ready to stand up to Scott or most anyone else! It is also perfectly apparent that without his skills all on the train are doomed  his comments on the massacre are poignant especially when one recalls that the actor was born in what is now Pakistan. Train massacres were a terrible feature of the partition period with all religious groups suffering terribly.Oh and what a cast. One expects top notch performances from the likes of More Bacall Lom and HydeWhite and we aren't let down. Eugene Deckers is very fine as the cynical arms merchant and Ursula Jeans a child of the Raj herself is a second strong female character to complement Bacall.Oh and it has a happy ending too...".

Puts his own life at risk to save a young Hindu prince's life from Muslim rebels all the while knowing that the kid will be coerced to fight against him should the British not cease the occupation of India. Nevertheless his actions are based on his duty as a soldier and as a compassionate human being.2 Effective portrayal of opposing views  the gullible British lady Mrs. Wyndham commenting that peoples not under the British Empire were uncivilized and the extremely polarized view of the cynical Indian journalist who opposes killing in theory. The movie brings out the sentiments from both sides. Also well done was the scene of a train massacre in showing the courage of Ms Wyatt to walk among the slain and save a young child that was still alive.3 Several thrilling moments and some moments of suspense. The ambushes feel very real.4 The movie was shot in India and it gives a very realistic look  especially the trains and the rural stations. Contrary to what many in the Western Hemisphere believe the movie shows that not all Indians in that time were illiterate Gupta speaks reasonably good English.All in all a great movie.

	schema:headline " A jolly old adventure";
	schema:reviewBody "J. Lee Thompson's enjoyably imperialist if dated adventure appeared from a creative point of view at the most successful period of his variable 40year career. Between 1957 and 1962 he directed such striking films as Woman In A Dressing Gown Ice Cold In Alex and Tiger Bay before concluding a continuous good run with The Guns Of Navarone and Cape Fear. Squeezed between Alex and Navarone North West Frontier aka Flame Over India shows many of the same characteristics of bravery and derringdo  the present film only differing in that it wears its old fashioned politics most conspicuously on its sleeve and sets its adventure amidst the conflicts of an earlier generation that of 1905 in India. A stolid Kenneth More plays Captain Scott charged with escorting a young Indian prince 300 miles to safety through rebel held territory the principal journey of which is aboard a train filled with a compliment of contrasting passengers. There's a feisty American woman Catherine Wyatt Lauren Bacall a suspicious halfcaste called Van Leyden Herbert Lom Bridie a stereotypical British gent Wilfred HydeWhite the arms dealer Peters Eugene Dickers as well as Lady Windham Ursula Jeans. Outside of this circle of principals is the amiably compliant engine driver Gupta played by veteran Asian actordirector I.S. Johar. Johar appeared in relatively few British films but was to pop up again in another British classic a few years down the line Lawrence Of Arabia 1962. It was rare for Asian personalities to appear with any great consequence in British cinema at that time and it is a tribute to Johar that he brings a modicum of dignity to a role otherwise written full of typical obsequiousness.It's the driver who fills the vacuum between the rebellious natives their sympathisers and the humane smugness of the British Half the world mocks us and half the world is only civilised because of us says Lady Windham. Despite his subservience Gupta declines to do more to further his own cause or join in the Hindu Muslim strife fomenting around him Guns for Gupta? Oh no sir... other man has different religion why should Gupta mind? By constantly referring to himself in the third person 'Gupta' assumes a greater significance than a single personality  perhaps even more than Little India the train also carries safely or the fleeing prince Gupta is a symbol of his country a moderate whose survival is paramount if the British are to be justified. As gorgeously photographed by Geoffrey Unsworth the setting in Thompson's film is a dusty treacherous environment the hills and plains home to bloodthirsty rebels ruthless hordes seeking to destroy civilisation. A decade later Unsworth was to work on Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey. In North West Frontier we are confronted with another hostile environment much of which is equally inscrutable to the Europeans who travel through it. As previously noted much of the action takes places in the environs of the train its engine nicknamed 'Victoria' which soon assumes the worthiness of England itself. As Van Leyden acidly observes Our little train is like our little world trundling through space. Surrounded by revolting locals facing a series of physical obstacles to progress the 'little world' has to fall back on itself sustaining itself with bravery and improvisation to some how 'make it'. Like Hauptmann Otto Lutz in Thompson's Ice Cold In Alex of two years before Van Leyden is an outsider brought within the bosom of a small travelling British orientated community. Similarly he provokes an ethical debate that provides the most interesting dialogue of the film. Unlike Hauptmann however he eventually proves a rotten egg  but not without first providing some lines which to the modern ear seem far less threatening and radical than the original writers intended them to be. With ironical relish Van Leyden reads Gibbons' Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire and along the way loses few chances to snipe sarcastically at those around him You think God is only on the side of the British? he jibes See what happens when the British are not around to keep order? all the while arguing that those who oppose them are not children but grown men fighting for the freedom of their own country. Van Leyden is also a key player in many of the most memorable scenes of the film  inncluding the one that most remember as he stands menacingly just behind the young prince who's playing close to the dangerous whirling spokes of a pump wheel.    If Van Leyden eventually oversteps the mark of a reasoned and reasonable response to British occupation then he finds a suitable opponent in Captain Scott. As played by the More the bluff and unimaginative soldier has some explaining to do himself principally to Wyatt who is less than impressed by his rigid adherence to his martial calling. Despite her growing romantic interest in him she is not entirely convinced by his protestation that soldiers are not machines... we're humans like anyone else. Van Leyden's bitter comment on Britishled civil order in mind it is she who leads the most striking sequence in the film as the Empress of India encounters the massacre of the refugees at Bihvandi Pura. In these postRwandan postReverend Jim Jones days the massacred innocents in North West Frontier can still shock if now sickeningly familiar. Thompson's viewers would probably have had to cast their minds back to Second World War atrocities to gain a context and the sight almost jolts matters to radical attention. But this is a jolly old adventure the British can clearly not be implicated in what is a native tragedy wrought by natives and so the audience is not permitted to stay at Massacre Halt too long. By the time the train reaches the end of its journey there's been time to sing the boating song from the Henley Regatta without a trace of irony to outsmart the attacking insurgents and finally see off Van Leyden's dastardly sort. Despite the last minute appearance of caricatured British officer Thompson's film ends aptly enough on a Kipling quote and once again all seems so clear cut and right in the world... some will miss the cynicism of a modern film. Others will revel in it.".

After a stunning opening twenty minutes where barely a line of dialogue is spoken the movie lives up to the old clich of offering a rollercoaster ride of excitement something which is much promised but seldom delivered.Kenneth More is one of my favourite actors and he is wonderful in this. Perhaps his character lacks the neurotic edge that the late Sir John Mills brought to the directors earlier movie 'Ice Cold In Alex' a movie which shares plot elements with this one but instead More brings an air of honest decency to the part. The evocatively named Captain Scott is no superhero but simply an honest man trying to do a difficult job.Lauren Bacall also gives a fine performance in a role which could easily have been the film's weakest link as a token Hollywood 'big name' for the American market. While the likes of Lom and Hyde White fill their roles with practised ease as I. S Gupta steals every scene he is in.At over two hours it is a long movie yet the 129 minutes seem to fly by and I was genuinely sad to bid farewell to the passengers and crew of the 'Empress of India' while the 'Eaton Boating Song' played in my head for day afterwards.".

Kenneth More plays the likeable plucky brit whose stiff upper lip and businesslike approach to solving problems is an example to us all. Lauren Bacall is her usual enchanting self but my highest praise for character acting goes to I S Johar Gupta. He brings copious helpings of humour to the film as an antidote to Lom's dark and sombre broodings. 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "North West Frontier 1959Also known as Flame Over India.For starters you have to ignore that rather boring first few minutes and the awful acting in it including the routine battle scenes quickly thrown at you. It's all set up for the main themes of this movie set in an India still under British control circa 1905. The real historical import of all this is that it's set in that part of India that was largely Muslim and is now modern Pakistan. But part of what happens here is to show the brutality of the Muslims toward the Hindu minority all in an effort for selfdetermination.There are lots of conventions at work hereHollywood ones. Like the train being chased not by American Indians but by rebel Muslims on horseback and they are picked off by the men on the train like well Indians. It's a weird deja vu moment in an otherwise very British film not Hollywood after all.The British are a target here actually to some of the writing as are men in general all from the sharp tongue of Lauren Bacall who is perfectly the strong American woman. Next to her is an understated convincing British soldier played by Kenneth More.This is actually an ambitious movie for all its relative obscurity now. There are harrowing scenes of a city under siege and of a massacre of hundreds of bodies very elaborately staged Bacall walks through the corpses in shot after shot and a sequence high atop a railroad bridge. Of course it's more than politics and warfare and adventure. That is there's the slowly simmering love story and it's not an overly sentimental one. It might seem an odd thing to mention here but the filmingthe photographyis really really good interesting and subtle. It's widescreen color though not Technicolor and the camera refuses to be static even in simple scenes with a group of people chatting on the train. It pans and rolls forward and back with fluid tactile sensitivity. The sets and scenery are wonderfulshot in the deserts of Spain not India except a couple establishing shots with a vintage train car on the old rails. The interior stuff in the cars are partly done in a studio in England with back projection of scenery out the window but it's all very convincing stuff. The cameraman is the underappreciated British cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth who became one of the industry experts at back projection and the revolutionary front projection of 1968he was key to the filming 2001 with Kubrick and its fabulous visuals. He made a whole slew of films in the same sensitive style seen here finally winning Oscars toward the end of his life including Tess posthumously. I'd recommend this film on the photography alone.You might say this is a perfectly realized film and what holds it back for modern audiences is its relative ease and calm and perhaps a history now forgotten. It's a careful film with great nuance. The acting is first rate though some of the characters are types in the same way Ford's Stagecoach played with types caught together in a confined space. This film has its expansive moments for sure but in a way it's a ship of fools situation. What it also lacks is perhaps complexity to the plot which sounds weird with all the complicated sets and filming but there is a linear process of the main group of characters trying to escape to their safety obstacle after obstacle. There are some more archetypal moments straight from an American Western a fight on the roof of the train a woman with a gun to the rescue but it's all part of the excitement. The Stagecoach echo appears in the form of a baby too halfway through.In case you are unsure of the British sentiment embedded here and the foreshadowing of the future that was known at the 1958 filming a decade after the Brits were booted out of India watch the last scene carefully. And remember the train is called Victoria. And check out the photography even on the last gorgeous shot turning and pulling up and back and turning again. Nice stuff!".

The Congress Party was a going concern at that point and was still a vehicle for both Moslem and Hindu to work within.If every single man at arms that the British Empire could command had been stationed in India at any time they could never have ruled such a vast area in land and population. They did it with a lot of collaboration some of it willing some of it a matter of convenience. Very little of what is now India Pakistan and Bangladesh was ruled outright by the British. They worked in collaboration with the various rulers of the many provinces some Hindu some Moslem.In this story a Hindu maharajah's state is being overrun by Moslem rebels. Kenneth More as a British captain is charged with getting the small son out of the kingdom and to safety along with the child's nurse an American played by Lauren Bacall.On a train of one coach More Bacall and the child Gorinda Raja Ross flee the kingdom. Other passengers on the train are arms dealer Eugene Decker newspaper correspondent Herbert Lom the wife of the provincial governor Ursula Jeans and the governor's secretary Wilfrid HydeWhite. The train is driven by Indian actor I.S. Johar and more has a small group of Sepoy troops to help out.The journey to safety is the bulk of the story of Northwest Frontier and on that journey all the people show their character. One of them will betray the others. All of them have flaws of a sort. The British really do believe in Kipling's white man's burden about keeping order among the people of India. To a greater or lesser degree they have a racial prejudice about the place. Only Bacall as an American and an outsider is seemingly free of it.Not to say that most of them aren't a brave bunch because in the crunch most step up to the plate.The story was written by Patrick Ford John's son and others have pointed out that he borrowed liberally from his dad's masterpiece Stagecoach. The final attack on the train by the Moslem rebels is as exciting as that attack by other kinds of Indians in Stagecoach. Kenneth More as the hero of the piece is not the Ringo Kid however. John Wayne was on his own mission when he became part of the Stagecoach ensemble More is a British officer with a mission.The various maharajahs and nawabs were all pensioned off as per the Mountbatten settlement in 1947. I'd like to think the young prince grew up and inherited his kingdom and got pensioned out of it along with a few hundred others of his class. One kingdom missed the settlement that of Kashmir which is today the sore point between India and Pakistan.Director J. Lee Thompson was at the beginning of a great career directing some fine action films. Northwest Frontier is a fine action film and you can learn a great deal about the Indian subcontinent in the viewing of it.".

Charged with bringing the boy safely from a small fortified hill station to the British base at Kalapur 300 miles away Captain Scott will need every bit of his resourcefulness energy ingenuity and pluck. The year is 1905 and Muslim tribes in India's north west territories are rising up against the Hindu princes and their British masters. Young prince Kishan is seen as a symbol of order and justice. If the rebels can kill him there will be uprisings against the British which they may not be able to control. But how to get the prince to Kalapur? The last refugee trains have left and attempting the journey by horseback through enemy territory would be madness. But then Captain Scott remembers there was an old derelict steam locomotive The Empress of India in the train sheds. Could it be put back into service? He calls upon his friend Gupta I. S. Johar who assures him in broken English that his locomotive will not fail Captain Scott and that Gupta himself will run it. In a trice Gupta brings needed maintenance to The Empress and Scott finds himself loading an assorted group of passengers onto the one passenger car. There is Lady Wyndham Ursula Jeans the governor's wife Peters Eugene Deckers an arms dealer whose weapons now most likely arm the rebels Mr. Bridie Wilfred HydeWhite a diplomat and old India hand and Van Layden Herbert Lom a reporter who has no love for the British. Most importantly there is the prince and his American governess Catherine Wyatt Lauren Bacall. On this desperate journey Captain Scott and this group of passengers will encounter massacres the old steam engine's urgent need for water the hard work of replacing rails the tense clamber over a blown bridge with only the rails remaining then the careful driving of the engine across those shifting sagging rails and the mass attacks of Muslims on horseback racing to capture the train and the prince. More troubling Scott discovers that his group harbors a traitor someone determined to either kill the prince or see that the boy is killed. Only the best traditions of British military leadership exemplified by the publicly confident but privately worried Captain Scott plus the vital assistance he receives from a number of the passengers enable North West Frontier to have a happy ending. For Captain Scott the ending is even happier. Not only has he fulfilled his mission it appears that he and Catherine Wyatt will have a future together. This film is a throwback to the classic movies about the British Empire and the quality of the brave men who made the Empire possible. It's all fiction of course but it's greatly entertaining. Films like Drums and The Four Feathers reassured many that the British Empire would always be around and that the men who made it work were...well gentlemen that is dedicated to bringing order opportunity and justice to the natives as only British gentlemen could and who always dressed for dinner. While this movie arrived in the theaters as the underside of empire was becoming known it still tells a cracking good yarn. There is a bit too much exposition in my opinion offering justification for and against the Empire's rule in India and the pro side wins the argument most of the time. It also seemed to me that the villain of the movie is far too easily identified. One final weakness is that the pairing of More and Bacall doesn't really work they have such different personalities that their attraction for each other and their eventually pairing just doesn't strike any sparks for me. Still the movie offers some grand adventures great scenery a journey on a steam train brave derringdo a typically forceful and optimistic performance by Kenneth More and a nice reminder of why adventure stories are so much fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this age of remakes and plundering classics to create mega mall blockbusters here is one film that not only deserves major adventure status all on it's exciting and superb own it is ripe for a 'reimagining' as perhaps an Indiana Jones film. NORTHWEST FRONTIER is a train chase movie something movie audiences love. Always a thrilling and spectacular way to offer a microcosm of a society and analyze it through the behavior of the characters as they weave their way through trouble. Read other comments for the story. With a stellar cast a panavision location of the Indian desert and mountains visually thrilling 'rattly old train in peril' stunts some startling political dramas ambush and shootouts punchups on a speeding carriage and a truly terrifying upsetting 'walk' through the aftermath of a massacre...etc this is the one adventure film of the past 50 years that is both British to its bootstraps and a big screen audience pleaser. It is a crime that the DVD release is NOT in panavision what is wrong with these DVD companies? ...almost as much a social crime that NORTHWEST FRONTIER is not a famous classic of International cinema. If it is on TV anytime of the day or night watch it and be as thrilled as anyone like me who champions it. Sometimes listed as FLAME OF India it was directed by J Lee Thompson who later made the visually thrilling chase adventure BITE THE BULLET in 1975 also with great train scenes ...if NORTHWEST FRONTIER was made in 2006 exactly the same as it appears already it would gross 100 million and be a big fat hit. If you ever get to see the wonderful Republic film from 1953 called FAIR WIND TO JAVA it too is a unappreciated adventure spectacular also a source of 'Indiana Jones antics and a seagoing companion piece to this great train chase.".

With a stellar cast a panavision location of the Indian desert and mountains visually thrilling 'rattly old train in peril' stunts some startling political dramas ambush and shootouts punchups on a speeding carriage and a truly terrifying upsetting 'walk' through the aftermath of a massacre...etc this is the one adventure film of the past 50 years that is both British to its bootstraps and a big screen audience pleaser. It is a crime that the DVD release is NOT in panavision what is wrong with these DVD companies? ...almost as much a social crime that NORTHWEST FRONTIER is not a famous classic of International cinema. If it is on TV anytime of the day or night watch it and be as thrilled as anyone like me who champions it. Sometimes listed as FLAME OF India it was directed by J Lee Thompson who later made the visually thrilling chase adventure BITE THE BULLET in 1975 also with great train scenes ...if NORTHWEST FRONTIER was made in 2006 exactly the same as it appears already it would gross 100 million and be a big fat hit. If you ever get to see the wonderful Republic film from 1953 called FAIR WIND TO JAVA it too is a unappreciated adventure spectacular also a source of 'Indiana Jones antics and a seagoing companion piece to this great train chase.";

It's left to a British Army Captain and a mixed group of other bravehearts to rescue and escape with a young princeling who is the sole survivor of a massacre that includes his family. Their means is an old steam engine and a short train of wagons and carriage. With this they run a blockade and must escape from the 'Northwest Frontier'.Set at the turn of the 20th century Kenneth More is as usual perfectly cast as the thoroughly decent and honourable Brit. He's SecondOfficer Lightoller but on rails instead of the sea. The cast in a shrewd mix of popular characters. Lauren Bacall provides an unlikely American love interest for More as the boyprince's governess it'd never work out!. Wilfred Hydewhite does a great dithery bachelor inclining to oldage. Herbert Lom is a scathing mixedrace reporter and something else besides. Eugene Deckers does well as an arms dealer. Ursula Jeans is the modestly authoritative MemSab with a bottomless Dorothy bag. She's everyone's ideal grannie full of matronly wisdom with an answer to everything in her handbag. I S Johar plays 'Gupta' the Indian engine driver with humorous and sympathetic panache.Along the way there are adventures. But no less entertaining is the spirited dialogue between the passengers each of which has a conflicting or complementary viewpoint as the conversation waxes.Although a tongueincheek adventure movie it doesn't shy away from the darker elements of human nature. These are explored in the intelligent dialogue but exposed in the circumstances too. At one point they encounter an earlier train which has been intercepted by bandits. Everyone aboard has been slaughtered. It is very simply but grimly presented. No needless gore just a sad pensive silence broken by the buzzing flies and caw of vultures. Lom's character isn't the impartial observer he pretends. As a Muslim he sympathises with the insurgents and means to murder the boy himself if he can.As high adventure movies go this is a class act. Easily a match for 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth' or 'The Pride  The Passion'. We get to spend a lot of time with the small ensemble their weaknesses and strengths and nowoutdated foibles as well as their good manners and consideration become very endearing. These are characters we can really care about. And THAT is STORY.The movie is beautifully filmed with great vistas of wilderness and excellent colour. Trainspotters will enjoy the railway details.This is highly recommended family viewing that  like so many of those 50's adventure tales  can stand muster with most anything being produced today.Great actors good script fine views bags of excitement a villain in the party and moral messages. What more do we need from a movie?".

In the 40's and 50's the time when Fanco power was stronger the team who won more Leagues in Spain was Barcelona!!! Real Madrid has won more since Franco died the only place where they could compete without Franco interfering was in Europe competitions and there Real Madrid was the best. Since Real Madrid has been the strongest team in Spain and Europe since then there are other team sympathizers making stories like yours. About the movie is about 5 stories based on real life stories and also they follow the team showing things you don't usually see. Is a very emotional movie with great cinematography and a superb music score I really recommend it to all Soccer Fans.".

	schema:headline " Good movie about the best soccer club in history";
	schema:reviewBody "Real Madrid is the best soccer team in history. It has won 9 times the European Championship 3 of them with the new name of 'Champions League'. Even FIFA named it as the best team of the 20th century.But this film is not about the history of Real Madrid. It's all about feelings. There are 5 short movies inside the movie which are set in different places of the world Senegal New York Tokyo Caracas and of course Madrid. Each one of them tells you a story of people who love Real Madrid and how this feeling is important in their lifes. So we have a young girl in love with Beckham in Tokyo a young woman who wants to play soccer in New York more than anything a little boy in Senegal who loves Real Madrid by his father but has never seen a match and in Madrid a school teacher who discovers what's Real Madrid. The most intriguing story is the Caracas one where one of the characters keeps a great secret. Moreover during the movie we can see the true Real Madrid preparing a soccer match against his biggest enemy in Spain Barcelona and finally the highlights of the match in a very interesting cut with an incredible soundtrack. I'm sure you won't have ever seen highlights like these on TV.The soundtrack is very good with very funny moments as the 'Mazinger Z' theme in the Japanese story and specially the soundtrack during the final match. And of course the Jose Merce's flamenco singer version of the Real Madrid anthem.I think this movie can be seen by anybody and will like to any soccer fan in the world specially Real Madrid's but any other who love soccer . Real Madrid has many of the best players in the world Zidane Ronaldo Raul Beckham Roberto Carlos Casillas and others who have left the team just now but can be seen in the movie Figo Owen etc...I suppose there will be many fans from other teams who hate Real Madrid because they don't understand soccer is only a game to enjoy and be better not to make enemies. You'll read many of these here but you can be sure they won't have even seen the movie. Don't give any importance. See the movie by yourself and if you don't like then say it.Who hasn't seen any of the movies with Pele? Think of this movie as a soccer movie but not about an only player but about a whole team. It's a good movie it's funny it's very well done has a nice soundtrack a great photography and of course Jessica the girl in New York is very pretty. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Goal! probably gave football fans a reason to cheer that there is finally a movie worthy of the sport nevermind the teams that were featured in it. It got the right moments of excitement joy trials and tribulations that most football fans could identify with in players and their clubs. However Real The Movie takes the genre two steps backwards even though you know it's like a congratulatory pat on the back of the club itself.Partly produced by Real Madrid CF Real attempts to weave fictional narratives into a plot which glorifies its players not that it does a good job anyway and also to point to the fact that it is the most successful recognizable football club in the world with fans all over the place able to connect with one another through the club's sporting ambitions.The first narrative is that of a school teacher who arrived in Madrid and staying a stone's throw away from the revered 80000 seater Santiago Bernabu stadium. He's like the chorus trying to sniff out the reasons why Real Madrid permeates through the life of the city and are worshiped by crazed fans.Then there's Tokyo which is hot on the heels of Beckhammania with the story putting focus on the relationship between a teenage couple interrupted by the girl's fixation on Beckham. Relatively short and not much meaning to it. If you dislike Beckham you'll probably puke at the various shots of his mug upclose.Speaking of Beckham there is a narrative thread which copies Bend It Like Beckham having feature a teenage female footballer from New York. We follow the story of Megan a hotshot footballer who suffers a careerthreatening injury. The reason why this plot line is included is to tie it into Ronaldo's comeback from injury. But the execution is weak and we see probably the worst piece of acting from an eyecandy.Perhaps the best story is that set in Senegal. We see upclose how remote villagers experience the events of a football game by having the dad travel on foot for a total of 4 days round trip to watch the game on television and return to the village to recount everything he saw to wideeyed children. This is perhaps the most heartwarming of it all one which demonstrates a father's love for his child.And on a similar premise and the weakest is that set in a Venezulean town about a young boy and a strange old man who happens to be quite a footballer himself. At the end of the day it's nothing much except for a community sitting down together supporting different teams one camp Real Madrid the other camp Barcelona.With of course the expected build up to the huge game of the movie that of archrivals Barcelona of course. However this is no Goal! with fictional figures inserted into the game. Rather it's like watching a rerun of the season 0405 game on a large screen with dramatic moments only which they won naturally 42.The separate narratives are well separate. Which makes it seem like little short stories stuck together. Though there are some redeeming features like the little nugget of facts done Hitchhiker's style and a behindthescenes look at how the large club prepares itself for games with its meticulous planning. For those who have not been to the stadium we're also granted a sneak peak into the high tech locale but unlike Goal! we didn't see the entire dressing room.In case you're wondering if this review is biased as I'm an Arsenal fan no. If you don't believe me don't tell me that you've wasted time and money watching this. If anything this movie is suitable only for Real Madrid fans only not football fans in general.And for that I'd wish the Gunners win the home and away legs of the Champions League against the Galacticos come FebMarch. Go Gunners! And hang in there for the sequel to Goal! set in erm Real Madrid.".

This is a well puttogether ensemble piece. I'd tracked it down having been encouraged by the largely positive IMDb reviews but mainly because of the Silke Hornillos Klein Rule Buy Anything She is In that dates back to Julio Medem's wonderful Philip K. Dickian Tierra. Purely from the perspective of The Silke Rule this film could almost have been seen as a disappointment since although her character Maria is top billed all of the characters are extremely well balanced and no one is really the lead. Every part is so well written and so well acted however that the viewer comes out ahead. In fact the primary PoV is 8 year old Jess played by Omar Muoz and he is wonderful despite my normal antipathy towards child actors. I can't alas say much more without revealing too much.If you've read the other reviews you already know that the primary situation appears to be similar to 28 days et al. This MAY actually be correct  if you prefer clear pat explanations from a film rather than have it ask as may questions as it answers leaving you with a delicious sense of cognitive dissonance then go watch something else. However I've never seen that ultrastandard plot trope handled THIS way or combined with THAT. Run don't walk to get La Hora Fra if you admire and enjoy originality a continual sense of surprise and a refusal on the part of the creators to spell everything out if like me you prefer leaving the experience of a film with a deep sense of unease and the feeling that you have a lot of thinking to do especially about what that final shot meant.

	schema:reviewBody "The tone and setting of The Cold Hour will instantly remind you of such genre milestones as George Romero's Day of the Dead Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later and Ridley Scott's Alien but in his directorial debut Elio Quiroga nevertheless manages to develop a very personal and unique atmosphere. This is more than just postapocalyptic survival horror it's a truly courageous drama that gathers relatively many characters in a very limited number of locations. And even though The Cold Hour introduces no less than TWO different types of hostile monsters the battles against them are only secondary to the character drawings and the often complex relationships  vulnerable understanding between the 9 members of the underground community. The events that put them in this precarious situation are never properly explained but the protagonists presumably are survivors of a devastating nuclear war that made it nearly impossible to live on the surface. Chemical warfare turned the majority of the population into contagious zombies the Strangers that wander around the surface and simply touching them is enough to transform into one yourself. Still the bravest leaders of the group occasionally have to leave their underground lair in search for food and medication. The Invisibles form another and even greater danger as they're ghosts that hunt once a day  during the titular cold hour  and spread frosty terror. There are a lot of things going on in The Cold Hour but there's very little on screen action or bloodshed. Still the film doesn't feature a single boring moment as Elio Quiroga puts the emphasis on slowly brooding fear and desperation. You quickly develop sympathy  compassion for the identifiable characters and hope that at least some of them make it out of the adventure alive but you also realize their chances are extremely slim and as good as hopeless. The Cold Hour ends with a dare I say it ... brilliant shot that suddenly and completely unanticipated alters everything you think you figured out about the story up until then! Regardless of what your personal opinion is on this shocking twist either brilliant or disappointing it definitely clarifies a lot and answers several questions that bothered you during the film. The film is beautifully photographed with sober and depressing images of the survivor's pitiable living conditions and the music is often enchanting. The cast is excellent mainly featuring unknown but professional Spanish players and even the childactors were great. Elio Quiroga is currently traveling around the world to proudly present his film at several festivals so if there's one near you don't hesitate to see it in the theater. It's one of those films of which the emotional impact is even larger if you catch it on a big screen. Recommended!".

When the menace of The Invisibles affects the safety of the group of survivors they need to reach the surface.La Hora Fra is a great lowbudget movie showing a pessimist view of the fate of mankind after a nuclear war. The atmosphere is melancholic and claustrophobic and the story discloses the characters through the innocent eyes of an eight years old boy. I expected to find an explanation to their biblical names but the film never clarifies. The story recalls The Omega Man Day of the Dead and 28 Days Later... but is original and supported by a great cast that transmits fear panic and lack of hope to the viewer and by an excellent cinematography using gloomy colors. I was a little disappointed with the ambiguous conclusion and I understand that Pedro was right and the group was part of an experiment but I am not sure if this was the intention of the writer. I believe the director Elio Quiroga failed since he was not able to express his real intention in the last scene. Probably due to commercial reasons the Brazilian title does not correspond to the original Spanish title as usual. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Hora Negra The Dark Hour".

	onyx:emotionText "The eight years boy Jess Omar Muoz has been living in a crumbling underground facility since he was born with eight survivors of an apocalyptical war the leader Maria Silke and her lover Pablo Julio Perilln the gays Lucas Pablo Scola and Mateo Sergio Villanueva the astronomer Magdalena Carola Manzanares and the teenager Ana Nadia de Santiago the soldier Pedro Jorge Casalduero and the lonely Judas Pepo Oliva. They are permanently is state of surveillance threatened by the contaminated mutants The Strangers and once a day they have to lock themselves in their rooms without heating to protect against the dangerous ghosts The Invisibles that attack in the Cold Hour. They cannot go to the surface destroyed by a nuclear war. When they need supplies medications and ammunitions they organize expeditions to a store. When the menace of The Invisibles affects the safety of the group of survivors they need to reach the surface.La Hora Fra is a great lowbudget movie showing a pessimist view of the fate of mankind after a nuclear war. The atmosphere is melancholic and claustrophobic and the story discloses the characters through the innocent eyes of an eight years old boy. I expected to find an explanation to their biblical names but the film never clarifies. The story recalls The Omega Man Day of the Dead and 28 Days Later... but is original and supported by a great cast that transmits fear panic and lack of hope to the viewer and by an excellent cinematography using gloomy colors. I was a little disappointed with the ambiguous conclusion and I understand that Pedro was right and the group was part of an experiment but I am not sure if this was the intention of the writer. I believe the director Elio Quiroga failed since he was not able to express his real intention in the last scene. Probably due to commercial reasons the Brazilian title does not correspond to the original Spanish title as usual. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Hora Negra The Dark Hour";

La Hora Fria or The cold hour weaves a fantastic story  about a group of eight people searching for whatever thing necessary for his survival . As they live isolated in crumbling installations  the group is finely performed by Silke  Julio Perian  Omar Muoz and special mention for veteran Pepo Oliva as a lonely old man . This scary  bizarre film contains tension  thriller drama  mystery  plot twists and shocks  including decent scares with tense terror sequences especially in its final part  in a creepy as well as amazing denouement . A low budget Spanish production with a timeline that spans through a few days  it is a thriller that begins introducing the varied characters and goes on through until a surprising final . La Hora Fria suffers from some sputtering about a quarter of the way in  the sputtering came from an unique scenario away from spectacular set pieces and toward a very sad story line  one which suffers from some slowmoving scenes and claustrophobic atmosphere . Interesting screenplay by the same director revolving the mental disintegration of a diverse group and the various amazing surprises they find . The motion picture is pretty well  although sometimes deliberate pacing and packs a lot of turns  however is entertaining for continuous suspense and intriguing as well as shady atmosphere . The picture is thrilling and some moment brilliant and the players are quite reliable . Ghastly movie builds taut by showing virtually well staged set pieces  appropriately sinister settings  enjoyable soundtrack and gloomy cinematography . Few disagree that the film is professionally mounted  the performances solid  and that it respectfully carries on the tradition and borrowing several elements of Spanish horror films . Furthermore  La Hora Fria takes parts here and there from known films such as Omega man Dark city  28 weeks later  day of the dead  among others . Rousing as well as disturbing musical score by Alfons Conde  a good composer expert on dark atmospheres such as he proved in Blind Alley or El Callejon  Viento En Contra Abandoned and Nodoor The Haunting the latter also directed by Quiroga . Adequate cinematography by Angel Fernndez who creates an unique atmosphere  he's Pedro Almodovar's regular cameraman  as he photographed What Have I Done to Deserve This?  Matador La Ley Del Deseo . This is a motion picture displaying genuine chills  suspense mystery and dark atmosphere and twisted finale  being skillfully proceeded by Elio Quiroga and turned out to one of the most unusual Spanish thrilling movies of 2006 and certainly one of the most unsettling . Quiroga is a good director and writer known for Fotos  Nodo and this his most successful film  La Hora Fria  he also directed shorts and documentary .".

Did the writer take his inspiration from the World of the  Ufo Alien involvement and human experimentation D.U.M.B.S Nibiru or was this just a straight End of the World flick ? There are even strong overtones of Orwellian 'Big Brother' War propaganda films and the World of the Conspiracy Theorist. By the way as an aside remark  what a great Poster that end scene would make. Was the War not between different country's but between us and an alien race the Invisibles ??? so many questions! A Great film though my reason for a 9 and not a 10 is that I thought the 'Strangers' zombies ? !!! inclusion was just not necessary and the film could have had less of the daily living scenes and more in a nature of explanatory elements.".

There's no doubt that there is a quirky Euro feel at work here but it isn't enough to save a very weak script and poor direction. Elio Quiroga probably did not have much budget to work with but his use of the environment is unbearably bland compared to filmmakers that preceded him. And there is no doubt that had this movie been produced and shot in the US with American actors the rating would be much lower.Some reviews have praised the actors on display when they are in fact terrible. Not that they are entirely to blame because the script itself is ladden with clichs and has a raw immature feel to it. All the characters are essentially cardboard stereotypes defined by their function or simply and dumbly by their demographic. Here's the scientist the soldier the kid the old loner and oh the homosexual. Talk about poor writing there. The film starts abruptly and then unfolds slowly and as an audience you expect you will gradually understand the stakes here what these survivors are hiding from. There are various threats to their survival but none make any sense and eventually you figure out that what you thought would be explained is really just poor writing. Where the film shines however is with its quirky style of aesthetics. There's definitely a strong Euro flavor to the way this movie was shot and there's also a lovely vibe of the old cold war scifi going. In this sense director Quiroga is like a poor man's Terry Gilliam.While La Hora Fria touches upon several genres drama scifi horror action it unfortunately fails to excel at even one of those and ends up being a major disappointment. The big reveal at the end just can't save this movie. Very disappointed at the rating. I guess IMDb viewers are traditionally more lenient when rating bmovies that are foreign.".

At first the viewer perhaps believes the relationship between the mother and Luca to be that of one of mother and daughter but gradually it becomes clear that Luca is in fact the wife of political prisoner Janos the favourite son of the dying mother and has the objective of sustaining the life of her husband's mother with tales of his burgeoning prosperity in the US in the ultimately forlorn hope that he will be released before she dies.By minimising the appearance of the authorities to just that which is required by the narrative Makk allows us to concentrate on the minute detail of love loss and recovery. I found the eventual encounter of the couple to have been handled perfectly in its mix of the banal and the passionate.This film is held in high regard by many but especially those who suffered under communism and rightly so. I almost deducted one point because I think the flashbacks could have been held a tad longer but I think that would have been a bit churlish of me.".

The movie is ninety minutes long and so is the story.Walken orders Depp to kill a woman the governor of California Marsha Mason and to persuade him he and some others kidnap his little daughter. He is given a gun by Walken. He has ninety minutes to do so and we see that ninety minutes. My problem with this movie is the Walken character. Although he is enjoyable to watch he pops up everywhere only to serve the plot and make things harder for Depp. Help comes from Huey Charles S. Dutton how I will not reveal but his qualities and handicaps are only there to serve the plot again. There are some clever moments I liked them but I kept wondering things.Pretty early in the movie we learn that almost everybody is in the conspiracy to kill the woman including members of the security. There must have been an easier way to kill this woman when security is on your side. I kept thinking about that spoiling parts of the movie for me. Still if you like Depp or Walken you might enjoy this since both are on screen almost the entire time.".

However if you can put your brain on hold for 90 minutes you'll enjoy the movie. The only annoying part for me was the typical Liberal bias in here where the Liberal politician is the target of a Conservative fanatic. They never show you the other way around. At least the writers here were somewhat subtle.As interesting the characters as Johnny Depp usually plays the two villains in here were more fun to watch than him. Christopher Walken and Roma Maffia were riveting as the killers. Depp actually played a normal person which is not normal for him.The suspense was so good I could hardly watch parts of this. That was the best part of the movie. The worst may have been the sooverplayed clich of the killers hesitating before shooting and then because of that being shot themselves. That is so tiresome. Or sometimes the crooks talk instead of shoot and then are shot. It's one of critic Robert Ebert's biggest pet peeves and I agree with him. It's another reason this film got low grades by most critics. However this real time movie trying to get the viewer even more involved is guaranteed if you've never seen it to give you an entertaining hourandahalf.".

	schema:reviewBody "The consistent struggle for originality in the genre of action thrillers has lead to certain less than outstanding premises being lauded as innovative  Nick of Time being a perfect example. While the premise of an everyman being blackmailed into murder to prevent his daughter's murder is undeniably a clever one showing glimmers of Hitchcock it was hardly an instant meal ticket to a successful film. In the hands of a sturdy capable filmmaker and boasting a taut terse script Nick of Time might have evolved into a nail biting masterpiece of tension but as it is the results fall disappointingly short of initial expectations. While the idea of the film's plot unfolding in real time is intriguing despite its concise hour and a half length the film still feels overlong as if it is pushing its slight concept over too extended a period leading to many repetitions or slack moments as opposed to the taut gripping thriller it intended to be. Director John Badham name related puns were just bound to surface given the quality of his work here appears uncomfortable with the notion of an intense claustrophobic thriller and continually inundates the film with long shots as if attempting to broaden its scope  the result being an expansive laxity of the tension which was ultimately necessary to make the film a success. Similarly despite its thriller classification the action in the film is restricted to only two brief setpieces one being an ill advised dream sequence suggesting its being primarily fuelled by suspense and emotional tension  however apart from the odd patch of effectively generated tension the film is so poorly executed on these fronts that it is often simply a lackluster or simply uninteresting watch falling short of expectations that were never terribly high to begin with. The paltry often laughable script offers nothing more than poor lines a mostly entirely absent sense of palpable tension and frequent absurdly inexplicable character motivations seeing as Walken's character oversees the pending murder so closely why not simply do the job himself? leading to plot twists which make little sense. Even the initially appealing premise reveals itself to be a thinly thought out one complete with dollops of plot holes too large to be swallowed up by the pithy enjoyment factor. While some peculiar cinematography adds a mildly unique quality to the film the ever so subtle recurring visual motif of clocks or watches serves to slow the film down rather than amp up the tension.Despite being deprived a venue for his usual lunacies Johnny Depp does what he can with the role of a harried everyman blackmailed into an assassination plot exuding enough charisma to keep the thin premise afloat. Christopher Walken has a great deal more fun oozing wild eyed menace as the mysterious captor coercing Depp into murder and delivering the only really noteworthy performance of the film. Charles S. Dutton is amusing as a jovial shoe shiner swept into the midst though his character's offbeat humour more often than not seems out of place considering his grim surroundings. Roma Maffia puts a slightly inventive spin on the archetypal hostage captor but Marsha Mason gives an embarrassingly melodramatic rendition of the threatened senatorial candidate Depp's target. Similarly Courtney Chase fulfils just about every irritating little girl clich in the book as Depp's kidnapped daughter doing little to sympathise the character in the audience's eyes. While the film can hardly be described as anywhere near as downright despicable as it might have become disappointing is indeed the word of choice as a decently intriguing premise is overwhelmed by inattentive lacklustre directing and lazy screen writing generating hardly a scrap of tension in a film intended to thrive on it. While the odd sliver of enjoyment can frequently be extracted from the experience most would be well advised to avoid Nick of Time apart from those willing to tolerate its glaring inadequacies. 510".

Conspirators kidnap everyman Johnny Depp's daughter and blackmail him into murdering a politician.Unfortunately the movie commits a few serious blunders. First as magnetic a presence as Walken is villains in these scenarios are best used as ominous vague threats in the background. Here Depp keeps bumping into a grimacing threatspouting Walken every two minutes so any sense of menace fades and the story takes a farcical turn. Second when it becomes apparent everyone is involved in the conspiracy suspension of disbelief shatters into tiny pieces. Why introduce such an erratic element in your plan when you have this kind of complete control over the situation? The movie reaches its nadir with an incredibly clichd dream sequence halfway through but even the rest is far from stellar. Hitchcock this ain't.510".

So they were at the airport looking for a likely candidate when they happened upon Gene Watson Depp an accountant and his young daughter Lynn. Holding Lynn in a van Mr. Smith looks silly to me following Gene around telling him you have to do it you have to shoot her. This is where I considered that turning it off might be the best choice.

I would have shot Mr. Smith the first chance I got then take my chances. Anyway Gene eventually recruits the shoe shine man Huey Charles Dutton who eventually storms the van outside to disarm the lady and free the child. In a funny scene leading up to that Huey pretends to be deaf and overhears Mr. Smith and Gene talking about the job which convinces him Gene's story is valid.

Yet the setup for this derivative plot is completely ludicrous with unintentional laughter and shameless holes in the script mitigating any hope for suspense. 12 from ";

	schema:reviewBody "Nick Of Time is only worth watching if you are a die hard fan of Johnny Depp andor Christopher Walken. In my opinion both these actors are highly overrated and their respective performances in this film is not close to either's best.Depp's character who seems tough and smart at the beginning of the film quickly becomes stupid and weak. I guess we are to believe that because of his situation he cannot think clearly. His daughter is kidnapped by Walken who tells him that he must kill a politician in order for her to live. Depp has numerous opportunities to save his daughter and take out Walken but doesn't do so. You just want to smack Depp after a while for his stupidity. Walken...well...plays Walken as he always does. Personally I feel this guy is riding on the success of The Deer Hunter I've never seen him give another decent performance besides that movie. He plays the same part over and over again. A weird bad guy. Walken is a gimmick that Hollywood uses stick him in any movie as a weird guy usually a weird bad guy  and you might get a few laughs from loyal weirdguy loving fans.In my opinion you will not enjoy this film unless you are a fan who is loyal to either Depp or Walken period. Rating 3 of 10 stars.".

I am not a sex addict but still connected with both Fassbender and Mulligan. I found the development both subtle and extremely realistic. Does everything need to always have that Hollywood ending? Should everything get wrapped up nicely and leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling when you walk out of the theater? I definitely don't think so. Anybody who does need that probably shouldn't watch any Steve McQueen films. Anyone who can appreciate a raw subtle and beautifully made film should go watch Shame.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shame the real feel bad movie of the year is only McQueen's second feature film to date. His first film Hunger focused on a man who made his life very public when he went on a hunger strike during the 1981 Irish Hunger Strikes. In Shame McQueen dissects the very personal and often shocking sexual addiction of Brandon Sullivan Michael Fassbender. Brandon is a well off business man. He has an apartment in New York where he leads a seemingly good life but hides a dark secret that is on the verge of destroying him. His sex addiction has gone out of control. To make this even more difficult his sister drops in unexpected and crashes at his place played by Carey Mulligan. Her lifestyle begins to interfere with his addiction forcing him to take drastic measures.Every waking moment is spent towards achieving one goal orgasm. We see him smile laugh engage socially but when he is alone he is focused like a junkie going through the routine of drug addiction. Brandon's tools aren't lighters spoons and rubber ties. He uses prostitutes Internet pornography magazines or his imagination. Even at work his mind wanders off either at a passing coworker or something he has looked up on his computer. This is far from a private matter. His addiction is slipping into the open and he knows it. We assume he is aware of his problem. At the beginning of the film we see Brandon lying naked in bed the sheet pulled over his private area. He lies motionless only staring at the ceiling above breathing in and out as if he knows that today is going to be a long day. We know he's not thinking about work. He has one thing and one thing only. Sex.Most people associate sex with pleasure. I'm sure Brandon has at one time or another had a pleasurable experience during intercourse but he is long past that stage. During a scene on the subway he spots a woman. She's an attractive woman. She's alone. Vulnerable. She eyes Brandon staring back at her. The two have chemistry. In silence they are mentally engaging each other. His stare never wavers he just scans her up and down. Suddenly her face changes. She gets up showing the audience her wedding band. We can feel her shame for flirting with Brandon. He gets up and stands behind her. He follows her out of the train only to lose her in the crowd. His disappointment isn't so much in relation to not getting to know her but that he will have to continue his search for sex elsewhere.Brandon is a tragic character. His only connection with people is linked with sex. How will this person help or interfere with me reaching my goal of orgasm? Brandon's limit's knows no bounds. Fassbender who also appeared in McQueen's Hunger gives a fascinating performance. It is fearless both in the sense that it is a physically challenging role and that he accomplishes the role with such honesty. He could have played it like some debonair businessman just looking to score. Fassbender knows that his character is truly disturbed. He knows that if people found out about his condition he would be ostracized. He also knows that he needs help and won't get it. All of these factors come into play and create an incredible performance. Much like Gosling pulled off in Drive Fassbender uses his eyes and body language to express how he feels.Pain is a word often associated with addiction. We see videos of addicts going through withdrawals in health class. They kick scream shake vomit. Evidence of a sickness in the body. Fassbender's character also shows great pain and uneasiness. During times of sheer euphoria at least for a normal person Fassbender gives us pain and suffering. He can't help what he's doing but he needs it to stay normal.Along with Fassbender is Mulligan another one of today's rising stars. Her character is rebellious dependent and loving. She wants nothing more than to find someone to care for her and to spend time with her brother. Her brother is too involved with his addiction and her taste in men and willingness to fall in love with them brings her down even more. She plays a girl on the edge of a breakdown and really shines on screen. Like Fassbender she gives her all for the role exposing her true colors.In just two films McQueen has established himself as a major player in the art house scene. Both films are festival favorites with critical praise but the general public isn't ready for his heavy storytelling. With hope and some financial backing he will continue to make the films he wants to make and hopefully garner enough praise here in the states to win over more of the public. It's going to be hard if he keeps getting NC17 ratings.".

	schema:headline " An expertly crafted and shocking film that will divide audiences";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite having never seen Steve McQueen's Hunger the smouldering and sensational acclaim for Shame was simply unreal. Having heard terrific things about the film I ventured out and snagged a last minute ticket to the premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Weeks later I am still trying to decipher what may be one of the most shocking and raw films I have seen in quite some time.The titular Shame in question is what Brandon Michael Fassbender a posh yuppie living in New York City must live with every day. He is a sex addict and his addiction knows no bounds. His estranged sister Sissy Carey Mulligan has also just dropped by his apartment for an extended stay making things all the worse.The plot may not sound like much because there really is not all that much to it storywise. Shame is more of a portrait of a man struggling with his inner demons than it is anything else. There is a story at its very core but the primary focus is always on Brandon his addiction and what boundaries and limits it pushes him to. I had read about some of the more unconventional and decidedly nonmainstream sexual escapades for lack of a better word Brandon gets himself into but I was still incredibly surprised and downright shocked by just how far McQueen goes with this character. He is brazen and uninhibited in what he shows on screen bravely defying the conventions of what we typically can and cannot see in mainstream cinema. McQueen does not shy away from hard truths and does not even try to mask the explicit nature of some of the sexual acts. Seeing how far Brandon will go to satisfy and suppress himself is simply harrowing not unlike films like Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream were with their characters' drug addictions. While the film and its frank depiction of sexuality are sometimes difficult to watch I found myself mesmerized by the choreography and cinematography at play throughout. McQueen frames the film with the audience in the position of a voyeur. Early on we see Brandon's morning routine featuring Fassbender roaming around his chic apartment totally naked. We see him at his most honest and his most vulnerable a man who is unable to hide the truth about himself. Later we watch him as he interacts with his office coworkers from behind huge glass windows and from a table across from him at a restaurant while he is on a date. McQueen uses a lot of unbroken shots to help depict this slice of Brandon's life through tracking shots and an immense amount of long shots. They help set the very somber mood and allow the audience to continue watching as if they were an actual character peering into the events that transpire for him. McQueen also expertly uses music to help dictate the action on screen tearing away the dialogue or sounds of the scene. It makes for an awkward feeling but one that evokes a response with every new scene.But for all of the shock and audacity McQueen still managed to make a deeply troubled film that leaves a lot unsaid and even more unresolved. He does not give out simple answers for what causes Brandon's addiction or even the reasoning behind the troubled and strained relationship between Brandon and Sissy. While leaving some things enigmatic and up to the viewers to decide many have already voiced their concerns regarding incest which seem a bit too outrageous for this kind of film is incredibly intriguing and help further propel the voyeuristic means of viewing the film it also makes for maddening thoughts afterwards. What exactly is McQueen trying to say? What is the point he is trying to make? It all feels like it builds towards nothing outside of an unsatisfying and deludingly ambiguous climax. As mentioned earlier it feels like the story and just about everything else came second to the portrait he wanted to paint through Fassbender's canvas. I can appreciate the film as it is but it makes it hard to love it the way I thought I would.Fassbender is stunning as Brandon magnetizing the audience from the beginning all the way to the end. He propels the film using his reactions and emotions to define the character. He makes Brandon's struggle one that is very real and almost horrific. He is unable to feel intimacy and watching him struggle to fulfill his urges is fascinating and deeply disturbing all at once. Watching his face through candid closeups you can see just how much raw power went into the role. But while it is a stellar and tortured performance that more than proves his weight as an up and coming actor I never found him to be nearly as incredibly impressive as we know he can be. I still find myself at odds with how great it was and how much greater it could have been. While James Badge Dale is effective in his small role as Brandon's smarmy and sleazy boss David it is Mulligan who truly compliments Fassbender. Her role does not ask a whole lot of her but her pained expressions and infinite desire to be loved by everyone is more than enough to make this a memorable turn for her. While the full frontal nudity was near useless I only wish that she could have done more.Shame is a very well done film but one that will divide audiences. On one hand it is an expertly crafted film about addiction that packs a great lead performance. On the other hand it is a maddening film that answers very little it asks and sometimes shocks just for the sake of it. It is an impressive feat for a second feature but one that I think could have been even better.810.".

The acting was totally convincing and the theme important and challenging. The repeated reminders of the hypocrisy of our society regarding sex and violence were clever and uncomfortable. I was very disappointed but not surprised that this film received no recognition at the awards ceremony. Normally sex sells is written on the heart of all promoters. But not in this case as it is not at all titillating. A genuinely adult film not the usual meaning. Fine performances from Michael Fassbinder and Carry Mulligan.".

	schema:headline " A Masterpiece!";
	schema:reviewBody "Shame centers on Brandon Michael Fassbender a lonely self  alienated man in his thirties who tries his best to appear as your  average New Yorker with an office job whenever he finds himself out in  public. The trouble with this young man or his tragic flaw is that  whenever he finds a minute of privacy in his day he hastily delves  into his own fabricated reality a world of excessive sex pornography  and masturbation. The day Brandon's distressed disruptive sister Sissy  Carey Mulligan barges into his condo looking for a place to stay  until things wind down and her sorrows disappear his life begins to  spiral out of control. He grows increasingly frustrated with her as he  feels her invasive presence will bring about the exposure of his  deepest and darkest secrets. However we see that this is just a  manifestation of his feelings of intense shame and regret for leading  the sad artificial life he believes is the only one fit for him.  Steve McQueen has the sheer audacity to go where very few filmmakers  have dared to go before by making a film about sexual addiction and its  effects on the human mind. In this ambitious boldness he doesn't want  to hold back on anything and he isn't afraid to show everything so the  result is a film with enough full nudity and explicit sexual content to  receive an Rrating in Canada which would probably translate to an NC  17 rating in the US unfortunately. There are several scenes in the  film where you literally see every inch of skin on the bodies of the  actors Fassbender is probably the most physically exposed. Having  said that this is never something that comes across as frivolous and  it only enhances the film's shock factor as a whole.  Michael Fassbender delivers the performance of a lifetime in Shame  and I currently can't see anyone else winning the Oscar for Best Actor  at the upcoming Academy Awards. He seems to understand his sad lonely  character just as well as the screenwriters who gave birth to him Abi  Morgan and Steve McQueen. Brandon is his own worst enemy for he longs  to find solace in someone and discover genuine human affection but the  other side of him remains too caught up in a shameful world detached  from real feelings and emotions. There are some scenes in the film  where we the audience are left alone with nothing but his  introspective subdued presence as he reflects upon his actions in  regret. These scenes say more than most movies can say within their  entirety. It's thanks to Michael Fassbender's pitchperfect performance  that we can step into his character's shoes and get to feel what he's  feeling. They say actions speak more than words with Shame acting  speaks more than the inclusion of any sort of narration ever would.   Don't worry I didn't forget about Carey Mulligan! I thought I would  highlight her performance separately too. If I had to say only one  thing about it I would emphasize how amazed I was at seeing her in  such an unusual singular role. She has a tendency to play softspoken  prim and proper characters but that's not the case with Shame. She  really submerges herself into this disastrous uncontrollable mess of a  young woman who never conceals her deepest feelings to the world be  it joy or sorrow. There's this one very memorable scene in the film  where she sings her own rendition of the jazz standard New York New  York in a lounge she's a singer who does gigs here and there and  for the duration of the song the camera stays focused on her face.  There are no cuts nor camera movements for a good five minutes of  course this won't come as a big shock to you if you have seen Steve  McQueen's Hunger yet somehow this scene is absolutely  mesmerizing almost hypnotizing. Just the way she naturally glances  about apprehensively as this beautiful voice is unleashed although it  probably isn't hers is enough to send shivers down your spine.  What can I say about all the other aspects of the film? Well since  Steve McQueen was the man behind the direction and shot composition  it's no big surprise that Shame is expertly crafted in every little  detail. McQueen used the same cinematographer Sean Bobbitt and editor  Joe Walker of his first feature to achieve the same impressive  aesthetic look. Some parts of the film must have required so much time  and effort from the editor it's hard to believe what was accomplished!  As for the cinematography I'm sure you'll be floored by it within the  first five minutes of the film. In this opening scene Brandon finds  himself staring at a woman sitting across from him as he is riding the  subway. He misunderstands her frightened glances and nervous attempts  to display her wedding ring as romantic advances so when she gets off  in a panic at the next stop he immediately follows her. In one of the  most beautiful gliding shots I've ever witnessed with an emotionally  shattering musical composition by Harry Escott playing all throughout  we see Brandon running up the station stairs and looking around for the  woman only to realize that she had run away from him. His failure to  comprehend human interactions in this scene already gives us a distinct  perception on this poor character's serious vulnerability.  In sum Steve McQueen's Shame is a masterful character study with  top grade performances from Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan and  a raw power unmatched by any other film I've seen. This is surely not a  film for everyone as it deals with dark gritty topics often labeled  as far too controversial for the big screen. But if you're open to true  cinema here's a devastating powerhouse of a film that will chill you  to the bone and forever stay with you.".

But like with musicians there is always the risk that a director's second film will not live up to the high expectations the first effort sets. Yet McQueen has a good go with his dark exploration of human character in Shame.Brandon Michael Fassbender is a successful and well off man living in New York City. He is also a sex addict who constantly picks up women hires prostitutes views internet porn daily and masturbates at any given opportunity. It affects his day to day life and he lives a lonely existence. His life is made more complex when his singer sister Sissy Carey Mulligan a woman with obvious problems crashes at his place. She interferes with his life including sleeping with his boss David James Badge Dale and sets Brandon off to tackle his addiction.Brandon is depicted as a really despicable character but he is a man struggling with an addiction. There is a number of sexual scenes throughout Shame but there is no eroticism as Brandon explores more depraved and disgusting acts and his life spirals out of control. Shame plays as a drug addition movie similar to Requiem for a Dream as someone struggles to give up something hazardous.Fassbender offers a powerful performance as a dark sinister man with strong interplay with Mulligan as he becomes threatening towards her. Compare him to Mulligan a much more brittle character on the edge for different reason. She gives a heartbreaking performance as a woman who does not know how to do deal with problems and has a sadness in her eyes. Their scenes were enhanced by McQueen's direction using hand held cameras to follows Fassbender and the conversations stick to one point making you feel like you are really watching them in a voyeuristic matter. This makes the movie more tense as the tone changes in an instant.McQueen employs a grainy filter giving Shame a dark grim look which is perfectly fitting considering the atmosphere of the movie. The visuals have a similar feel and tone as other gritty and grim New York set films such as Taxi Driver Midnight Cowboy and American Psycho all of which follow the horrible underbelly of the city. He has shown that he is a great actors' director but McQueen also had some great visuals such as a long tracking shot of Brandon jogging and Brandon watching two people having sex in their apartment.There are many moments in the movie that have little dialogue relying on Fassbender superb abilities as an actor particularly key in the beginning and during a long montage of Brandon wandering alone in New York playing like a scene in the great novel Last Exit to Brooklyn. This is a movie about Brandon's continuing descent and selfsabotage and Fassbender should hopefully gain an Oscar nomination to back up his award buzz in Europe.Shame continues McQueen's reputation as being one of the best emerging directors around sticking to his no holds barred brutal style which keeps a stage play quality to the presentation. Shame is tough but worthy just for Fassbender's performance and keeps to a tradition of grim New York based film.Please visit www.playeraffinity.com".

	schema:headline " A film for the intelligent mind this is not";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Steve McQueen has said this is a film he wants to stay with the viewer and in that respect he's succeeded. Since seeing this buzzedabout film last evening my mind has been swirling around the many elements I disliked along with genuine curiosity as to how it has fared so well in reviews.To begin with the positive aspects that earned my two stars I found the film to be very true to its NYC location. I appreciated that although Brandon has a high income job which affords him a luxury apartment with incredible views in a spatial space the apartment is actually quite small and confining. Not only is this true of Manhattan living in general I felt it lent itself nicely to the tension between Brandon and Sissy. I also enjoyed that in scenes where Brandon is walking through his neighborhood or going for a run we are seeing actual storefronts and landmarks that exist in that location. Such details along with a number of well executed subway scenes gave me the sense that Brandon is someone I could pass on the street or sit across from on the subway without a second thought or insight into the darkness of his character.These positives aside I carried through the entire film the feeling that Brandon and Sissy were people I could not understand and more importantly were presented in such a way that I was not meant to understand them or even try. While I don't need to be able to relate in order to appreciate a character I do think it's important to distinguish character development from portraiture. Brandon and Sissy are clearly two troubled individuals the motivations of whom are intended to shock and disturb and while McQueen succeeds in that regard without any greater sense as to how these characters developed into such deeply flawed and unconventional people I simply lost interest in them from the very start. When a tear rolls down Brandon's cheek as Sissy performs New York New York perhaps one of the most excruciating cinematic moments I've encountered in a long time I did not know why he was touched I did not care and most importantly I did not believe.Brandon and Sissy's relationship in general was a point of frustration for me. I wanted more information from the very start yet I could sense it wasn't forthcoming. What was it about their past that made them so comfortable with each other in one respect yet so incredibly distant in every other? When we see Brandon ignore Sissy on his answering machine until she turns up in his shower saying he'd given her a key I just didn't believe that Brandon would've given her a key based on what I'd seen of their relationship particularly in light of the fact that Brandon's sexual deviance was something he tried to keep hidden. I ultimately felt that given the many inconsistencies in their relationship without any insight as to the development of that relationship even the moments between them which should have touched me did not. When Brandon is forced to deboard the subway car has what appears to be an epiphany as to the condition of his sister and takes off running for his apartment where he discovers her postsuicide attempt I again didn't buy this innate connection that attuned him to her state of being. From a converse perspective if Brandon recognized all along the extent of Sissy's fragility as the references to her many failed suicide attempts would lead one to believe and the realization that he may have finally pushed her too far is the reason he runs to find her why then would he have carelessly initiated so much of the abuse in their relationship only to weep over her nearlifeless body when she attempts suicide again? Again I felt my ability to grasp the character's motivations was hindered by lack of context.In terms of the performances by Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan while I generally felt they embodied their roles well within the constraints of the material I found myself distracted at times by their accents. Carey Mulligan is usually right on target however in an early scene where she cries on the phone to a former lover it's abundantly clear that this is not a woman who grew up in New Jersey as her character claims. Far more blatant was Michael Fassbender's Irish accent throughout the entirety of the film. When Brandon tells a date he was born in Ireland I had to wonder whether this dialogue was added to the script solely to explain why his accent was not that of a local.Moving on to the graphic sexual nature of the film I can't claim it was entirely gratuitous as Brandon's sexual compulsion was the pulse of the film however it felt after a while like I was watching a bad porno flick that succeeded only in turning me off  for what seemed at the time like the rest of my life. My biggest problem here was a lack of balance. We are given a tremendous amount of insight into the deviant nature of Brandon's character but the insight ends there. If every moment of Brandon's life is consumed by his sexual appetite what are we to make of the fact that no one he interacts with on a daily basis seems to have any indication? And being multifaceted people ourselves how are we to see Brandon as anything but onedimensional?Shame is not the word I'd use to describe characters so eager to relinquish control to their worst instincts. Could the title Depression SelfLoathing and Unwillingness to Initiate Change have been taken?".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Steve McQueen has said this is a film he wants to stay with the viewer and in that respect he's succeeded. Since seeing this buzzedabout film last evening my mind has been swirling around the many elements I disliked along with genuine curiosity as to how it has fared so well in reviews.To begin with the positive aspects that earned my two stars I found the film to be very true to its NYC location. I appreciated that although Brandon has a high income job which affords him a luxury apartment with incredible views in a spatial space the apartment is actually quite small and confining. Not only is this true of Manhattan living in general I felt it lent itself nicely to the tension between Brandon and Sissy. I also enjoyed that in scenes where Brandon is walking through his neighborhood or going for a run we are seeing actual storefronts and landmarks that exist in that location. Such details along with a number of well executed subway scenes gave me the sense that Brandon is someone I could pass on the street or sit across from on the subway without a second thought or insight into the darkness of his character.These positives aside I carried through the entire film the feeling that Brandon and Sissy were people I could not understand and more importantly were presented in such a way that I was not meant to understand them or even try. While I don't need to be able to relate in order to appreciate a character I do think it's important to distinguish character development from portraiture.

Clearly the guy is abnormal but why? Besides it simply does not makes sense that he wishes to have sex with every woman that crosses his path but he is also impotent seemingly a gay who has not yet left the closet and a voyeur. And if the readers really wish to have a reason for not watching this film the guy spends long times doing nothing.

The unhappiness theme is established at the start. It is reiterated throughout the film. OK he's unhappy I get it.There's way too much sex. You know at the start of the film that Brandon has a lot of sex. The additional sex scenes add nothing to our understanding of the character. Although the sex looks hot two hookers at once! Brandon always looks grim. Anonymous sex is never fun in the movies. Lighten up dude!It's not clear if the sex is causing Brandon's unhappiness or if it is a symptom. The character is not articulate so you will have to infer.It is fun to see Michael Fassbender walking around naked. Dude's got a big one and a nice butt. I could do without actually seeing him pee. There are some teasing moments when the director sets you up to expect something sexy or pervy and then doesn't deliver. When Sissy and Brandon's boss are having loud sex in Brandon's apartment Brandon takes his clothes off. Is he going to join them in the bedroom? No he's just going running.In the opening scene Brandon is shown naked in bed with his hand over his crotch. Sorry no payoff he just rolls over and gets out of bed.Incest between Brandon and Sissy is implied. She stands provocatively naked in front of him when he bursts into the bathroom. She does not cover herself as they talk. In another scene he jumps on her on the sofa when he is wearing only a towel which then slips off. She gets in bed with him. The issue is not directly addressed or resolved so it seems to be a red herring.The film seems padded. There are long shots of Brandon walking through Manhattan or riding the subway. OK we know he's always on the make. There is a very long single shot of Brandon jogging. If you know Manhattan geography you can pass the time by trying to identify his route. Or you can check your messages. In the restaurant where Brandon meets Marianne you have to listen to the waiter give his spiel about that night's specials and the wine list. Worst of all you have to listen to Sissy sing New York New York all the way through at a very slow tempo.There is an incident when Brandon is on the subway. His train comes to a halt at the platform but the doors do not open. There is some kind of scuffle on the platform. Perps are seen running. The conductor orders all of the passengers to exit through the rear car. There are cops and yellow caution tape to guide the passengers. This sequence is interesting. Being stuck on a train underground is a kind of primal fear. How was the caution tape put up so fast? The sequence looks like it was really shot in the subway. If there is some connection with the rest of the story I missed it. Brandon exits up to the street and the incident is forgotten.Why does Sissy have to stay at Brandon's apartment? She has money. Why doesn't she have her own apartment? Or stay at a hotel? How can she get highpaying gigs as a singer when her life is chaotic? When does she rehearse? The sequence where Brandon goes gay is uncredible. Is this sequence intended to show how low he will go?  or that he's latent? These things do happen but we already know that Brandon can get all of the hookers he wants. He meets chic women in bars and they're having sex under a bridge 20 minutes later. This hetero superman all of sudden goes to a gay sex club? Not so plausible. Sissy's character is more interesting than Brandon. She talks more so you know her better. Too bad about the suicide attempt. Like now it's time for a big dramatic moment. Maybe if the movie were about Sissy I would care more.There isn't a lot of ideas here. Most of the film seems to be treading water. Brandon is unhappy at the end of the movie. Like he was at the start.".

	schema:reviewBody "In New York the empty thirty and something yearold Brandon Michael Fassbender is a sexaddicted man that works in an office. His longest relationship lasted only four months and Brandon does not have any friend. Brandon has casual sex with women that he meets in bars has sex also with hookers visits porn sites in Internet and collects sex magazines. However he is unable to have sex with an acquaintance.When his also dysfunctional younger sister Sissy Carey Mulligan unexpectedly moves to his apartment she has one night stand with Brandon's boss and the world of Brandon turns upsidedown. Shame is one of the most overrated films that I have recently seen. Brandon is a man that was probably sexually abused when he was a child and is sex addicted. The plot is limited to show his empty existence shagging women and masturbating. His sister Sissy is also a dysfunctional young woman weaker than him that needs support from her older brother but he is unable to help her. In the end Shame is a film with good performances but with a shallow and empty story. My vote is four.Title Brazil Shame".

The movie just didn't go anywhere. The acting was okay but there is a scene of his sister singing an entire new york new york song...really.

My take is that Mr McQueen is duping us into believing that his movie is full of action by putting up 18sln  just a man showing dick and ass. Not even proper shagging. There was no storyline at all. The movie sucks big time. Where in the world a married boss meets the sister of a subordinate and bangs her on the same night in the condo of the subordinate while the subordinate is listening to the bonking moaning?

For example at the very beginning of the film we are treated to the sight of the main character Brandon walking around his apartment naked  with the camera at crotch height. Then we are treated to the sight of him peeing  with the camera at crotch height. Does this add to our understanding of the character? No. Does it advance the plot? No. Ergo gratuitous unless . . . well I don't know Steve McQueen but this seemed a tad homoerotic for my taste. Later the main character's boss walks up to him and pinches him on the bottom. We aren't told why an aggressively heterosexual man does an act of homosexual harassment. So is this also gratuitous? Still later  I'd walked out by then  I gather there's a fullon and less than credible homosexual encounter. That doesn't surprise me but I am surprised that the depths of Brandon's addiction to sex his 'Shame' was marked by a sexual encounter with another man. In these enlightened times it seems odd to mark a sexual nadir by a spot of consensual buggery  and not complimentary to gay men who quite rightly aren't in the least bit ashamed of what they do. If you want a bit of degradation why not show Brandon in a clinch with a sheep  if that is you want a little 'shame'?There will be reviews cladding this movie with a lot of pretentious statements but at bottom this is a film made for men who like to take a sideways and surreptitious peek at the urinal. It's a film made for men who will claim it's a deep and meaningful look at sexual addiction  to patch over the fact that they are titillated by other men's body parts. It's a film made for men who can pretend it's intellectual while denying it's masturbatory. In short 'Shame' is a film for men who haven't got the guts to rent 'Young Studs of Oslo'.Actually let me take one thing back 'Shame' is not masturbatory. It's not that good. Pornography has to engage but this film was boring. It was dull. It was tedious. And that's what's unforgivable.One to avoid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Shame is worse than the clichs of watching paint dry or grass grow because in those instances you know there'll be some sort of satisfying conclusion some point to it all. If there's a point to Shame it's so subtle as to be apathetically invisible which is so say you can't see it and it doesn't much care if you do. It features performances that range from stoic to histrionic plot development that is nonsensical scenes that drag on for no discernible reason and awkward conversations that don't even show the promise of lessawkward conversations later on. It's a soulless deadeyed film. Brandon Michael Fassbender is supposed to be a porn addict who has gigabytes of the stuff on his PC at work and his laptop at home plus a lot of magazines he has anonymous sex with anyone he can find. He's a bit of a nihilist not moving through life so much as wafting through it like an unpleasant odor. But his sex addiction let's be frank is really rather tame. There are probably millions of loner males who indulge in the same behavior. That is this ain't the same guy played by Christian Bale in American Psycho or by Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver. Brandon a welloff exec at some Big Company simply finds outlets for his desires sometimes tempting danger but never resorts to crime or anything requiring emotion. We're meant to take that to mean he's repressing something.Enter his sister named  seriously  Sissy Carey Mulligan. Our first glimpse of Sissy is her emerging startled from Brandon's shower she's arrived unexpectedly to stay while he was at work. She is naked and we see it all. We're supposed to be shocked and we are. After all Carey Mulligan is an up and coming star and this is no stand in. Brandon's reaction is a little more of the enraged type but he merely bottles it up and stomps away after closing the door. There's a lot of door slamming in the movie.Over the course of the movie we get some clues to the nature of the siblings' relationship. They have been out of touch for some time although Sissy does have her brother's apartment key. She's flirty and works as a torch singer in various New York clubs. He seems to be perpetually seething at her immature behavior. Is it because she's disrupting his happy fun time or is it something moredecadent? The movie's title gives us an idea.The movie promises to be intriguing. Why have these two been apart? Where has Sissy been and why does Brandon hold her in such contempt? We're supposed to assume that his constant masturbating and hooker engaging portends something a way perhaps of acting out an emotion or two. But what? We're never told. The hints are there and one can make an educated guess to the root of the problems but it's a fool's errand. It's not just that we might not find out the entire truth we might not find out anything period. That leaves us with two opposite characters who under lessprofane circumstances could have starred in a buddy sitcom about mismatched roomies.The movie looks grimy and feels slimy. You want to take a long bath afterward not a cold shower  despite the frequent sex and nudity. Sometimes the movie shows us one thing leading us to one conclusion and then shows us a different conclusion. Whammo you've been hit by a red herring.

	onyx:emotionText "Watching Shame is worse than the clichs of watching paint dry or grass grow because in those instances you know there'll be some sort of satisfying conclusion some point to it all. If there's a point to Shame it's so subtle as to be apathetically invisible which is so say you can't see it and it doesn't much care if you do. It features performances that range from stoic to histrionic plot development that is nonsensical scenes that drag on for no discernible reason and awkward conversations that don't even show the promise of lessawkward conversations later on. It's a soulless deadeyed film. Brandon Michael Fassbender is supposed to be a porn addict who has gigabytes of the stuff on his PC at work and his laptop at home plus a lot of magazines he has anonymous sex with anyone he can find. He's a bit of a nihilist not moving through life so much as wafting through it like an unpleasant odor. But his sex addiction let's be frank is really rather tame. There are probably millions of loner males who indulge in the same behavior. That is this ain't the same guy played by Christian Bale in American Psycho or by Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver. Brandon a welloff exec at some Big Company simply finds outlets for his desires sometimes tempting danger but never resorts to crime or anything requiring emotion. We're meant to take that to mean he's repressing something.Enter his sister named  seriously  Sissy Carey Mulligan. Our first glimpse of Sissy is her emerging startled from Brandon's shower she's arrived unexpectedly to stay while he was at work. She is naked and we see it all. We're supposed to be shocked and we are. After all Carey Mulligan is an up and coming star and this is no stand in. Brandon's reaction is a little more of the enraged type but he merely bottles it up and stomps away after closing the door. There's a lot of door slamming in the movie.Over the course of the movie we get some clues to the nature of the siblings' relationship. They have been out of touch for some time although Sissy does have her brother's apartment key. She's flirty and works as a torch singer in various New York clubs. He seems to be perpetually seething at her immature behavior. Is it because she's disrupting his happy fun time or is it something moredecadent? The movie's title gives us an idea.The movie promises to be intriguing. Why have these two been apart? Where has Sissy been and why does Brandon hold her in such contempt? We're supposed to assume that his constant masturbating and hooker engaging portends something a way perhaps of acting out an emotion or two. But what? We're never told. The hints are there and one can make an educated guess to the root of the problems but it's a fool's errand. It's not just that we might not find out the entire truth we might not find out anything period. That leaves us with two opposite characters who under lessprofane circumstances could have starred in a buddy sitcom about mismatched roomies.The movie looks grimy and feels slimy. You want to take a long bath afterward not a cold shower  despite the frequent sex and nudity. Sometimes the movie shows us one thing leading us to one conclusion and then shows us a different conclusion. Whammo you've been hit by a red herring. There's more depravity in here than there was in Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant but without the compelling plot. Novice director Steve McQueen no relation seems to have little idea on how to end a scene as long silences seem pointless rather than pointed.

But just as the film begins its long but rapid descent from irony and satiric comedy into dark drama the pace picks up and the film grabs your attention holding fast until the strong finish.

	schema:headline " Uneven but definitely worth watching";
	schema:reviewBody "Ever since I first saw Gattaca I've been looking for other films directed by Andrew Niccol. This being one of them and so far one of the only onesbut I certainly hope he makes more films in the future... he has some very interesting ideas I simply had to watch. I was not disappointed. Like Gattaca this is science fiction however Gattaca is more of a allout scifi film and S1m0ne only has some elements of science fiction. Before I comment on the scifi I must comment on the great humor in the film. This is the first of Niccol's filmsTruman Show Gattaca and then this I've seen that has comedyin the form of satire that is. Truly great comedy as well. You know why? Because it's real. It's stuff that we can recognize stuff that we know from ourselves from the people around us. The comedy mostly revolves around how easily everyone is tricked how quick they are to believe in something without any proof. I believe it was Voltaire who said If there were no God it would be necessary to invent one. We want to be deceived we want to be tricked we want to have something to hope for and believe in. I mean let's be honest that is the very basis for why religion exists and why people claim to spot UFOs. People need to believe in something... and they believe in Simone. Despite what her maker has her do despite no one ever having met her in person people love her. They need to. They need someone something to believe in. The many scenes of Viktor covering up Simone not being real creating the illusion of her in various forms to satisfy other people's urge to see her meet her talk to her may be somewhat slapstick in their nature but they only emphasize how ludicrous and easily bought the everyday man is. They want to believe it so badly they simply can't accept anything else. This seems to be what most critics of this film are missing. Their refusal to accept it is simply them denying human nature. As Pacino's character realizes near the end She's indestructible. It is not possible to remove her because the public won't accept it. She must exist. I noticed a lot of references to the story of Frankenstein in this film. It is basically the 21st century's version of Frankenstein with some computerbased science fiction elements and set in Hollywood. I have never seen a film that so openly mocks the superficiality of Hollywood and for that reason alone anyone should see it. The plot is very good though it develops at a somewhat uneven pace... in fact the pacing seems a tad off. The acting is mostly very good. The special effects are topnotch... they were in 2002 and they still are. This could have been better but it was still very good. I recommend this to anyone who is interested from reading the plot outline people who enjoyed Gattaca and fans of science fiction as commentary on real issues. 710".

	onyx:emotionText "Ever since I first saw Gattaca I've been looking for other films directed by Andrew Niccol. This being one of them and so far one of the only onesbut I certainly hope he makes more films in the future... he has some very interesting ideas I simply had to watch. I was not disappointed. Like Gattaca this is science fiction however Gattaca is more of a allout scifi film and S1m0ne only has some elements of science fiction. Before I comment on the scifi I must comment on the great humor in the film. This is the first of Niccol's filmsTruman Show Gattaca and then this I've seen that has comedyin the form of satire that is. Truly great comedy as well. You know why? Because it's real. It's stuff that we can recognize stuff that we know from ourselves from the people around us. The comedy mostly revolves around how easily everyone is tricked how quick they are to believe in something without any proof. I believe it was Voltaire who said If there were no God it would be necessary to invent one. We want to be deceived we want to be tricked we want to have something to hope for and believe in. I mean let's be honest that is the very basis for why religion exists and why people claim to spot UFOs. People need to believe in something... and they believe in Simone. Despite what her maker has her do despite no one ever having met her in person people love her. They need to. They need someone something to believe in. The many scenes of Viktor covering up Simone not being real creating the illusion of her in various forms to satisfy other people's urge to see her meet her talk to her may be somewhat slapstick in their nature but they only emphasize how ludicrous and easily bought the everyday man is.

Satire is based to a great extent on the frightening predictability of people and it must follow a logical train of escalating events or what's the point.  The biggest failing in the movie is near the end where it jumps track from a logical train of events to a dumb plot device which while not a fatal error is lazy and takes away from the overall effect of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "What attracts most people to cinema is of course the famous actors. Every film is different from others depending on the director or the producers. This film tells the story of an actress who is appreciated and loved worldwide. There's only one problem she isn't real. S1m0ne is about a downonhisluck film director Viktor Taranski played by Al Pacino whose career sinks into a slump when his spoiled lead actress Nicola Anders played brilliantly by Winona Ryder walks off the set and leaves Viktor with an unfinished film and his loss of selfrespect. However when computer genius Hank shows up he presents Viktor with a computer program before he dies of a tumor that will change his life forever It's called Simulation One. Just a few strokes on the key board and an overnight sensation is born S1m0ne.The movie was bashed both critically and financially but I don't know why. Taking the critics's side I'll admit the writing and aspect of the film is weak and of course slightly unrealistic but that's exactly what a film is. Onscreen performances are what's most important to everyone and that's what the digital character S1m0ne is. Everyone instantly loves her and in turn Viktor gains the fame he always wanted with his films Sunrise Sunset and Eternity Forever. He still however cannot admit to the world the fraud he has committed. Later on his beautiful computergenerated leading lady gets the better of him. Ultimately he tries to crash her career and reputation but the world loves her even more.On a personal note I like this film mainly because of Al Pacino and the comical cosmic feeling you get from a sciencefiction movie. It's nice to see Pacino in a simple role for a change instead of the complex and sometimes rough characters he often plays such as police detectives and men of power andor authority. One of the smalltime extra sides to this pleasant film is Pacino's look as he's always looked younger for his age and Evan Rachel Wood's who plays Viktor's teenage daughter Lainey last appearance before her risetofame Academy Award nominated film Thirteen. S1m0ne is nothing special but it stays simple and cute. It's fun to watch and very tempting.".

S1m0ne is about a downonhisluck film director Viktor Taranski played by Al Pacino whose career sinks into a slump when his spoiled lead actress Nicola Anders played brilliantly by Winona Ryder walks off the set and leaves Viktor with an unfinished film and his loss of selfrespect. However when computer genius Hank shows up he presents Viktor with a computer program before he dies of a tumor that will change his life forever It's called Simulation One. Just a few strokes on the key board and an overnight sensation is born S1m0ne.The movie was bashed both critically and financially but I don't know why. Taking the critics's side I'll admit the writing and aspect of the film is weak and of course slightly unrealistic but that's exactly what a film is. Onscreen performances are what's most important to everyone and that's what the digital character S1m0ne is. Everyone instantly loves her and in turn Viktor gains the fame he always wanted with his films Sunrise Sunset and Eternity Forever. He still however cannot admit to the world the fraud he has committed. Later on his beautiful computergenerated leading lady gets the better of him. Ultimately he tries to crash her career and reputation but the world loves her even more.On a personal note I like this film mainly because of Al Pacino and the comical cosmic feeling you get from a sciencefiction movie. It's nice to see Pacino in a simple role for a change instead of the complex and sometimes rough characters he often plays such as police detectives and men of power andor authority. One of the smalltime extra sides to this pleasant film is Pacino's look as he's always looked younger for his age and Evan Rachel Wood's who plays Viktor's teenage daughter Lainey last appearance before her risetofame Academy Award nominated film Thirteen. S1m0ne is nothing special but it stays simple and cute. It's fun to watch and very tempting.";

Simone which got nearly identical scene is the best modern embodiment for it.Through one solid enjoyable and smart scifi black comedy near to farce the movie presents a story about how we all became slaves for images mostly unreal ones love the illusion to an extent where we replaced it instead of our own reality escaping from the ugly actuality to another phony one but comfortable to relish it then be addicted to it. It's in the same time a story about funny director's vendetta on his bosses to regain his dignity and achieve what he merits of appreciation by the ultimate scheme or rather the triumph of little smart man over huge stupid world and that's the beauty of it to be good philosophical satirical even comical movie all in one. I can't help but mentioning its clever situations so aims which made the whole movie a long clever moment  the director launches Simone saying I am the death of real leading a new age where the unreality becomes the only available reality. Simone the beloved star now talks completely dull however all the viewers love her believe her and agree with her. Or Simone directs a meaningless film and all the audience applauds making the ugly idol to worship it observe how they ask about her after it and not about the lousy film I've seen that many times before in my lifetime !. The director's inability when it came to killing her which makes it the most comic Frankenstein ever where this time the people love the monster and reject its death !. All refuses to believe the director's confesses about Simone as we live a world of delicious fancy where counterfeiting is the ruling logic hence the true thing would be not only scarce but refused so when life is falsetruth would be the imagination. The lead's surrender at the end to live as life imprisonment with unreal image otherwise he'd lose his success amongst idiots who adore chimera. And the hint in killing Simone's creator by eye cancer or rather how adhesion to the computer screen or any screen for too much time just destroys the viewer while there is another world out there real world that deserves to be lived. I loved extra satiric points  Simone's performance wins an Oscar as if all of Hollywood actresses is lower than holographic image ! Or why not Simonethe powerful delusion goes into the world of politics at the end it's the same game but with nations' people instead of crazy viewers some satire makes it impossible to not connect it with George. W. Bush's era when the movie was produced !.It's not where the joke is on you Hollywood it's on you human ! And I bet that's the very reason why it didn't turn into a hit and why anybody might hate it because some can't laugh at themselves especially when it dashes for instance Hollywood icons into pieces denuding the holy truth that you cherish as giant lie.The script the direction and the acting made a perfect job. Thank god that it got Al Pacino as the lead as it gives ultraenjoyment in the second watching and also because it's one of his finest movies lately in the commercial phase of him at the 2000s amongst sure lower ones such as  The Recruit Ocean's Thirteen 88 Minutes Righteous Kill etc. This is a wild satiric comedy. It's rare to watch a work about the effect of illusion and to be as perfect as this. The movie compressed its idea skillfully being cynical to the max mocking at the fast delusion so all the human stupidity. Actually the mocking was at our age as well to assure one genius conception Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it. It reminds me with what Dario Fo said once in one of his plays  sometimes illusion is more believable than reality. Few times in my life I felt entertained out of movie as a mental fine experience and a movie in the same time. In the last years the American cinema lacked this kind of movies extremely but Simone did it superbly representing the perfect deal for me as highly amusing and profoundly meaningful. It's really unbelievable. Or more correctly speaking  unbelievable yet real too.".

This is genuinely one of the worst most flaccid films I have ever seen. I was actually looking around the audience in disbelief to see if they were as flabbergasted at its rubbishness as I was.Seriously save yourself some money  wait till it comes out on TV probably within 6 months.

The computer effects  where they show Pacino 'editing' Simone  are laughable too  they bely a director who has never used a computer and makes no attempt to make any part of this film even vaguely conceivable.The plot is dire the dialogue is comainducing and the twist is so predictable as to surprise only the very feeblest of minds. This is genuinely one of the worst most flaccid films I have ever seen. I was actually looking around the audience in disbelief to see if they were as flabbergasted at its rubbishness as I was.Seriously save yourself some money  wait till it comes out on TV probably within 6 months. Then smash your TV.";

	schema:reviewBody "Andrew Niccol's S1mone is social satire at its cheeriest a pleasant endearing dissection of Hollywood mania and celebrity obsession that only hints at the level of menace one might achieve with the concept. It's less of a cautionary tale and more of a comedic fable and better for it too. In a glamorous yet used up Hollywood mega producer Viktor Taransky Al Pacino with some serious pep in his step needs to give his enterprise a makeover. His goto star Winona Ryder is a preening diva who drives him up the wall and there seems to be a glaring absence of creative juice in his side of the court. Something cutting edge something brand new and organic something no one else has. But what? Simone that's what. After finding clandestine software left behind by a deceased Geppetoesque computer genius Elias Koteas excellent he downloads what lies within and all manner of mayhem breaks loose. The program was designed to create the perfect virtual reality woman flawless and capable in every way including that of the cinematic thespian. Viktor sees this as gold and treats it as such carefully introducing Simone played by silky voiced model Rachel Roberts to an unsuspecting film industry who are taken by storm and smitten. Simone can tirelessly churn out five Oscar worthy performances in a month never creates on set drama whips up scandals or demands pay raises. She's the answer to everyone's problem except for the one issue surrounding her very presence on the screen she isn't actually real. This creates a wildly hysterical dilemma for Pacino a fiery Catherine Keener as a fellow executive and everyone out there who's had the wool pulled over their starry eyes. It's the kind of tale we'd expect from Barry Levinson or the like a raucously funny warmhearted pithily clever send up of the madness that thrives in the movie industry every day. There's all manner of cameos and supporting turns including Evan Rachel Wood Jay Mohr Pruitt Taylor Vince Jason Schwartzman Rebecca Romjin and the late Daniel Von Bargen as a detective who cheekily grills Pacino when things get real and the masses want answers. This is fairy tale land in terms of plausibility but it's so darn pleasant and entertaining that it just comes off in a relatable believable manner. Pacino is having fun too a frenzied goofball who tries his damnedest to safeguard his secret while harried on all sides by colleagues and fans alike. Roberts is sensual and symmetrical as the computer vixen carefully walking a tightrope between robotic vocation and emoting essentially playing an actress pretending to be an actress who isn't even human no easy task. It's a breezy package that's never too dark or sobering yet still manages to show the twisted side of a famously strange industry. Great stuff.".

The beautiful Rachel Roberts is great as S1m0ne.In conclusion it's truly a pity how such a genial idea was ruined by rubbish humor. The movie had potential to be much better than this.

I can't imagine why he would even want to associate himself with such a horrible movie.What annoys me the most about this movie is the lack of attention to detail. Film directors should realise that movie goer's are not completely computerilliterate. I mean no one except people who've never used computers or are from a very old generation would believe that a film director could simply rustleup the perfect actor by simply hitting a few keys on a PC.....maybe a supercomputer but a PC? Paleeeeease. And we're to believe that a hologram would pass for a real person at a LIVE concert? And I'm sure most people noticed that the virus came on a 5 12 inch floppy which NO computer has come equipped with since the late eighties with a label marked Virus ver 8.1. This is a real insult to our intelligence especially in an age where most everyone owns a PC. The funniest bit is when Al Pacino's teenage daughter managers to undelete every thing and bring simone back to life even though everything including hard disks floppies etc. where at the bottom of the sea  again by hitting a few keys  COME ON!!!And what's the aim of this movie? So Hollywood actorsesses are bitchy and make silly demands who cares?. I think they have all the right to do so. After all they earn the director the film company and about 200 other people a few million bucks.....so what if they only eat brown mm's. If they were really downtoearth and fair us ordinary people wouldn't be interested in them....they wouldn't be glamorous.This really is a horrible movie......avoid it.".

Frankie Lancaster invades Dink's Douglas office to muscle in on what he's owed of Dink's big operation. But Frankie's a gangster of the uncomplicated 1930's while Dink's a whitecollar criminal of the coming 1950's. So. By the time Dink's accountant Dave Corey is through answering each of Frankie's threats with another layer of corporate ownership that can't possibly be divided Frankie's reduced to a bundle of quivering frustration. In short Dave has beaten all Frankie's assembled thugs with what amounts to a maze of legalese. As a result piles of paper prove ultimately more powerful than gangs of gunmen in what amounts to a great unexpected scene.All in all. The movie's decent 40's noir long on atmosphere but too long on talk at least to my liking. I suspect the screenplay was tailored to showcase producer Wallis's top 3 new stars especially Scott who gets a lot of romantic dialog along with sultry screen time. The overall result is a movie composed of too many underblended showcase scenes  some quite good that nevertheless don't really gel into a compelling whole. It's the kind of movie where the stars are more memorable than the story.Scott and Douglas for example really shine. Scott does some of the best acting of her career as the conflicted glamour girl. But I especially like Douglas's slimy version of a smoothtalking mastermind who's so selfassured you can't wait to see him get what he's got coming. Douglas's early career specialized in such compromised types a revelation to those only familiar with his later more heroic career. For his part Lancaster does well enough with his distinctive looks but Frankie is a less showy role than the other two.Anyway one thing for sureproducer Wallis certainly had an eagle eye for new talent as this movie more than demonstrates.".

It's a shame as with a few minor changes this one easily could have earned an 8 or possibly a 9.After 15 years in prison Frankie Burt Lancaster is released and he beats a path to the nightclub run by Noll Kirk Douglas. It seems that when Lancaster was caught by the police he could have implicated Noll as well but kept his mouth shut. And the two had a deal that when the other got out of prison they'd split everything 5050. However despite having a very successful club and lots of dough Noll isn't about to give half of his fortune to Frankieno matter what they agreed to. There's quite a bit more to the film than thisincluding a third guy Dave Wendell Corey whose loyalties seem all over the place as well as a dame there's always a dame...played by Lizbeth Scott.There's a lot to like in the filmparticularly the acting. In addition the camerawork is great as is the beating scene it's amazingly brutal and realisticthough it could have used a bit more blood. The street scenes late in the film had a great use of shadowsa film noir trademark. However despite a decent script idea a few times it really let down the audience. One major mistake was having Dave announce to Noll that he's going to do the right thing and he is going to cross Dave. Now we have already seen that Noll is bad...very very bad. So why would Dave be dumb enough to announce his intentions to Noll?! Of COURSE Noll is going to have Dave killed...that's what bad people do when you threaten them!!!! Duh... Also at the end Noll asks the cops to let him have a farewell as they're taking him inand they let him go behind the bar and grab his gun!!! Isn't he a suspect in murder?! So why let him have a chance to do anything like this?! Cops can't be that dumb!".

They had a good scheme going until Frankie is caught with the goods he is bringing to their speakeasy in Manhattan. Madison has to serve fourteen years for the crime. When he is released from prison Dave  a mutual friend who now works for Turner is sent to meet the excon and help him settle down.Frankie who wants to be paid for the time he spent in jail has a lot to square away with his former friend. Madison is taken aback when he goes to pay a visit to Dink's new club. Not only is it posh it caters to a high class crowd! In the club he meets two ladies one the headliner Kay Lawrence who is involved with Turner and Mrs. Richarson a high society type. Turner wants to use Kay to pump information from Madison but he soon discovers the duplicity but in reality the singer's heart is not into betraying Frankie who she seems to have taken a liking to. On the other hand Mrs. Richardson can't get her hands on this new arrival the way she has gotten away with Dink.Dink feels threatened by Madison's arrival into the scene. When they have an argument about the money owed to Frankie Dink has a plan to get rid of his friend. Dave the accountant who has been called to explain to Madison the intricacies of the corporation that owns the club sees what Dink is trying to do. Frankie Madison gets a chance to get what is due to him. He also gets to keep the gorgeous Kay! I Walk Alone directed by Byron Haskin is a good example of those films that came out after WWII. It's worth a look because of the marvelous cast assembled to appear in it. I Walk Alone marks the first time Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas appeared together in movies. Although the top billing is given to Wendell Corey he has little to do in it. The huskyvoiced Lizabeth Scott plays the sultry Kay Lawrence with her usual flair. She is beautifully dressed by Edith Head.Victor Young's musical score and Leo Tover's cinematography contribute to the overall success of this movie.".

It is so easy to see his son Michael's face on him. Burt was fun to watch as usual in giving his best to this intriguing screenplay. What was interesting to see unfold in this almost 60 year old film was how challenging the crime corporations are in pinpointing the vastness of what exactly they own. How they get around the skimming of the profits. As well as stating that they only get a minimal amount of the percentages  by the books. There was a lot of thought that went into this film and the three stars gave it their best. Pure quality.".

He senses that Dave is uneasy with him and discovers that Dave is working for his old partner in crime Noll Kirk Douglas who is now running a successful nightclub. Frankie visits the club and Noll is curious to find out what he wants. He instructs his mistress Kay Lizabeth Scott who is a singer at the club to pump Frankie for information over a dinner. It is soon clear to Frankie that everyone around him is under the influence of Noll and so confronts him with a demand of a half share in the business. Noll refuses and Frankie plans to take what he believes is rightfully his  they agreed to split things 5050 if either of them went to prison. It is interesting to see the two different characters pitted against each other ie Frankie straight forward and uneducated vs Noll deceitful and intelligent. Kay switches allegiance when she hears of Noll's intention to marry Mrs Richardson Kristine Miller and Dave also has 2nd thoughts about Noll....The film is wellacted but Lizabeth Scott seems slightly out of place as a worldweary nightclub singer. She's too young to be believable as someone who has been around the block and I also found her voice slightly irritating. The acting honours go to Kirk Douglas and Wendell Corey. Burt Lancaster tends to overact his part. My favourite part of the film is the sequence where Frankie confronts Noll with a team of heavies in order to get what he feels is his share of the nightclub. We have a very amusing scene where Noll and Dave confuse him with legal speak to the point where even his gang of thugs give up with the whole idea. It's an entertaining film although I was expecting slightly more from it. There is also a melodramatic piece of music that is played throughout the WHOLE film. I can't remember when the music wasn't playing!".

It is also one of the first pairings of Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster in film. Douglas and Lancaster were so well balanced in their movies that they were interchangeable. While in most of them they were allies or buddies THE DEVIL'S DESCIPLE GUNFIGHT AT O.K. CORRAL TOUGH GUYS they could alternate as the villain against each other. It's hard to find a pair of actors who did this as well or at all. Matthau and Lemmon usually were in comedies although they both could be at loggerheads on some ethical points or past history. Grant and Ralph Bellamy are normally love rivals Bellamy being hopelessly outclassed. Crosby and Fitzgerald are usually in a battle of the generations and a confrontation of two street smart types. And so it goes in other male pairings.SPOILERS AHEAD Here Kirk is the villain  he got away with a large stolen cash prize in a crime back in the 1920searly 1930s. His partner Burt got caught and was sent to prison for 14 years actually rather lucky for him  a cop was killed. Burt is now out of prison and he discovers that Kirk is quite a social success. He took the money and used it to build a gang but he was smart enough to use his profits to get a legitimate sheen to his image he's a successful nightclub owner with many wealthy friends and customers. One of the best moments early in the film is when Lancaster sees newspapers and magazines that show Douglas swanning with the swells even wearing top hat and overcoat in a rotogravure shot. Not quite like the good old Dillinger days or even Al Capone.Other films had touched upon the legitimization of mob money as time passed. In THE ROARING TWENTIES while Jimmy Cagney is building up his hooch empire he invests the money in a legitimate taxi company an early example of money laundering only to lose everything when the stock market crashes. Ironically his untrustworthy secondincommand Humphrey Bogart never diversifies but keeps to the illegal activities. He not only survives the crash but he profits by it taking over Cagney's property  though he contemptuously leaves him one taxicab. But even he tries to pick up a better public image  you see him practicing his putting in his office at one point.Lancaster confronts Douglas in his nightclub only to be brought into the modern world of organized crime. All Lancaster really wants is his half of the original money. But as Douglas' accountant Wendell Corey says they can't just give him the cash as it has been invested throughout Douglas's financial empire. Lancaster is left without cash and led a chase as well by Douglas using Lizbeth Scott as femme fatale bait. He ends up getting beaten by Mike Mazurki. But he remains determined to beat Douglas and get his share.He does in a manner that today would not pass muster. He entraps Douglas by pretending to have him at the end of a loaded gun forcing Douglas to make a confession before the police. Douglas naturally frightened does admit information that only the criminal involved in the crime would have known but at the end he sneers at Lancaster saying that the confession was gotten under duress. But then Lancaster shows his gun was empty. Civil libertarians today would denounce this trick saying the confession was tainted. In 1948 it was perfectly legal.".

The story here overtly bridges the gap between the 1930s gangster film and the new postwar noirs. Lancaster took the fall for some bootlegging and is out after a 14 yr sentence. Neat idea.Particularly clever and effective is a tense confrontation between stoolie Lancaster and Douglas in ascent which underscores just how corporate and despicable gang activity had become in the intervening years. Lancaster as in Criss Cross is completely hapless throughout the story and it's never more embarrassing for him than when he gathers some henchmen and bursts in on Douglas to demand his portion of the bank only to falter because he can't understand the deliberately circumlocutious structure of the new organization. Condescending Kirk Douglas and Wendell Corey explain it to him point by point humiliating him and gaining the upper hand. You feel bad for him but you can't help laughing as the future of the nation is staring you back in the face Corporate crime and plausible deniability. It's a great little scene.Some of the shots are nice as you'd expect from noir. But in a distinctly nonnoir angle Lancaster never gets the jump on anyone and requires the pity of a doting supportive woman Lizbeth Scott for the entirety of the movie. Scott is second best material as usual She's awkward. But it's a decent B noir.".

	schema:reviewBody "I Walk Alone 1948  12 out of 4Frankie Madison Burt Lancaster gets out of prison after fourteen years and heads to see his old partner Dink Turner Kirk Douglas. The two men made an agreement when Frankie took the wrap that they'd split everything down the middle while he was in prison but once on the outside he realizes that Turner has double crossed him. Broke and without any hopes for the future Frankie must get his revenge. There are some terrific performances to be found here but sadly the end results aren't nearly as good as one would hope for thanks in large part to a screenplay that is just way too predictable for its own good. The story itself really isn't anything original and it doesn't take long for you to realize that Lancaster isn't going to be getting what's coming to him and the film takes way too long for this obvious setup to take place. Once the double cross actually happens things start to pick up but once again you're one step ahead of the characters as none of them ever really see what's going to happen and after a while you start to realize that they're all rather stupid. This is especially true during the ending which I won't ruin. I will say there's something Douglas does which is just so silly that you can't help believe the two characters he does it to would be that dumb. With that said the film is still worth seeing thanks in large part to the terrific cast. There are many legendary actoractor combos throughout film history but one of my favorites has always been Lancaster and Douglas. It's somewhat shocking to me that their films aren't better respected than they are but this was the first of seven films they made together and that terrific chemistry is on display here. It's rather amazing to see how well they play off one another in their film film but Lancaster was always terrific at playing the wronged tough guy and Douglas is just so snake like that you can't help but love to hate him. Lizabeth Scott is good in her role as the woman in love with Douglas but who quickly starts to fall for Lancaster. There's no question that the director wanted her to act like Lauren Bacall but it works well. Wendell Corey is also very good in his role. I WALK ALONE is part noir and part thriller and fans of those two genres will probably want to check it out. The terrific performances make it a film worth watching but it's a shame the screenplay didn't do a better job with the characters.".

It just can't end well when the two meet again after 14 years when one let the other down.It was probably his performance here that gave Wendell Corey his only significant lead in a noir a few years later The File on Thelma jordan but he was best as a supporting actor and will be remembered best as such  while both Burt and Kirk never stopped rising as stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having spent 14 years in prison for crimes during prohibition the melancholy Burt Lancaster has returned home to try to muscle in on what he rightfully believes is partially his now controlled by old pal Kirk Douglas who has turned their previous illegal enterprise into a corporation. Douglas's bookkeeper Wendell Corey a younger brother figure to Lancaster has greatly aged in Lancaster's time away obviously consumed with guilt over the illegal activities he has had to do at Douglas's demands and now must keep Lancaster at bay as well. Lancaster takes it into his own hands to try to force his way in but as Douglas charmingly tells him only the board of directors can approve such changes. This leads to Douglas having Lancaster badly beaten up and turns Douglas's songstress mistress Lizabeth Scott onto Lancaster's side tired of Douglas's involvement with a pushy wealthy widow Kristen Miller. Sudden betrayal leads to Lancaster being accused of murder and along with Scott Lancaster must find a way of clearing his name and see justice finally served in this case a cold dish as justice through revenge is normally presented.Along with The Strange Loves of Martha Ivers Desert Fury and many others this is a series of Hal B. Wallis produced film noirs where many of the same actors got together as sort of a repertoire company to show off the dark sides of the post war society. Whether returning from war duty prison out of town jobs or just drifting along many of the protagonists here found themselves up against evils they couldn't control yet were far from noble characters themselves. Lancaster's Frankie is moody amoral and not above breaking the law. Yet he is aware that he had broke the law which sent him up the river but is bitter because nobody from the old rackets stood beside him. Douglas smiling and sly is a great villain while Corey is appropriately stone cold as a character barely living whom Lancaster notices seems older than him even though he's younger. Scott who could go from cold and calculating to purring like a kitten is a combination of a vixen and a very melancholy baby but knowing when a bad deal is done even by the man she thinks she loves. Originally considered for Scott's role Kristen Miller is deliciously bitchy and cold as the nasty socialite keeping Douglas under her thumb. Unfortunately her role is underdeveloped and she pretty much disappears from the second half of the film.Having seen Lancaster in a good guy role Scott in a very similar part and Corey in a supporting role with homosexual overtones in the color film noir Desert Fury I wanted to see how this would compare and found it to be even better. Douglas basically plays the type of part that John Hodiak had been cast in Desert Fury but there are enough twists and turns to make this unique. The film is elaborately designed and photographed especially the elegant nightclub and deliciously darkly lit for the intense finale where everything comes out into the open. Then there are some great outdoor shots of Lancaster and Scott on the run going back into the city for the final confrontation unconcerned about Lancaster being looked for by the police for murder as he knows they would be looking for him the opposite way. The musical score in the background nicely adds to the tension although i would have loved to have heard the title song used more often rather than the upbeat jazzy way it is briefly heard. Still this is one of the better late 40's film noir with an outstanding cast and everything else pulling it together in a tight little package.".

Paul Kelly had the Burt Lancaster part while Luther Adler played the heavy. Also cast Dorothy Comingore Adrienne Ames Herbert Berghof Tom Pedi George Mathews E.G. Marshall and Arthur Hunnicutt. Oscar Serlin produced Harold Clurman directed. COMMENT The writers have come up with a few fascinating new angles on the classic convictseeksrevenge plot turning what could have been merely another gangster story into an engrossing film noir that rivets the attention from start to finish. The sharp dialogue and zesty characterizations of the play have been fleshed out by superlative performances all around. Lancaster is exactly right as the bitter excon an innocent in a nowtoosophisticated world of shady finance. His nemesis is powerfully represented by Kirk Douglas here reprising his ruthless heavy from Out of the Past. Although she has unjustly copped a fair amount of downgrading from jealous critics sultry Lizabeth Scott is at her most stylishly convincing best as the putupon heroine. Also compelling are wonderfully glumfaced Wendell Corey as the harassed accountant who cooks Douglas's books and George Rigaud as the schemer's confidant. Good to see George in a decentsized role for once.Other appealing contributors include Kristine Miller as a socialite with a yen for low life Marc Lawrence as Burt's sympathetic pal for a switch Marc is operating on the right side here even if still on the shady ledger of the law Mike Mazurki as the doormanbouncer also sympathetic to the hero's plight but nonetheless loyal to his current employer. Mike in his best role since Moose Malloy enjoys some of the script's best lines Did you see that right hook he caught me with? I always liked the guy. Fifteen years ago he was the greatest! The movie is nothing if not superbly lit. The visuals are often quite excitingly photographed and composed. In fact as usual with Hal Wallis productions production values are firstclass with really outstanding technical credits including the appealing seats attractive costumes and one of Victor Young's most lovely scores.OTHER VIEWS This one was written by George Addison a pseudonym I used years ago for various newspapers and magazines. My opinions may have changed in the meantime but the review was valid when it was written and deserves to be reprinted. In fact I've had people write to me that they preferred George Addison's insights to my own! Like Casablanca here's another excellent example of an unsuccessful stage play translated into an outstanding movie. And like Casablanca the credit belongs mainly to producer Hal Wallis who saw potential in the original property and then oversaw its repackaging as a film. In this case he even persuaded Byron Haskin to resume directing after a break of twenty years in special effects. Haskin has induced solid performances not only from the principals and costars but even from minor players like Mickey Knox as the abrasive Skinner and Olin Howlin in a brief bit as a nightwatchman. And is that former cowboy star Jack Perrin in a silent walkon as the cop who looks over the parked taxi?The screenplay incorporates several unusual elements for a film noir. Involved corporate structures designed to freeze out the Lancaster character successfully defeat his quest for vengeance. But the excon is also sidetracked by a heavy romantic entanglement with a voluptuous but increasingly sympathetic siren. The conventional roles of vulnerably innocent heroine and sexy femme fatale are here skillfully rolled into one. It says much for Lizabeth Scott's utterly convincing portrayal that her playing of this difficult complicated role never once falters or strikes a single wrong note.In addition to its proud ensemble acting I Walk Alone also benefits from masterfully realized sets costumes lighting and music scoring. This is a film with atmosphere. In spades.".

Of course they would do better collaborative films in the future but I Walk Alone was a pretty good way to start the team identification. Lancaster is an old time prohibition bootlegger who has just finished a fourteen year stretch in prison. Like Cagney he took the fall and like Cagney he wants his share of the business just like he left off.But in the intervening years which also included the Great Depression and World War II Kirk Douglas in the Bogart part no longer runs a cheap speakeasy. He's the proprietor of a successful Stork Club like nightclub with Lizabeth Scott singing there nightly. He's got Scott on the side but he's also putting the moves on society mover and shaker Kristine Miller. There's no place in his set up for an old time Twenties hood like Lancaster.Lancaster doesn't take the hint easily until he's left beaten and unconscious in an alley. After that he's framed for Wendell Corey's murder who ran the books then and now for Douglas. The film really belongs to Kirk Douglas. He does a variation on the part he did Out Of The Past a rather elegant and fastidious man whom you don't have to scratch too hard or too deep to see the menace come out. Blended of course with the Bogart role in Angels With Dirty Face in which quite more depth is given. Kirk just thinks he's the smartest guy around and everyone else is dumb that's his downfall.I Walk Alone is a nice noir thriller from Paramount and the beginning of the partnership of Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas of whom columnist Hedda Hopper labeled the Terrible Twins.".

They don't really fight it out like John Wayne and Randolph Scott in 'The Spoilers' and for that reason this film disappoints just like 'Gunfight at the OK Corral'. There is tension between Lancaster and Douglas but their scenes together are just talking heads. Lancaster wins the physical war with his fists whereas wins the intellectual war of words by outsmarting Lancaster. It is unsatisfactory because they would continue to be talking heads in 'Gunfight at the OK Corral' and 'Seven Days in May'. This is why it is not a movie but rather a collaboration between two talented actors who are not maximising their potential together.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 38 films I saw there this year the Art of Negative Thinking has emerged as my film favorite. Fist of all this is a small film shot in 20 days with little obvious budget. Almost the entire film is filmed on location in a house and besides the cast the most expensive overhead was probably the rights to use Johnny Cash and some other great 60's 70's music and some snippets of a few movies. This is a dark comedy and the comedy is very very funny and it's usually unexpected and right around the corner throughout the film. What makes this film all the more amazing is it is the debut feature film from it's writerdirector Brd Breien both as a writer and as a director. Geirr Fridtjov Sheim is a paraplegic whose once idyllic life of matrimonial bliss to Ingvild Kirsti Eline Torhaug has been shattered by his paralysis. Ingvild wants to stay with him but Geirr has withdrawn from her and the world and spends his days watching 1970's Vietnam themed films on TV and listening to Johnny Cash records while he gets drunk and smokes pot living on pizza wearing an Army jacket and a silly cap and harboring an unhealthy fascination with handguns. Tori Kjersti Holmen is a national health psychologist who is the head of a state run positivity group program for victims of paralysis. Ingvild has contracted Tori to try to enroll Geirr in her program and since Gierr is naturally resistant to the idea Tori takes her group to him. Marte Marian Saastad Otteson is a quadriplegic who is Tori's star pupil in positive thinking. Gard Henrik Mestad is Marte's boyfriend who has joined the group in support of Marte. Asbjrn Per Schaaning is a once successful businessman who as the result of stress and alcoholism suffered a debilitating stroke. Lillemar wears a neck brace for sympathy but is a bitter 65 year old divorce. This is a great ensemble cast with each a memorable character. This is one of those films that makes me laugh days and weeks after seeing it. I would give this a 10 out of 10 and highly recommend it.".

If she thinks she's going to win Geirr over she's got another think coming.

There's Lillemor Kari Simonsen a middle aged divorced woman in a neck brace. Marta Marian Saastad Ottesen is a pretty woman. She is paraplegic too from a mountaineering accident. Gard Henrik Mestad is her selfrighteous selfpitying boyfriend. Asbjorn Per Schaaning is an older man who is seriously damaged by a stroke and can hardly speak. Tori imposes a regime of forced cheer. It's obviously gone too far with Marta who wears a fixed rictus smile. Lillemor is perpetually whining. She gets to voice her complaints into the knitted shit bag which Tori passes to people who want to say something uncheerful.Ingvild has invited the group over because she can't take Geirr's withdrawn grumpiness much longer and is desperately hoping they can get through to him. The surprise is that it's he who gets through to them. Geirr doesn't want anybody to try to tell him that things are okay for him. By shaking up the group and expelling Tori and encouraging the others to admit what's really going on inside or alternately dropping their facades of selfpity Geirr releases a swoosh of energy in the group that flows back to him. It turns out he's a pretty together fellow. He becomes the leaderand the exponent of The Art of Negative Thinking. The group helps him by pointing out that of all of them he's materially the best off. He lives in a big beautiful house while some of them are struggling to survive financially. Others also reveal what else is going on with them that Tori's bossiness had kept from coming out. Marta stops smiling long enough to point out to Gard that his failing to tie her off is why she fell. On the other hand he needs to stop agonizing over that and move forward. Lillimor doesn't really need the neck brace. Asbjorn gets so involved in the proceedings which involve some useful drunken revels that he regains some of his power of speech. In time Tori is allowed back to apologize and the air has been cleared.The solutions the group with Geirr arrive at relate to 12step recovery which assumes as a given that people must help themselves and you don't know what it's like unless you've been there yourself. Nobody who hasn't dealt with the minute to minute hardships of being disabled has the right to tell handicapped people to keep their chin up. You have to acknowledge the dark side to get to the light. When being honest is the prime requisite it also comes clear who has been faking and who can get a lot better fast if they try.But this isn't some kind of instructional film. It's a somewhat theatrical happening whose improvisational surprises at times suggest the work of Lars von Trier. The actors manage to seem real and at the same time somewhat stylized.This is a nice little film that somehow seems ideally a product of the angstridden world of the Scandinavian northland. But a lot of what goes on here is universal and by no means restricted to the handicappedor to Norwegians.Seen as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival 2008.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very few movies are made about disabled people. It seems to be a taboo area that few filmmakers are willing to venture into as they do not want to make a tearjerker propaganda film that manipulates people's feelings or appear to be too insensitive about the issue. This film does neither instead through realistic characters it takes the honest approach and allows the audiences to examine the characters and understand how they feel without the filmmakers help. Thus it makes the film enticing and provocative.The film examines the different degrees and dimensions of both physical and emotional disability and how it affects those around them. It shows how some people are down on themselves and refuse to improve or become worst than they are. It shows how those disabled can increase pressure and frustration on those closest to them and viceversa how those closest to them can cause them pain and suffering even if they had the best of intentions. Finally it shows that acceptance both the disabled and those around them is a process. It takes time and patience if one does not have the patience it is better off if that person leaves.One thing to take away from this film as it offers a great lesson there must be a balance between positive and negative thinking. Being too positive and smiling all the time might not be such a good tactic in life. Just look at Marte. She tries to be positive in order to protect her partner's feelings instead he feels very guilty and does not appreciate her efforts. However at the same time being too negative will only sent one into depression as Lillemor demonstrates. She is rather healthy but because she is so down on herself she thinks she is no better than the disabled people she associates with. Therefore in the end one must be both positive and negative. This way a person would be able to examine the reality of the situation and have the courage to move forward.810".

This black comedy is a stranger comes to town story although in this case the community comes to the stranger since he is housebound through grief after suffering a spinal cord injury that capitalizes on the badbehavior genre. The violence and cruelty in the movie  there is a surprising amount of violence although it results in very little gore  express a universal urge to rage against bad luck and this is the pleasure viewers are supposed to derive from watching. Unfortunately in this preMeToo movie this violence is overwhelmingly directed at a woman. The woman who receives this violence is one of four ablebodied characters and as the facilitator of a support group for people with disabilities she represents authority. She also represents the system and the vapidity of mainstream culture which is a substantial narrative stretch since people who work in care are almost always disadvantaged women. To cover this stretch she is presented as the author of a book about the group that has just been accepted for publication. This plot point touches on interesting issues about representation of illness and disability but like the issue of suffering as competition also raised by the movie the treatment is confusing and unresolved. At some points the group members are shown as collaborators and at others victims of exploitation. The other women in the movie come in for a lot of abuse too the longsuffering girlfriend the group member whose suffers a mental illness rather than a physical disability and the woman with quadriplegia function primarily as sexual objects. Their agency is limited to providing sexual access. The men in the movie don't benefit from this their agency is limited to sexual performance and this it seems is the real problem of the badlybehaving hero stranger. In this film the men's violence stands in for sexual performance by battering a woman they demonstrate they still have some agency. Bigger issues about loneliness and guilt are raised in the process of farcical sexual pursuit but like the sufferingascompetition and disabilityporn themes they aren't explored with any depth. Instead the badlybehaving hero is cast as redeemer and the narrative ends with the perplexing message that deliverance comes in the form of a wealthy white man with a big gun booze and weed. The longsuffering girlfriend rides off into the sunset sunrise in this case with the stranger who has one hopes finally realized clinical potency isn't required for sex. Farce and loose threads aren't problems. The ambiguity and dominant theme of moral anarchic catharsis would be enjoyable if it weren't for the sexist framing of the violence in this film. The assaults endured by the group facilitator are simply too realistic too close to the harassment and abuse endured by women in all kinds of workplaces particularly care work to fall under black comedy. This film literally gave me nightmares and will give nightmares to many women who have experienced sexual verbal emotional and verbal assault of the kind that has been overlooked or trivialized.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was a notorious turkey in 1966 but thanks to the recent DVD release it can be reevaluated.  It still doesn't come anywhere near classic status but now we can see it in a format at least a little closer to how it should have been seen in the first place.First the dubbing  the original theatrical release which is the version released on VHS is the single greatest case for subtitles in the history of film.  It was execrable.  On DVD in French with English subtitles the rhythms of the language are preserved and the distraction of having lip movement and the soundtrack so totally at odds with each other is gone. Unfortunately the French track runs through the sequences featuring American stars and that's a little disconcerting though the French actor who dubbed Orson Welles does a very good Orson Welles impression.  The solution of switching language tracks is inelegant but useful.  And there is no German track for the sequences featuring Gert Frobe.  A better solution would have been to go the route of THE LONGEST DAY and run each sequence in the appropriate language with appropriate subtitles but this film did not have a Darryl F. Zanuck producing it willing to make those hard choices.Second  the screen format.  Again the VHS release was not letterboxed and many of the shots and sequences demand the 2.351 ratio particularly in the shots when the Resistance raises the French flag over the Prefecture of Police and Notre Dame.  The VHS version is like going to Paris and looking at everything you see through a cardboard toilet paper tube.What they couldn't do anything about in the DVD release was the allstar American actor casting.  Kirk Douglas looks nothing like George Patton and they made no effort to even try.  Glenn Ford could have looked more like Omar Bradley with a little more attention to makeup but when you're only in a couple of shots and maybe working a couple of days hey why bother right?  At least with Orson Welles as Nordling and Robert Stack as Sibert we don't have the baggage of comparing a historic image to the image of the actor.The biggest complaint about this movie was that it was confusing  well yes but they were confusing times which this movie brings out very well. But to the French a lot of the characters like Colonel Rol and General Leclerc are legendary.  No real explanation of who they were and what they did is needed like Patton would be to an American audience.  So you really do have to know some of the background already.  But for an American audience it is a lot easier if you don't try to keep straight who's who among the Resistance as long as you get the point which IS clear that there were several groups at odds with each other in the days before the Liberation and finally they were able to force the hand of the Allied generals and get them to change their strategy.This film is basically a victim of American ethnocentrism.  As an illustration a while back I was visiting England not long after the film version of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN had been released  and it was shown on the flight over.  At one point while I was there I was discussing the film with our English hosts and they made the telling point that they never could understand what all the fuss about Watergate was about anyway.  In Great Britain a simple vote of no confidence would have been put to Parliament and the government would have been turned out in a Knightsbridge minute.  In IS PARIS BURNING? Americans have no idea of what Nordling Orson Welles is talking about when he asks the German General Choltitz Gert Frobe if he is prepared to take the responsibility for destroying a thousand years of culture and mentions Notre Dame and SainteChappelle. We all know Notre Dame or think we do hunchbacks and all that but SainteChappelle?  Ay there's the rub.  Most Americans don't know that SainteChappelle is the absolute jewel of High Gothic 13th century architecture.  Where Notre Dame is imposing and overwhelming SainteChappelle is elegant and delicate.  And most Americans are not aware that Choltitz is one of the most interesting figures of the war.  He had a reputation for being a very efficient destroyer of cities which is why Hitler gave him the job in the first place  Rotterdam is not mentioned in the film though Stalingrad is  but his facetoface interview with Hitler when he was given the assignment for Paris convinced him that Hitler had completely lost his mind.  His disobedience of the Fuhrer's order meant he was shunned by Wehrmacht veterans after the war but he saved Paris.But if you forget the heythere stunt casting Hey there it's Kirk Douglas!  Hey there it's Orson Welles! and forget trying to identify every single character in every single plot thread and instead view Paris itself as the central character around which everything else revolves then IS PARIS BURNING? can be a very rewarding film.Paul Wilson Theatre Department Methodist College Fayetteville NC".

But the Resistance fighters eventually take over Paris and Van Choltitz decides not to burn the city but to let intact to the liberators  as he thought which destroying it no useful for the future like a mankind legacy.This is a spectacular pseudodocumentary style developing the liberation of Paris with the Resistance factions and tryings to burn the city by Nazy hierarchy . It's a coproduction French and Paramount US with a plethora of international actors many of them playing cameos and prestigious intervention. Special mention to Bruno Cremer as Resistance chief  Orson Welles as Sweden consul and Leslie Caron as fighter wishing to free her husband. The short detailscharacters about Resistance leaders only for a minutes are based on the stories of reallife people. Appear historical characters well incarnated by famous players Omar BradleyGlenn FordGeorge PattonKirk Douglas General LecrecClaude Rich Von CholtitzGet Froebe among others. The title movie comes from the continuous phone calls realized by Hitler to Von Choltitz that always began with  It's Paris burning ?. The movie was filmed in atmospheric black and white which allow the edition adding actuallife footage but also the main reason was the German swastikas flags but the French Mayor rejected to let the black and red in Paris and they would agree sole to gray and black version of flag that looked real when shot.The motion picture displays an interesting script by Gore Vidal and Francis Ford Coppola based on Larry Collins and Dominic Pierre novel who give you a much better perspective about role each Resistance faction played in the Paris liberation. The picture was deservedly nominated to Academy Award for best Art Direction and best cinematography by Marcel Grignon though didn't achieve none. The movie is professionally directed by Rene Clement though sometimes is confuse and contains some flaws.".

But the Resistance fighters eventually take over Paris and Van Choltitz decides not to burn the city but to let intact to the liberators  as he thought which destroying it no useful for the future like a mankind legacy.This is a spectacular pseudodocumentary style developing the liberation of Paris with the Resistance factions and tryings to burn the city by Nazy hierarchy . It's a coproduction French and Paramount US with a plethora of international actors many of them playing cameos and prestigious intervention. Special mention to Bruno Cremer as Resistance chief  Orson Welles as Sweden consul and Leslie Caron as fighter wishing to free her husband. The short detailscharacters about Resistance leaders only for a minutes are based on the stories of reallife people. Appear historical characters well incarnated by famous players Omar BradleyGlenn FordGeorge PattonKirk Douglas General LecrecClaude Rich Von CholtitzGet Froebe among others. The title movie comes from the continuous phone calls realized by Hitler to Von Choltitz that always began with  It's Paris burning ?. The movie was filmed in atmospheric black and white which allow the edition adding actuallife footage but also the main reason was the German swastikas flags but the French Mayor rejected to let the black and red in Paris and they would agree sole to gray and black version of flag that looked real when shot.The motion picture displays an interesting script by Gore Vidal and Francis Ford Coppola based on Larry Collins and Dominic Pierre novel who give you a much better perspective about role each Resistance faction played in the Paris liberation. The picture was deservedly nominated to Academy Award for best Art Direction and best cinematography by Marcel Grignon though didn't achieve none. The movie is professionally directed by Rene Clement though sometimes is confuse and contains some flaws.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good movie but only if you have read the book.  Otherwise it would appear to be muddled and difficult to follow.  There were so many different resistance factions operating in Paris at the time of the liberation it is difficult to keep them straight.  The movie doesn't help you in that regard.  Reading the book gives you a much better perspective on the part each faction played in the liberation.The little vignettes you see with characters appearing in the film for only a few minutes are all true.  Unfortunately they don't always make sense to an uninformed viewer and they give the viewer the sense of a badly edited film.The true story of the last few days before the liberation is extremely remarkable.  Hitler sent a hard core general he trusted to destroy Paris. It is incredible that he disobeyed orders and saved the city.What I really loved about the movie was the city itself.  It is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  The film was shot mostly in the actual locations where the events portrayed took place.  As a lover of history I have been fortunate to have visited Paris more than once and walked these locations fully aware of what happened there.  That makes this movie special for me.  But the film does have problems.Besides being a bit disjointed the French and German dialog were dubbed in English.  It would have been better with subtitles although many of the same actors did their own English dubbing.  The film is in black and white which doesn't bother me but it might have been better in color.  One of the main reasons for BW was the Nazi flags.  The French authorities refused to allow red and black Nazi flags to fly in Paris even for a movie.  They agreed only to have black and gray flags.  But the black and white filming also allowed the blending of authentic war footage with the movie.  Also remember that another similar film The Longest Day was shot a couple of years earlier in BW.The film is filled with a small army of great international actors.  That was fun although I didn't buy Kirk Douglas as General Patton.  Gert Frobe Goldfinger was excellent as the German general in charge of Paris and Charles Boyer was also excellent in his small role.  The music was composed by Maurice Jarre and is just wonderful.  Whenever I am in Paris the music continually runs through my head.  As a side note Jarre obviously borrowed much of this soundtrack for use in Grand Prix.In short this is a historical movie rather than a great film.  I recommend you read the book to get the full impact of the movie.  But understand this remarkable story of the liberation is stranger than fiction which makes it a good read.  And if you ever visit Paris the movie will take on a whole new perspective.".

	schema:headline " Pretty Epic French WWII Film with Shaky Narrative";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Rene Clement brings together the finest French American and German actors of the 1960s for a rather muddled historical epic. Released in 1966 Is Paris Burning? is a rather mixed bag of historical drama and confusion.In August 1944 the Allies are closing in on Paris. Hitler Billy Frick orders General von Cholitz Gert Frobe The Longest Day to take command and burn the city to the ground to prevent its capture. French resistance forces within the city won't permit this to happen and Swedish consul Nordling Orson Welles The Battle of Austerlitz convinces Choltitz to make multiple concessions allowing the resistance to make significant gains and hold on until the armed forces arrive.The allstar cast is uniformly good although many of the American stars have little to do. Gert Frobe is the real star of the piece. As Cholitz he makes a strong and sympathetic character. Cholitz has to make important difficult decisions  on one hand he's concerned about his men's safety on the other he is trying to follow orders. Welles is somewhat engaging but he disappears partway through the film without leaving a lasting impression. The script by Francis Ford Coppola and Gore Vidal combines several stories allowing the host of characters little time to do much of anything. Gallois Pierre Vaneck and Dr. Monod Charles Boyer try to break out of Paris and reach the Allies Colonel Rol Bruno Cremer and Chaban Alain Delon organize the resistance forces Nordling and tries to free Francoise Labe's Leslie Caron Father Goose husband from a POW camp. It's hard for any of these subplots to make much on an impact but like The Longest Day and Battle of Britain the characters are kept distinct enough that they are easy to follow despite major time lapses between appearances.The German characters are portrayed by a host of familiar characteractors. Helmuth Schneider The Dirty Heroes plays a Sergeant who throws a pessimistic Corporal Otto Stern Commandos into a detention cell Gunter Meisner The Bridge at Remagen is his usual evil self as an SS Officer in charge of a prison train Joachim Hansen The Eagle has Landed is a moral officer who tries to help Nordling gain concessions Wolfgang Preiss Von Ryan's Express has little to do as the commander of a demolition squad and KarlOtto Alberty Battle of the Bulge is an SS officer. The American actors tend to have clunky cameos Kirk Douglas In Harm's Way Glenn Ford Casablanca Express Robert Stack and E.G. Marshall are all limited to one or two scenes. Anthony Perkins Catch22 and Skip Ward make more of an impression as infantrymen waiting to liberate Paris.Clement handles every shot brilliantly. There are several standout scenes. One sequence has partisans ambush a German armored car. One soldier escapes still smoldering from burns from an exploded Molotov cocktail. He proceeds to hijack a passing French car and make the driver take him to HQ where his gruesome burns alert the neatandclean officers that something is not right in the city. The scene in which Francoise Labe searches for her husband amongst a throng of prisoners in especially moving and the conclusion is brilliant and unexpected. In another scene a French squad occupied an old woman's apartment to fire on a German barricade as the old woman watches while preparing herself a cup of tea. In another scene SS officers arrive to secure a painting for Hitler's birthday from the Louvre before Frobe burns down the city. Frobe informs them that the Louvre is in French hands and they reply But it's right across the street! Without missing a beat Frobe tells them to take a white flag over and see if the French will let them in. This grim humor and wit add to the human story within the big picture.A lot of attention to historical accuracy and detail went into the film's production. Costumes from French civilian dress to military uniforms are all accurate. The exteriors are beautifully shot in and around Paris often with excellently staged wide shots showing off the narrow streets and just how vast and battleground was. The scenes of the French resistance gathering in the streets to march on the Police Station set to Maurice Jarre's thundering jovial score are most memorable. The spirit of revolution and joy of liberation is so wellportrayed that you can feel it with the characters on screen.Is Paris Burning? suffers from annoyingly bad dubbing overlength and a lack of focus but these are nicks in any epic film and cannot be avoided in order to tell such a vast story. As its heart Is Paris Burning? is a fine movie about human freedom told with brilliance and gusto.".

	schema:reviewBody "About 350 years earlier Henry of Navarre had captured just about all of France but Paris and had been ruling as Henry IV for about five years but he decided he wasn't really king without his capital. He converted to the Catholic religion and Paris became united with the rest of the country. Henry decided that Paris was indeed worth a mass.Fast forward to 1944. Maybe militarily Paris wasn't worth that much in defeating Hitler but for the morale of a people being liberated from a brutal conqueror it was invaluable. When the forces of the Resistance in its many branches could no longer be contained with Allied armies only days from Paris battle plans got changed and a Free French Division under General Phillippe Leclerc went in and helped the Resistance take the city.Paris bruletil is the French cinema's answer to The Longest Day. It is dotted with cameos from French German and American film players and makes very effective use of newsreel footage blended into the finished product. You really do think you are watching an actual filmed record of the events as they happened.The lead in this film is German actor Gert Frobe better known to audiences as James Bond nemesis Goldfinger. The film opens with him being given command of the city by Hitler himself and given very specific orders to destroy the city before it was recaptured.Frobe knows it and finally admits that the war is lost. He's concerned about what history will think of him should he do this terrible thing. He gets a direct order from Hannes Messemer playing Alfred Jodl and a reminder of what Hitler does to those who disobey him. Frobe's character General Von Choltitz died shortly after this film debuted and Jodl was executed after being tried at Nuremberg. JeanPaul Belmondo Alain Delon JeanPierre Cassel Yves Montand are all playing roles of Resistance members. Leslie Caron has a poignant small part as a woman trying unsuccessfully to get her husband freed before the Nazis ship him off to Germany before retreating. Americans in this film are Kirk Douglas as General Patton Glenn Ford as General Bradley and Robert Stack as General Siebert. Those three were put in briefly to insure some American box office in a French story. Funny no one thought of Douglas for the Patton biographical film classic four years later.Orson Welles has a much bigger part as the Swedish consul general in Paris who negotiates between the Nazis and the Resistance before the Free French Division arrives. Another one of those brilliantly executed parts by Welles he did to get money for his own projects.Director Rene Clement really made the people of Paris the star of this film. It is their tribute picture and a terrible reminder to people in every nation what it is like to live under a tyranny.".

	schema:reviewBody "I made my first trip to Paris this past year. There are remembrances of World War Two on nearly every street corner plaques with the names of resistance fighters who died during the war and during the Liberation. And France's military history is also on display from monuments to Louis XIII to Napoleon and to their Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe. As Americans we forget sometimes that the French army lost millions during World War One and struggled with how to fight the Second World War. Losing Paris was a humiliating defeat that the Free French army needed desperately to avenge. This film does a pretty engaging job of telling the story from a French point of view. Like many war films from the time it's a little too long some celebrity cameos are miscast and some facts and events are abridged. But unlike some other films from the period it has some humor and some great pathos. There's also great footage of the real liberation intercut with the narrative. If you've ever been to Paris it's a beautiful travelogue of all the famous public spaces seen through eyes from 1945 and 1966. I can only imagine seeing it in widescreen and I hope to get a nondubbed version soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whoever was responsible for writing the first half of the movie botched it. The script fails to set up the story leaving the movie without the necessary tension. The second half on the other hand is very good and follows the the details of the book closely.The first half of the movie is devoid of the suspense found in the book. The viewer is left with a bored who cares attitude to the events we see of the French Resistance. The book is different.I lent the book to a friend who read it in less than two days. I on the other hand savored it reading a portion at a time of the wonderfully detailed accounts of hundreds of French Germans and Americans reported by the two authors Larry Collins and Dominique LaPierre. I am a journalist and this is the most magnificent job of reporting I have ever read. I asked my friend why she was in such a hurry and she said she wanted to see how it ended! You see the key to the book is found in the title Is Paris Burning? This question recurs throughout the book. Will General von Choltitz have to destroy all of Paris part of Paris or will it be spared? How will he handle this order? Von Choltitz' position on this is not made clear until more than halfway into the movie and even then the issue as described in the book is never stated explicitly. When you know the whole story von Choltitz' pivotal heroic role is clear. But the movie drops the ball on this. Perhaps the French director was not willing to go that far. Back in the early 1960s many Europeans who lived through the war were not willing to forgive the Germans any German. My father was French. Nearly all of his family were killed by the Germans. So I know. But the price paid by the director is a botched movie.General Dietrich von Choltitz is the true hero it is he who saved Paris from destruction. He died shortly after the movie was released. I suspect he was at least a little disappointed by the movie but from what I have read he lived quietly and I doubt he did what he did to be thanked I think he did it because it was right. That's the picture I got from the book.The book and I am going from memory here begins with von Choltitz being called to see Hitler as does the movie. The book makes it clear that von Choltitz realizes that Hitler is now insane and the war is lost the movie does not have von Choltitz state this until halfway through. Next on a train he encounters a Gestapo officer by chance who has written new guidelines to make sure all officers in the field follow orders despite the impending collapse of the war If they fail to obey orders their families will be slaughtered and their homes and possessions destroyed. So he now knows the price if he fails to destroy Paris on Hitler's orders. That is how the book opens. The movie NEVER states that von Choltitz's family could be killed. But at the end right before his surrender von Choltitz asks General Speidel to see that his family does not suffer.Von Choltitz had destroyed other cities in Eastern Europe a fact not stated by the movie. That is why Hitler chose him. But he realizes from the beginning that there was no military point to destroying Paris as a simple act of vengeance and he never had any intention of carrying it out. Therefore he had to perform a delicate dance with the Resistance to satisfy German command and to avoid things getting out of control so that the Germans forced the total destruction of the city. That is the tension that drove the book it is almost completely missing from the first half of the movie. How will von Choltitz balance the two forces?While von Choltitz acted the tough German general in the beginning he soon had several sympathetic conversations with the Resistance pleading with them not to force his hand. The most astonishing detail of the book is that it is von Choltitz who called in the Resistance and told them to cross the German lines and go to the Allies and ask them to invade Paris and hurry! If they did not he would be forced to set off the explosives set throughout Paris. This is almost entirely missing from the movie though there is the scene with Consul Nordling that suggests this.There are a number of historical inaccuracies mainly in the first half of the movie as I recall from the book. One odd error is that the movie has von Choltitz being asked by a German general why he did not call in the Luftwaffe to bomb Paris. Actually he did do one bombing run to placate the Germans and buy time of a Parisian slum. Not of the Parisian monuments Hitler wanted destroyed.The second half of the movie is excellent virtually all of the detailed dialogue is true even of those who die seconds later reconstructed by hundreds of interviews. The scene where the soldiers invite themselves into the old lady's apartment who sits happily by as if it were a tea party as they kill Germans is true. It was one of the highlights of the book in my opinion.One memorable detail missing from the movie is that as von Choltitz is taken through the streets as a prisoner of war a woman spits on him reminiscent of A Tale of Two Cities. It was one of the great ironies of the book for it was von Choltitz who had saved her city. But the Parisians did not know this.".

The second half on the other hand is very good and follows the the details of the book closely.The first half of the movie is devoid of the suspense found in the book. The viewer is left with a bored who cares attitude to the events we see of the French Resistance. The book is different.I lent the book to a friend who read it in less than two days. I on the other hand savored it reading a portion at a time of the wonderfully detailed accounts of hundreds of French Germans and Americans reported by the two authors Larry Collins and Dominique LaPierre. I am a journalist and this is the most magnificent job of reporting I have ever read. I asked my friend why she was in such a hurry and she said she wanted to see how it ended! You see the key to the book is found in the title Is Paris Burning? This question recurs throughout the book. Will General von Choltitz have to destroy all of Paris part of Paris or will it be spared? How will he handle this order?

When you know the real voices of Cremer DelonDux etc you're exasperated from the very first minute. I watched the movie on YouTube. And I stopped one third from the end when Bradley gives Leclerc the go to liberate Paris.There are also huge missing and errors. Nordling had a heart attack on August 22nd and his brother Rolf met Bradley the next day to get Leclerc . Others claim it was Gallois? Who tells the truth especially at the time the book was written and the film shot? But of course we all know of the antagonism between the Communist resistance and the other side! Thank god the communists did not win in the end to take power as they would surely have if permitted. De Gaulle was there to prevent such an eventuality. I doubt unless Morandat gave the information to the production that he did not know where Matignon was located.No although Ren Clment is a great director I don't think this is a masterpiece and this major event of Paris history remained to be treated with more accuracy and it would not need 3 so long hours to digest. A French movie has been released this year 2014 Diplomatie  httpwww.imdb.comtitlett3129564  which I have not seen fearing that again it was betraying history. It would appear that it presents the decision not to burn Paris in a 24 hours period. Only those having seen the movie can answer the question. It is certain that it took more than that to make Von Choltitz take his decision.The best review of Ren CLment's movie is probably the one of SgtSlaughter on this site. He clearly exposes why it is so important in our history I'm French and living in Paris since 1953. I'm not surprised to see that there are no reviews by french people here the movie doesn't deserve it.".

No I have not read the book but I will put it on my list of books to read. Nevertheless good history doesn't always guarantee classic movies and Is Paris Burning remains hopelessly questionable in my opinion. Before I generate a laundry list of flaws let me tote up the assets. First Maurice Jarre's orchestral soundtrack qualifies as nothing short of brilliant because he captures the atmosphere and the drama in the events. Second Marcel Taxi to Tobruk Grignon's black  white widescreen cinematography rivals Jarre's score in the epic scope that it confers on the film. The producers clearly filmed this movie on location in the City of the Lights and the filmmakers may be applauded for giving the film a documentary flavor. The performances raised no concerns for me except for Kirk Douglas looking like he was on vacation when the casting director caught him and convinced him to portray General Patton did raise an eyebrow. Is Paris Burning is a professionally mounted motion picture and there is no evidence of a shoestring budget. Ultimately however what undoes IS Paris Burning is the overlong Gore Vidal  Francis Ford Coppola screenplay along with the other acknowledged contributions from other scenarists because there are no truly sympathetic characterjust too many to keep track of the storyline is episodic to the point of incoherence and the entire movie wears out its welcome by the time that it pauses nearly two hours later for an intermission. There is no quotable dialogue and I felt like a lot of information that I learned on IMDb.COM should have been in the film itself. At the intermission I wish that Paris had burned in the movie BUT NOT IN REAL LIFE. As a World War II military history scholar I can now appreciate the historical contribution that Is Paris Burning makes in its cinematic context but as a film consumer this bland obtuse yarn just makes me yawn.".

	schema:reviewBody "Is Paris Burning is the description of the fall of Paris and Hitler's order in such an event to destroy the city. It is a detailed description giving point of perspectives from all participants from German Commander Choltitz French Resistance Leader Rol and the advancing Allied Army. Thus it is quite long approaching almost three hours and feels like a combination of a drama and documentary. Even though some events and actions may be disputed it feels plausible. And if you like me like war movies Is Paris Burning is interesting despite its length. It actually never became dull but not really entertaining either because of the documentarian feel. There was little suspense or surprising developments. We just tagged along with the story with neither we or characters being able to change anything.It is quite interesting that the movie was filmed quite recent after the fact when measured up with seriousness and the trauma of the event. Also that German officers are portrayed by Germans most notably Frbe. Also check the trivia why it was filmed in black and white.The movie is also augmented by its cast list it is almost worth watching because of it which among many others include Alain Delon Kirk Douglas Orson Welles JeanPaul Belmondo Anthony Perkins Yves Montand  Jean Pierre Cassel and along with Frbe Goldfinger Michel Lonsdale Sir Hugo Drax Moonraker is the second Bond villain to appear. Also written by Gore Vidal and Francis Ford Coppola.510".

	schema:headline " An epic portrayal of the liberation of Paris starring the city itself";
	schema:reviewBody "What gigantic and difficult project! Gore Vidal and Francis Ford Coppola collaborated on a screenplay which would portray the vast subject of the liberation of Paris in a lively and coherent manner despite the sprawling content and disparate multiple story lines and endless variety of locations. The fact that they succeeded at all is a miracle. Many characters appear in the film as miniature cameos their stories lasting only one or two minutes which is one reason why these cameo appearance were 'heightened' by using a cast consisting of a large number of famous movie stars of the 1960s all of whose faces were well known at that time both American and French. The best production decision taken was to entrust the directing of the film to the famous French director Ren Clement 19131996 who even at this time was a grand old man of French cinema and commanded transatlantic confidence due to the success of FORBIDDEN GAMES 1952 in America and Britain nominated for an Oscar won a Bafta and New York Critics Circle Award etc. He had also just directed THE LOVE CAGE 1964 with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda in English. This film was made in both French and English versions with a lot of German speakers as well and had dubbing which was often imperfect. The film was also based on two separate books dealing with the subject. French and German script collaborators prepared the dialogue for scenes involving those nationalities. Making this film was practically a military exercise it was so complicated. Orson Welles has a substantial role as the Swedish Consul in Paris who was always trying to save French prisoners but the main part in the film is really that of General von Cholitz brilliantly performed by the German actor Gert Frbe who has a wonderful way of swallowing 'Ja' mumbling frowning and looking troubled for all the world as if he really is in charge of the occupation of Paris. The title of the film refers to the fact that von Cholitz has been given explicit orders by Hitler to destroy Paris. Near the end of the film while the liberation is taking place a phone lying off the hook in his nowabandoned office is screaming 'Is Paris burning? Is Paris burning?' Obviously I am giving away no secrets about the film by revealing that von Cholitz defies the order to destroy Paris as most people are presumably aware that Paris still exists. But just in case viewers of the film had their doubts about what it really means to destroy a city this film includes horrifying footage of the total destruction of Warsaw. Throughout this film eager SS men are seen planting bombs beneath the Eiffel Tower the bridges over the Seine in Napoleon's Tomb and the Chamber of Deputies ready for von Cholitz's order to detonate everything at once. And this is a true story it came within a hair's breadth of happening. This film was made in black and white so that there could be seamless intercutting with real footage of the liberation. The result is totally satisfactory and very unnerving. Much of the footage was shot by Resistance fighters at the time. The film thus achieves a tremendous sense of immediacy and realism in many parts. The French Government and Municipality of Paris gave total cooperation whole streets such as the Champs Elyse and the Place de la Concorde were cleared of people and traffic and no effort was spared to make the entire city of Paris available to portray itself. This film really does ultimately star the city itself in a way which has probably never happened before or since in the entire history of the cinema. The achievement should thus not be underestimated. Such a thing will and can never happen again. It is true that Kirk Douglas does not at all resemble General Patton and Glenn Ford looks nothing like General Omar Bradley but these factors were wisely ignored by the producers who focused only on the events and the epic itself. Jacques ChabanDelmas must have been very flattered to be portrayed by the handsome Alain Delon. Billy Frick does an excellent cameo of Hitler near the beginning of the film. Some of the stars such as Anthony Perkins have more extended roles and he in particular lends great pathos to the eager young GI who has always wanted to see Paris and is so thrilled to enter a real Paris caf even though he has never drunk wine before and wonders if he should. Simone Signoret's smile as wide as a boulevard lights up a small part but poor Yves Montand gets shot in the back by a German sniper. Tragedy is not at all spared in this gritty portrayal of real events and many genuine persons. JeanLouis Trintignant gets stuck with the part of a slimy collaborator responsible for the murder of 30 young people. I remember so well seeing this when it first came out in a huge cinema in 70 mm widescreen with the rousing music of Maurice Jarre blaring out. It made a huge impression on everyone I knew at the time and was a major cultural event not just a cinematic one. Maybe it never earned its money back despite the fact that the French authorities probably did not charge. But it stirred the public and brought the lessons of history home to them. After seeing this no one could say that Paris was a faraway city of which he knew nothing. And that is what this project was all about to portray the world's most romantic city in its greatest moment of danger and to see how narrowly it survived being wiped from the face of the earth by madmen. When I see the plaques all over Paris today to the brave Resistance fighters I always give a thought for their courage.".

But Frobe's stern yet surprisingly sensitive portrayal of Von Coltitz is as brilliant and as sympathetic a performance as you will ever see of a portrait of a Wehrmacht officer.Jarre's soaring theme music The Paris Waltz at the end of the film with the liberation of Paris the film changes from an oppressive black and white to a spectacular segue to glorious color. It is as sublimely joyous and unabashedly sincerely emotional a moment in cinema as any I have ever experienced. I cannot imagine anyone who has been to the City of Light feeling anything but jubilation and appreciation in watching this film despite it's minor flaws.My feeling after the film concluded was this what a profound loss it would have been if Paris was indeed reduced to ashes. General Von Coltitz' humanity in refusing Hitler's Satanic order was a coupe de grace that history will probably forget. What a shame.".

I have not seen The Longest Day and I remember The Bridge at Remagen as plodding and slow. I own The Dirty Dozen The Great Escape and Patton. These are great films indeed. But if you have seen just one of them you have essentially seen all three. The war movies from the sixties were all about the rugged tough guys wanting to stick it to some German commandant except Patton.Is Paris Burning? is a documentarystyle film that puts you right in the heart of the war in Europe. But many things are missing things like the stoic RAF commander who sleeps around The Battle of Britain the US Navy airman who falls in love with a Japanese girl Midway or every guy in the film being referred to as Mister any war movie from the sixties. In other words Is Paris Burning? does not deviate for one second from its story. The flow is strong and the action is simply mindblowing especially for 1966. Moreover as much as we have a reason to not like the French at the moment they deserve their due honor and respect in history. Go ahead call me a traitor and tarandfeather me. The cinematography in Is Paris Burning? is daring and articulate. The cinematography is also reminiscent of The Passion of Joan of Arc silent and Schindler's List. I loved this film!!! It made we wish I was with the Resistance in Paris back then.".

Lacking a cohesive narrative as well as one specific person's point of view this is a very distant film. There's too much going on. While scenes of Allied tanks rolling into Nazioccupied Paris are extremely moving much of the film despite myriad cameos by the likes of Anthony Perkins Simone Signoret Charles Boyer and Kirk Douglas is not particularly involving. Certainly it's exciting and full of action but it's also far too hectic for its own good. It's as if Clment was afraid to leave ANYTHING tied to the Resistance out. Still there's much to recommend. Clment is mostly successful at blending documentary footage with his film and some of the performances are terrific. Claude Rich is a standout as the deceptively clever Gnral Leclerc and Jean Paul Belmondo adds a lot of color as a none too bright freedom fighter. Orson Welles has some moments as the Resistancefriendly Swedish Consul and Gert Frbe's portrayal of German Gnral Von Choltitz avoids the onedimensional crazed Nazi route unfortunately Gnter Meisner takes that prize as a very ornery SS goon. Maurice Jarre's music score is suitably patriotic and Marcel Grignon's cinematography is excellent. Yves Montand Alain Delon Leslie Caron and Robert Stack also appear.".

Due to the many characters and storyplots it all comes over rather incoherent and sometimes muddled as often quite important characters appear and disappear without no particular reason. Every major French star of the sixties is in this. Delon as the later famous politician ChabanDelmas Belmondo who still can't keep a straight face but also Michel Piccoli Claude Rich JP Cassel Yves Montand as a tank driver and so on. Some US actors get also thrown in but besides Orson Welles they have really no more then an extended cameo appearance. The one pivotal character who also holds together the 2 main segments of the movie is General Von Choltitz the German governor of Parisexcellently portrayed by Gerd Froebe. Von choltitz is right in theirfrom the start and keeps being on the screen continuously until the very last minutes his surrender of course. By the way the screenplay based on the bestseller of CollinsLapierrewas written by none other then Francis Ford Coppola and Gore Vidal.But this is of course mainly a French show besides the actors it has a French producer and a French director and last but not least Paris itself so there is quite a lot of French flagwaving going on giving the impression that 95  of the Parisians were in the Resistance'. In reality it was more of the opposite at least until the liberation. Keep also in mind that a few months prior to these events large numbers of Parisians were cheering Marechal Ptain the leader of the Vichy collaboration government. But despite all its many plot lines and overall length it is competently directed and features quite some wellstaged and realistic battle scenes from numerous firefights in the Parisian streets blowing up German vehicles tanks crashing into each other and culminating in the storming of the German 'Kommandantur'. All in all this is like The Longest day ' la franaise' featuring many stars and stories filmed in blackandwhite in 70 mm it really needs to be seen on the big screen and essentially a propaganda piece on one of the few exploits of the French during WWII.I saw the letterboxed version on French TV with everybody speaking French. The best version is of course with everybody speaking their own language.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd like to recommend this movie because it deals with a subject of such historic significance but I found it confusing. It meanders all over the place like the Seine. The Germans have been ordered to destroy the city including its historical monuments by an insane Adolf Hitler if it is ever in danger of falling into Allied hands. That's clear enough but then the waters turn turbid. The General in charge Gert Frobe is reluctant to follow the order for humanitarian reasons but will evidently do what he's told. He's held up by the French resistance who gather their small arms and fire on German patrols. They were a lot more organized than I'd realized. A messenger is sent to the Americans to ask them to divert from their plans to destroy the German army and aid in the liberation of Paris. The request reaches General Bradley who agrees. The Free French Army enters Paris followed by the Amis and shortly the Germans are subdued and the city saved.For me the most stirring moment is when two men activate the bells of Notre Dame. What a job. The huge old chimes weight tons and are covered with cobwebs and it takes a heap of huffing and puffing to get the clappers going but this is the liberation of Paris.It's one of those spotthestars movies with more famous faces than you can count and every other time one of them first appears on screen the director Rene Clement moves the camera in for a close up in case you might miss the dimple in the middle of Kirk Douglas's chin. Well maybe it's understandable since you've only got about 30 seconds to spot it. A central character would probably have helped to integrate these loosely linked tesserae.The sound is so terrible it distracts a viewer from the already fragmented story. The voices are all dubbed of course and only occasionally by their reallife owners like Orson Welles and Tony Perkins in a stereotypical and dispensable role. The gun shots sound as if they were lifted from an inexpensive Italian war movie. Loud incidental noises have been added to the sound track  the crunching of boots on gravel the clicks of a bolt action rifle. Maurice Jarre's score isn't bad however closely it resembles some of his other works during this period.The visuals are okay. Some blackandwhite news footage from the street fighting is integrated into the drama. But it's not a gripping film and not very innovative. If a man is shot he twirls around and dies in conventional Hollywood fashion. Nice shots of some Parisian tourist spots though. We get a good look at Napolean's tomb.I'm glad that Paris wasn't destroyed. The greatest sandwich I ever had was at a nondescript caf in the Gare du Nord. And it's good to see the Free French Army in combat in a movie like this. They may have been organized in exile but they did a splendid job alongside the rest of the Allies in Italy particularly at Monte Cassino.".

	schema:headline " Very disappointing!";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember sitting alone in the dress circle of a huge city cinema when this film was released in its 165minute version. It was dubbed of course. Only Orson Welles Leslie Caron Kirk Douglas Glenn Ford Charles Boyer Anthony Perkins Simone Signoret Robert Stack George Chakiris and Skip Ward were permitted to dub their own lines. Everyone else in the cast was at the mercy of some very inept dubbers indeed. So with the DVD I decided to watch the French version which is certainly a vast improvement. Welles Caron Boyer and Signoret continue to voice their own lines but now they are joined by the entire French cast. Main drawback is that Gert Frbe who has the movie's lead role is still inadequately dubbed. Director Ren Clement of La Bataille du Rail 1943 and Plein Soliel 1959 would seem an excellent choice but the movie's longwinded script seems to have overwhelmed him. The sluggish pace is not helped by extraneous episodes Montand Perkins Chakiris and vignettes. I can appreciate an editor's reluctance to eliminate many of the guest spots but the movie's pace would undoubtedly improve a great deal without them. Some of the action wellstaged though it is also needs to be trimmed. On the other hand Gert Frbe's character is poorly developed and needs more exposition. What do we know about him at film's end? Virtually nothing! So little in fact that his acts and final summation all come as a complete surprise.".

The villain Yu is ruthless in this one who doesn't let anything or anyone stand in his way especially Jet.  Their battles are fast and intense.  I think the final fight is so creative and had me on edge to see what would happen next.  I've never seen benches and tables used in that way.  Really cool.Supporting cast includes Josepine Siao as Miss Fong who provides for a lot of laughs.  She is at her best when she has to intervene for her son and has a great way of explaining things!  Ting Ting Michelle Reis has a little competition with pretty Angie Amy Kwok and I like how they included a triangle in this one.Overall this has more action and less comedy than the first one.  You cannot miss when Jet dons the shades.  Super cool.".

All the characters are great! and the story is really cool plus Jet Li is simply amazing in this!. The fight choreography is phenomenal and all the characters are extremely likable! plus I thought the finale was especially awesome. It had some pretty cool flashbacks and it had some great comedy in it too plus Jet had excellent chemistry with Josephine Siao!. The whole love triangle was amusing however the villain in this is just plain annoying and is nowhere near as good as the one in the 1st plus while the fight scenes are fantastic they can't match the 1st in that department either!. The finale does get quite intense and the ending is really amusing however Fong's father absence is clearly felt as he had a great character in the 1st!. It's also a bit more serious then the 1st and as I said it lacks a good villain however Jet and Josephine Siao carry this and make it a highly enjoyable sequel to one of Jet's best films! and while it's not as good as the 1st I still loved it the fight scenes and performances are fantastic and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is awesome. Corey Yuen does an awesome job here with great camera work cool angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is excellent. Jet Li is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable hilarious kicks that ass had wonderful chemistry with Josephine Siao had a great smile and used the same formula that made his character so lovable in the 1st! Jet Rules!!!!!. Josephine Siao is wonderful as Fong's mother she also used the great formula that mad her so hilarious in the 1st and it also helped that her dubbing was better then usual I loved her!. Michelle Reis and Amy Kwok are great as the love interests and do what they have to do well. The Main bad guy is way too annoying and hammy to be that menacing and really brought the film down. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. 12 out of 5".

	schema:headline " Not as all round entertaining as the first but still pretty funny and pretty enjoyable";
	schema:reviewBody "Newly married Fong Sai Yuk has joined the secret society of the red flower seeking to over throw the oppressive Emperor and establish a new dynasty in its place. When a soothsayer declares that the leader of the society is actually in line to be Emperor but that he sees one of his closest friends will betray him while another will intervene to rescue him. With this news the leader sends a group of men to capture a box belonging to a rival a box that holds the truth about his lineage. When the first mission fails Fong is sent on a more covert mission to try and get the box  however the internal conflict within the Red Flower society is great and the presence of Fong's mother isn't really helping his stature with his peers.Having really enjoyed the first Fong Sai Yuk film I was looking forward to this film and despite it being a bit less fun it was an enjoyable film. The plot is a bit better than the first film and is easier to get into once it settles down from the first few minutes but it is more serious than it needed to be and it sucks a lot of the comedy out of it at the same time. This is a bit of a problem since the thing I enjoyed about the first film was that it was pretty freewheeling and funny but it wasn't a problem to the point that I disliked the film just to the point where it didn't feel like it was being loyal to the spirit of the first film. It still does have the same sense of humour but it has fewer chances to come through despite still having enough laughs to do the job. Some are inspired lunacy the chicken nerve freeze but others are unintentional witness if you will the hilariously fake horses they are seen riding in close up shots.The action is fun but not as impressive as it could have been with only some of the fights really being technically impressive as well as fun. Jet Li still has a good presence but despite not being as well served by the material he is still a good lead. However as with the first film it is left to Siao to produce a lot of laughs and the film noticeably lightens whenever she is on screen yes she gets dragged into the darker side of the story as well but for the most part she is a funny without being made a straight 'comic' character if you pardon the oxymoron in those words. Reis and ChuenHua are both good looking and pretty funny in their various roles and it adds a romantic thread to the film that it benefits from. The leader is pretty good but the main bad guy was a bit hammy and looked too weird to really be the cunning insider that the plot would have us believe he was. Everyone is OK but whenever Mother Fong is absent for any length of time it is very telling.Overall this is a fun and silly film that will give some laughs intentionally and unintentionally. Those who enjoyed the first film will notice that this is weaker in several regards but generally it delivers enough to be worth mentioning in the same breath. The cast try hard but the material isn't there often enough to back them  happily Li is always a good presence and Siao is a force in regards comedy and action.".

Reis and ChuenHua are both good looking and pretty funny in their various roles and it adds a romantic thread to the film that it benefits from. The leader is pretty good but the main bad guy was a bit hammy and looked too weird to really be the cunning insider that the plot would have us believe he was. Everyone is OK but whenever Mother Fong is absent for any length of time it is very telling.Overall this is a fun and silly film that will give some laughs intentionally and unintentionally. Those who enjoyed the first film will notice that this is weaker in several regards but generally it delivers enough to be worth mentioning in the same breath. The cast try hard but the material isn't there often enough to back them  happily Li is always a good presence and Siao is a force in regards comedy and action.";

Most of the humour is very well done and I really enjoyed it. The story is above average as well which is a bonus with KungFu films.The action scenes are done very well and look great. One scene in particular at the end when Fong Sai Yuk is walking down a street to rescue his mother and is confronted by several men looks great and the slow motion buildup to the beginning is excellent.".

I sore the mandarin edition on the channel 4 TV and managed to get it on video with a few minutes missing. I tried very hard to get hold of a copy of the film but with no luck.To day while checking the local video rental store I found The Legend 2 Also known as Fong Shi Yung or Fong Sai Yong'. With delight I rented it thinking of the English edition of the same film I had enjoyed many times.A few hours later I watched the film with disgust as it was an American dubbed voice with no feeling or matching of the characters. To make matters worst the script was terrible nothing of the same script as the mandarin edition which was funny interesting and meaningful. This edition was like as episode of an American TV show attempting to mimic a successful film it was like watching a cheap meaning less film on sky TV which had not been successful enough in America to be tried any where in the world. The original oriental feel which inspired me so much was ruined if I call it that it was not there it was cold meaning less and plain TERRIBLE. The soundtrack which helped give the film its graceful rhythm was cheap and badly done making it sound like an episode of the power rangers IT WAS TERRIBLE.When people want films from other countries they want them as they are shown in the country it was made for with sub titles or good audio dubbing with correct feels with the correct soundtrack and if they cart do that they should leave sub titles and not mess it up.The film is nearly 10 years old and is only just coming to some of the world. Many people have been waiting to be able to buy this film this cheap edition film I sore was terrible meaning less and some thing which would never even touch Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon if it had a stick as big as the Titanic in length.I was so bored by the new script that I turned it off even though I tried very hard to sit to the end to see if the film was even possibly enjoyable I ended up with at least 40mins till the end.End result TERRIBLE and nothing of the good stuff the film was striped from.Rest In Peace".

I'm not talking on the level of BRAINDEAD here but there are tons of breaking bones blood spurts and other nasty goodies that will no doubt delight action fans who enjoy these kind of special effects for what they are. Yuen has assembled many returning cast members especially memorable is Josephine Siao as Jet's mum who has even more slapstick here than in the first film! is that possible? Sadly Jet's tubby assistant only gets a onescene cameo but it's nice that they thought of him anyway.Li himself is excellent in the martial arts sequences though he seems to struggle with the heavier drama still this matters not when there's so much asskicking going on around him. I especially loved the big bald villain of the piece whose head seems about to explode all the time and the climatic showdown between him and Li is excellent making great use of the wire work. Imaginative touches  such as the 'nerve blocking'  round off what is altogether a very pleasurable film.".

In that regard this movie does an impressive job at tying some knots like showing how the twofaced thing came to be as well as the origin of the dog from the start of Carpenter's Thing.

One of the scariest things of Carpenter's version is the practical effects of the thing. They were horrifying. Here all subtlety is thrown out the window in favor of huge CGI monsters. It's effectively used in a couple scenes but the monsters lose their scariness after a while and it just becomes gratuitous. The characters themselves are paper thin. What helped make the '82 version so fantastic is that we got to know the characters their quirks their personalities and we were able to empathize with their situations. In this movie half of the characters are interchangeable. I didn't even know most of their names. And worse yet I didn't care about any of them. There's one particular scene that calls back to Carpenter's infamous blood test scene where I realized that most of these people are really dumb and I don't care if any of them die. That's not good in a horror movie. By that point it was just a waiting game for them to get picked off one by one.The lead performances are strong. For the material they were given Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Joel Edgerton do a fine job. But that simply isn't enough to carry a movie like this. The Thing is supposed to be scary and for the most part it isn't. That's a failure by horror standards.

I would have screamed for totally different reasons than the directors intended if this movie had turned out like those awful AvP movies ruination for both onceproud franchises or one of George Lucas' prequels. Most of the negative critiques I am hearing are folks complaining that this movie was the same as the 1982 Carpenter movie or unoriginal because it involved the same basic plot premise. HELLO!!!!! Read the director's interviews that is EXACTLY what they were shooting for!! This movie is supposed to be the same genre the same mood the same eventual outcome it is supposed to be a companion piece to the 1982 Carpenter movie! The director's stated goal was to create a prequel that was both RESPECTFUL of the original and that you could pop the 1982 movie in after watching this one and not notice much of a difference. The directors went to great lengths to ensure everything from the original movie was explained in regards to the Norwegians and the many clues left around their camp in the 1982 segment. They did not make it stupid by adding some gangster rapper to the cast to give the movie massappeal they didn't try to introduce some cheesy lovestory they didn't have to use nudity of some hottie chick to draw an audience. The movie stands on its own but probably won't ever be that popular for just those reasons. THE THING 2011 draws on the same mental resources as the 1982 movie and establishes the same results a very good thing. Too much CGI of course but that cannot be avoided in this day and age. To sum it up if you liked the 1928 Carpenter movie you will like this one as well the movie was complete with a dissection scene with halfabsorbed people no less a climactic battle with a superthing and the usual expected paranoia. They took the time to actually setup the mood and to give the characters some personality as opposed to some rushed effectsladen George Lucas CGIfest. I have not ever seen any of the other movies by this director but am willing to give it a try after seeing this movie. Not too bad at all....especially if you are a diehard fan of the Carpenter version.".

I myself happen to be a student of oldschool horror and I am DEFINITELY a loyal fan of Carpenter's classic and I thought that this movie held strong for itself. It's like all those people out there that complain that The Godfather Part 3 was terrible when in reality it was a good movie on its own. Compared to the rest of the series it was weak but like this movie was good on its own. Yes we get it. Its not the original. It doesn't keep the creature out of sight as much. Okay get over it. Keeping the audience guessing was in in the late 70searly 80s and I loved that. Thats why it worked in The Thing Alien etc. But its 2011 and as much as I miss the suspense and guessing games of those times we're in a new era where films sadly use more CG and flashy scenes than character development by the way where was the superb character development in the original? both films are HORROR movies about a group of people we know nothing about as we watch them try to survive. Did we really ever learn anything about Kurt Russell's family? or what Keith David's favorite football team was? and good old SaviniBakeresque special effects. But this movie in my opinion was made for those loyal fans thatwhile watching the first film were saying Wow I'd love to know what happened at this Norwegian camp before Kurt Russell got here! And it did just that. It led right up to the events of the first film while telling a separate while similar interesting story. It explained minute details from the first film that we were left wondering about. It recreated the Norwegian camp as viewed in the first film. It did everything in its power to remain true to the first film while also giving us a reason to pay and see a NEW MOVIE. In our day and age where it seems like every other horror movie that comes out is a remake of a classic from years ago due to lack of original ideas? its nice to see a prequel instead of a remake. Its nice to see a movie that tries to tell an original story while keeping just enough elements in there to hook loyal fans of the original film. If you're going to the theater to watch Carpenter's The Thing which it seems like all these 'loyal fans of the original' were expecting though I don't know why... then don't see it. If you loved Carpenter's film and want to see a fun NEW story that perhaps answers some questions you've wanted answered then see this. Remember its not Carpenter's film and its not trying to be. Its another movie just giving a bit of an homage to Carpenter's classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "When it was announced that this was going into production there was a level of confusioncuriosity regarding what exactly it would be remakerebootsequelprequel? Also would it utilize prosthetic effects like the 1982 original or would it go all out CGI splatter? As it turns out it's a combination of the former and the latter. The new 'The Thing' wants to have its cake and eat it too you see technically it's a prequel but for some reason the makers have molded it as kind of a remake as well. That's both clever and rather infuriating in equal measures. With regards to the effects yes they are CGI for the most part but they look practical and are done well.Storywise with the exception of some additions it hits the same beats as John Carpenter's original movie too. An alien vessel is discovered frozen in the Antarctic permafrost by a Norwegian research team. Finding a mysterious life form they bring it back to their research station. Even though there's no mention of an American in the original the makers shoehorn one in here clearly unconvinced that a movie comprised entirely of Europeans would sell. And likewise it's a female  once again you get the feeling they're not confident that an all male cast would sell this time round and are taking no chances. The American a palaeontologist Mary Elizabeth Winstead is drafted into the equation by a member of the research group. Then they set about participating in a scientific study of the alien creature. Only problem is it returns to life and being a shape shifter that can replicate any living organism starts to hide amongst the group leading to lots of finger pointing flame throwers explosions and suspicion fueled arguments. Sounds rather familiar right?Whereas the original 1982 movie was all about paranoia and the fear of the unknown  the alien hid among the human hosts desperate to remain concealed at all costs only showing itself when it felt its identity was compromised  it's distinctly not the case here. In this movie the creature revels in revealing itself at every available opportunity. With bells ringing. It screams and shrieks its presence to such an extent that all notions of a story based on the mistrust and doubt of an isolated group of characters goes out the window. What's the point in being a shape shifter if you're going to constantly give the game away? Then there's another aspect that doesn't quite ring true early on in the movie the characters witness a violent helicopter crash. The logical thing would be to go out to investigate it and search for survivors but for some reason they all choose to ignore it. Additionally one can't help but wish the makers had called the movie by a different title after all if it's meant to be an official prequel to the 'The Thing' why call it the same name?It's not that it's bad movie as remakes go it's really rather good and executed with a lot of style. Sequelwise it's up there with Psycho 2. As with the original we get a scene where there's a 'big test' as Mary Elisabeth attempts to ascertain who's who in the group. In the original Kurt Russell used blood samples here they go for an admittedly clever spin on that scene while being totally different adds a new aspect to the creature while also playing as some kind of homage. You might even conclude that since this is a prequel then you must know the ending right? After all we saw how it ended in the opening scenes of the original 1982 movie starring Kurt Russell. Wrong. While they don't violate the events they take the movie in a whole different direction but still shrewdly stick with the original time line. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is very good in this. She doesn't strut around with a Look at me I'm so gorgeous expression in fact she plays the role  sans make up for the most part  with a level of icy cool female conviction unseen in a movie about a creature from outer space since a little movie made in 1979 called 'Alien'. It can't be an accident that she reminds the viewer of the Ripley character played by Sigourney Weaver in the same movie and even possess a similarly unconventional beauty. Based on this it wouldn't be surprising if she ended up replacing Weaver in the inevitable rebootremake etc. of that franchise.The John Carpenter original was rightly celebrated for its surreal effects giving audiences something that was genuinely cutting edge and never seen before at the time. Happily there is lot of utterly bizarre transformations going on here as well that will make your jaw drop a guy's face splits open two men fuse together and in an attempt to outdo the spiderhead of the original we see a monstrous fourlegged creation stalking its prey. While everything is 90 CGI once again it's done in such a way that it almost homages the original. For the most part the effects here look similar to the 1982 movie except they're done with a sheen that only CG could create. In conclusion is it any good? Yes it is. It's not the disaster some snotty critics would have you believe. While it's not as good as John Carpenter's move but then what is? it still honors the original while effectively and cleverly building the story that lead to the events in that movie. Yes the aforementioned 'Thing' does shout and scream a bit too much giving away its presence all too often but that could easily be interpreted as a legacy of its inexperience with humans. This is a prequel after all. But don't worry  by the time Kurt Russell and pals come along it will have learned its lesson.".

An alien vessel is discovered frozen in the Antarctic permafrost by a Norwegian research team. Finding a mysterious life form they bring it back to their research station. Even though there's no mention of an American in the original the makers shoehorn one in here clearly unconvinced that a movie comprised entirely of Europeans would sell. And likewise it's a female  once again you get the feeling they're not confident that an all male cast would sell this time round and are taking no chances. The American a palaeontologist Mary Elizabeth Winstead is drafted into the equation by a member of the research group. Then they set about participating in a scientific study of the alien creature. Only problem is it returns to life and being a shape shifter that can replicate any living organism starts to hide amongst the group leading to lots of finger pointing flame throwers explosions and suspicion fueled arguments. Sounds rather familiar right?Whereas the original 1982 movie was all about paranoia and the fear of the unknown  the alien hid among the human hosts desperate to remain concealed at all costs only showing itself when it felt its identity was compromised  it's distinctly not the case here. In this movie the creature revels in revealing itself at every available opportunity. With bells ringing. It screams and shrieks its presence to such an extent that all notions of a story based on the mistrust and doubt of an isolated group of characters goes out the window. What's the point in being a shape shifter if you're going to constantly give the game away? Then there's another aspect that doesn't quite ring true early on in the movie the characters witness a violent helicopter crash. The logical thing would be to go out to investigate it and search for survivors but for some reason they all choose to ignore it. Additionally one can't help but wish the makers had called the movie by a different title after all if it's meant to be an official prequel to the 'The Thing' why call it the same name?It's not that it's bad movie as remakes go it's really rather good and executed with a lot of style. Sequelwise it's up there with Psycho 2. As with the original we get a scene where there's a 'big test' as Mary Elisabeth attempts to ascertain who's who in the group. In the original Kurt Russell used blood samples here they go for an admittedly clever spin on that scene while being totally different adds a new aspect to the creature while also playing as some kind of homage. You might even conclude that since this is a prequel then you must know the ending right? After all we saw how it ended in the opening scenes of the original 1982 movie starring Kurt Russell. Wrong. While they don't violate the events they take the movie in a whole different direction but still shrewdly stick with the original time line. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is very good in this. She doesn't strut around with a Look at me I'm so gorgeous expression in fact she plays the role  sans make up for the most part  with a level of icy cool female conviction unseen in a movie about a creature from outer space since a little movie made in 1979 called 'Alien'. It can't be an accident that she reminds the viewer of the Ripley character played by Sigourney Weaver in the same movie and even possess a similarly unconventional beauty. Based on this it wouldn't be surprising if she ended up replacing Weaver in the inevitable rebootremake etc. of that franchise.The John Carpenter original was rightly celebrated for its surreal effects giving audiences something that was genuinely cutting edge and never seen before at the time. Happily there is lot of utterly bizarre transformations going on here as well that will make your jaw drop a guy's face splits open two men fuse together and in an attempt to outdo the spiderhead of the original we see a monstrous fourlegged creation stalking its prey. While everything is 90 CGI once again it's done in such a way that it almost homages the original. For the most part the effects here look similar to the 1982 movie except they're done with a sheen that only CG could create. In conclusion is it any good? Yes it is. It's not the disaster some snotty critics would have you believe. While it's not as good as John Carpenter's move but then what is? it still honors the original while effectively and cleverly building the story that lead to the events in that movie. Yes the aforementioned 'Thing' does shout and scream a bit too much giving away its presence all too often but that could easily be interpreted as a legacy of its inexperience with humans. This is a prequel after all. But don't worry  by the time Kurt Russell and pals come along it will have learned its lesson.";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1982 John Carpenter released his groundbreaking scifi horror masterpiece The Thing. It involved a group of scientists in Antarctica who must divert from their research to deal with a mysterious creature that has infiltrated their research center. It's a creature that kills off people and then copies them perfectly so as to blend in with everyone else before they attack again. The creature came from another research camp located miles from their own a desolate and abandoned Norwegian camp. What exactly happened in that doomed research facility has long been a mystery. All we know is that it was a disaster and it where the entire problem began. 2011's The Thing attempts to resolve that mystery by telling the back story of the events which led up to John Carpenter's film. However in its attempt to fill the gaps and resolve the ambiguities this version of The Thing to put it bluntly does a very poor job.The Thing is technically a prequel however it is in many ways just a remake of the 1982 version. It follows the same basic storyline of researchers in Antarctica finding an alien and then being terrorized by said alien. Because of this we know exactly how The Thing is going to unfold. It's not the film's fault it's just a simple fact. This puts a major obligation on the shoulders of the film to be highly imaginative and original in its own way. Sadly The Thing does not do this. It falls short of being a truly inspired retelling of the classic tale and it really gets to be nothing more than a straightforward horror story and I use the term horror loosely. This version of The Thing possesses none of the raw terror that Carpenter's version elicits. It doesn't capture that same level of visceral suspense that leaves us on the edge of our seat every waking minute of the film. This version is congested with cheap jump scares and gross out moments that sicken more than frighten. What Carpenter did in 1982 just couldn't translate over to this new rendition as it disregards everything that makes the original The Thing such a masterpiece.I really try to judge films based on themselves alone. I try not to critique films based on other films as I feel like every film deserves to be judged individually. But when you have a film that is more or less purposely identical to its predecessor there's no other way to do it. As is the case with The Thing. I have to compare every element of this new version with the 1982 version and it clearly highlights all the flaws with this new version.However the one region where I thought the 2011 version could really surpass the original would be in the visual effects department. And oh how wrong I was. The creature design in The Thing is excellent I can give it that. There are some very well designed monsters. Unfortunately it is the CGI renderings of these wicked monsters that lets the design down. There is just something about the CGI in this film that just simply isn't good. It looks fake it looks cheap and it looks sloppy. If anything it makes me appreciate the stop motion effects of the 1982 version so much more. I still have vivid images of the disgusting creatures from the 1982 The Thing but I'm sure I will quickly forget the underwhelming designs of this new version.It's sad to see a prequel to one of the greatest films of the 80's go down in flames. Overall as a film on its own The Thing isn't terrible but it isn't very good either. It didn't amaze me and it didn't do any of the things that a good horror film should. But when you compare it to the 1982 version it is a very bad film. It simply gets everything wrong that Carpenter's version got oh so right. Watching The Thing doesn't make you sick to your stomach its so bad but it severely underwhelms you and has nowhere near the same affect as Carpenter's immaculate version. 2011's version of The Thing won't be remembered and people certainly won't be talking about it 20 years down the line. That role is reserved for John Carpenter's 1982 masterpiece.".

No it's not like the original movie. Go figure. It's nearly thirty years later. If you want to see the same film go and rent it and then watch it twice.Having seen the original movie maybe three or four times in the past thirty years I was fourteen when I will have first seen it in 1983 I was quite pleasantly surprised by the end of this prequel. True it lacks some of the tension of the original and the acting from most if not all was below par. I remember the wonder of the special effects taking my breath away in the early eighties. This effort failed to bring me those same kind of delightful terrors. However this is not due to the realism or effort on the part of the filmmakers.This is purely down to my experience of horror movies throughout the past thirty years. My expectations at 42 are not the same as that 14 year old boy and I am a grisled and wisened old movie cynic these days as opposed to a wideeyed horror newbie. I think I watched this around the same time as my pirate VHS copies of The Evil Dead and Poltergeist.In short this wasn't half bad. It was faithful enough the original film for my liking though having only seen it a few times I am far from an authority on the subject matter. Continuity sputtered from time to time and there were slightly too many plot lines left dangling for comfort but altogether this was an enjoyable hour and a half. Yes it's true that you didn't feel for the characters as much as say MacReady or whatever Russell's name was in the first film and some of the blame for this should fall squarely on the writers. After all bad though the acting may have been they can only read what's on the page in front of them.Don't be put off by the comments you read here that tell you this is nothing more than an awful pile of monkey doings because that is judging it too harshly. It's never going to be the classic that Carpenter's film ended up being but given the last decade of truly terrible remakes we have been forced to sit through horrorwise this is almost a breath of fresh air.

	schema:reviewBody "What really made John Carpenter's The Thing so magical was not its sci fi elements its alien movie aspects or even I daresay its splendid 1980s animatronic gore. It was the psychological tension! The issue of trust was a horrifying prospect Who can you trust? Are you who you say you are? How can I tell what you say is the truth? At any moment someone could be an alien waiting for the opportune moment to burst out and consume the vulnerable person. As a prequel to John Carpenter's work The Thing 2011 taps respectfully into this raw suspense from the start but towards the end loses its direction and falls victim to the Hollywood clichs of a typical alien monster film. The Thing prequel for simplicity I'll call the 1982 film John Carpenter's covers what happened in the Norwegian base. Kate Lloyd Mary Elizabeth Winstead is recruited cautiously by Dr. Sander Halvorson Ulrich Thomsen to aid in an Antarctic dig of a great scientific discovery an alien specimen found frozen in the ice near its ship. With the help of Norwegian scientists they recover the body to the safety of the base but soon learn that it is still alive and has the ability to assume the shape of that which it kills. The first half of the story follows how John Carpenter's film goes down almost exactly. I won't say anything about how it fares against 1951 The Thing from Another World because I haven't seen it. After the alien has proved to infect several humans already extreme paranoia and distrust breaks out among the surviving crew. Kate quickly assumes the Kurt Russelltype leader herding the survivors into open areas and investigating methods of exposing the monster. Tensions run extremely high as they did in John Carpenter's and at these moments I felt The Thing prequel had a good thing going for it. The suspense was thrilling and engaging and aliens were bursting out of bodies at wholly unexpected times. The acting was consistently solid Winstead did her part well and the use of authentic Scandinavian actors was an added bonus. Within thirty minutes the film had paid enough homage to the original to be a worthy predecessor  more than I expected it to do in the first place  but then it decided to take its own stylistic turn which most would consider to be fine but Carpenter fans not so much.First the age of animatronics is over. It's realistic to expect the effects in every Hollywood movie these days to rely on CGI The Thing 2011 being no exception. So while it lacked that creepy gooey tangible feel of John Carpenter's animatronics The Thing prequel had plenty of fast paced alien sequences while still looking fairly good. The monster design stays pretty faithful including wiry tentacles and frighteningly random mouths. Of course at this point though these kind of CGI effects are nothing we haven't seen before many times it seemed to be a zombietype monster rather than Carpenter's amorphous alien and in that sense was a bit unbelievable. Second the movie switched tone halfway from primarily a psychological thriller to an alien scifi flick. Whilst in Carpenter's film the alien tended only to burst out into its true form necessarily when discovered in The Thing prequel it is glorified with an ungodly amount of screen time. The film quickly loses its intensity as it dwindles away into an ordinary monster chase around the Norwegian base. By measures of any typical Hollywood monster horror film The Thing is still an engaging and impressive ride. But trying to continue in the same spirit as John Carpenter's the film fails to sustain the classic psychological suspense it starts out with. 7.510".

I have never been more pleased by a prequel or even a sequel for that matter.And I honestly think it's harder to make a prequel because you have stricter guidelines. But this movie shines as a perfect example of what a proper prequel should look like. Nothing was over looked and every important detail was accounted for.

And really that's the fundamental flaw with the movie and why the whole thing feels forced. The pacing wasn't as deliberately slow the whodunnit aspect didn't feel properly in place and finally...and again this criticism is as a fan of the original movie...why on earth did the thing not try to hide more than it did? At one point it seemed like the movie shifted gears into a simple monster movie with insert beastly monster just running around killing which was completely uncharacteristic of the original movie where the thing even when found out would try to make an escape to hide again...So in all as a standalone movie it wasn't bad at all. It was a nice return to gory disgusting things that go bump in the dark. But as a prequel it missed the mark I think the film makers were trying to hit. John Carpenter laid out a very specific and deliberate tone to the original movie that this one just couldn't seem to figure out how to replicate...no blood test needed to find this impostor.".

They go to great lengths to match up to the events suggested from the 1982 version and I personally appreciate them doing so. I also liked their method of detecting who was the Thing. It was different than MacReady's test but it was original.Nothing will ever top the petri dish sequence and dialogue Carpenter and Russell just nail it.If you're a fan of the original looking for something completely different or a new take on The Thing From Another world than this movie is not for you. But if you're like me and always wondered who put that ax through the door or what events led up to the twoheaded thing burnt up in the snow at the Norwegion compound than I highly recommend this flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me preface this review with two things first I apologize for the punclich in the title second I'm a major fan of John Carpenter's 1982 effort. I've watched it countless times and always cite it as my favorite film. With that in mind I approached this remakeprequel with great caution.To get the good stuff out of the way I have to praise the filmmakers for keeping very close to John Carpenter's style. The lingering shots of cold mysterious hallways while atmospheric synth music plays notes of dread are present and accounted for. The creature transformations are interesting and despite being computer generated are generally well executed. The script is cleverly written hitting all the notes needed to work as a prequel as well as a story that will work for new audiences.All around the film is entertaining brain candy. There's lots of action creature effects and explosions to ensure you won't be bored. Its faithfulness to the style of its predecessor and its willingness to please fans and audiences are why I'm giving this film a 5 instead of something much lower.But that's where the good stuff ends.The effectiveness of The Thing's story relies on its mysteries and our fear of the unknown. What happened at the Norwegian base has been a subject of debate amongst fans for many years and finally someone has gone and ruined that debate. That's the central problem with the movieit's a story that never needed to be told and in telling it the mythos becomes damaged. At least we still don't know what happened to Macready and Childs! At the risk of sounding sexist I'll state outright that casting a young woman as the main protagonist was a major mistake. The 1982 film was unique in that the cast was populated by a bunch of grizzled old character actors. By including women we lose a lot of the subtext afforded by the all male cast in Carpenter's version. Also the film asks us to stretch our disbelief by wanting us to accept a group of Norwegiansalready reluctant to bring anyone else in on their discoveryare willing to bring in a young American woman to help. Opening up the story outside of Antartica at its very beginning also brings us away from the sense of isolation so thick in the 1982 film.While I said earlier that the creature transformations are interesting and fun to watch they still don't hold a candle to the amazing practical effects and prosthetics created by Rob Bottin almost thirty years ago. As the runtime wears on it sadly devolves into another kickass chick brandishing a flame thrower being stalked down dark corridors by a computergenerated creature movie and that's not what The Thing was ever about. Where Carpenter's film was subtle this one is loud and obnoxious and I'm not trying to say that Carpenter's version was ever a hugely subtle movie.The film rolls along at a steady pace of hitting every single beat found in the 1982 version. There's not enough here to make it an original entry in a franchise as it substitutes slightly different ideas for ones better executed by Carpenter. It's a bizarre beast one that looks new acts as some kind of prequel but in reality is a thinly veiled remake.It's ironic that Carpenter's The Thing a movie about an imitating creature was itself imitated even down to the studio's refusal to change the title. The film is at its best when emulating Carpenter's style and the scenes over the credits put a smile on my face. Thankfully the movie itself is respectful enough of the 1982 classic and you can tell the filmmakers really tried their hardest to please everyone. It's just a shame that it's a story that never needed to be told.".

	schema:reviewBody "...Shocked that this film is currently rated at 6.7. It is becoming increasingly difficult to take ratings seriously on this site. Considering that Dog Soldiers for example is rated as 6.8  it is beyond my ken as to how this mediocre film can end up near a rating of 7.0. Even when taken as a stand alone film and not a remake it doesn't contain enough elements to add up to an average 6.7 rating.Anyway for those who have no experience with John Carpenter's 1982 version of the 1951 original The Thing From Another World I can understand how they may be impressed with the movie. The story is great. It's an absolutely fantastic concept. That's why it's somewhat offensive to me that Heijningen and company could be handed a golden goose and in turn give it such a thoughtless and sterile treatment.First I'm not buying the relationships among the scientists. I mean these are people that have traveled to Antarctica are holed up in close quarters have in their possession the greatest find in the history of the world and seem to have about as much chemistry as a bunch of 5yearolds at a Easter photo shoot. I didn't give a good damn about anyone. Actually the only one that I really connected with at all was the one dude that couldn't speak any English. He seemed to me to be the most genuine actor of the lot. Most of the acting was mediocre at best as if the actors and actresses had difficulty inserting themselves into the story in such a way as to produce a visceral performance. Part of the problem is that the film moves along too quickly. They could have spent a little less time showing scenery and shots of the monster and invested more into character development.Which leads into the next problem. I expected to feel more of a sense of claustrophobia but most of the shots were way too expansive. The camera work really ruins the film. I mean they're in freaking Antarctica packed like sardines in a tin can and freaked out of their gourds. I felt more tension watching The Muppet Christmas Carol. And that's why The Thing doesn't work as a slasher flick like it was portrayed. Giving the movie that type of treatment guts the film of what's most effective the Man vs. Man element.Thirdly there are way too many shots of the monster. It's gratuitous and detracts from the mystery and suspense. In the end the monster comes off as being clumsy and inefficient.In my mind movies rated above say 5.0 are films that I would consider watching again. Having said that there is no chance that I would ever watch this film again. I can't give this film much higher than a 4.5 maybe 4.6. To really break it down into simple terms it lacks the coolness factor where I might say to myself Boy I'd really like to see this scene again or hear this dialogue. There's nothing I want to revisit in this movie.The best parts of the movie were the fillings test and the end when they showed the beginning of the 1982 version.In conclusion go ahead and watch the movie but don't lose the ability to view a film with a critical eye because it's loaded with CGI. As for me I'll be watching Carpenter's masterpiece again the next chance I get.".

	schema:headline " Completely Missed the Point of Carpenter's film";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all like many others I have to say that I am a huge fan of John Carpenter's The Thing. I was looking forward to the Norwegian prequel as I love Ronald D Moore's version of Battlestar Galactica and thought he would really nail this as well if he wrote the screenplay. I first saw The Thing on VHS at the age of 16 over 20 years after it originally was released in theatres. What I loved about the film was the tension created based on the characters' paranoia of not knowing who to really trust to be a human. It was this quality that I believe made the film as compelling as it was. The monster effects were very impressive for their time but for me they came secondary to the paranoia aspect of the film.So if this is to be an actual faithful prequel any fan of The Thing should accept Kurt Russell's monologue that the alien has tendencies to strike only when it is alone with another person and will try to take the whole group over slowly by hiding amongst them. The problem with this socalled prequel is that the alien does anything but that. We are treated with plenty of gross out monster revealing effects where the alien straight up attacks the humans sometimes taking out three humans at a time. This action completely undermines the original where the idea was that the Thing was vulnerable when it was out in the open. All this prequel provides is gross images of a monster that attacks humans who then fight back with whatever weapons they have on hand. This aspect got boring really fast whereas the paranoia aspect of the original played a very minimal role in this film. When a character was revealed to be a Thing it really had no impact at all as there was not enough character development to really care about it. I realize Carpenter didn't have much more character development but he still had enough for the audience to be blown away when the creature chose to reveal itself.Yet the most flawed trait of this film could be pointed out by a young Stephen Spielberg or Ridley Scott 30 years before this film was even made. Much like Spielberg's shark in Jaws or Scott's original Alien the alien in Carpenter's The Thing was hardly ever shown. The tension that was created from all these films was built off of what was not seen. The audience knows that the monster is a real threat to the characters and we also feel the tension of how the characters treat each other because of this threat. It was this aspect of these films that worked so well not the violent gross out special effects of monsters attacking humans.To summarize I was highly disappointed with this film and would rank it with The XFiles I Want to Believe as the worst movie I have ever gone to see in theatres. Fans of Carpenter's The Thing will not benefit in the slightest from seeing this film and the socalled tieins are so shallow that it is better to preserve the mystery of the Norwegians that the original film created.".

	schema:reviewBody "I sincerely believe that if it had been handled properly this movie could have stood proudly alongside the Carpenter version.If the filmmakers had balls the entire movie would have been in Norwegian with subtitles. It made zero sense that they would need to bring in people from American and Britain. Are there no radio operators or palaeontologists in Norway? Characters completely contradict this later in the movie when they are desperate to ensure no outsiders come to the base to steal their discovery. Stupid.I guarantee the English speaking characters were included because the filmmakers think the audience is stupid and can't handle reading in a movie. And of course the Americans are the heroes and the Norwegians are nothing but walking meat bags waiting to get ripped apart and eaten. The casting of women really didn't bother me too much as any sort of tacked on romantic subplot was completely absent. At least they got that right. But with no romance and no gender conflict did they need to be women? Or was this just a studio decision to appeal to a wider demographic?The rampant use of subpar CG destroys this movie. This should have been a showcase for every advancement made in practical effects since 1982. They had some real talent working on it Alec Guinness and Tom Woodruff Jr. but all they got to do was sculpt a few dead aliens on lab tables. Everything else including a majority of the gore was rendered with cheap looking computer animation. This movie should have been mind blowing. Instead I was pulled right out of it by how terribly unconvincing the creatures looked every time they were on screen which is a lot. Why didn't they get Rob Bottin back? Even as a consultant it couldn't have hurt. The CG should have complemented the practical work see Pan's Labyrinth or Alexander Aja's Hills Have Eyes for how to do this right instead it totally replaces it.What adds insult to injury is that throughout production the filmmakers kept saying how they were going to do as much as possible using practical effects. I guess that just makes them liars. What a waste.The creatures don't even sound right. The original monsters sounded unique with their haunting almost sorrowful howling. Here they just make everything sound like Aliens except way too loud to the point where it actually becomes painful as your bombarded with high pitched shrieks constantly.Another thing that bugged me glaring continuity errors. This is a prequel to a movie that's been watched repeatedly for 20 years the importance of continuity is paramount. In the original the American team watches tapes of the Norwegians where they clearly blow the alien craft out of the ice with explosives. The characters even say they're using Thermite charges and it shows the explosion on the video. In this the ice above the ship breaks when the creature turns on its ship. I read in an interview that the director always had a copy of the '82 version on hand to check for continuity. How do you miss that? When the ship is shown in the original it is in a vast snow plane. Where did the vehicles and cave from this movie go? The stories are seemingly hours apart so I don't think they got covered up in a storm. Sloppy film making.It states at the start it's 1982. We see Kate Lloyd examining the inside of a specimen using a camera on a tube. Next to her is a flatscreen computer monitor with a display showing modern looking video text and graphics. Funny I don't recall that technology existing in 1982. Take a look at the computer simulation used in the original 2bit graphics with nonexistent animation. You were lucky back then if you had a computer that could render more than green and black on the screen. How hard would it have been to secure a CRT TV from a pawn shop and hook up the video feed using RCA cables from a camcorder? Because I have a feeling that is exactly what they would have been using.The 1982 version has one of the most memorable soundtracks in movie history. The music totally adds to the bleakness and horror. Here it's your standard throwaway Hollywood score that you'll forget the minute you leave the cinema. The classic theme is heard at the end and by then it's too little too late. Finally the 2011 movie thinks that having random characters transform into monsters at unexpected times without any sort of logic simply to have an onslaught of cheap jump scares is suspenseful. You never see 95 of them come into any contact with the creatures. I get that they were trying to keep you on your toes but the mystery should have been better developed like it was in the original. The creature in the original wanted to stay hidden as much as possible in this they transform into monsters wantonly. Instead of suspense and paranoia you just have a monster chase movie with monsters that don't hold up.The writer was the same guy who worked on the abysmal Nightmare on Elm Street remake. The constant monsters popping out closely mirrors the tactic he used in NOES with micro naps so Freddy could pop out and essentially say boo! constantly. Your 0 for 2 buddy.The only reasons I rated this movie a 2 and not a 1 is that storywise it wasn't too offending and did manage to tie in well with the original continuity errors aside the acting was fine although there's basically zero character development and despite how fake the CG looked the creature designs were cool just so poorly executed.".

It made zero sense that they would need to bring in people from American and Britain. Are there no radio operators or palaeontologists in Norway? Characters completely contradict this later in the movie when they are desperate to ensure no outsiders come to the base to steal their discovery. Stupid.I guarantee the English speaking characters were included because the filmmakers think the audience is stupid and can't handle reading in a movie.

	schema:headline " Why did this movie suck so much?";
	schema:reviewBody "What a surprise someone complaining about a recent Hollywood prequel of a beloved franchise on the internet how original right? Listen I get it I hate having to be that guy. I wish that I could be writing how much I loved this movie and how amazing it is hell I would love to have found at least one thing positive to hold on to but that unfortunately would just be a lie. I was massively optimistic going in and very skeptical of all the negative reviews that had been popping up prior to my viewing of the movie. They don't know what they're talking about I told myself they just love to hate on things because that's the 'cool' thing to do these days. After all how could they possibly mess this up? It's such a perfect concept and what's more it's pretty simple. As the classic Spielberg quote goes any great film plot can be summed up in one sentence Alien creature could be anyone in snow. Not an overly convoluted structure but one that worked so well in John Carpenter's 1982 version so well that it remains one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm not complaining about how the prequel pooped all over the original I'm just disappointed and somewhat baffled by just how they could have made such an awful failure of a movie with such a rich concept to work with? ? Surely there would be at least one good thing about this movie right? RIGHT?? Even if this was just a standalone movie it would still suck it just doesn't work. It's not scary it's not suspenseful it's not tense it's not dark it's not exciting it's not really anything. Coming away from this movie the best way I could describe it was just hollow.There's just nothing to it it's an empty husk. It feels like exactly what it is a big pay check for everyone involved with no creative drive behind it whatsoever. I find it hard to believe that anyone involved with this movie cared at all about the original they didn't even care about just making a decent movie!! And if they did it certainly does not show one single bit. You can almost feel the apathy soaking through every aspect of the movie. From the blank expression on Mary Elizabeth Winstead's face to the pointlessness of every scene to the almost laughable lumbering joke a CGI monster.I don't know if there was a definitive moment during the film in which my heart began to sink but when the Thing started chasing people down corridors it was the beginning of the end. The Thing does not chase people around. What should have been an intense psychological expression of human paranoia is now just a lazy stupid creature feature and a bad one at that. It's Hollywood telling us in no uncertain terms You are so stupid the only way you'll understand this is if we have a big stupid looking creature who's all 'Blarg I'm a scary monster coming to get you!!' lumbering awkwardly down a corridor and then have a pretty young girl running the opposite direction who's all like 'Eeeek help me'. And let me tell you nothing feels better in this world than being treated like a moron right? You guys all love that feeling don't you because there' s no way you would ever understand anything even slightly subtle you're far too stupid for anything like that. Well thanks a lot Hollywood you condescending asshole. So it's a prequel so you're already going in with a different perspective. You have your internal check list the block of ice the Axe in the wall etc. etc. And the filmmakers obviously knew this would be our mindset as an audience and then apparently went out of their way to antagonize us. Now I'm acting like a fan boy right? Hear me out you've seen the original movie two Norwegian dudes chasing the creature in husky who quickly meet untimely ends at the American camp and now we have a prequel. Finally a chance to explore these characters find out what drove them to this end who are they as people what horrors have they witnessed in the frozen wasteland. An amazing set up for a movie so how does the prequel answer these questions? Well as it turns out poorly is how. In an absolutely stunningly questionable decision they get all of 10 seconds in the end credits!! What were they thinking?? One of the guys isn't even in the movie until this point and isn't referenced to once!! He just shows up in the helicopter out of nowhere he doesn't know what the Thing is he's never witnessed the creature transform he has no idea other than what Lars shouts at him in 5 seconds before they just jump into the helicopter and leave and THAT'S IT. They may as well have inserted another clip in the credits just the smug face of Hollywood exec grinning as if to say Yeah audience those are the guys from the original movie I bet you love that don't you you stupid audience. Well no Hollywood I didn't love it it sucked. They took a concept that could have been brilliant and just pooped all over it? Why? This is what I'm left asking the film is just a series of god awful choices. It would have taken just one person who looked at the last page of that script to speak up and say 'Hey you guys all know this sucks right? Why are we making a prequel that shows such disdain for these characters?' This is why I stand by my previous statement that they are deliberately trying to antagonize us. The Thing isn't just bad it's belittling it's insulting and it's baffling and I hate it.".

	schema:headline " Gorgeous monster movie another great version";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm surprised there haven't been more than three versions of this one The Thing From Another World is up there with Dracula and Frankenstein in terms of quality. John Carpenter's 1982 version however was so pitchperfect and so close to preCG special effects perfection that it seemed like you just couldn't top it! A new take on a classic tale for a new audience is always welcome in my book though provided they capture what made the previous versions special.A living 'Thing' from another world recently excavated in Antartica assumes human form and lurks amongst others then splits contorts and bursts open its human bodies in whatever way necessary to survive. Paranoia spreads the cast never knowing who among them has been assimilated by this 'Thing'. The Thing acts as a remake for the newcomers but also as a prequel for people familiar with John Carpenter's version complete with homages to shots found in that film even down to the placement of a bloody axe and a midcredits sequence leading right into it.The reremake has been met with some anger on the internet due to its use of CG after Carpenter's film wowed people so much with its reallife animatronic effects. The bizarre truth is that the majority of this version's effects shots are actually practical with a bit of CG to smooth out the edges and to achieve a few of the things practical effects could not Jurassic Park style. The fact that people have had trouble realising this is testament to just how far both types of effect have come. The 'transformations' here however are less visceral than they were in the 80s version the bodies change shape and sprout tentacles and teeth without the gushing blood and pus from the 'original' and it gives the entire affair a 'cleaner' feel where the monster is more of a marvel than a horror. I was also pleased to see that where CG is used here it really is used to its potential creating some awesomely grotesque and agile creatures which move freely of any rigging or puppetry and nobody's going to convince me that CG tentacles are any less believable than jerky greenscreened stop motion.In fact the most notable difference in this version is the pacing. Carpenter's film bided its time steadily working on the paranoia only pulling out the glorious effects in a few key scenes whilst this 'Thing' wastes no time showing off what it can do. For me the 'original' was too slow in many ways and in contrast I find this one a little too fast and it almost feels over too soon. The allmale cast of the 'original' weren't the most compelling set of characters many of them crude stereotypes shoehorned in to further fuel the rage with their testosterone whilst this version brings in a more diverse group of people  Norwegians Americans Englishmen young and old  and it benefits from it. Whilst you could argue that the heroine character is crammed in and given too much character strength to contrast with Carpenter's sausagefest but she's still strong and when wielding a flamethrower and calling the shots at times she almost has an Ellen Ripley vibe to her. It's also nice to learn a bit more about the 'Thing' as great as the mystery of it all was in the 'original' it's refreshing to get a further look into the kind of world this being may have come from and the kind of technology that brought it here.Overall a great monster movie and another great retelling of a classic but probably better for newcomers than for people with fond memories of the previous versions. Less tension and more 'BOO!' less revulsion and more awe this is the 'accessible' version of The Thing.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm surprised there haven't been more than three versions of this one The Thing From Another World is up there with Dracula and Frankenstein in terms of quality. John Carpenter's 1982 version however was so pitchperfect and so close to preCG special effects perfection that it seemed like you just couldn't top it! A new take on a classic tale for a new audience is always welcome in my book though provided they capture what made the previous versions special.A living 'Thing' from another world recently excavated in Antartica assumes human form and lurks amongst others then splits contorts and bursts open its human bodies in whatever way necessary to survive. Paranoia spreads the cast never knowing who among them has been assimilated by this 'Thing'. The Thing acts as a remake for the newcomers but also as a prequel for people familiar with John Carpenter's version complete with homages to shots found in that film even down to the placement of a bloody axe and a midcredits sequence leading right into it.The reremake has been met with some anger on the internet due to its use of CG after Carpenter's film wowed people so much with its reallife animatronic effects. The bizarre truth is that the majority of this version's effects shots are actually practical with a bit of CG to smooth out the edges and to achieve a few of the things practical effects could not Jurassic Park style. The fact that people have had trouble realising this is testament to just how far both types of effect have come. The 'transformations' here however are less visceral than they were in the 80s version the bodies change shape and sprout tentacles and teeth without the gushing blood and pus from the 'original' and it gives the entire affair a 'cleaner' feel where the monster is more of a marvel than a horror. I was also pleased to see that where CG is used here it really is used to its potential creating some awesomely grotesque and agile creatures which move freely of any rigging or puppetry and nobody's going to convince me that CG tentacles are any less believable than jerky greenscreened stop motion.In fact the most notable difference in this version is the pacing. Carpenter's film bided its time steadily working on the paranoia only pulling out the glorious effects in a few key scenes whilst this 'Thing' wastes no time showing off what it can do. For me the 'original' was too slow in many ways and in contrast I find this one a little too fast and it almost feels over too soon. The allmale cast of the 'original' weren't the most compelling set of characters many of them crude stereotypes shoehorned in to further fuel the rage with their testosterone whilst this version brings in a more diverse group of people  Norwegians Americans Englishmen young and old  and it benefits from it.

	schema:reviewBody "Monster movie in which an alien menaces an isolated scientific community . The producers convinced Universal Studios to allow them to create a prequel to John Carpenter's The Thing instead of a remake as they felt Carpenter's film was already perfect . Directed by Dutch Matthijs van Heijningen in his first film  the thriller is produced by Strike Entertainment's Marc Abraham and Eric Newman Dawn of the Dead. However the prequel still has the title of the original film because they couldn't think of a subtitle that sounded good . It is set in Antarctica an extraordinary continent of awesome beauty. It is also home to an isolated outpost where a discovery full of scientific possibility becomes a mission of survival when an alien is unearthed by a crew of international scientists . It deals with a lonely group of scientists Ulrich Thomsen as Dr. Sander Halvorson  Eric Christian Olsen as Adam Finch  Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje as Derek Jameson who take on the most dangerous creature of universe. The shapeshifting creature  accidentally unleashed at this marooned colony has the ability to turn itself into a perfect replica of any living being. It can look just like you or me but inside it remains inhuman. In the thriller The Thing  paranoia spreads like an epidemic among a group of researchers as they're infected one by one by a mystery from another planet. Paleontologist Kate Lloyd Mary Elizabeth Winstead and in order to not try to compete with Kurt Russell's portrayal of the 1982 film's protagonist R.J. MacReady the character of Kate Lloyd was designed to have traits in common with the character Ellen Ripley from the Alien film series has traveled to the desolate region for the expedition of her lifetime and she is studying a thawing cave bear Ursus Spelaeus. Joining a Norwegian scientific team that has stumbled across an extraterrestrial ship buried in the ice she discovers an organism that seems to have died in the crash eons ago. But it is about to wake up. When a simple experiment frees the alien from its frozen prison Kate must join the crew's pilot Carter Joel Edgerton to keep it from killing them off one at a time. And in this vast intense land a parasite that can mimic anything it touches will pit human against human as it tries to survive and flourish. Acceptable and estimable actionthriller professionally directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. who provides a punchy suspenseful SciFi . However  the filmmaker copies several scenes from Carpenter movie  in fact an enormous amount of screen shots from the first movie were kept on the set while filming at all times in order to ensure that the Norwegian station would be rebuilt to the smallest details. The Thing serves as a prelude to John Carpenter's classic 1982 film of the same name that is one of the great SciFi classics . The gradual builtup suspense is quite superb as when the monster is shown largely to create a real menace  though some moments looks and feels just like a remake of Alien. This exciting film packs chills  thrills  guessing  paranoia  absence of all characterization  spectacular FX  including a loathing chestburning scene . It takes a liberal stand in exposing the tension of men when confronted with an alien . Based on the short story titled Who Goes There? by John Campbell Jr  published in 1938  the screenwriter Eric Heisserer rejects out the hand the idea that the alien might be worth attempting to understand or communicate with research team . Thrilling and intriguing musical score by Marco Beltrani . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Michael Abramowicz . The thing produced Marc Abraham J. Miles Dale  David Foster  Eric Newman and Lawrence Turman emerges as distinctly SciFiterror movie and one might be recommending for its FX  masterfully made by Tom Woodruff Jr and Alec Gillis for creature effects and special makeup . The creature effects were done primarily with cableoperated animatronic robots on the director's insistence since it would improve the performances of the cast if they saw what they had to react to. Computergenerated images were used to add elements to the animatronics such as tentacles  or in some cases to replace the entire animatronic if it didn't behave convincingly. The earlier first version results to be The Thing from another world by Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks with Kenneth Tobey  Margaret Sheridan and James Arness as the monster  it holds a subtle but efficient intrigue . The best version by John Carpenter was starred by Kurt Russell and an allstarsecondary cast as Wilford Brimley  T.K. Carter  David Clennon  Keith David  Richard Dysart  Charles Hallahan  Peter Maloney  Richard Masur and Donald Moffat . The modern version is this The Thing 2011 by Mattijs Heijmingen resulting to be inferior to previous but still being acceptable .".

First of all if you are a fan of the 1980's The Thing like me then you will want to see this movie just because of the flashes of the great time you had watching the oldie will make you want more of the same but with the help of some new technology. And this movie does not disappoint. As soon as I started watching this movie I thought it was going to fail. Mainly because I recognized all of about 1 of the actors. Those no name actors did a dam good job especially the lead actor who I was worried about the most. Kurt Russel was the man in the 80's version and for him to be replaced by a woman... I was worried. But she KILLED it! Great job by her whatever her name is. She made all the right expressions hit all the right tones of voice at the right times had a great script to read from and did a great job in this movie overall. One of the coolest things no pun intended about this movie is that it is a prequel. It is a prequel to the 80's version. And it is extremely accurate and for that I thank the director. Its as if this movie was released a year before the 80's version except with way better technology and CGI backing it up. Yes the CGI effects are plentiful in this movie and they are great. Simply a great script. and also I like how there are Americans and there are Norwegians. Not just some nonsenseical Norwegian speaking English for no reason bull crap. They put Norwegian people who speak Norwegian and American people who speak English. That is some great work by one of my new favorite directors. This movie easily could have been halfassed and milked just based off the success the Kurt Russel version had in the 80's but no they took the time to make one of the best movies of this year. I haven't even mentioned the Thing yet! It is great ! You will be guessing who is really an alien and whos really human the whole way through. And I actually cared about all of the no name actors throughout the movie. These no name guys and girls acted better than a lot of the old big names have recently adam sandler...jack and jill... really? This movie just felt ALIVE and really well done. SEE IT. and if you already have then SEE IT again!".

	schema:reviewBody "Much to my surprise as I begrudgingly went to the movies with my 12 yr old son I LOVED this film. I expected nothing yet in return I received a wonderful 1 hour and 40 minute respite from the real world filled with slapstick humor and total silliness. Slapstick humor always walks a tightrope between bad taste and belly laughs. The Three Stooges are mindnumbingly inane most laugh intensely and some never get the joke. Laurel and Hardy isn't for everyone either. Nacho Libre is not filled with Woody Allen irony it doesn't have Christopher Guest's drollness and it's not James Brook slick. It's not sophisticated humor! How can any film featuring Jack Black as a Mexican friarfryerwrestlerwannabe wooer ... all for the good of the orphans be taken seriously? It's simply for the 12 year old boy in all of us who laughs when Moe hits Curly and laughs when fat guys even with over the top Mexican accents are paired with skinny guys ... in a wrestling ring ... with stretchy pants.I originally wrote this as a reply to a poster who asked if the mean IQ of people who liked this was 93 but the post was subsequently deleted. But to him I say By the way I'm a physician and my IQ is a tad over 93. But even if I had no job at all and even if my IQ was 93 ... who cares ... I laughed with my son eating popcorn in the dark. And that's the joy of sharing a movie like this. No es?".

	schema:headline " very funny if shallow";
	schema:reviewBody "Preface I will avoid giving specifics on the movie in this review. There is nothing more damaging to a comedy that knowing the jokes before hand. Since I liked this movie and it was funny. I shall shy away from spoilers. Jared Hess shoots his movies like a funny David Fincher. His obsession with grime and dirt and everything looking old and decrepit is almost fetishistic. But he has grown a lot since we last saw his work shooting extreme closeups of steak and tatertots in Napoleon Dynamite. Not to sound cruel but I was surprised while watching his latest effort Nacho Libre because wellit looks like a real movie. There is dynamic lighting proper shot composition and interesting camera movements. I guess a budget increase from 400000 to about 38 million makes a difference. Oh and by the way the movie is very very funny. I'm talking cola out your nose funny. Starting with the addition of the brilliant Mike White to his writing staff Hess has crafted a much more cohesive and narratively satisfying film.Though it does keep the skitish nature of Napoleon Dynamite stuff actually happens in this film. The movie apparently based on a real monk though the end of the credits state that the film is totally fictitious tells the story of Ignacio Nacho for short an orphaned boy who becomes a monk at an orphanage. Nacho is in charge of Cooking duties anddead guy duties and is generally looked down upon by the other monks and priests though the children love him. After the orphans nacho's are stolen by a homeless man and the head priest humiliates Nacho for his pitiful meal preparation skills Nachowho's greatest love in life is masked luchador wrestlingdecides to enter a tag team match with the thief as his partner. They lose horribly but discover that even the losers get paid. And with money Esqueleto the street urchin and yes those are his real teeth can live comfortably and Nacho can buy better food for the orphans. Orphans who are hilariously always referred to as the orphans as if to constantly reminding them of their misfortune. Also during all of this Nacho is trying to woo the new girl Encarnacin who just happens to be a nun with the same name he has. Given the current battery the Catholic Church is taking in public opinion it is nice to see a movie that never once mocks the religion. Sure there are priests who have the hots for Ana de la Reguera. But the she is so dumbfoundingly gorgeous it would be silly for any man much less one who must be celibate to not at very least look twice at her. The church here is played as a wholesome good place. There is never any salacious undertone to the scenes between the priests left alone with small children and nobody gets the girl in the end so all the general morals are upheld. Also it is nice to see a movie about Latin culture starringgaspLatinos! Everyone in the movie except Black who is actually playing a white guy not a Mexican as many IMDb posters have postulated is of Hispanic origin. And the culture comes off well.Beck does a few wonderfully fun songs for the soundtrack and Danny Elfman's score is his best in years. ironically shortly after I wrote this I discovered that he had taken his name off of the film because he was unhappy with the way his work was presented. There is a general irrepressible levity to the proceedings that is infectious. And though the movie meanders more than it should you can't help forgive its shortcomings because it is so well natured. Oddly in contrast to this are the wrestling scenes. They come off as overly violent and though this could have just been Mann's Chinese's killer sound system I could hear bones crunch and things looked painful. The action scenes aren't farcical like the rest of the film though some of them are thrilling. Parents should be aware that this movie could be a bit scary for children under 9 or 10 and though the film has a more positive role for minorities and women than any film I've seen in a while it does seem a little bit inappropriate at times. There is nothing sexual and there are good morals to be found but the movie does have a strong line of toilet humor and Punch and Judy level slapstick throughout. However this isn't really a kid's movie. It is just a movie that happens to be rated PG. It is made for teens and adults but there is nothing objectionable enough as to keep kids out. Overall Nacho Libre is a pretty damned funny movie with a good heart and lots of laughs. Jack Black even gets to sing a few times! And while it is less instantly quotable than Napoleon Dynamite it is a better film overall. If you like Jack Black Dynamite Wrestling or your kids have already seen Cars and you want to take them to something else this movie is about as good as you could hope for. Though not especially deep it is exactly what I want when I go see a big summer comedy. Now I just can't wait for the Tenacious D movie.Post Script Prepare to hear I only believe in science constantly after this film is released.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's good to know that farce is alive and well in the world. Since the mid 90's it feels like film makers have lost their grip on truly great weird comedy. Movies that speak to the few and turn off the rest. It seems that even as the tools to unlock our imaginations get flashier and flashier and special effect budgets grow and grown American film grow static and stale. Then when it seems like all hope is lost a film like NACHO LIBRE comes along.Somewhere in Mexico a young priest named Nacho Jack Black longs to be recognized. He's tired of serving the same bland food to the young boys in his charge. He's tired of being disrespected by the other priests. He longs to be a luchadore a Mexican wrestler and to gain the affections of the stunning Sister Encarnacin Ana del la Regura. Then when all hope is lost he teams up with a new friend named Esquelta and takes the Mexican wrestling world by storm. Will the orphan boys get better food? Will Nacho win the heart of Sister Encarnacin? Will he lose everything he has on a quest to become a great warrior? Giving this movie its due will provide those answers and more. The movie not perfect. It's a little overlong and some of the jokes fall flat on their face. But there is an earnestness and a sweet gentility in the film that will win you over. You cannot enter this movie with the wrong attitude and if you don't like weird movie its not for you. But if you let it entertain you and if you give into the fact that it really bizarre it will work. You have to take every scene with grain of salt and logic must be thrown out the window. But if you turn off that part of your brain that strives for everything to be plausible than this film will entertain.Then for no apparent reason the movie does something I didn't quite expect it begins to tackle a serious subject. Behind all the silliness is a story about how legalism traps us in a place of boredom and predictability. Whether it be religious legalism or secular legalism NACHO LIBRE is about a misfit who succeeds because he goes out on a limb. He doesn't give up his religious fervor when the chips are down when his atheist friend tells him to give into science and logic and he doesn't give up on God because men of cloth treat him badly. He stays true to his faith and not his religion. This message is not beaten over the audiences head. This is not a religious picture. But it gives the film a dimension that I didn't expect.Director Jared Hess doesn't stray to far from his Napoleon Dynamite roots. But that's okay. It works here and he hits the right comic tones. I can't wait for the DVD because I'm convinced that the film really needs to be viewed a second time. Knowing what to expect allows the audience to settle into Hess skewed comedy. The film is very dry and if you don't know what to expect its easy to dismiss the comedy and think the film is horrible. You have to work at it a little bit and let it sink in. But when you get it you'll love it.If you're looking for an hour and half of silliness you can't go wrong with NACHO LIBRE. It's cute sweet and you get to stare at Jack Black's upper torso for far too long. Trust me if you like weirdly sweet Mexican wrestling comedies this is the film for you.".

Now I own it.Jack Black was hilarious as the monkpro wrestling wannabe Nacho. The premise alone is humorous an overweight Mexican monk who would rather be a famous wrestler. It doesn't say much for his spirituality but it made for a lot of laughs.It's all outrageous absurd humor not meant to do anything but evoke laughs at any cost......just harmless fun. Detractors should keep that in mind. I have no interest in wrestling but the wrestling scenes in this film had me constantly laughing out loud. Black's tagteam partner Esquelito Hector Jimenez was just as funny as the main star if not funnier. Just the look on his face with all his teeth sticking out was funny!I have no interest in being a monk either but I know none of these monks in here were realistic figures especially the nun Sister Encarcion Ana de la Reguera . No offense but only in the movies are nuns this beautiful. Wow Reguera looked like a cross between Penelope Cruz and a young Winona Ryder. And she wasn't just beautiful but a sweet lady too.Although it's a comedy the story had some nice touches of sentimentality and humanity namely Nacho's attitude adjustment his genuine compassion for orphaned kids that the Brothers and Sisters took care of and his basic desire to do good despite a very weak commitment to vows.Maybe that's why there are so many critics of this film it wasn't meanedged and nasty enough to satisfy them. Howeverthose who appreciate good slapstick will like this movie.Also if you appreciate bold beautiful colors you'll find this an attractive movie. There was a feast of brilliant colors shown. I was impressed how much effort was made to make this movie look nice in addition to getting laughs.In a very very pleasant surprise much better than I ever hoped it would be....and recommended for those wanting a bunch of belly laughs for an hourandahalf.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nacho Libre contains much of the same dry deadpan humor that made Napoleon Dynamite so much fun to watch. I'm sure Jared Hess's brand of humor is not for everybody. We're living in an era where Dane Cook is our top comedian. So if you're expecting the same loud obnoxious gags you see in most comedies nowadays you'll probably be disappointed. I on the other hand love this type of humor. Just like in ND the actors don't try hard to be funny. Jack Black is not very convincing as a Mexican. With his skin so white he sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the rest of the cast. But that's no big criticism. This is a comedy farce and if his accent didn't sound so phony I doubt his character would be nearly as funny. As an extra treat for all the ND fans out there his character is paired off with a softspoken Mexican buddy. They make a good comic team with Jack being so short and fat and his buddy being so tall and thin. I tend to just roll my eyes at many of the crude gags I see in movies nowadays but I even enjoyed the bathroom humor in this movie. I found myself laughing most of the way through and this is one of the rare cases where I felt that the film lived up to its trailer. Some of the funniest gags were given away in the trailer but there are many other funny gags that weren't. If I have any complaints the movie does sort of drag in the third act. But all in all Nacho Libre is good fun for the entire family. I can't wait to see Jared Hess's next project.".

To enjoy the schizophrenic world of Nacho Libre however you don't have to be to be a genius. It is a uniquely original and zany vision that no one could possibly confuse with reality. However it is the kind of film that does not frame itself very well in high expectations. It is somewhat counterproductive to announce beforehand Oh now here we have a very amusing and hilarious movie. Despite the fact that for my wife Carmen and I LIBRE most certainly was both! Perhaps the main attraction here is a surreal simplicity innocence and freshness and that its basic raison d'etre is so utterly hairbrained and absurd...but in the best possible way! Shouldn't go into much more detail here so as not to ruin it for you with anything resembling a Spoiler. But taking this into account I will dare to offer the following observations Another interesting element of LIBRE is that seemingly it was made tailored to seek out a new market in the United States...The bilingual movie buff! at least new in relation to film production. Jack Black is listed as the sole producer. That is he put up his own money betting there would be a receptive bilingual viewing audience segment! .It must be noted however that there are a number of attempts at humor that flat out do not work in LIBRE. But these flubs fortunately are handily outnumbered by scenes that DO produce considerable laughter. The sight of Nacho Libre and his tagteammate Esqueleto Skeleton wrestling and taking on the world is about as close as I ever want to come to dying of laughter! The love songs composed and sung by Jack Black are so slapstick operatic exaggerated so insanely ridiculous and so poorly rendered that they end up being immensely entertaining.Most certainly Nacho Libre is not a classic of the Seventh Art that will be much debated ten years in the future. But it definitely will keep you laughing a lot during an hour and a half of your life! 8....ENJOYDISFRUTELA!!!".

I don't think that it will be a huge hit though even on the order of Napoleon Dynamite.Also I'm curious to know what fans of Lucha Libre will think of this movie.

What do you do when you just had a big hit movie and one more joke? You get a backer and make a one note bad film.Husband and wife Jared and Jershua Hess the creative team behind Napoleon Dynamite join forces with Mike White and Jack Black the team behind School Of Rock to try and drop kick another hit with the tale of Nacho Libre. The concept perhaps the most interesting and funny aspect of the movie has a Mexican Friar Ignacio Black as a man of the cloth that has to turn to Mexican Wrestling to make enough money to feed the orphans.While the film does have a couple of great guffaws and it's share of slapstick antics to shock us into laughing the bulk of the movie relies on Jack Black's ability to carry the weight of the entire film on his back and suplex it. He can't do it with one joke but what an effort he puts in. Jack Black does his worst typical Mexican accent and body slams his signature style of quick quips effectively but it just is not enough to make the whole movie work .This is the kind of movie that catch phrases come from but I'll put a figurefour leg lock on anyone that tries to repeat these lines to me. Some times this kind of movie works but that is when the star has a cast to support him. The script only introduces one other comic character into the movie and he only has one joke too and it's the same one Jack Black is telling.In what could have been a very funny scene with Black singing to the current wrestling champion the director ends the scene way too short. I'm sure they has a great time filming this movie but during the editing process someone should have noticed that the film just wasn't working. In the middle of the film is a sequence of scenes that seem to be put in just because the director thought they were funny. Not only do they not follow the plot or progress the story at all but they don't even stay in the same genre of comedy. There are two jokes that would have fit into Airplane! and others that wanted to be in a dark Wes Andersonesquire comedy.Some positive things I can say is that the costumes and set design was meticulous and perfectly hilarious. The location shooting in Oaxaca Mexico is beautiful and sets the mood wonderfully. By using the full use of the natural beauty with the cinematography to capture the amazing work of all the technical aspects of the film this film was visually compelling.When I left the theatre I saw some younger people still laughing outside maybe this unfocused film would be funny for someone that has not been jaded by watching intelligent and inspired comedies. Sorry Mr. Black but I have seen great comedies and this is not one of them.He may be the champ but I will not step back in the ring with Nacho Libre.".

Sorry Mr. Black but I have seen great comedies and this is not one of them.He may be the champ but I will not step back in the ring with Nacho Libre.";

I kept waiting for the mother eagle to come and poke his eye out or pull down his stretchypants. Not that that would have improved the scene but I was left unfulfilled.

	schema:reviewBody "I have fallen asleep every time I watch Napoleon Dynamite. Without fail. But aside from embarrassing myself to every reader I have to say that I did not mind Nacho Libre at all. The dialog is fine yes and fart jokes are strategically if not diabolically placed from scene to scene. But Nacho is very much a visual film. A treat for the eyes where with the obvious exception of Ana de la Reguera actors are not beautiful or glamorous or drowned out in makeup but are real. Their faces have more expressive character than anyone in Hollywood does and with that foundation you can build a comedy around that package it and let the talent do the rest. With that in mind I have to say Nacho Libre is a fantastic movie in its own right and Jack Black well he just runs wherever the script lets him.Ignacio grows up all his life wanting to be a luchador. The monastery slaps a ladle and pot in his hands and makes him cook to make some kind of use of him. But inspiration returns to him when he sees a chance at making money in the sport he so often wanted to do.Jared Hess made a smart move by letting Jack Black run around with the film. From making Ignacio sing for Encarnacion or Ramses the comedy comes from Black's wit in knowing how Hess wants the film. Extra thumbs up goes to Nacho's partner Esqueleto who lets Hess run wild with his unusual imagination. No one knows really the hows or whys of Esqueleto's stance on science or relationships or even orphans for that matter but Jimenez delivers the punches. I recommend Nacho to everyone who loved Dynamite. Hess delivers a Hollywood ending but throws it so over the top that only your inner 4yr. old might laugh for it. Visually I enjoyed the real world look of Nacho Libre with the comedy being a plus. But if you look for consistency and you lack the patience of what could be a generally silent film maybe wait till it comes out for the home.".

Also this movie had a good hearted story involving a man who is determined to use his desire to be a wrestler for good and not evil showing us that you don't have to fit into a perfect mold to be a man of God.Jack Black is a genius.

Our hero wants her to praise his heroism by break her vows of celibacy but she's oblivious to his yearnings and instead gives him a hilarious thumbs up. The film surprisingly doesn't exploit Jack Black's singing gifts. He's given one funny song  he hums Piel Canela with a mariachi band  but most of his other songs are truncated or interrupted.8.510  See Eagle vs Shark. Multiple viewings required.";

Some of the action is ludicrous but the most ridiculous of all  the fight against the huge Russian is actually the most fun of the action scenes. The rest is just plain mean as the hero's entire family gets wiped out by gunman and The Punisher Thomas Jane goes after them after almost being killed himself.A smart aspect of this film was inserting a bit of humor in it such as the two nerds down the hallway who befriend The Punisher.

	schema:reviewBody "A fairly good adaptation of the Marvel Comics vigilante character originally introduced in the SpiderMan comic books.Former soldier and FBI man Frank Castle exit Dolph Lundgren enter Baltimore native Thomas Jane of Deep Blue Sea and DreamCatcher who's about six or seven inches shorter than Dolph Lundgren but still pretty buffed up and also a naturally blond man having dyed his hair black to match the character's appearance in the comics has retired from the action and is looking forward to living a quiet life with his wife and kid. While attending a family reunion at the beach Roy Scheider plays his dad Frank's family is attacked by assassins sent by Howard Saint John Travolta to avenge the death of one of his sons from Frank's last mission. In a shot similar to the original Mad Max 1979 Frank's wife and son are brutally run over with a giant truck while his father brothers and in laws are gunned down. After being beaten to a pulp and shot in the chest and nearly blown to bits Frank is saved by a local and nursed back to health. Naturally he is enraged at the heartless murder of his family and goes after Howard saint his wife son and secretly gay lawyer thirsting for revenge. He sets up his base of operations in a run down building with three misfit neighbors  a sexy but unloved waitress a guy with lots of piercings in his face and an over weight Asian guy.In many ways closer to the comic book than the earlier film this one manages to get the skull shirt in there and remembers to at least mention that Frank was originally a soldier before going and making him a copFBI guy. Thoug Thomas Jane is not as physically imposing as Dolph Lundgren he still manages to be a fairly menacing yet sympathetic figure. John Travolta delivers his usual joyful villain routine. Rebecca RStamos of the XMen films and yes I know she's separating from her husband John plays the sexy but unloved waitress who's spent the last few years trying to keep undesirable men out of her panties but once she gets an eyeful of Frank she wants to get into his pants because he's a strong confident Alpha male who sticks up for the underdog and tries to steer Frank away from his suicide new life style. Rebecca is okay in this role certainly no worse than any other comic book movie love interest.One thing that surprised me about this film was how much humor was in it whether it was Frank's fight with a giant blond Russian thug or his torturing the informant to be by threatening to blow torch him while actually burning a thing of meat while poking him in the back with an ice pop You are not a nice person.. Also worth noting is Frank's response to being told that obviously he's upset I used to get upset when I had a flat tire... when a plane was delayed... when the Yankees won the series... Still despite this humor the film is never as ridiculously unbalanced as Daredevil or as disconnected as Hulk both released in 2003. I was also expecting a little more violence but all in all I was satisfied with what I got.So far this is probably the best of the nonXMenSpiderMan Marvel movies. Of course studios have a tendency to NOT give the lesser known characters a suitable running time to establish who they are because they ARE lesser known and try to compensate by making them fast paced. Once studios learn not to do this better superhero films will become more common.".

He is much more cerebral here than in most of the other media he has popped up in and more human but not any more humane. Using the tried and true style of fist fights and pyrotechnics this movie keeps the character rooted in his all too mortal persona. The supporting characters turn in equally descent roles the likes of John Travolta worked well although nothing outstanding. No doubt about it Thomas Jane ran away with this one. He's just a normal guy doing supernormal things with a lot of gunfire and explosions to boot. If you are in the target demographic Male aged 1730 you will definitely enjoy this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Audiences have become so accustomed to being overloaded by CGI effects in recent comic book adaptations that the idea of a tougher leaner approach seemed to catch viewers and critics offguard when this latest adaptation of The Punisher premiered. Sadly most critics chose to ignore the very qualities that made this film so special never accepting that the story is closer in spirit to Sin City than SpiderMan or Daredevil. Now that the film is available on DVD I invite everyone to take a second look at this dark tale of the fine line one man walks between Justice and Vengeance...you may be surprised by how good it really is! The film is carefully constructed to allow viewers an opportunity to see dedicated undercover cop Frank Castle in action and to understand the caring loving family man Frank Castle was...before mob boss Howard Saint and his equally ruthless wife Livia played by a remarkably lowkey John Travolta and Laura Harring takes vengeance for their son's death by ordering the brutal execution of Castle's entire family. As conceived with total conviction by Thomas Jane Castle is so completely traumatized that he 'lets go' of what remained of his compassion and becomes a human weapon devoid of pity living only to see justice done in equal measure to the crime.This is not someone you can easily 'warm up' to and as the movie evolves into a series of executions you may actually start to feel more sympathy toward the Saints and their henchman Quentin Glass the everwatchable Will Patton than in Castle. But screenwriter Michael France and cowriter and director Jonathan Hensleigh both wellversed in the Marvel comic character add three quirky 'innocents' Rebecca RomijnStamos Ben Foster and John Pinette who Castle warms up to somewhat and must ultimately protect. He will never recover the compassion that he lost but he realizes that for many being brutalized he is the only hope they have giving him a purpose to live for.Unlike the earlier Dolph Lundgren Punisher hampered by a minuscule budget and twodimensional acting this version makes the most of its small budget with firstclass acting including a VERY welcome cameo by Roy Scheider incredible stunt and pyrotechnic work and a storyline that offers far more depth than you might expect in a comic book adaptation.I sincerely hope a sequel is made as this will be a film that will grow in stature as audiences realize how good it actually is!".

He will never recover the compassion that he lost but he realizes that for many being brutalized he is the only hope they have giving him a purpose to live for.Unlike the earlier Dolph Lundgren Punisher hampered by a minuscule budget and twodimensional acting this version makes the most of its small budget with firstclass acting including a VERY welcome cameo by Roy Scheider incredible stunt and pyrotechnic work and a storyline that offers far more depth than you might expect in a comic book adaptation.I sincerely hope a sequel is made as this will be a film that will grow in stature as audiences realize how good it actually is!";

Thomas Jane was amazing he definitely had the essence of the tortured Frank Castle down perfect. The acting in this movie was extremely well done a lot more well done than many people critics have given it credit for. I think that John Travolta even though he can be a bit annoying at times played a great bad guy and his character was sinister and cruel but loving at the same time. Will Patton I think almost stole the show with his portrayal of his character Quentin Glass because he had a charisma about him that was equally disturbing. It was a great movie not just 'great for what it was'. The story was good the stunts and the violence amazing and I really hope they greenlight for a sequel.".

I thought it was going to be some type of 80's action movie but it turned out to be great movie aimed towards an older crowd. The beginning is a bit slow but the action really keeps you focused. Thomas Jane did an excellent job as the Punisher and Travolta's performance was much better than I was expecting. This is a movie that thinks so deeply about its conflicts and decisions that there are times when the audience itself feels like it has a personal stake in the outcome.

The pain and anger that he deals with causes him to become what he used to hunt down a murderer who slaughters criminals day and night.

The suspense and excitement experienced throughout the film eventually unfurls into a dramatic and astonishing conclusion that moviegoers will never forget.I can't think of anything more to say about this movie so I will say this The value of this movie is beyond words.

I do however feel it is extremely important to debunk the 'comic book' label since it is both unjustly applied and it will perhaps generate false expectations from the mainstream audience.Although The Punisher is adapted from Marvel Comics the Rrating alone should be blunt indicator of the path it intends to take. Half an hour into the film it still leaves us clueless and oblivious to the dark turn it will twist into. During which Thomas Jane undergoes an apt transformation of character from heartfelt family man on that one last undercover op to a hardboiled brooding vigilante who downs whiskey swears tortures and broods. The catalyst for this development is the brutal murder of his family and now he's out to get the hierarchy of villains headed by John Travolta  only he isn't just out for vengeance or justice  he's out to punish. In a corrupt city of thugs Frank Castle becomes the judge jury and executor.What is so refreshing about Thomas Jane in the part of Punisher is that he is a sprawling surge of old school with a splash of Clint Eastwood protagonist  the detached effortless action hero who is too cool for romantic interests with hardcore oneliners and a merciless approach to duels. In this way he is easily one of the most successful 'superhero' actors of the new millennium. But alas Jane went unnoticed and Punisher did poorly at the box office probably BECAUSE it adopted this offbeat oldschool style to acting and action.I also want to comment on said action which was spectacular. Truth to be told I have been waiting a long time to say that about a film. Usually it's the obligatory the visuals are stunning or it's extremely fastpaced and kinetic but here the sheer handtohand combat is the film's goldmine because it moves back into close character mode instead of the epic scenarios that Batman Superman and Spiderman dish out to keep out interest. It's gloriously gritty graphic and dirty which unfortunately also begs the question of where the 33000000 budget went. Did they spend it all on late night taco runs?For that matter The Punisher is far from devoid of faults. Its fatal flaw stems in part from what made it a good film in the first place its sparseness of effects general minimalism and lack of superhero formula. Rather it is a modelkit assembled from seedy oldschool revenge action movies the type you'd sort of casually catch a bit of on TV one night. 7 out of 10".

After castles final operation spinning out of control killing one of the saint twins Howard and Livia order out a brutal mob attack on castle family reunion killing everyone his wife his son will his mom and dad cousins uncles I can imagine castles pain and taste for vengeance on the saint family. More other great work is the stunts the car chase sense where castle is hunted down by a bounty hunter harry heck of course hes some sorta country boy who was probably hinting castle with a tune that he was gonna attempt to kill castle who also gets his throat slashed by castle a 2nd hitman the Russian played by a great wrestler Kevin Nash probably without a doubt the most brutal sequence in the movie. Alittle bad language here and there but the best thing about this film is that it is very true to both the character and comics. The Punisher is a hardR rated movie delivering a great action film of this generation. Fans of the comics will love this and probably by now are hoping for a sequel as I am myself! 1010 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA all the way ".

Both Frank Castle and Max Rockatansky are cops Both were on some sort of leave from the force when their families were murdered. Frank was with his family celebrating a family reunion Max is taking a holiday with wife and Baby after his best friend Goose's death. Both Max and Frank were hunted down after getting one of the gang members in each movie murdered Bobby Saint in Punisher and The NightRider in Mad Max by accident. Max's wife and Baby son were chased down the highway and run over by motorcycles Frank's wife and son were chased down the jetty and run over by a Red Bronco ute. Both Wives and children tried to escape by driving away. Max's wife in the Sandman and Frank's wife in the Bronco with a boat attached. Both Max and Frank end up becoming renagade cops and end up hunting down the baddies. Oh yeah and both drive converted cars which are both coloured Black and have V8 Motors. Frank's car was a Pontiac GTOdone up with metal venetian window shields Max's car was a Ford Falcon XB coupe V8 351 The Black Interceptor.Overall I loved The Punisher. Its not your average Comic book movie. He doesn't have special powers like Spiderman and The Hulk and Hellboy do he's just a normal guy taking out his anger the way normal people would do...In extreme circumstances.".

Its not perfect the main villain is a bit over acted easily over looked in a comic book movie and Thomas Jane owns the screen.I'd definitely place this closer to something like Sin City than Spiderman deadly serious with a few funny moments it has the funniest torture scene in any movie I've seen So is this a rent or buy? It depends on how you feel about a tragic revenge story If its not so much you're thing rent it.

	schema:reviewBody "Make no mistakes about it The Punisher is a great action flick that's the proper mixture of quality acting deep emotion and dark violence. The Punisher ended up being a much better movie than I was anticipating. I think it will please comic fans and action fans alike. I also think it will be accessible to mainstream audiences. Definitely check it out on the big screen. The brilliance of this movie comes from the uneasy nature in which you spend your two hours riveted to the story.  Yes I did say brilliance.  At first you get that uneasy feeling as you watch the director set up a story which is pretty much common knowledge.  You know that Frank's wife and son are going to get it.  So the exposition that sets up his love for his family and the tender moments they share are uneasy sorrowful and touching.  After the Punisher revs up into full Punishing' mode you're uneasy at the way in which he is dispatching villain after villain.  I was squirming in my chair and I wasn't the only one in the theatre doing so.  Sure it's violent but it borders on sadistic violence.  What's makes you the most uneasy is the fact that you are actually enjoying the carnage. These guys are so vile and are so deserving of their Punishment' but you still have guilt to go along with the pleasure of seeing Frank really cut loose.  If you've seen The Punisher trailer then you see an image of him firing an arrow.  You have NO idea where that arrow ends up but boy that must have hurt.  The one thing you don't have to worry about with this film is if the villain will get his.  I hate movies that go so far to develop a villain as truly evil by having him do despicable things after despicable things but have his demise be quick at movies end.  Well you will feel sorry for Travolta's character at the end of this film and he does some very horrible things himself during the duration of this movie.  Overall this film is an emotional journey that will make you squirm.  I experienced all of the following emotions while watching this movie revulsion sadness satisfaction compassion anger laughter envy thrills and thanks to multiple product placement I really had to have a shot of Wild Turkey when I went home!".

However after seeing both this movie and it's predecessor 15 years earlier I do believe I would have been a fan of the comic.The thing I like most about Frank CastleThe Punisher Thomas Jane is that he is not too over the top unbelievable... and he's mean! Who would not be after going through what he went through? Frank Castle is a war veteran turned FBI agent and he is on his last mission before retirement. He hopes to get through it without any casualties but alas somebody has always got to do something stupid or there would not be a story. Anyways a son of Howard Saint John Travolta is inevitably killed which makes both Howard and his wife Livia Saint Laura Harring thirst for revenge against those responsible. Somehow they get the name and whereabouts of Frank Castle who has retired and is at a family reunion in Puerto Rico. They send a group of assassins who swiftly and callously execute every member of Castle's family and believe they have killed Castle himself but he has somehow survived.From that point on Frank is healing and going on a drinking binge all the while plotting his revenge on Howard Saint. He does not refer to it as revenge however because that is more of an emotion. He calls it punishment thus his new moniker.Once The Punisher goes all out there are all kinds of nice fights and scenes that show the nature and anger of The Punisher. I thought there would be a lot more violence as I had played the ultraviolent video game before seeing the movie but I thought what they showed was pretty good. There will be plenty more if they make a sequel. Maybe if we are lucky we could eventually start having the crossovers like in the comics with SpiderMan vs Punisher etc.This is one of Marvel's better efforts following Hulk and Daredevil. I enjoy all of them but this one stood out for me and is up there with SpiderMan and XMen in my book. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Castle is a cop who leads a bust that sees the son of crime boss Howard Saint end up dead. Not content with killing Castle Saint orders the whole Castle family to be killed  which they are in a bloody seaside massacre. However Frank survives the attack  just but with nothing left of his life he focuses on the only thing he knows  hate. With this the only thing he now feels Castle sets out to bring down Saint killing each and every one of them that were involved in his family's death.If you are looking for a violent action movie with lots of things going bang and quite cool images then this will pretty much do you. You sound like you have quite low requirements in life and this film is happy to settle for less to help meet them. The action is distracting enough  hardly fun perhaps but certainly violent enough and regular enough to satisfy the target audience of teenage males. However below this there is nothing where really their should have been a great deal. Castle is supposedly a tormented figure he must blame himself for his family's death since he created the enemies that killed them he has nothing but revenge and even when he has had that he must know that he will then have nothing else. However Castle in this film is just mean apart from the extreme violence he just comes across as antisocial rather than racked by a terrible pain and emptiness.And it is in this part of the film that it falls down in a major way because although it wants to be all dark and complex it really is nothing of the start. The opening credits are dark and menacing but the rest of the film is just a straightforward action affair  hell it doesn't even have anything of interest to say in regards revenge or vigilantism although this is minor compared to the failure to give Castle any character beyond that of a standard Hollywood tough guy. Without this heart to the film the extreme violence is more about getting an audience than getting to the heart of the character. The violence is unpleasant but not as much as it should have been  it should have been horrific sickening to the point where we're not sure if Castle was ever any better than Saint. It wasn't like this it was just gory and seemed to take pleasure if making the audience wince. I wanted to be sickened by the massacre of the Castle family  I wasn't I wanted the massacre of the Saints to play out so that the film showed us how similar it was to the earlier massacre  but it didn't. It may want to have been dark but it just ends up being a Hollywood action movie after all  and a fairly ordinary one at that.Jane must have known what he was up against and he can do nothing to stop it. Neither he nor the material have the complexity needed and for most of the film he just seems to be brooding rather than hurting. Travolta is soso but has little time I assume he took the role because it is an interesting baddie who did manage to have a more tragic character than Jane did. The support cast are mainly poor mostly because of the material. The film didn't need a love interest or a comic relief  so RomjinStarmos Foster and the big guy sorry don't know his name couldn't have gotten off the screen quickly enough. Patton is reasonably good but he is better than this film deserves. Nobody is terrible but nobody is particularly good and although it should have been this was not a film for the actors.Overall what should have been a dark disturbing complex violent and emotional film is just a normal action movie with some rather unpleasant violence. Without heart the film does enough to distract its target audience but those foolish enough to expect anything beyond the basics will only go away disappointed.".

	onyx:emotionText "Frank Castle is a cop who leads a bust that sees the son of crime boss Howard Saint end up dead. Not content with killing Castle Saint orders the whole Castle family to be killed  which they are in a bloody seaside massacre. However Frank survives the attack  just but with nothing left of his life he focuses on the only thing he knows  hate. With this the only thing he now feels Castle sets out to bring down Saint killing each and every one of them that were involved in his family's death.If you are looking for a violent action movie with lots of things going bang and quite cool images then this will pretty much do you. You sound like you have quite low requirements in life and this film is happy to settle for less to help meet them. The action is distracting enough  hardly fun perhaps but certainly violent enough and regular enough to satisfy the target audience of teenage males. However below this there is nothing where really their should have been a great deal. Castle is supposedly a tormented figure he must blame himself for his family's death since he created the enemies that killed them he has nothing but revenge and even when he has had that he must know that he will then have nothing else.

But it is Valentina Cortese who steals the show as the fading actress Severine. Her scene opposite Alexandre in which she can't remember her dialog and suggests just saying numbers she did the same when she worked with Federico is priceless.At one point Ferrand says that a director is a man who is constantly asked many questions and sometimes knows the answer and it is sort of a surprise that the one man who invented the auteur theory which more or less says that a film is the director's work makes a film that shows how many people's work is involved in the making of a film. But it is not only a film about people making films Many of the characters most notably Ferrand Alphonse and Joelle are film enthusiasts and the entire film is a film from a film lover about film lovers for film lovers.

	schema:headline " Delicate but penetrating";
	schema:reviewBody "La Nuit Amricaine is an interesting movie with celebrated French director Francois Truffaut playing a director making a movie. He proves to be a modest and convincing actor himself while patiently weaving a tale about how movies are made and how intense the emotional interactions among those making the movie can be.Don't give up on this one too soon. It starts slow and seems almost amateurish because of the relatively lowtech way the film within the film is being shot. Truffaut gives us a glimpse of how the production crew works together and sometimes at odds while showing us some of the things that can go wrong while making a movie. He begins with the technical details of the production but before long begins to concentrate on the personalities of the moviemakers and their individual stories. Each story is carefully crafted in a somewhat leisurely way almost like the characterizations in a soap opera without of course the phony drama and mass market sentimentality seen on TV. Truffaut's fine sense of emotional conflict and how conflict might be resolved makes the various stories touching without being maudlin.Jacqueline Bisset who stars as English actress Julia Baker who plays the title role in the film within the film May I Introduce Pamela? doesn't make her appearance until about a fourth of the way in. She is a delight as an actress with a heart of gold recovering from a nervous breakdown married to an older man whom she does indeed love. JeanPierre Leaud whom most viewers will recall as the running boy in Truffaut's The 400 Blows plays a young and not entirely confident actor who gets jilted by the script girl who runs off with the stunt man during production. Bisset's warm and sisterly befriending of Leaud is shall we say entirely French which gets her into trouble with her husband. This really is a skillful showcasing of Bisset since she gets to play something like an ingenue with her husband and the older woman with Leaud. Be careful you might fall in love with her.Valentina Cortese in a fine supporting role does a most convincing job of playing the temperamental Italian actress just past her prime who quaffs champagne while working who forgets her lines and can't find the right door but when properly indulged gives a great performance.My problem with this movie is I saw the dubbed version and of course that is disconcerting because one is constantly trying to reconcile the visualized actor with the dubbed one. To see Jacqueline Bisset who is beautifully fluent in both English and French speaking French while at the same time hearing someone else speaking English for her is just a bit too much to take. I understand that the DVD version is in French with subtitles. I would recommend that you get that and not the dubbed video.Truffaut is the kind of director who allows the audience to penetrate not only his characters to see what makes them tick but also the stars who play those characters.

	onyx:emotionText "La Nuit Amricaine is an interesting movie with celebrated French director Francois Truffaut playing a director making a movie. He proves to be a modest and convincing actor himself while patiently weaving a tale about how movies are made and how intense the emotional interactions among those making the movie can be.Don't give up on this one too soon. It starts slow and seems almost amateurish because of the relatively lowtech way the film within the film is being shot. Truffaut gives us a glimpse of how the production crew works together and sometimes at odds while showing us some of the things that can go wrong while making a movie. He begins with the technical details of the production but before long begins to concentrate on the personalities of the moviemakers and their individual stories. Each story is carefully crafted in a somewhat leisurely way almost like the characterizations in a soap opera without of course the phony drama and mass market sentimentality seen on TV. Truffaut's fine sense of emotional conflict and how conflict might be resolved makes the various stories touching without being maudlin.Jacqueline Bisset who stars as English actress Julia Baker who plays the title role in the film within the film May I Introduce Pamela? doesn't make her appearance until about a fourth of the way in. She is a delight as an actress with a heart of gold recovering from a nervous breakdown married to an older man whom she does indeed love. JeanPierre Leaud whom most viewers will recall as the running boy in Truffaut's The 400 Blows plays a young and not entirely confident actor who gets jilted by the script girl who runs off with the stunt man during production. Bisset's warm and sisterly befriending of Leaud is shall we say entirely French which gets her into trouble with her husband. This really is a skillful showcasing of Bisset since she gets to play something like an ingenue with her husband and the older woman with Leaud. Be careful you might fall in love with her.Valentina Cortese in a fine supporting role does a most convincing job of playing the temperamental Italian actress just past her prime who quaffs champagne while working who forgets her lines and can't find the right door but when properly indulged gives a great performance.My problem with this movie is I saw the dubbed version and of course that is disconcerting because one is constantly trying to reconcile the visualized actor with the dubbed one. To see Jacqueline Bisset who is beautifully fluent in both English and French speaking French while at the same time hearing someone else speaking English for her is just a bit too much to take. I understand that the DVD version is in French with subtitles. I would recommend that you get that and not the dubbed video.Truffaut is the kind of director who allows the audience to penetrate not only his characters to see what makes them tick but also the stars who play those characters. He does a particularly beautiful job with Bisset who is warm and wise and something close to heroic and with Leaud whose childishness seems natural and whose pettiness forgivable. Don't believe those reviewers who think this is a slight film. It is carefully crafted and very well thought out and is a fine example of the work of the one of the great directors of the French cinema. See it for Truffaut whose delicate genius is evident throughout.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	schema:reviewBody "No sentimentality  just play notes! is the instruction we hear over the credits that open Day For Night. About three seconds later we see silent film stars Dorothy and Lillian Gish striking highly theatrical poses with a signed inscription by director Francois Truffaut saying the film has been dedicated to them.So is sentimentality a good thing or a bad thing? Truffaut may be playing it both ways yet Day For Night makes a great argument in both directions. You need to feel something to pour so much heart and soul into moviemaking but you also need to be hardhearted say for example if an actor dies before a film is wrapped or a cat won't drink milk on cue. Day For Night strikes an amazing balance between hard and soft happy and sad comedy and tragedy and in the end offers a unique take not only on movies but on life itself.What a funny life we lead says the aging starlet Severine Valentina Cortese summing up Day For Night's take on the ephemerality of both departments. We meet we work together we love each other and then as soon as we grasp something  pfft  it's gone. See? But if there is some consolation in Truffaut's view it is the companionship life offers especially on a film set where families of intense passion and strength can sprout up in an instant.Cortese is a treat with both her sweetness and her lighter moments. Severine tries to make a dramatic exit in one scene but keeps opening a closet door. Everyone in this film shines in some way selling you utterly on the idea you are not watching a movie but eavesdropping on a real set even as Truffaut constantly makes references to the fact Day For Night is a movie. Jacqueline Bisset plays an actress known for being in that movie with the car chase while JeanPierre Laud's character's girlfriend complains he wants the whole world to pay for his unhappy childhood.Truffaut was responsible for Laud's unhappy childhood of course but avoiding sentimentality makes his young actor protg more of a heavy and comic foil this time out playing not Antoine this time but another fellow named Alphonse. Laud rewards his director with a genuinely funny takeoff on his intensity from other Truffaut films.I also love Bisset who as Julie gives the film a bit of real heart as the one character who has something of a life beyond movies with a middleaged lover she cares for almost sheepishly. Yet it is she who exemplifies the show must go on by risking her life outside the picture in order to save the picture itself.Even Truffaut does a good turn as a major character playing a film director. Truffaut always worked best as a slightly ruffled authority figure here urging a tipsy Severine not to go through her difficult scene reciting numbers In France we have to say the lines!There's very little I would want to change in this film not even the garish 1970s clothes which give this film an appropriate aura of informality. It's soapy yes but so's life at times and like life it really makes you want to stick around for the moments it gets right. Sentiment may be dangerous to performance but it seems worth having around in the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Truffaut's movie dedicated to two great silent stars Lilian and Dorothy Gish is very specific since it shows how a movie is being made from a technical as well as personal point of view. The content may seem to be boring for some people. However it is not exactly so for many people since lots of us would like to see the real wings of a film and Truffaut's movie does a perfect job in this aspect.The cast are generally good but the quality of performances is raised by very few individuals. The actors and actresses have a double work to do to play in the film which is being shot MAY I INTRODUCE PAMELA as well as to play in DAY FOR NIGHT. Jacqueline Bisset is supposedly the main star of the film. Yet she is far from best. Sometimes it is felt that she cannot combine her role in DAY FOR NIGHT with her role of Pamela. She looks confused at switching to two different realities. There are some less famous French cast like Dani or JeanPierre Aumont who do a good job but do not appear to be particularly memorable. However the person who absolutely shines in her role is in my opinion Valentina Cortese. The Italian stage and movie actress born in Milan was cast by such great directors as Antonioni Fellini and Zeffirelli. She was always very good. But here in Truffaut's movie she gives one of her very finest performances. She beautifully combines the role of an actress and the role of Alfonso's mother. It's just a perfect flow between these two. I have watched the entire film twice but the scenes with Ms Cortese  ten times. Her facial expressions in the portrayal of Severine an alcoholic desperate movie star her constant forgetting of the lines and opening wrong door her whole acting REALLY DESERVE AWARDS!Since the film's content deals with making movies I would like to concentrate on one more aspect how it really shows movie making and people who take part in it. Here I must say that Truffaut did something unforgettable and universal. While watching DAY FOR NIGHT a viewer is led to a wonderful journey into the core of film making. One can see for instance the scene shooting problems with direction writing the script the private problems of the cast the way others perceive the works director's real devotion including ultimate work  Who is a director?...Someone who is constantly being asked. Finally the film touches the most serious problem what happens if an actor dies during filming... This is something that happens rather rarely thank goodness yet it's double tragedy. Truffaut also develops the characters of actors and actresses  these are not only people who act but complex individuals.I recommend DAY FOR NIGHT to those people who are interested in filmmaking. Truffaut did a piece of marvelous job and I am glad that Valentina Cortese was cast by him and her performance resulted in awards. She really deserves it.".

However his father and Pamela fall in love with each other and she leaves her husband to live with her fatherinlaw. The producer Bertrand Jean Champion and the director Ferrand Franois Truffaut invite the British Julie Baker Jacqueline Bisset who had a nervous breakdown and married her Dr. Nelson David Markham to the role of Pamela. Along the shooting the cast and crew are lodged in the Hotel Atlantic and Bertrand and Ferrand have to deal with problems with the stars Severine Valentina Cortese an aging artist with drinking problems that affect her performance the immature spoiled and needy Alphonse JeanPierre Laud Julie that is emotionally unstable. But in the end they succeed to complete the film.La Nuit Amricaine is a film about making a film and a great tribute to the cinema. This is one of my favorite Truffaut's films and the last time I saw it was on 08 January 2001. It is impossible to highlight performances in this film but the mesmerizing beauty of Jacqueline Bisset shines. JeanPierre Laud performs his usual role of an insecure man using the same gestures of Antoine Doinel.In 1992 Louis Malle explored the storyline of Je Vous Presente Pamela in Damage. My vote is nine.Title Brazil A Noite Americana The American Night".

That and it's also a French film made by renown French director Francois Truffaut.  It's definitely watchable and entertaining and deserves some notoriety but personally it's hard for me to call it a masterpiece albeit a good film.It's a fairly decent film but nothing extraordinary unless you're wrapped up in the whole film making process.  That is to say it helps if you're involved in the industry to really appreciate the scenarios that are being presented because they are quite accurate in general the various problems and situations that arise and must be overcome but are somewhat exaggerated here because Truffaut's attempting to present many of the things that can and often do go wrong during production but tosses them into one film.It's the kind of movie that tries to offer a slice of life that most people don't get to experience and makes some minor comments on the lives of both cast and crew.  If you've read either jutulen's Colorado USA or jennifernz's Auckland New Zealand comments on this BBS then you've read pretty much what you need to know about this film and what it's all about.What the film doesn't show is the more mercenary aspect of the industry.  So be warned you're getting a very sugarcoated look at the realities of motion picture production.  The film doesn't show crew members networking and competing for the next job nor the intellectual theft and real material theft that occurs on sets and stages nor how cast and crew often demonstrate their lack of respect to ordinary folks and their values who are interested in seeing a movie being made though those things are really American occurences.  Nor does it show the vast amount of litigation that occurs in the family as the cast of Day for Night might say.Often the film gets unwarranted praises because of its exposition on the art of film making.  It's more than a docudrama but not quite a traditional classicat least not in the commonly understood sense.  The industry's changed some since then somewhat more industrialized but also somewhat more sordid in more subtle and whitecollarlike ways but in general is more or less the same and Day for Night gives some good examples of that.See Day for Night once.  If for no other reason so you can brag about it at the next cocktail party i.e make yourself look well versed in cinema and just generally smart ".

Truffaut by comparison likes shiny pretty things and anything that disturbs that safe universe is averse to him. Thus his 116 minute long 1973 filmic take Day For Night La Nuit Amricaine on the behind the scenes goings on at the making of a movie amount to little as neither the exterior film the interior film nor the extraexterior of the viewer watching the film satisfies on any level. The characters on all levels are rather vapid if not outright cardboard characters and it's a tossup as to which set of characters are more vapid those who portray actors in Day For Night whose title derives from film scenes that are shot day for night wherein a filter is used to give the look of night while shooting in daylight yet the metaphor of which is pointless to the actual film or those the actors portray within the interior film Meet Pamela Je Vous Prsente Pamela literally May I Introduce Pamela. On either level the action is purely melodramatic. Critics argue the film shows how much Franois Truffaut loves film. So? Love without action or meaning is rather sterile the perfect description for this well made but dull and simply pointless film. There have been many films made about the making of film or metafilms on the subject even going back to the silent era. But the two most interesting comparisons to be drawn with this film would be from films released a decade earlier. One by Truffaut's rival Godard who made Contempt Les Mepris and the other by Federico Fellini 8 Otto E Mezzo.... Still despite its awards and reputation Day For Night is not near a great film merely an adequate one whose greatest failing is its being too long for its banal and lightweight screenplay to sustain itself. If it lost 3035 minutes it could have been more successful. Then again I may as well grow wings for the screenplay aspect of films was never high on the list of the French New Wave filmmakers who were birthed out of the atrocious Cahiers Du Cinma magazine on film theory. The filmmakers who came from this milieu Truffaut Godard Eric Rohmer Jacques Rivette Claude Chabrol were generally not good writers with the exception of Louis Malle even if they were competent technical and visual stylists. Their writing as critics was routinely bad consisting of purple prose that dealt with the criticism of intent rather than substance and was usually only undershot by the often worse ideas they espoused. Thus Day For Night's failure is no surprise. It is too prosaic flat and hollowly predictable to succeed as great art even if it is an interesting diversion at times. Compared to a film like John Cassavetes Opening Night which similarly details the dramatic goings on of a stage production it is fey and forgettable. Say what?".

The score to 'Pamela' has to be played over the phone to the composer something like that so we get to hear the music as we are shown shots of magazine covers depicting film directors. Only trivial in the sense that a beautiful sunset is trivial.What is great about this movie is that is not serious but at the same time it is serious. For instance I think it is unfair to criticize Bisset for a leaden performance her role is the most difficult because she has to play tragic in a comedy.I love the title both the French one and the American one but it  might give a false impression about this fun movie.More than any other nonserious movie I highly recommend watching 'Day for Night' from the beginning.

The editing here too is a tour de force of film art   actually I'm surprised that few critics have mentioned it in their rush to acclaim 'La Nuit Americaine' as la grande hymne a la cinema. Most of all this film is as densely layered and as sweet as a Napoleon pastry  indeed near its ending Truffaut lavishes its set with frosting.Some claim that 'La Nuit Americaine' has dated. Well it can date me any day anytime anywhere and yes that was an oblique reference to the best line Nathalie Baye delivers. With this film Francois Truffaut cut and polished and gave from his intellect and heart a gem whose facets and heart will sparkle eternally. An absolute must for everyone's don't miss list.".

For some this might mean that this Truffaut film is perhaps a little less exciting and more concrete but I still preferred it to 8 12. Truffaut played what else a film director making a film entitled Pamela. It was a little odd that the names were all changedthe actors director producer etc. I think this is because this isn't really a documentary but a movie about you watching a movie being made and so it isn't exactly reality. This left some questions though about where reality and fiction diverged. In particular I was curious if Truffaut REALLY was hard of hearing as in the role of the director he wore a hearing aid. I never saw Truffaut with one before though he couldn't have worn it when he acted in the movie Wild Child as it was set in the later 18th century! Overall the film was very interesting and worth watching. Great? Not really but certainly on of Truffaut's better films and much more conventional that the similar but wildly surreal film 8 12.".

	schema:reviewBody "Because i like films with small casts this one is not my kind of film.  I find it a bit confusing with so many characters with so many different problems coming and going at breakneck speed.  If ever I wished to become a movie director I think this film has certainly cured me of that desire unless of course it was my intention to commit suicide following a nervous breakdown.The production of a film within a film was interesting for me never having experienced a large movie set.  I thought the kitten scene was hilarious. As an actor I've been on stage with a dog and i know the unexpected problems one encounters.  Also it's nerve wracking when some players cannot remember their lines.  I've used the same ploy myself by pinning sections of the script to walls and curtains and furniture.  In fact at one time i thought this was an original idea of mine.  I was highly amused to see the idea used by players in the film about Pamela.It is said that being on a movie set can be very boring because of the repeat takes.  If you are not in that particular scene you may have to sit around for hours.  I have to admit that this film develops the right atmosphere with lots of pressure on the director as he attempts to finish the film within the prescribed time limit and so many of the players happen to be absent at the moment when required to do their part.I was delighted to pick up quite a few bits of technical information e.g. a burning candle is fitted with an electric globe half way down the length of the candle out of sight of the camera of course which gives a nice glow on the face of the character.  We are told that a revolver should be held at arms length for best dramatic effect and the size of the firearm is important too.  The snow making equipment was intriguing and the effect quite convincing.  Lots of aspects of movie making are included such as priming oneself with alcohol before going on the set and the dangers of overdoing it.  Obvious Truffaut has faced all the eccentricities of movie making and combines them with good effect in this film.".

	schema:headline " A ridiculous waste of talent";
	schema:reviewBody "Gregory Peck is Mackenna a onetime gambler who's settled down as the Marshall in a small desert town. Rumors of a lost Apache valley full of gold causes a mass rush that catches both the best and worst elements of the town up in its force. His nemesis Colorado Omar Sharif is the chief ringleader responsible for kidnapping the local judge's daughter Camilla Sparv and Mackenna after Mackenna destroys the only map to the valley.By far the strangest thing about this movie is the way that so many great character actors are basically wasted in tiny roles. I see no reason for the townspeople who only play in one scene to be performed by actors of the caliber of Lee J. Cobb Burgess Meredith Ray Massey Eli Wallach and Edward G. Robinson. It seems to me like a gimmick a trick to make the audience think that the film will be full of great stars when in actual fact they only paid them for what looks like a couple days' work. The big roles in the film go to incompetent performers like Sparv or to the stale theatrics of a born TV actor like Savalas who looks incredibly odd and uncomfortable with his tiny fat legs perched on a huge stallion. Only the excellent Sharif is able to do anything really memorable or interesting with his character and that's a bit of a stretch since the character himself is so typical. Peck is fine but that's about it. He has none of the fire or passion that fueled his best western performance in Duel in the Sun here. Poor Julie Newmar is stuck as a mute with brown makeup on as an evil Apache woman.Another odd thing about the movie is the way it consciously evokes Lean's Lawrence of Arabia a far better film. The landscape shots are fantastic but the shots of Sharif riding through the desert ring a note of deja vu. And it can't be a coincidence that Anthony Quayle shows up in the movie. I half expected Peter O'toole or Alec Guinness to make a cameo towards the end.There's nothing horribly wrong with the film or bad about it as simple entertainment. But considering the cast assembled and the money that was spent it's very underwhelming. The story is rather dull and predictable the direction is bland and impersonal. This is simply functional western filmmaking of the kind that killed the genre.".

His nemesis Colorado Omar Sharif is the chief ringleader responsible for kidnapping the local judge's daughter Camilla Sparv and Mackenna after Mackenna destroys the only map to the valley.By far the strangest thing about this movie is the way that so many great character actors are basically wasted in tiny roles. I see no reason for the townspeople who only play in one scene to be performed by actors of the caliber of Lee J. Cobb Burgess Meredith Ray Massey Eli Wallach and Edward G. Robinson. It seems to me like a gimmick a trick to make the audience think that the film will be full of great stars when in actual fact they only paid them for what looks like a couple days' work. The big roles in the film go to incompetent performers like Sparv or to the stale theatrics of a born TV actor like Savalas who looks incredibly odd and uncomfortable with his tiny fat legs perched on a huge stallion. Only the excellent Sharif is able to do anything really memorable or interesting with his character and that's a bit of a stretch since the character himself is so typical. Peck is fine but that's about it. He has none of the fire or passion that fueled his best western performance in Duel in the Sun here. Poor Julie Newmar is stuck as a mute with brown makeup on as an evil Apache woman.Another odd thing about the movie is the way it consciously evokes Lean's Lawrence of Arabia a far better film. The landscape shots are fantastic but the shots of Sharif riding through the desert ring a note of deja vu. And it can't be a coincidence that Anthony Quayle shows up in the movie. I half expected Peter O'toole or Alec Guinness to make a cameo towards the end.There's nothing horribly wrong with the film or bad about it as simple entertainment. But considering the cast assembled and the money that was spent it's very underwhelming. The story is rather dull and predictable the direction is bland and impersonal. This is simply functional western filmmaking of the kind that killed the genre.";

	schema:reviewBody "How can a western with Gregory Peck Omar Sharif Telly Savalas Eli Wallach Lee J. Cobb and Edward G. Robinson be mediocre? Well it can.This could have been a classic treasure hunt action adventure growing paranoia shifting factions... instead it's a waste.The big cast is handled terribly. We are introduced to this huge group of people played by famous stars and respectable character actors we get some halfbaked characterbuilding scenes... then after a few minutes 90 of them get killed. The quote from a much better western I've put in the review title feels quite fitting. Try to imagine a version of say The Magnificent Seven or The Dirty Dozen... where most group members die in the scene right after their introduction. Anticlimactic doesn't quite convey it. Peck is not at his top form he looks uninterested even bored. Sharif goes for an overthetop approach as the outlaw.Worth mentioning is a bit near the end which just cracks me up  movie villain stupidity at its most glorious. Sharif's Colorado has all the gold and the horses he can ride away and live happily ever after... but he grabs an axe and goes freeclimbing after Mackenna who is far away on the top of a mountain. It's so dumb it's brilliant.There are a few effective scenes  like the arrival at the valley and the gold fever  but overall Mackenna's Gold is sadly mediocre.I dig the main theme of the score though  catchy.510".

In this case we have 70mm wide screen the actual demolition of an impressive canyon as if it had been created for this one event. We have nudity ! and there's a parade of big names from both TeeVee and Hollywood. The original scope was 2 12 hours with an intermission after the townspeople get massacred.But everything about this is wrong. Everything. In part it was because they started with components and shoved them together without any coherent tone a heehaw narrator a comically toned score what looks like the goals of three or four scriptwriters and in the end some radical chopping of scenes.But there are other problems too. Peck is supposed to be an ordinary character modeled after Maverick the character in the runaway Warner TeeVee western. A man with a rogue past many women drinking gambling who has turned good and cleaned up the town perhaps heavyhandedly.He encounters one of his lovers here a sexy Indian maiden who he has not only thrown over but disfigured. He is played by Gregory Peck but because the director is so weak Peck reverts to his Mockingbird lawyer. It screws the whole thing around. Lucas and Harrison Ford were one of the bad things to happen to the world but you have to admit they got this center right. Egyptian Sharif as a Mexican bandito is similarly bungled.Everything else is sullied in the same way We have some actors that have been adequate elsewhere but here we see Lurch Catwoman Kojac the wife of the studio boss and a bunch of cameos from movieland. Here movieland is shoveled in as The Town. All the Hollywood actors are townspeople who are killed by the audiencecavalry contrasted to the TeeVee folks passing through.The explosions that bring the walls of the canyon down are compromised by some of the cheapest junkiest effects you'll see. The wonderful location shots are interspersed by artless backprojection. The nudity is by Julie Newmar or her double and consists of a very strangely assembled nude swim during which she tries to seduce Peck is rebuffed so she tries to drown the apparent new girlfriend in underwater shots made murky in postproduction.Its a curious piece of history. In lots of other places we have movies poorly assembled from prefabricated parts some which spend a lot of money. Its the overt role that TeeVee plays that makes this interesting plus the obvious selfreference of goldseekers that come away emptyhanded and in the process destroy something beautiful.So much of life is dealing with old battlefields.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

Lucas and Harrison Ford were one of the bad things to happen to the world but you have to admit they got this center right. Egyptian Sharif as a Mexican bandito is similarly bungled.Everything else is sullied in the same way We have some actors that have been adequate elsewhere but here we see Lurch Catwoman Kojac the wife of the studio boss and a bunch of cameos from movieland. Here movieland is shoveled in as The Town. All the Hollywood actors are townspeople who are killed by the audiencecavalry contrasted to the TeeVee folks passing through.The explosions that bring the walls of the canyon down are compromised by some of the cheapest junkiest effects you'll see. The wonderful location shots are interspersed by artless backprojection. The nudity is by Julie Newmar or her double and consists of a very strangely assembled nude swim during which she tries to seduce Peck is rebuffed so she tries to drown the apparent new girlfriend in underwater shots made murky in postproduction.Its a curious piece of history. In lots of other places we have movies poorly assembled from prefabricated parts some which spend a lot of money. Its the overt role that TeeVee plays that makes this interesting plus the obvious selfreference of goldseekers that come away emptyhanded and in the process destroy something beautiful.So much of life is dealing with old battlefields.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.";

	schema:headline " Tepid and often underwhelming Western which is largely out of control when it isn't just rather dull.";
	schema:reviewBody "From its bizarre ornithological opening to its brash and clumsy finale featuring two people duking it out on a cliff top because generic framework structure demands they do just that Mackenna's Gold is an uneasy and often stupid exercise in style over substance a film attempting to feed off the the success of a certain Sergio Leone and his array of westerns from a mere few years before. Like the opening bird to whom a certain song of which five whole minutes of screen time is dedicated it is a scavenger looking to live off scraps from a kill made by a bigger better animal a film cashing in on an approach to material that was fresh and daring in its character depiction and treatment of the genre whilst wanting to keep things on the straight and narrow so as to not be too alienating. Mackenna's Gold is all fancy camera angles and macho posturing a film with a bored looking lead film with an idea at is core that is too worn and not executed freshly nor made to feel like it isn't something we haven't already seen a film that is essentially all but daft shootouts unfolding throughout an episodic script plagued by problems with tone.Our lead is the titular Mackenna an American marshal from the Old West played by Gregory Peck who's a man chasing outlaws and doing his best to uphold peace even if it means having to go against one's principals in shooting dead an Apache oldtimer on account of self defence. You see Mackenna is a killer and a good killer and a warrior in battle able to negotiate around his surroundings so as to garner the upper hand if needs be but he is the sort of guy the film wants us to realise most probably despises violence. Peck looking as if he is in pain for most of the movie comes across a map possessed by the mentioned dead elderly Apache a map directing the owner towards an infamous stash of gold in amidst the hills and canyons of this land supposedly as plentiful as the sand to everywhere else on this damn frontier. Memorising it and then burning it he is picked upon by Omar Sharif's larger than life Mexican bandit Colorado plus gang who were looking for the map and its now deceased owner so that it may direct them to the gold. Fresh scenario in mind they are forced into dragging him along rather than leave him in a shallow lonely grave.Standing in stark contrast to Mackenna Colorado is an animated and full of himself individual a man with a ruthless streak which rubs off on his compadres as they run from their wanted status' and happily ransack an elderly gentleman's house if it means new horses food and the companionship of the endowed Camilla Sparv. She plays the young Inga of whom they take along from the ranch on the quest for the Apache treasure but is ultimately no more than a pretty thing to look at a 'one for the road' character primarily existing to look nice and get a little grubby later on. Chasing Colorado are the American Calvary headed by Telly Savalas' cutthroat Sergeant named Tibbs and after Mackenna is an Apahce tribe looking to avenge the death of that elder. The presence of Eli Wallach brings about several supporting acts a series of townsfolk inexplicably looking to get in on the treasure hunt but are essentially clichs in that they range from the wellspoken and seemingly informed Brit to the cocksure 'kid' character through to a mostly unmoved holy man and must quite literally be introduced to us via a pointing and a verbal reiterating of who they are. They exist to play that of the film's cannon fodder.Cue several madcap episodes and some rather disjointed content ranging from goofy oasisset wouldbe romances to full on Native American assaults the film coming at us with pretensions to be as good as or even as intelligent as The Good the Bad and the Ugly but mostly ending up as a badly choreographed precursor to something like The Cannonball Run. In essence an awful lot needs to go and a good deal more needs to be changed dramatically the voiceovers periodically updating us on the voyage when they aren't attempting to infer a childlike fableist tone to proceedings are ultimately superfluous.The women of the piece prove equally problematic in that Sparv's character is an angelic unmarked and more grounded member of the adventure although ultimately exists so that she may be dragged about in the mud and get a little bit filthy on top of the fact she appears too photogenic for the era within which the film is set. In keeping with this apparent idea of binary opposition between the two warring males that of Mackenna and Colorado Julie Newmar's young Native American girl HeshKe as in former international footballer Emile is a dangerous temptress and a scarred often overly aggressive woman capable of murder. If we're going to go down this fatuous route of women cast for their looks and brief moments of 'skin' at pools of desert water why not exploit the fact the dangerous one had a fling with Peck's character a few years previously and have them come together for a brief violent fling? Why not attempt to insert something daring or a little off kilter amidst the drudgery to keep us interested? Alas the film is too cute in its shacking up of its lead with someone 'safer' so as to not generate thinking amidst its audiences. J. Lee Thompson aims high with Mackenna's Gold but both he and the project fall well short of where the bolt should have landed the film somewhat obnoxiously selfaware of its own 'hunt' for gold box office receipts and popularity via the opening Jose Feliciano song and in truth just coming across as a tad daft.".

But after reading all the reviews I found the positive reviews are almost directly proportional to the distance of the reviewer from the West. I was a kid growing up in the Mother Lode country of California's Sierra Nevadas where they have their own lost gold legends and have actually worked for the past few years on microwave radio sites in New Mexico including the area of Reserve Quemado Datil and Magdalena where the Lost Adams Mine legends are said to be located. I'm also a Brother of Equal Indignity of the Ancient  Honorable Order of E Clampus Vitus A 170yearold Historical society with roots in the Mother Lode. So I'm always interested in gold mining stories from the Old West.I had seen this movie as a kid not long after it first came out probably for Julie Newmar's nude scene more than anything else and liked it then despite it's more hokey elements. Since then I grew up and actually worked in areas of the Jicarilla Mescalero White Mountain and Chiricahua Apache reservations as well as the Navajo reservation. So I watched this film today with a much more informed and jaundiced eye than when I was a kid. How bad IS this movie? Let me count the ways.1.Cinematography that wastes the natural beauty of Arizona Utah and New Mexico while adding unbelievably cheap special effects including shadows that LENGTHEN in the morningthe defying the Laws of Physics part.2.A script that wastes the talents of the actors especially the townspeople played by Wallach Wynn Cobb Massey Meredith Quayle and Robinson whose onscreen appearances and deaths shortly after reminded me of the guest stars in the opening credit scenes of the old Police Squad TV series. Sharif horribly miscast as the Bandit chief Colorado whose secret ambition seems to be to become Louis Jourdan in Gigi. Peck as the stolid stalwart hero at his MOST stolid. Camilla Sparv as the damsel in distress made of wood. Ted Cassidy and Julie Newmar as Tall Apaches which worked OK when I was a kid until I met REAL Apaches and realized how SHORT Apache people REALLY are. And Telly Savalas playing well Telly Savalas.3.Direction and production values that changed so much because they couldn't decide whether to shoot in cinerama 70 mm or 35 mm so they just decided to shoot some of the movie in each format and then edit it together with bubblegum two bandaids and some spit.4. Quincy Jones' execrable score that should be played on loudspeakers in front of his house for a month as penance.5. The unbelievable ending sequences where the mere echoes of rifle fire and hoofbeats are loud enough to trigger a seismic event.If there's ANY saving grace to this movie it's having Newmar play her character HeshKe as a mute. Considering the roles I've seen Newmar play where she SPEAKS that was the single most effective direction in the entire movie. That and her nude scene which was apparently her OWN idea so kudos to HER for that.So I give it three stars. One for the location shots one for Newmar's Mute portrayal and one for her nude scene. If you want to watch a GOOD Greg Peck western rent Duel In The Sun or The Big Country.".

There is a continuous jumping from scenes in studio with Peck and Sharif and in location with the stunts riding shooting etc. so badly and clumsily made... alas!

	schema:reviewBody "Mackenna's Gold is directed by J. Lee Thompson and adapted for the screen by Carl Foreman from a novel of the same name written by Henry Wilson Allen AKA Heck Allen Henry Allen  Will Henry! which in turn is loosely based on the legend of the Lost Adams Diggings. It stars Gregory Peck Omar Sharif Camilla Sparv Julie Newmar Ted Cassidy  Telly Savalas. It's photographed by Joseph MacDonald in Technicolor and Super Panavision with a music score by Quincy Jones. It begins so well the credits inform us that not only do we get Peck Sharif and Newmar in lead roles but that we also have in support a role call of quality thespians Eli Wallach Edward G. Robinson Raymond Massey Burgess Meredith Lee J. Cobb Keenan Wynn  Anthony Quayle. We are then treated to some gorgeous aerial photography of Monument Valley a Vulture glides gracefully thru the air and then we hear the awful strains of Old Turkey Buzzard warbled like it belongs in a seventies porn movie by Jos Feliciano. It's there that the true marker for Mackenna's Gold is set. The idea and source for the plot is safe Lawman Mackenna Peck has the knowledge of where the legendary Canyon of Gold is. A fabled place awash with gold but guarded religiously by the Apache. With the map safely tucked away in his brain Peck is quickly captured by blood thirsty Mexican bandit Colorado Sharif and his companions one of which Newmar playing Indian HeshKe has past history with Mackenna. But that's not all pretty soon Mackenna's party are joined by a whole host of other gold seekers all seemingly gripped with Gold Fever.

The film was originally a three hour epic complete with intermission but the budget probably all went on securing the cast and the producers don't seem able to deal with the task of making a big budget epic. Thus the film was cut to just over two hours thank god for small mercies! Looking at the cast assembled it's obvious that this was a very ambitious project meant to keep the Western flag flying high and enthral the adventure seeking cinema goer.

But what plays out is a series of clichs and absurdities that makes one unintentionally laugh. The effects are awful I mean OK we don't expect back screen work to be high class but here with the actors half heartedly pretending it's real it belies the fine work of MacDonald for the exteriors. The problems don't just stop with the effects before we even get to the issues in the cast there's Jones' dreadful score to try and ignore. It sounds like he thinks he's scoring a Keystone Cops Gold Rush type movie! Dimitri Tiomkin along with Foreman is on production duties hmm I'm sure he could have knocked up something better for this film in his sleep. Peck is actually OK with that laconic way of his he suits the tone of the narrative. Sharif is grossly miscast while Sparv is simply woeful. Newmar raises the temperatures of audience and cast alike which you sense was her only instruction while the lauded support cast file in and out without time to impact on proceedings. All of which leads to a finale of ham model work and predictability. Yet there's been just enough to make the undemanding stay to the end. We wonder if indeed there is a Canyon of Gold and Peck is so likable we just want to see him win out and defy the baddies. Does it succeed by failing big? Well it is fun but coming as it does from the makers of the Guns of Navarone you have to believe that the end product is not the sort of entertainment they originally set out to craft. 3.510".

Lee Thompson and adapted for the screen by Carl Foreman from a novel of the same name written by Henry Wilson Allen AKA Heck Allen Henry Allen  Will Henry! which in turn is loosely based on the legend of the Lost Adams Diggings. It stars Gregory Peck Omar Sharif Camilla Sparv Julie Newmar Ted Cassidy  Telly Savalas. It's photographed by Joseph MacDonald in Technicolor and Super Panavision with a music score by Quincy Jones. It begins so well the credits inform us that not only do we get Peck Sharif and Newmar in lead roles but that we also have in support a role call of quality thespians Eli Wallach Edward G. Robinson Raymond Massey Burgess Meredith Lee J. Cobb Keenan Wynn  Anthony Quayle. We are then treated to some gorgeous aerial photography of Monument Valley a Vulture glides gracefully thru the air and then we hear the awful strains of Old Turkey Buzzard warbled like it belongs in a seventies porn movie by Jos Feliciano. It's there that the true marker for Mackenna's Gold is set. The idea and source for the plot is safe Lawman Mackenna Peck has the knowledge of where the legendary Canyon of Gold is. A fabled place awash with gold but guarded religiously by the Apache. With the map safely tucked away in his brain Peck is quickly captured by blood thirsty Mexican bandit Colorado Sharif and his companions one of which Newmar playing Indian HeshKe has past history with Mackenna. But that's not all pretty soon Mackenna's party are joined by a whole host of other gold seekers all seemingly gripped with Gold Fever. So in fighting and suspicion ensues and with the Cavalry in pursuit of Colorado and the Apache still to come this is as dangerous as it gets. If only the film wasn't so choppy and flat.

	schema:reviewBody "Our Modern Maidens was MGM's followup to the previous year's Our Dancing Daughters. Key personnel were the same cast members included rising star Joan Crawford and second lead Anita Page as well as supporting actor Edward Nugent. Josephine Lovett again wrote the story and continuity Cedric Gibbons again designed the sets in art deco fashion and William Axt had a central role in music supervision which again consisted of popular tunes of the day matched carefully to the emotion or tone of the scene. It's almost like watching an opera without sung words. In this film the audio bits are more numerous and painstakingly crafted than in Our Dancing Daughters. Ambient sound is used as often as possible. If we are watching cars speed down a road we hear the engines. If a radio is playing we hear the announcer as well as the music. When a crowd is shown we hear the hubbub of voices the clapping of hands etc.The theme of both movies seems to be old morals vs new or good straightarrow behavior vs devious badness topics not uncommon in American popular culture during the 20s. In both films Joan Crawford is the wealthy spirited heroine who goes after what she wants without a second thought to the consequences she makes mistakes and pays for them but gets her wellearned rewards in the end. She is again opposed to Anita Page who hankers after the same man. Crawford does a lot of gesturing with her fingers in both Daughters and Maidens and seems to have developed a tight repertoire of definite facial expressions often involving motion of the lips. Page acts with her whole body and is more natural and convincing. But neither is unwatchable. Both films examine flaming youth perpetually in motion laughing uproariously about one thing or another jumping into jalopies to go on midnight joy rides swilling bootleg booze with gleeful abandon encountering pitfalls and bouncing back in the endless desperate quest to have fun and embody modernity which in its essence seems to mean accommodation to a female equality. When the characters in this scenario talk about being modern they are referring to the notion that a newlywed bride can go her own way if she chooses rather than accompany her husband on the honeymoon.As for leading men we get a very young Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as the foughtover fianc. He comes across splendidly in the silence looking much older than the 19 or 20yearold he actually was when he made this. His early talkie performances were often stilted but here he seems a master of the craft. Rod LaRoque is perfect as the more mature and sophisticated love interest to the Crawford character. Edward Nugent returns as the perennial happygo lucky boyman.".

Unfortunately MGM didn't make separate continuity versions  they simply added a soundtrack music and sound effects to the silent version.  But the silent film could be run at the proper speed  anywhere from 16 to 22 frames a second at the discretion of the projectionist  whereas the sound version had to be shown at 24 frames a second the fixed speed to have the sound come out right.  So you see the action faster than you are supposed to making some of it seem rushed quite noticeable and often annoying.The plot is your basic love quadrangle with Crawford in love with and getting secretly engaged to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. while Page is in love with him.  It's secret so Crawford can play up to influential Rod La Rocque who can get Fairbanks a diplomatic job.  She cruelly lies to La Rocque who falls in love with her saying Fairbanks is a friend only a boy.  While Crawford is getting to La Rocque Fairbanks and Page have an affair which he regrets finally telling her of his engagement.  Page simply says she will never tell Crawford her best friend. After La Rocque gets Fairbanks the job the  engagement is announced enraging La Rocque to the point he almost rapes Crawford.  I was really surprised when they were alone in his cabin and he grabs Crawford that he yanks her hair back violently so he could kiss her passionately.  He finally leaves in disgust after telling her he stopped not because of decency but because he didn't want her. Crawford marries Fairbanks but all four are in for some big surprises.The love scenes are punctuated with a lot of jazz age fun.  We see Crawford doing a nice interpretive dance at a party and Fairbanks imitate John Barrymore doing his facial changes made in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 1920 and then imitate John Gilbert passionately kissing a woman. Those two are mentioned by name but then someone yells Do Robin Hood an amusing in joke because it referred to his real life father Douglas Fairbanks Sr. in Robin Hood 1922.  And he does it very well leaping and posturing just as his father did a reason why he was able to make some swashbuckling films himself later on.".

Anita Page who also never looked lovelier is everyone's charming girlnextdoor pretty cute decent. She gives a superlative performance as the intriguingly named Kentucky.

It's story drags and the characters are very flat and uninteresting.A few positive things that can be said While Joan Crawford is not very pretty in the role of Billie Brown she shows that she can carry a film.Douglas Fairbanks Jr. isn't that bad as an actor. The jerkiness of his scenes has to be forgiven he still didn't have much experience with acting in pictures. He does a lot less posing than his father which is nice. He also imitates his father in a party scene and also does amusing and effective impressions of Lon Cheney and John Gilbert.Anita Page so hateful in the first film is delightful here. Her character is so much more likable here and it really gives her a chance to let her real personality shine through. Miss Page just recently started acting in films again after years off the screen and is one of the oldest of the original Hollywood line up.The sets and costumes are great. The cinematography is also very nice.Our Modern Maidens falters in several places. It's poorly paced with long scenes that feel padded and unnecessarily slow. The last fifteen minutes progress slowest of all with too must emoting on sofas and rushing from room to room. The use of sound is interesting and reflects a time when Hollywood was frantic to market any film they could as a talkie. This is a silent film with intertitles and sound effects. For instance when Joan asks her girlfriends what their thoughts are on leaving school they chant MEN! MEN! MEN! both in an intertitle and on the sound track.Typical commercial fare at the time Our Modern Maidens is made watchable by it's visual design and by Joan Crawford and Anita Page. I recommend it to fans of either but the average viewer will probably find it laborsome and slow.".

It is not as good as Our Dancing Daughters but it is still a slice of riotous jazz age fun. Were the 20s really that exuberant  who knows???? The film studios wanted you to think they were!!Billie Brown Joan Crawford and Gil Douglas Fairbanks Jnr. become engaged but keep their engagement a secret until Gil's appointment at the Paris embassy comes through. Kentucky Anita Page Billie's best friend also loves Gil but from afar. Meanwhile Billie starts to romance Glenn Abbott the very dashing Rod La Roque in the hope that she may be able to influence him to help Gil.On the night of Billies' big party Billie decides to stay with Glenn leaving Kentucky and Gil alone on the lake. When Glenn who is now in love with Billie finds out about the secret engagement  he goes to her and tells her he wants nothing more to do with her. On her wedding day Billie learns that Kentucky is having Gil's baby he doesn't know of course. She leaves them to it and honeymoons on her own  I'll start a new modern trend. Of course Glenn tracks her down in Paris and they embrace at the fade out.The art deco sets are stunning and the stylish Adrian gowns are gorgeous. The theme song throughout the film is Should I from Lord Byron of Broadway. It was a huge song hit in 1929. My Sin was probably Kentucky's theme song. Other popular songs in the film were If I Had You and My Kind of Love.Again another top performance by Anita Page. It isn't a big part but she makes the most of it with tons of emotion. I have read that she felt her career was sabotaged because she would not succumb to L.B. Mayer's advances. There seems to be some truth in that judging by the strength of her performances. Dorothy Sebastian was replaced by Josephine Dunn as Ginger. She is the bad girl and her part isn't big. Eddie Nugent again plays one of Billie's pals.".

The two have a modern relationship where they seem to flirt with others and party a lot with the country club set. Crawford wants to secure her boyfriend a job in Paris so she puts the make on a wealthy businessman Rod La Roque who has all the right connections. While this is going on Anita Page who was also in Our Dancing Daughters with Crawford is madly in love with Fairbanks. The two flirt go places together and we find out at the end the two have produced a child this right after Fairbanks and Crawford get married! Crawford gets to be the selfsacrificing one something that would be a common theme throughout her long film career.The best thing about this film is Crawford herself she is so young and pretty here and her vivacious eyes light up the screen. Fairbanks is young and handsome as is the entire cast. The film hearkens back to a different time and place in Hollywood. This film is silent with some sound effects but sound films were already being made. Just a year later silent pictures would be dead. But thank God for film and Turner Classic Movies for bringing them to us.".

He takes up with her pal Page and she turns to the older la Roque a dashing scoundrel whose pencil thin mustache identifies him as a cad.Perhaps one of the easiest silent films I've managed to watch this is extravagant decadent and sinfully delicious. It is a festival for the eyes with Crawford's feathery flapper outfits an outrageous party with ostentatious sets that are a sight to behold as well as some situations that only seemed to work in silent films and an obvious reason that some considered a production code necessary. It's romantic funny and filled with the gaiety of youth that cannot be fathomed by the overly sensitive snowflakes of today. It's easy to see why Crawford was such a big star. She's got a vitality unsurpassed even by It girl Clara Bow. Fairbanks Page and la Roque all deliver emotional performances as well. The lavish wedding sequence complete with a chorus of Here Comes the Bride is a campy delight. There's also a nice camaraderie between Crawford and Page even though they are allegedly rivals.

While this film is pretty mild compared to many of them it DOES concern a woman Joan Crawford that kisses up to a man and pretends to love him to help her fianc! In addition the young people in this film spend most of their time getting drunk chasing the opposite sex and gambling! Apparently Grandma was quite the party animal back in 1929! This is also an interesting film because it's transitional between silent and talking films. While technically some might consider it a silent since all dialog is on intertitle cards sound effects and music were later added to make it almost seem like a sound film. THIS WAS A PROBLEM THOUGH as to make a silent film with sound effects the movie was actually run at a slightly higher than normal speed silent films were cranked at between 16 and 22 frames per second sound was 24. So the film looks a tad too fast! While this isn't always noticeable when the people are dancing they appear to be hyperactive amphetaminepumping gerbils!!! This doesn't really harm the film much though.As for the story itself the production values are good BUT the plot seems a bit slow and dull. In addition to Crawford trying to romance Rod La Rocque for the sake of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. who was her husband in real life at the time their mutual friend Kentucky Anita Page was desperately in love with Douglas! And so the audience is left wondering who will live happily ever afterand we really are led to feel sorry for La Rocque and Page. Well see for yourself what happens but don't expect any magic.

This will mainly be of interest to Joan Crawford fans or those who are especially fond of jazz age stories. Otherwise it's pretty forgettable.";

To make sure headlines were grabbed costars Joan Crawford and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. were married. In the film the two play a happy couple who are engaged with their whole lives in front of them. Crawford decides to gave a fling with an important government man Rod La Rocque so that her fianc can get his career off the ground. This morality play isn't overly strong in terms of drama but all the precode elements make up for that. The first thirtyminutes of the movie are quite naughty as our young ladies do nothing but want sex men drinks and gambling. These jazzage images are certainly rather fresh considering how many classic movies didn't feature any of this stuff. I would have loved to have been in the leg casting room as there are countless shots of beautiful legs that I'm sure had men smiling back in 1929. We even get Crawford in a rather revealing bikinilike outfit showing off her curves. The story itself really isn't anything overly great as it's rather predictable and I'm sure you'll see the ending coming from a mile away. Crawford is very good in the role making for a nice little character that she can play without any trouble. Fairbanks is also pretty good but his highlight is the sequence where he mocks John Barrymore's Jekyll and Hyde and spoofs his own father's image. Anita Page has a brief part of bad girl Kentucky and La Rocque is good in his scenes as well. As with the previous film this one here has a synced music score which features the typical cheering brief dialogue and even a radio broadcast. I feel this early silent to sound stuff doesn't work too well but again we must remember this was 1929.".

Of course the most prominent was Manuel Fidello in Captains Courageous but he also played a gypsy in Tortilla Flat a Cuban fisherman in The Old Man and the Sea a German in The Seventh Cross. He certainly did a lot better than Henry Fonda who was also typically American but laughable in War and Peace.In The Mountain he plays a Swiss mountaineer a simple peasant guy with great dignity and iron moral sense. He's got a younger brother played by Robert Wagner and there's a generation gap between them.Wagner's performance reminded me very much of what Marlon Brando said in The Young Lions about how he resented working for tips from foreigners in his own country. Wagner wants to get up and out of their Alpine village and doesn't care how. Brando and Wagner are both ambitious Brando's way was to become a Nazi Wagner had a less political approach to satisfy his ambition one a lot more crude though.A plane crashes on a forbidden Alp near their house a mountain that Spencer Tracy had climbed solo before. An expedition to reach survivors fails with the death of a friend of Tracy. Wagner wants to go up on the mountain to loot the passengers. Tracy wants to see if there are survivors and they make the climb.A survivor does turn up actually a Hindu woman played by Anna Kashfi this was in fact an Air India plane that crashed. Her survival touches off a test of wills and purpose for the brothers.I hadn't seen The Mountain for many years and I had forgotten how riveting Spencer Tracy's performance was. In the dialog and in the closeups the anguish in him tears at the audience.The only criticism I have of The Mountain was that Tracy and Wagner were playing brothers. Tracy was the least vain of all the great Hollywood stars from the studio era he was known for never wearing makeup. He looks every bit the 56 years on the screen and Wagner looks his age and he was in his twenties then. They're not too believable as brothers but both are skilled enough players to overcome it. But they should have been made father and son like in Broken Lance.Outside of that The Mountain is one great film.".

Nobody attempts an authentic accent but Tracy compensates by speaking veeeery slowly and was clearly in no condition to climb a flight of stairs never mind a mountain.

After all Spencer Tracy and Robert Wagner are cast as brothersand their age difference is 30 years! And frankly at this point in his life Tracy looked significantly older than 56probably due in part to his heavy drinking. On top of that the film is based in the Alpsyet no one sounds French German or Italianjust American. For me all this really took me out of the experience and overwhelmed everything else in the filmboth the good and the bad.The Mountain begins with a plane crashing into a mountain in Europe. A group of mountain climbers have volunteered to climb to the summit to look for survivors but the job looks almost impossible. After all it's getting late in the year and the mountain has claimed lives over the years. One climber who isn't about to climb is a guy played by Tracy. He is a VERY experienced climber but has given up the sport because he KNOWS he'll die if he keeps climbingas he nearly lost his life the last time he climbed this mountain. Soon the rescue party returnstheir leader is dead and they don't believe it's possible to make it. So far so good. However inexplicably Wagner insists he'll go up the mountain alone even though he's NOT an experienced climber because he wants to rob the dead. Even more inexplicable is that Tracy agrees to go alongeven though he's horrified by his brother's callousness. His intention is just to keep the younger sibling from getting himself killed. What happens next? See the film.I thought as I watched the film that although Spencer Tracy looked way too old for the part that he did a nice job. As for Wagner however he didn't have much chance in this film. First he was acting against one of the ages best actors. Second his character was about as onedimensional as Snidely Whiplash or Simon Legree!! He was ridiculously writtenand his character sure went to a lot of trouble just to steel. He could have easily committed crimes at sea level instead! When the film began I was very impressed. The camerawork was greatwith incredibly vivid colors and a scope that was just lovely. And many times during the film I marveled at the way the director and his crew were able to make it appear as if Wagner and Tracy really were climbing in the mountains. Too bad then that the writing and casting was so dumb that all the great looks of the film were in vain. Overall a timepasser that should have been much better.FYISomething you might want to look for if you like spotting goofs is Tracy's hands. In a VERY shocking and exciting scene his hands are horribly torn apart by a rope. His brother falls and Tracy's only recourse is to grab the rope and hold on for dear lifeas you see blood pouring off his torn hands. It's a VERY effective scene. Yet shortly after his hands are perfectnot a trace of a wound that should have taken weeks to heal. And looking at the accident you'd assume he'd always be seriously scarred by this!! However at the very end his hands are all bandaged! Talk about lousy continuity.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Mountain 1956A brightly colored movie with old school Spencer Tracy and new style Robert Wagner in a drama about getting something that doesn't belong to you. The scenery is stunning clear high altitude stuff shot on location in the French Alps. Edward Dmytryk is a Hollywood steady with a good sense of drama and the movie has good bones.Loosely based on a true story a 1950 crash of an Indian airplane the catchy facts are dwarfed by the stereotypes of the two main characters and by the general drama and landscapes. The plane wreck is high up in the mountains and a rescue party is waiting to go up in the morning. But then these two brothers far enough apart in years to be father and son go up first the evening before. The acting is first rate all around which keeps even the slow acts held together decently. Overall though this is a plodding plot. Roughly a third of the time yes is pure mountain climbing which can be fun for a minute but it follows the two men up and then down the mountain in great detail. All well done yes but what you really want is some intensity a greater clash of two moralities each representing a different generation. The crash site is really quite believable if a little concentrated in one spotI think these high speed crashes get pretty scattered in truth. And the general idea works pretty well not only the difference in motives of the two brothers but the ability of one brother to look the other way for the other. There is a surprise turn of events at the top and then another on the way down when the drama builds at last. And then there is a final little confessional speech that Tracy gives like he does in many of his roles. He is meant to be the great selfsacrificing humble man as good example. It really is as others write overly sentimental and frankly unbelievable. And unnecessary too. Even an unwillingness to talk about the events would have had the same moral effect without the townspeople basically winking in the final scenes.Alas. Not a classic. If you like technical mountain climbing with ropes you might enjoy a lot of it. And some great scenery.".

I wanted to see more of Trevor and her character's devoted friendship to Tracy. So I must call this film a missed opportunity with artistic flair that lacks in an interesting narrative.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1950 Air India Flight 245 crashed into the side of Mont Blanc in the Alps killing everyone on board. A couple of years later French novelist Henri Troyat wrote a book entitled 'La Neige En Deuil' about a plane crash in the Alps and this 1956 movie is a screen adaptation of that book. With Spencer Tracy and Robert Wagner playing brothers the film immediately gives itself credibility problems. Both good actors and both effective enough in their individual roles but to believe in them as brothers is remarkably difficult. Wagner was 26 and looks marginally younger than that Tracy was 56 and looks a good deal older. Their relationship simply doesn't ring true and the tremendous age gap is the key factor. Luckily if you're willing to overlook this piece of lunatic casting the rest of the film is wellmade absorbing and very interesting.Aging sheepman and Alpine expert Zachary Teller Spencer Tracy hears of a terrible air crash in the Swiss Alps on a mountain he knows better than anybody. Zachary is very superstitious and refuses to climb the mountain as he has already had a few nearfatal accidents upon its slopes. A rescue party sets off to the crash site but is forced to turn back when their guide  one of Zachary's close friends  is killed in a tragic fall. Later Zachary's impetuous and coldhearted younger brother Chris Robert Wagner decides to go to the crash site to find loot and make himself rich. Zachary is appalled at the idea  he calls it pickpocketing the dead within the sight of God  but he knows his brother will surely die if he tries to climb alone. Therefore he joins him on the hazardous climb. When they reach the crash site they discover a young Hindu woman still alive in the wreckage. Chris wants to leave her to die so that he can fill his pockets with loot Zachary is determined to bring her down to safety at all costs. Soon the brothers are locked in a furious moral feud.Tracy does very well as the older Teller brother. He is such a skilled actor so very watchable. There are very few films where he doesn't command attention and in this one his morally righteous mountain man is at once lovable and deeply humbling. Wagner is quite good too as the selfish younger brother. Obviously they don't suit each other as siblings but the point about their incompatibility as onscreen brothers has been laboured enough. Edward Dmytryck shoots the film in glorious VistaVision capturing his Alpine scenery in breathtaking beauty. If nothing else this is a truly greatlooking film. The narrative is rather slow in parts particularly the opening but it builds to some genuinely hairraising climbing sequences later on. The ascent of the brothers to the wreck site is powerfully done with one moment in particular when Wagner slips and the rope slides through Tracy's hands burning and bloodying his palms as he tries to break his fall that lingers long in the memory. A solid character film  almost a twohander play with a more spectacular backdrop than most  The Mountain is a very worthwhile 105 minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I waited many years for this film's conversion to DVD. As a kid I remember so well watching this in black and white on Saturday Night At The Movies. I first bought the DVD of this and now the BluRay version both produced by Olive Films. It's a fairly good transfer and the BluRay is decidedly better as it should be. However the film has not been fully restored so there are some scenes where the color seems to fluctuate...but that may just be a result of the age of the film well over 50 years. Certainly not enough of a problem to make the movie less enjoyable although oddly enough it's the instudio mountain climbing where the color varies the most not the natural Alps footage. And considering that much of this movie was actually filmed in the French Alps well it's still magnificent Vista Vision photography! And they do a great job of combining instudio footage with Alps backgrounds making this more realistic than many films of its era. Unfortunately despite being in the Alps and it's snowing...you can't see their breath! Even in Ronald Colman's 1937 film Lost Horizon they worked in a large freezer so you could see their breath in the mountain scenes. But again one really shouldn't get lost in these shortcomings because Spencer Tracy's acting makes up for it all.Spencer Tracy has been my favorite actor pretty much all of my life and I'm in my mid60s tied perhaps with Cary Grant. But it wasn't until I watched this for the third time that I fully realized why I so admired Spencer Tracy's acting  believeablily almost instant believability. Portraying a Clarence Darrow lawyer figure...instant believability. Portraying a judge at the Nuremburg Trials instant believability. Portraying a father whose daughter is about to marry a Black man instant believability. And now playing an old sheepherder who once climbed mountains...instant believability. And here as usual playing the moral center of the picture.And then there is Robert Wagner It's a good performance although I wonder why he accepted the role. It's about as unlikable a character as you will find in any film short of a rapist or murderer. He's brave enough to slap and belittle and old man but a coward once he gets on the mountain. It occurred to me that Wagner's character is very much like a roommate I had for a couple of years. One evening he said I'm very sensitive. I responded with No you're half of sensitivity  the selfish have...you have no sensitivity toward others. Sorry Dang. Robert Wagner was the pretty boy in the film but does reasonably well. There are two problems with this film. First the age difference between Spencer Tracy and Robert Wagner was not reasonable to make them brothers. Father and son would have been believable and in my view would have worked. But then again in most movies you have to suspend belief in one area or another so okay...I can live with it. The other issue here is that Robert Wagner is such a jerk I was going to say...well you know that you not only know he's going to die climbing the mountain but from the moment early on in the film when he slaps Spencer Tracy in the face you're rooting for him falling to his death off the mountain! But okay there too!  While we all know that Spencer Tracy wasn't doing the actual mountain climbing here  he was already 56 and in somewhat declining health  this must have been a tough movie for him to make. He may not have yet been the lion in winter but he was certainly well into late autumn. But over the years as Tracy aged he only improved. His later years saw most of his finest performances...and this is one. The double used for the climbing did an excllent job. You could almost believe it was Tracy.It's surprising to see Robert Wagner in such a negative role but it's just as surprising to see Claire Trevor as a very mature washer woman in the village who has her eye on Spencer Tracy. E.G. Marshall is here as well as William Demarest but they both have very very minor roles.Many have criticized the closing scene as Tracy's character reports that he had all the ill intent while his brother was a hero. I have mixed feelings about the ending. Why should a thief and coward be given credit for something he didn't do. I understand that Spencer Tracy didn't really like this film. I wonder if it was the film itself or the strenuous nature of the project at his age.A fine film and a different story...well worth viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the second film starred by the duo Spencer Tracy and Robert Wagner. In the first one the western Broken Lance 1954 Tracy acted as the Wagner's father while now in this drama Tracy is Wagner's eldest brother and also the man who raised Chris Teller Wagner in his childhood. So two brothers who should have the same ideas and ethics in their lives but paradoxically it was not like that. Chris was a young man very ambitious able to kill for money while his eldest brother was a hard working man unable to do harm to anyone. A plane coming from Calcutta felt down in a high mountain called Montecarlo in France. The people of the neighboring village organized an unsuccessful rescue. At this point Chris knowing that in the plane there were plenty of money and that his brother was the only one able to climb the mountain decided to compel his brother Zachary Tracy to go for rescue. After some arguing and discussion Zachary agreed to do that for this they have to walk long and difficult ways always guided by experienced Zachary. When they finally reached the plane they found an Indian lady still alive and Zachary decided to help her to survive. but Chris wanted to get the money and to kill her. This situation compelled Zachary to beat Chris and to leave him alone taking the lady with himself to save her. The fact is that Chris alone could not manage and died falling down but Zachary succeeded back with the lady. When asked about all what happened Zachary said that his brother Chris did everything possible to save the lady and he Zachary was who planned to take the money in the plane. He lied but everybody in the village knowing the kind man he was never believed him. One of the things that I cannot easily accept is the egoism of Chris. If he was raised by his brother he should have loved him and also should have had the same ethic values as Zachary. This seems to me a bit incoherent in the plot and from the original novel. Everyone is a product of the environment where heshe was raised and lived.".

The stunning scenery is a delight to behold with only occasional studio shots subbing for the real mountain rocks.Summing up Could have been much better with more accurate casting. Tracy was only 56 at the time but looks more like Wagner's grandfather and lacks credibility as a mountain climber capable of rescuing singlehandedly an Indian girl from the plane wreck.Where was Kirk Douglas?".

You can over analyze that Tracy and Wagner don't look anything like brothers or that some of the backdrops especially from the dramatic narrow cliffwall scene don't quite make sense. There's quite a few yet minor logic failures. I'll never understand why the original rescue crew had to walk all the way across that field carrying their wounded when a perfectly viable jeep was right there and could have helped.

Fear wonder and a weird sense of losing your wife's body to something you don't quite understand. And as funny as the film is it is also quite poignant at moments and full of heart.The use of classic late 80's bands a Hughes specialty is excellent and quite extensive.

Jake and Kristi played superbly by Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern are indeed your average married couple going through the same problems most married people do and most kids their age would be sidestepping.

Becon's chemistry with the lovely Elizbath McGovern whatever happened to her? is undeniable and early into the film you really find yourself rooting for this couple. Alec Baldwin had one of his best early roles here as Jake's slightly slimy college buddy. There a lot of very funny and imaginative scenes in the film which are mostly a product of Jake's mind which I found kind of novel for a John Hughes film...love the production number with the lawn mowers and Jake's inlaws coaching him on what to do during sex not to mention's Jake's internal rewriting of his wedding vows. Both Holland Taylor and the late Cathryn Damon score as Jake and Christy's moms and William Windom is amusing as Christy's dad who cuts Jake no slack whatsoever. I think I liked this movie better than the average viewer...maybe because I really like Kevin Bacon and he's practically in every scene but I think even for nonBacon fans there are smiles chuckles and warm fuzzy feelings to be found by taking in the story of Jake and Kristy Briggs.".

There a lot of very funny and imaginative scenes in the film which are mostly a product of Jake's mind which I found kind of novel for a John Hughes film...love the production number with the lawn mowers and Jake's inlaws coaching him on what to do during sex not to mention's Jake's internal rewriting of his wedding vows. Both Holland Taylor and the late Cathryn Damon score as Jake and Christy's moms and William Windom is amusing as Christy's dad who cuts Jake no slack whatsoever. I think I liked this movie better than the average viewer...maybe because I really like Kevin Bacon and he's practically in every scene but I think even for nonBacon fans there are smiles chuckles and warm fuzzy feelings to be found by taking in the story of Jake and Kristy Briggs.";

	schema:reviewBody "So I guess if I were at gunpoint I would choose this as being my second favorite film in the Hughes lineup.  He has made so many good movies it's hard to pick just one as your favorite but this is definitely a close second to The Breakfast Club.  Kevin Bacon plays a writer just out of college trying to support his newly wedded wife while at the same time working for some sort of ad agency and trying to write his first book.  Throughout the movie it's him narrarating his life from the start of his wedding until the end of the movie...His wife however decides that she's ready for a baby.  He on the other hand does not really get as excited about the idea as she does. The entire movie is set up from his point of view and he sees the world through his eyes and a lot of 'what ifs' start to boggle his mind.  His confusion and dry humor make it a great classic and a great watch for anyone. A fun piece of movie trivia...in the movie 'Trains Planes and Automobiles' Steve Martin's wife in the movie lays awake late one night watching a movie on T.V.  If you listen closely to what they're saying it's a scene from 'She's Having a Baby'.  The scene when Kevin Bacon and his on screen wife are having a fight. A fun little movie fact for you.I hope you'll see it if you haven't.  And if you already did you're smart. And if you saw it and didn't like it well then....there we are.I give this movie a 10 out of 10.  A great movie to be seen by all!And that's the end of my review.".

The movie centers around how Bacon matures to become a responsible family man. The movie is portrayed through the eyes of new graduate Briggs and the audience moves along with his fears plight and fortunes. Although not entirely original there are moments throughout that you will empathize and laugh along with mainly because we all went through this before. This is one of Hughes' definitive films from the 1980s and the music accompanying the movie is great from Gene Loves Jezebel to Everything But The Girl and Kate Bush. Bacon is hilarious and McGovern gives an understated but effective performance as the wife determined to have a baby. Alec Baldwin is brilliant as Davis McDonald the devilish best friend of Bacon who tries to dissuade him out of marriage. There are genuinely funny moments that pepper this movie throughout and makes it really delightful. There are the highbrow critics who slag this movie off. Don't be influenced by their views.

	schema:reviewBody "...Would be a more fitting title for this movie. And I really liked the movie. It just wasn't about a baby and it wasn't about his wife. She's a secondary character if that. It's all about Kevin Bacon's character who is a adman who wants to be a professional writer but his wife and the beautiful home in the suburbs and all its dreary perfection is bringing him down. As are his inlaws his player best buddy Alec Baldwin in his thin days and a dreamgirl who seemingly wants to seduce him. This film is really about the struggle and the temptation of a guy who has everything but doesn't know if he wants it. There are some incredible creative scenes. One showing how his office literally closing in on him another showing a picture of his fatherinlaw smiling as he's looking at it then he says something to the picture as if speaking to it and the picture has changed to where the fatherinlaw has a shocked expression. There's one homage to Psycho where the wife throws the pill down the drain you get a shot of the water going down the drain which then slowly dissolves to her eye. And there's a musical sequence with suburbanites mowing their lawns whilst dancing and singing that is hilarious when taken in its context but if you were to see this sequence out of context you'd think it's gonna be a horrible film. Anyhow this movie is all about the husband. They show the wife having the baby at the very end and things get complicated and that's when he realizes how much he loves her... brooding in the waiting room like the character from Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms. But you really don't feel that he ever really loved her in the first place. That's the only fault I can give this film. The rest of it is creative and totally entertaining.".

Whilst I think the screenplay could've been tighter and the script is not nearly up to the usual John Hughes banter the picture is adequate due to the oh so natural performances of Kevin Bacon and the neglected Alec Baldwin. But it is not these two that saves this picture. What saves this picture is the final montage to the backing of Kate Bush's This Woman's Work which intertwined with Bacon's brilliant expression of emotion makes your heart skip a beat.

	schema:headline " Married life from a man's perspective.";
	schema:reviewBody "She's Having a Baby is very much like Kevin Bacon's later film 'He Said She Said' in which moments of a story are articulated from the perspective of each gender. But while 'He Said She Said' provided humorous views of love and life from both the shovinist male and the overconfident female 'She's Having a Baby' provides only the perspective of one person a very nervous and doubting husband. It is interesting to me at least as there are few movies which dedicate the entire experience of married life solely to the male perspective and I suppose that John Hughes the film's writer and director is telling the story from his own personal experiences fears expectations and other approaches to his life as a husband and father.I have always like John Hughes work and despite some of the sexism and cliches that the story deals with it is an entertaining film about newlyweds unsure about whether getting married was a good idea but discovering in the end that despite the obstacles ahead of them they actually find that married life and soon parenthood can actually quite a wonderful thing. Jake Briggs Bacon marries his high school sweetheart Kristi McGovern his love at first sight. The movie introduces us to Jake who is preparing himself and simultaneoulsy doubting himself to walk down the isle and declare himself a married man. But for Jake somehow saying I do was the point of no return and his relationship to Kristi and his perception of her drastically changes once they officially carry on together as a married couple. Jake finds disatisfaction with his work as an advertising agent aspiring instead to be a writer but always being told that it just wasn't going to happen with the drone life in the suburbs a typical John Hughes theme and even gets tempted with indescretions as he meets a woman at a bar who tests his faithfulness to Kristi. For Jake it seems like the single life had a lot more to offer in both independce as well as his love for Kristi even to the point that he tries to convince his bachelor friend Davis played by that hubba hubba actor Alec Baldwin that he need not be unmarried to enjoy himself. In fact things start to change for Jake as he starts to grow accustomed to marriage and finds that the situation isn't as bad as he imagined. When his wife Kristi becomes pregnant and there are complications during the pregnancy Jake is forced to consider whether he would give it all up. And in that time he realizes that he actually doesn't hate it at all. That there are things there that he can adjust by way of work we see later that he does take it upon himself to do some writing and with his relationship to his wife and hell even the inlaws. It's hard to say but folks who are married and who have gone through that 'moment of truth' at some point in their relationship if at all must know how that feels. And from the look on Jake's face it must feel pretty good to realize how lucky a person can be to share that with somebody else.There are some problems with the characters such as Kristi always been made out as this bossy detached spouse of Jake's. One viewer wrote that she was often depicted as selfish and while I agree that it is an unfair assessment of Kristi who could not have been this way all the timeyou have to watch the movie to see it was also meant to be portrayed from the husbands point of viewed. Therefore we get the subjective view of the husband and not the objective view of what we may consider Kristi to be because nearly the whole movie is told from Jefferson's viewpoint. The story is also stereotypical in some of it's assertions about marriage and work and the like. But I think that the movie still offers some good humor and is certainly one for John Hughe's fans to see before he gave up writing and directing teen moviesthe 80s films prior to She's Having a Baby and went on to make children and family filmsmostly all of his films made after 1989. And fans of Kevin Bacon are sure to enjoy the movie as well. It's not fantastic and I'll admit I never got through watching it the first time. But I gave it a few years and tried again and though it isn't a great movie it is one that I would recommend trying out.".

I was not displeased in the least with this movie. It had all the emotional elements a movie should have and what a great directorial project. I always enjoyed Hughes and his certain direction points and trademarks. I thought he did a great job. Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern shine true as a newly wed couple struggling in the beginning years and also experiencing different effects of their marriage. In some places I found myself completely relating and laughing out loud. The ending held me on pins and needles and with that conclusion I felt this movie had everything it should offer.

	schema:headline " She's having an overstuffed baby . . .";
	schema:reviewBody "'She's Having a Baby' is an interesting exercise in the oldest most simple kind of story hendered by stupid gimmicky sideplots that pull it down like dead weight.At the center is a pure honest likable couple played by Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern. There aren't two more winning personalities in the movies. Bacon has a strong presence and a good personality. The Invaluable Elizabeth McGovern has one of the most honest faces that I have seen in a movie. When she says she loves him she has a certain way of holding herself that leaves absolutely no doubts in my mind.The movie tracks the progression of their first years of marriage from the wedding to their first child. We meet them on their wedding day where Bacon like the groom in almost every movie is a sweating nervous wreck fearful that he is giving up his freedom.They move into a condo that is more mortgage then home. Bacon gets a lowlevel job with an ad agency and after a few years the rest of the family hints that it might be time to have a baby. So the rest of the movie shows their efforts at conception.This is all well and good and if the movie had stayed with the simple plot detail that I just described this would have been a better movie. The problem is that it keeps throwing in a lot of distracting unnecessary plot baggage. For example after the two move to the suburbs they are surrounded by the usual gallery of suburbanites including the men who are more interested in their lawn mowers then their wives and wives discuss their husband as if they were children. This all culminates in a stupid Busby Berklytype dance sequence involving lawnmowers.Clichd characters abound in this film including McGovern's parents who absolutely hate their daughter's new husband and bad mouth him at every turn. Another clich Bacon's best friend played by Alec Baldwin keeps hitting on McGovern while Bacon keeps having fantasies about the same beautiful woman and begins to have longings for his bachelor freedom.On top of all of that there are silly fantasy moments as when Bacon finds out that McGovern is pregnant and envisions himself being hurled screaming toward a brick wall. Or the moment when they get married and the minister reads off a laundry list of duties that Bacon is to perform in order to make her happy. Or the typical panicstricken tailspin that Bacon goes into when McGovern goes into labor.This is a case of less is more. I liked the quiet moments in this movie which are wedged in between the gimmicks. The small romantic moment between the couple are very sweet and touching. Because these two actors are masters of emotional depth I had no trouble believing that their were honestly and passionately in love.The movie ends with one of the most emotional scenes I can remember. A complication arises when McGovern goes into labor and Bacon sits in the waiting room. The scene is done so beautifully that I longed for what the rest of the film could have been if it weren't trying so hard to be cute. 'She's Having a Baby' could have been an effective movie had the director had the nerve to trim the fat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1988 it must've seemed like Armegeddon was near as...John Hughes was actually gonna write a semiserious movie!  Now a year earlier he had veered into nonteen territory with Planes Trains and Automobiles.  But had kept the laughs constant enough that it really wasn't a film about adults.  But after a fiveyear whirlwind run of success which featured seven of the more memorable films of the decade he was able to get greenlighted his pseudolife story.  Die hard fans of him like myself will easily spot how this mirrored his hughe rise.  An aimless newlywed Bacon goes through the usual pains of accepting adult responsibilities becomes an adman really wants to be a writer and somehow makes the dream work.  All the while cliches abound around him a fatherinlaw who hates him neighbors who yap endlessly about their lawnmowers and a wife who is pressuring him to be a father.  A better title might've been He's Having a Cow as the film is more about Bacon than anything else.  As someone else mentioned the baby portion of the film doesn't happen till nearly the end and after it's born here come the end credits.  Hughes scores here and there with this but mostly it's jumbled all too traveled ground we've seen in other movies.  Plus his flights of fancy where he incorporates incredibly out of place daydream segments that just confuse.  The big lawnmower sequence had me perplexed was this Bacon getting an idea for an advertisement or him hopped up on something?  Someone else also brought up that McGovern's character is hardly familiarized with the audience and when she is can be overbearing or loud and angry.  And you could tell Hughes was going for an ethereal moment of drama in the end as he has Bacon soaked in white light with creepy music playing as he waits for his wife's delivery. But it doesn't come off because we hardly care for these characters who have meandered through a dopey adventure until that point.  Even the familiar celebrity faces during the end credits are disappointing as none of them take it seriously and offer up one idiotic name after another Aykroyd's alien monikers are especially stupid and painfully unfunny.  For better expectant baby fare check out Hughes' graduate Molly Ringwald in For Keeps a much better and very Hughesish film on the subject.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Hughes films had some of the best soundtracks ever or more correctly gave rise to the best albums based on soundtracks. The Pretty in Pink album is one of the greatest compilations of 80's music made in the 80's. It was edgy stuff back then and still sounds remarkably current today.The music in She's having a baby is almost as good. Kate Bush's This Woman's Work is one of those rare songs that was so beautiful and haunting that I can flash back to exactly where I heard it first. It is so universal and timeless that a muscular 6 foot 5 250 pound AfroAmerican man could sing it on American Idol 23 years later and bring tears to the judges eyes. The movie is worth seeing just for the final scene where this song plays while Kevin Bacon is anxiously waiting for word about his wife and baby.The rest of it is very playful and fluffy and especially for those of us that lived through those times quite enjoyable. Younger viewers might get an appreciation for how innocent and naive people were back then. Especially fun was seeing Alec Baldwin in his pretty boy greaseball stage. And unlike Pretty in Pink the music in the soundtrack actually forms a large part of the story  and did I tell you how good that soundtrack is?".

I like the club scene and the music used as well as its artistic presentation when it shows backandforth lone images of Jake and the mystery woman who is trying to lure him to cheat. I also like the wedding scene as well as the scene where Jake and Kristy are sitting with Davis Alec Baldwin who has visited Chicago with his mistress and they're sitting in the Briggs house.I'm a big John Hughes fan and enjoy most of his films that he has directed and produced and wrote but this isn't his best work. Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern deliver good acting performances but they don't have a high level of chemistry between them and that also holds the film back.I liked the concept and saw what Hughes was trying to achieve but it didn't quite connect for me with this film.".

I'd say this movie would be ideal for anyone between the ages of 5 and 9. I'd not buy it on DVD except from the bargain bucket or watch for free on regular TV. I regret having spent good money to see it at the cinema.We saw this at the cinema as a family we are middleaged parents with a son 6 and a daughter 4.We adults thought it was slow to get started but managed to pick up a little bit of pace. It was quite predictable with the same jokes repeated and there were no plot twists at all to give it any interest. The bored teenager role was acted with little imagination the girlfriend just about imagining a soupon of character. Brendan Fraser managed to make a reasonable deal of a weak plot and his wife Brooke Shields had a few moments of believable acting as a wife.The script writer lacked imagination the budget was probably quite low too there were times the poor CGI punctured the suspension of disbelief I imagine this would not be one to enjoy on bluray unless they fix things up in the transfer. One novelty was that the animals didn't speak instead thought bubbles appeared with pictures. If I was being cynical I'd say this was as much a way to avoid the costs of voice character actors and dubbing into foreign languages as to give the movie a twist.This could easily have been an episode of a any standard sitcom about a family relocating to the country and could have been edited down to 45 minutes... and then perhaps the reuse of jokes might not be so bad but they quickly became stale.So the movie failed from an adult perspective. Did it succeed to keep the kids entertained? Our 6 year old enjoyed it he's at that age where adults being stupid animals being smart and lots of mess and stink are funny. He's able to follow quite complex dialogue so was able to grasp the point of the movie.Our 4 year old found it hard going as it was slow to start there was too much dialogue with too little action she enjoyed the slapstick humour but was frequently restless  she'll rewatch Finding Nemo with more attention and she's seen that 10 times!.".

It is what it is a funny family movie with lots of forest critters causing trouble for Brendon Fraser.Of course Brendon has done better more artful movies of course he's done more adultthemed action but why all the hate for this movie? Sometimes I want a sophisticated cerebral comedy with witty satire and subtlety just like sometimes I want a fancy meal.

It is what it is a funny family movie with lots of forest critters causing trouble for Brendon Fraser.Of course Brendon has done better more artful movies of course he's done more adultthemed action but why all the hate for this movie? Sometimes I want a sophisticated cerebral comedy with witty satire and subtlety just like sometimes I want a fancy meal.

This angers the local wildlife headed by a cackling raccoon who set off to humiliate injure and presumably kill Fraser and other human interlopers.Now I'm all for the stupidly funny. I wasn't expecting Oscar material and certainly didn't expect it from this. But even on its own low terms this movie just fails to be funny and in my eyes there's little worse than a bad comedy. Bad efforts at other genres can be great for laughs but when comedies fail to elicit laughs they're just painful and dull.Fraser's goofy amiability has levitated other films before but this time he's just not up to it. There's too much bottomofthebarrel slapstick an overpopulation of stupid characters and predictable family drama. Also frequently weirdly inconsistent. At one point Fraser is flung into a bee's nest and is covered with stings but the next morning he's shown without a scratch or swelling on him. Early on another character suffers an animalinduced auto accident that's rather appalling since it would be clearly fatal and later we're told the character disappeared. There quite a bit of wetcrotch and groininjury humor I remember a time when that was considered too risqu for children and now is standard for kid flicks. At any rate they're cheap laughs.Fraser looks bad he's gained weight and looks pudgy and uncomfortable. Brooke Shields can be a great comic actress but spends most of the time playing the straight man so her talents are underused. She also doesn't look her best either. They're basically playing second fiddle to the cutesy animals which range from real animals to poorlydone CGI standins. Also has nocturnal animals like owls and raccoons running around in the day and daytime animals like crows active at night. Not to mention seagulls suddenly showing up in a clearly inland and mountainous locale. At one point the flick attempts to set up some sort of mysticalmagical reasoning for the intelligent animals who not only understand human speech but seem every bit as aware of human pop culture as the humans are but then it's quickly dropped and forgotten.I saw this at a preview screening there were a number of families there and I could tell the very young found it funny but older kids and adults were clearly not amused and unimpressed. I guess they wanted a sort of liveaction cartoon here but amidst all the mayhem they forgot to make it truly funny...and contrasting it to a halfway realistic family drama doesn't help. You're better off staying at home with some classic Warner Brothers cartoons. FURRY VENGEANCE is to be avoided at all costs one of the worst things I've seen in a long time.".

Since then he's turned in a lot solid performances in genre films notably as gentleman adventurer Rick O'Connell in the Mummy series. So while he does doofus really well he can also sell himself as a big beefy guy with a soft heart or as a serious actor in a serious role. The one thing he's never attempted is villainy like Will Smith he's always aimed for and largely hit likability. Last year he reached new heights in Inkheart which I thot was magnificent. I'm a sucker for books. This week the law of averages reasserts itself as he plummets straight to the bottom in the role of suburban developer Dan Sanders beset by the woodland creatures he's preparing to displace in Furry Vengeance.Just to put things in perspective about the relentless unremitting awfulness of this movie I gave Beverly Hills Chihuahua a higher rating 2. Speaking of relentlessness Edward Shearmur's score is both ubiquitous and manically perky. An appearance by the world's least helpful librarian is only about 54th on this film's list of sins.Screenwriters Michael Carnes and Josh Gilbert have provided an abundance of plot and dialog so you get a lot of substance in the 90 minutes you spend squirming and covering your eyes. I think they took pride in breaking new ground in the ickyfluids department. In addition to the abundance of poop pee fart barf and crotch jokes they've upped the ante with skunks. And just to be sure you didn't miss this brilliant innovation on their part they repeat it 3 or 4 times.Searching desperately for something positive to say about Furry Vengeance I must commend director Roger Kumble for getting the entire cast to buy into the premise of how it should be overacted as every single one of them gives it everything they've got from beginning to end without pause or apology. I can imagine Kumble's pep speech at the kickoff meeting All right we're making this film for an autistic audience that doesn't read human expressions very well. Also we think it'll probably play well with space aliens who know nothing whatsoever about carbonbased life forms. So don't hold back OK? Exaggerate everything. Everything! Actions expressions vocal intonations emotions the works! Just to help you out we've prepared this little drug cocktail we'd like you to take daily consisting of LSD PCP speed and whatever it is that gets your eyes to bug out like that guy in the Staples commercial.I categorize this movie under talking animals even tho they don't engage in actual human speech. Instead we get a variety of churrs coos and gurgles apparently from the throat of one Dee Bradley Baker. But the various different kinds of critters can all understand each other and they pass along stories via cartoon thot balloons running flashbacks or in one scene Mel Gibson in Braveheart. And they've developed tool use which we see in the opening scenes as a Rube Goldberg contraption turns a huge boulder loose on the SUV of an arrogant developer who has just thrown his cigar stub into a pile of dry leaves.Philosophers who have long sought the elusive white crow as an example of trying to prove a negative will be delighted to know that the producers of this nature epic did not blanch at depicting one apparently figuring nobody in the audience would notice ... or maybe care.This film reminds me of nothing so much as the conservative political pundit William Kristol. He's bright well informed charming articulate thotful and well intentioned. And you know that every single time he's opened his mouth for the last quarter century whatever comes out of it has been dead wrong. Reliably. Consistently. Every time. Without let or regret. And he just keeps on doing it!I cannot imagine what anybody ever said to the participants in or financiers of this train wreck that made them think it would be a good idea. Redeeming thot? As long as you're still alive things can always get worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "Furry Vengeance features talented people making fools of themselves as they lazily try to collect their paycheck. It follows the same route as Daddy Day Camp making stupid jokes about skunks and poop that don't even appeal to kids. At least Daddy Day Camp thought that kids would like these jokes while Furry Vengeance is significantly more annoying because it knows that kids won't like this but continue to make this so they can all make money. During this film nothing in the actually film made me laugh but I did laugh seeing the target demographic a 5year old boy falling asleep not from fatigue but from being plain bored. Brendan Fraser has actually been a talented actor in his career when he wants to be. Don't believe me? If you don't watch Gods  Monsters Crash The Quiet American With Honors  School Ties. If you want to prove me wrong watch this film. Other talented people such as Ken Jeong Brooke Shields Angela Kinsey and Wallace Shawn show up but just blandly read their lines walk off screen and if I were to go out on a limb collect their paychecks and walk out of the studio. The animals don't talk which should be refreshing but is even more annoying than talking animals in live action films and that's saying a lot. This is the worst film I have seen this year and yes I have seen The Back Up Plan The Bounty Hunter  Leap Year this year.".

At least Daddy Day Camp thought that kids would like these jokes while Furry Vengeance is significantly more annoying because it knows that kids won't like this but continue to make this so they can all make money. During this film nothing in the actually film made me laugh but I did laugh seeing the target demographic a 5year old boy falling asleep not from fatigue but from being plain bored. Brendan Fraser has actually been a talented actor in his career when he wants to be. Don't believe me? If you don't watch Gods  Monsters Crash The Quiet American With Honors  School Ties. If you want to prove me wrong watch this film. Other talented people such as Ken Jeong Brooke Shields Angela Kinsey and Wallace Shawn show up but just blandly read their lines walk off screen and if I were to go out on a limb collect their paychecks and walk out of the studio. The animals don't talk which should be refreshing but is even more annoying than talking animals in live action films and that's saying a lot. This is the worst film I have seen this year and yes I have seen The Back Up Plan The Bounty Hunter  Leap Year this year.";

In fact watching the kind of movie this was I wonder if it was written for Will Ferrell but he was not available so they went with Brendan Fraser instead.This movie can't decide if it wants to be a family film or edgy adult comedy it blurs the line quite badly. Brendan Fraser is unfunny and uninteresting to watch he is oftener enjoyable to watch but he just was'nt this time. Usually I like movies about smart animals but everything was too precise in this film. Not to mention the comedy was badly written resulting to unfunny written slapstick. Brooke Sheilds who plays Frasers wife looks amazingly bored through most of this not to mention there is no chemistry between Fraser and Shields.So if you are looking for a funny entertaining film it's not Furry Vengeance".

There's no obvious profanity nor is there any nudity and when characters get into some wildly unbelievable scrapes that realistically would cause a lot of bodily damage pain or worse death it's glossed over because THIS IS A KIDFRIENDLY MOVIE. It's made that way in the old Disneystyle tradition to entertain with lots of cartoonish antics particularly by Brendan Fraser's goofy real estate developer. It's nice to see Brooke Shields acting in something again but the real stars of this silly but often funny film are the animals especially the ringleader raccoon and his platoon of able and willing skunks. Don't expect the depth of Shutter Island or the amazing special effects of Avatar here this is just a cute little film for parents with kids who are not interested in seeing giant robots blow the snot out of a city yet...they're still young and naive enough to find the cutesy antics of comical animals amusing enough. Check it out if you've got little ones or you just need a break from the rest of the stuff that's been churned out by ton from the studios out there.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like Brendan Fraser. I really do. I think he does best when he's doing comedies like Bedazzled or family fare like Journey To The Center Of The Earth. Furry Vengeance is good comedy to spread its Get Green message and it does it while being funny. Fraser plays a contractor living in the housing development he is building near the woods of a forest preserve and the animals have learned his bosses want to devastate the forest for housing tracts. He mugs grimaces and reacts to the wild antics going on as he surrenders his body to more slapstick again and again. One of the odd things about this movie is that the animals ranging from a raccoon some skunks beavers and a bear among others act and think like humans just how and why is never resolved. The bulk of the movie is the amount of abuse and harassment Fraser gets from these furry woodland creatures and his resulting psychosis when he realizes the animals seem to have a conspiracy against him but by then they've infested his house and violated his car. Brooke Shields plays his wife oblivious to the action and his son and girl friend are additional witnesses to his spiraling descent into hysteria. It's a really funny movie once you learn to ignore the ridiculous leaps in logic and science but you really start to cheer the animals on as they fight together in wild and creative scenarios to defend their homes. There's a message in the movie that isn't forced it's much more simple than coerced and the closing montage of movie parodies is a lot of fun to watch as well.".

There that's it.Basically nothing more than a live action version of Open Season with a smattering of Over the Hedge Are We Done Yet? and Evan Almighty slopped about this is another tale where a bunch of cuddly little vermin connive to thwart a major development project.Oh yes the lines are drawn very clearly. For example the head of the project Neal Lyman Ken Jeong The Hangover The Goods brags openly about all of the forests he has  well deforested. His henchmen are equally disrespectful of the environment. Hey I'm no developer but wouldn't an intelligent one utilize both aspect of construction a certain care for the surrounding area? And aren't there many many laws on the books  both local and national  to prevent wholesale rape of the land? Anyway Lyman's point man for the new project is Dan Sanders who with wife Tammy Brooke Shields and Earth Firster son Tyler Matt Prokop High School Musical 3 get to live in the first prototype home in the area. Since the trailers all show it and the film's title is Furry Vengeance there's no need for a spoiler alert here.Yep the little creatures begin to put together a plan not only to drive out the Sanders but to keep their sanctuary as human beingfree as possible. This begins with little annoyances such as keeping Dan up at night it's funny that only HE  and the audience  sees what's happening but his clueless wife does not to total war on the encroaching developers i.e. birds divebombing bears trapping Dan in a portapotty etc..We're supposed to universally root for the animals but I could not support ANYONE or ANYTHING in this mess. The creatures were creepily unrealistic the actors were abysmal dialogue ridiculous and the direction nonexistent. That and there wasn't a solid laugh in the whole enterprise. And this is what passes for comedy in Hollywood today? In fact the past two years have been a vast wasteland in the humorous film category. A wasteland littered with the decaying bones of Year One I Love You Beth Cooper Our Family Wedding Cop Out Hot Tub Time Machine PostGrad etc. etc. etc. Now add this lame effort to that evergrowing list.Brief political rant Okay I know destroying the environment is bad. We ALL know that. It's also bad to wipe out forests for nothing else except to build a mall. But that mall had to go SOMEWHERE. After all if there was no mall there would be no venue for suckers out there to pay good money to watch crap like this.".

Since the trailers all show it and the film's title is Furry Vengeance there's no need for a spoiler alert here.Yep the little creatures begin to put together a plan not only to drive out the Sanders but to keep their sanctuary as human beingfree as possible. This begins with little annoyances such as keeping Dan up at night it's funny that only HE  and the audience  sees what's happening but his clueless wife does not to total war on the encroaching developers i.e. birds divebombing bears trapping Dan in a portapotty etc..We're supposed to universally root for the animals but I could not support ANYONE or ANYTHING in this mess. The creatures were creepily unrealistic the actors were abysmal dialogue ridiculous and the direction nonexistent. That and there wasn't a solid laugh in the whole enterprise. And this is what passes for comedy in Hollywood today? In fact the past two years have been a vast wasteland in the humorous film category. A wasteland littered with the decaying bones of Year One I Love You Beth Cooper Our Family Wedding Cop Out Hot Tub Time Machine PostGrad etc. etc. etc. Now add this lame effort to that evergrowing list.Brief political rant Okay I know destroying the environment is bad. We ALL know that. It's also bad to wipe out forests for nothing else except to build a mall. But that mall had to go SOMEWHERE. After all if there was no mall there would be no venue for suckers out there to pay good money to watch crap like this.";

	schema:reviewBody "From the always reliable and brilliant Roger Kumbles College Road Trip The Sweetest Thing comes Furry Vengeance which might just be his masterpiece. Hilarious and laugh out loud funny from the first frame to the very last Furry Vengeance provides the brand of intelligent comedy that has been lacking for the past few decades. While the plot may seem simple on paper it truly is an intricate story that unfolds with great pace and flow. Not once did I glance at my watch or take my eyes off of the screen. Simply put this is very effective storytelling that blends in comedy very well with its engaging storyline. And as we all know a comedy cannot be truly great without a funny lead. Brendan Fraser provides just that. He adds a whole new dimension to his character that I can't imagine any other actor pulling off. But that's not to say there are no standout performances from the supporting cast. Megastar Matt Prokop proves once more why he has become such a bankable star. The other main component of the film is the visual effects which is one of the best to date if not THE best. You thought Avatar was great? Think again. Words cannot describe the achievement in visual effects this movie has managed to pull off. So I'll simply state they're fking amazing. To say the least I'm very content with my decision to attend the exclusive premier of one of the best comedies of all time. I recommend you check it out once it arrives at a theater near you.".

The screenplay draws upon the successful 1947 stage play by Maxwell Anderson who also wrote plays on the lives of Elizabeth I and Mary of Scotland. But this is his most famous historical drama and it is unfortunate that Anderson did not live to see this fine film adaptation.The film covers major events and figures from the early Tudor age including Henry's controversial divorce from Catherine of Aragon the rise and fall of Cardinal Wolsey the courageous ethical stance taken by Sir Thomas More in opposing the will of the king and the unscrupulous Thomas Boleyn who played the role of pimp and gobetween in the trysts with his daughters and the king.While the movie proceeds at a deliberate pace in recounting the various subplots it is the figure of Anne Boleyn who ties together the different plot strands related to the king's Great Matter. Bujold's multilayered performance reveals an Anne Boleyn with heroic virtues and deep ethical concerns. The film takes license with a nonhistorical scene where Anne confronts Henry after she has been convicted of treason adultery and incest and is imprisoned in the Tower of London. The deluded Henry has come to believe that he was bewitched by an enchanted Anne and the scene in the Tower delivers a thundering dramatic climax to the film. Bujold's performance is all the more remarkable as she is playing opposite one of the great actors of the previous century in Richard Burton. Not only does Bujold's Anne set Burton's Henry straight but she takes a stand on matters of conscience from which we can still learn today. Genevive Bujold and this dynamic scene in the Tower of London alone make Anne of the Thousand Days a classic.".

	schema:headline " Passionate historical and sombre";
	schema:reviewBody "It is a memorable film well nominated exquisitely costumed. I like Richard Burton best of all in this one. He takes up the role of Henry VIII and gives it many subtle shades of feeling so that you almost understand what might have really transpired in such a king's turbulent soul. He was somewhere between a rock and a hard place and rushed headlong into history with his determined efforts to change the rules of kingship.Anne Boleyn here played by Genevieve Bujold was caught up in these events and ultimately became a casualty of circumstances. I'm not a history buff so can't fill in the true story but it's obvious there was much political intrigue taking place. Also it rather reminded me of Othello in which the illfated Desdemona was victimized by Iago's slander. Genevieve portrays Anne with deep conviction and her tremendous vehemence at times sweeps us along through happy moments as well as fiery clashes with family king and authorities.I was enthralled by the excellent supporting actors who formed the king's entourage and hope to know them by name one day. In particular was their exchange of witty dialogue in the captivating scene which ended in a reference to a venison haunch. I believe one of these actors later appeared in Mary Queen of Scots 1971 as I recognized the same wonderful voice and I think it's Vernon Dobtcheff. Well it's a bit of detective work I must do to confirm.Anthony Quayle's portrayal of Cardinal Wolsey was right on. Oh the glories of power in high places so many titled positions he held! Yet in the end the Cardinal could hold onto none of them in a true sense. I feel this is one role where Quayle really excelled as an actor and a very dramatic presence.For me this film goes hand in hand with A Man for All Seasons and Mary Queen of Scots for some great drama on screen.".

	onyx:emotionText "It is a memorable film well nominated exquisitely costumed. I like Richard Burton best of all in this one. He takes up the role of Henry VIII and gives it many subtle shades of feeling so that you almost understand what might have really transpired in such a king's turbulent soul. He was somewhere between a rock and a hard place and rushed headlong into history with his determined efforts to change the rules of kingship.Anne Boleyn here played by Genevieve Bujold was caught up in these events and ultimately became a casualty of circumstances. I'm not a history buff so can't fill in the true story but it's obvious there was much political intrigue taking place. Also it rather reminded me of Othello in which the illfated Desdemona was victimized by Iago's slander. Genevieve portrays Anne with deep conviction and her tremendous vehemence at times sweeps us along through happy moments as well as fiery clashes with family king and authorities.I was enthralled by the excellent supporting actors who formed the king's entourage and hope to know them by name one day. In particular was their exchange of witty dialogue in the captivating scene which ended in a reference to a venison haunch.

Richard Burton is fine here as always very magnetic as Henry VIII but he absolute joy of this picture is Genevieve Bujold in her first major picture as Anne Boylen. How she failed to wina n Oscar is beyond me.    The set and costumes are great and the acting is stellar. This is all aobut henry's quest for a male heir. Since Catharine of Aragon failed to produce one he dumps her and seeks out Anne. For a thousand days they are happy. But only a daughter Elizabeth is born to them. So Henry accuses her falsely of adulter and asks annulment which the church refuses. Henry decides that will not stop him he puts her to death having her beheaded and promptly rides off to romance Jane Seymour the real person not the actress. But Anne can die with diginity for Elizabeth is hers and will be a far greater queen than any king Henry could have sired.  Highly recommend for all fans of Burton and historical drama.".

Henry VIII fascinating in himself probably didn't even realize what his love for this woman was going to mean. Has there ever been a more tantalizing historical figure to study?  This man moved  literally  heaven and earth to win the heart of this reluctant uncooperative insignificant girl.  And no one plays Henry better than Richard Burton combining wit cruelty and selfishness in one unforgettable character.  This movie is such a charmer even if it does take some historical liberties.  Bujold is superb as the spiteful spoiled Boleyn.  But even in her transformation in this film is tragedy  she goes from the crown to the block with such speed that even her head must have spun!  Any student of Tudor history or anyone just wanting to see a goodoldfashioned epic will love this movie.  I like to think that Burton comes the closest to portraying what Henry VIII must have really been like. But even if you don't like history Tudor England or the stars in this movie watch it anyway.

	schema:reviewBody "Henry VIII's male chauvinistic desire to begat a male heir for the throne of England is a tale often told from many points of view. In Anne of a Thousand Days it's told from the point of view of Anne Boleyn second wife of Henry VIII and mother of the infant child who became Elizabeth I. Anne Boleyn a high spirited young lass of 18 catches Henry VIII's eye at court. One of his previous dalliances was with her older sister Mary and that paid off well for the Boleyn family. Father Tom sees riches and glory even more and persuades her to really keep the king panting. Anne succeeds all too well. Henry divorces Catherine of Aragon and marries Anne. But all he begats is another daughter. And Henry still wants a son and he's got an eye on another. It all ends tragically for the Boleyn family.It's important to remember that as the film opens Henry VIII having caught sight of Anne at his court denies permission for her to marry some young lord whom she is in love with and vice versa. Had he looked elsewhere had he moved on all this might never have come to pass.Anne of the Thousand Days took 21 years to come to the screen. It ran on Broadway for a year in 19481949 and starred Rex Harrison as Henry VIII. Richard Burton joins a great list of actors who've portrayed Henry VIII on the screen. Probably the young Charles Laughton did him best but Burton is certainly fine.Genevieve Bujold in her screen debut is a stunning and fetching Anne too fetching for her own good. Poor kid though in other than a monarchist society that was becoming more absolute during Henry's reign she'd have married the man of her dreams and lived happily ever after.Anthony Quayle is a fine Cardinal Woolsey though I prefer Orson Welles in A Man for All Seasons. Michael Hordern as Thomas Boleyn destroys more than one member of his family through his own ambition.Irene Papas makes a tragic Catherine of Aragon. By all accounts Catherine was a pious woman who had incredible rotten luck with her pregnancies. Only daughter Mary survived who grew up to be the Queen known as Bloody Mary. She settled some accounts when she became Queen.I think the best supporting portrayal is that of John Colicos as Thomas Cromwell. This Cromwell was the great uncle of the more well known Oliver Cromwell. Oliver has his supporters and detractors but I've never seen a good word in any history books about Uncle Tom. Colicos has him pegged just right as a serpentine intriguer. By the way after the period of this film is over Thomas Cromwell made one too many intrigues and got on Henry VIII's wrong side. People usually didn't live long after that and Cromwell was no exception.When he wrote Anne of the Thousand Days Maxwell Anderson grew up in a society of law. I think a fine appreciation of that fact comes into the moral of the story. Even an absolute monarch has to obey laws or no one is safe. Until Henry VIII was off this mortal coil no one was.".

Other historical elements such as the schism with the Church of Rome and the political machinations of members of the court have been downplayed in order to concentrate on the love story. Thus this movie should be viewed as a costume drama rather than an accurate representation of historical events. In spite of these and other inaccuracies I still heartily recommend this movie as a spirited rendering of Royal lust in Merry Olde England and on a broader level as a kind of morality play showing how the pursuit of one's hearts desire is often more rewarding than the achievement of one's ambition or as Henry and Anne both learned to their cost when you get what you want you may then realize that you don't really want what you get.For another view of this same era see the film version of Robert Bolt's A Man For All Seasons  I also strongly recommend Henry VIII and His Six Wives starring Keith Michell and adapted to a movie from a sixpart TV series which I believe is also available as a boxed set.".

Then Henry breaks with Catholic Church and secretly married Anne  creating the Anglican religion . When the King proclaimed himself as Head of the England Church was inevitable that Henry and Thomas Moro would clash . Those who stood in Henry's way  even those he claimed to love invariably ended up on the scaffold and many catholic priests were led from their cells in the Tower of London and beheaded . Later on  Henry falls in love with a young favourite named Jane Seymour and he wishes to marry her . But the marriage to Anna did not last long and she was accused of adultery with his brother and four Communers .Interesting screenplay based on the source stage play Anne of the Thousand Days by Maxwell Anderson that was originally produced on Broadway in New York at the Shubert Theatre it describes England between the years 1526 and 1536 . Dynamic performance by Richard Burton  though he hated both the film and his interpretation and was amazed when he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor . Burton had been the second actor to do so for playing Henry VIII and the first to win for playing a role that someone else had already nominated an Oscar for playing the same character was actor Charles Laughton  he first played the monarch in 1933 for The private life of Henry VIII 1933 and won the Best Actor Academy Award for his performance . Burton and Genevieve Bujold make an extraordinary battle of wits  they were two of the foremost talents of the time . Actresses Olivia Hussey Julie Christie  and Faye Dunaway all turned down the role of Anne Boleyn  Hussey was the first choice for the part but she declined due to personal problems she was dealing with at the time  as the leading female part in the end was cast with French actress Genevive Bujold who gives a marvelous acting . Understanding and charismatic acting by large secondary cast as John Colicos as the ambitious Thomas Cromwell  Irene Papas as suffering Catherine of Spain  Michael Hordern as Thomas Boleyn  Peter Jeffreys as Duke of Norfork  among others . It appears uncredited Elizabeth Taylor as masked courtesan in a lush ball  in fact she wanted to play Anne Boleyn but was rejected as too old at age 37 . Sumptuous cinematography by Arthur Ibbetson  reflecting glamorously the spectacular sets and luxurious gowns which won an Academy Award . Evocative and emotive musical score by Georges Delerue . Lavishly produced by Hal B Wallis fitting accurately to Renaissance time  though the film received mixed reviews it was a financial flop on release . This engrossing motion picture was brilliantly directed by Charles Jarrot who continued in similar style with Mary queen of Scots about Henry's greatniece he directed two years later and again a wills duel  this time starred by Glenda Jackson as Queen Elizabeth and Vanessa Redgrave as Mary Stuart .".

Charles Jarrott never a reliable filmmaker but usually an oldfashioned one was probably a good pick for director though his lack of spirit or vitality makes itself apparent early on and his handling overall seems a bit indifferent and callow.

Although more recent research since the original 1940's play has shown that Anne's character was most likely a little less selfsatisfying as that depicted in this interpretation it is nevertheless a compelling account of a love affair that like the fictional Rhett and Scarlett turns down for the heroine once she realizes her love for her husband and unfortunately for Anne leads to her demise entirely.From research that I have done and reading more recent biographical sketches by Tudor historians Anne is depicted as a coquette but very chaste despite her exposure to French life. It appears she became educated on the Protestant movement while in France and welleducated in affairs of state. Much of information in Anne of the Thousand Days is speculative at best but much is historically based. Supposedly historical data errors caused many to speculate that Anne became pregnant before a first secret ceremony to Henry but current theory is the two were married in a ceremony prior to Anne's pregnancy. Historians believe Anne had two miscarriages after Elizabeth the latter being brought on by her distress at hearing Henry had been wounded jousting and that the premature fetus had deformities which at that time would have been blamed on the woman or evil influences.Despite any anachronisms or inaccuracies Anne is a wonderful movie and deserves the DVD restoration so discussed by many fans of the movie.".

Later when she fails to produce the longedfor Prince she does a fantastic job as the castoff wife worrying for her daughter resolutely facing her own tragic destiny. The other characters were also wonderfully portrayed Henry's finicky nature but sincere scruples and deep affection are more than just acted or so it seems by Richard Burton the proud determined disposition of the Spanish Princess is very much alive in Irene Papas' role as Queen Katharine and old stealthy Wolsey and cunning Cromwell come to life out of the pages of history just as they have been described. My only complaint is that the film was not long enough to show much about the threeyear marriage of King Henry and Queen Anne. After Elizabeth's birth which happened in September of 1533 the movie goes immediately to Katharine of Aragon's death which happened in January of 1536. Aside from a few misplaced dates the story line is intriguing. I definitely recommend it.".

The latter's morality can certainly be questioned in his bedscene. Given the woman in the scene the latter becomes hilarious to view.A majestic movie score well captures the mood of the story.Irene Papas is basically wasted as Catherine of Aragon. A fine actress her role deserved to be more meaty in content.";

Only Charles II of the followup Stuart family Henry V of the Lancastrian Plantagenets Richard III of the York Plantagenets Henry II of the Plantagenets and Victoria of the Hanovarians rival the Tudors but only for their own immediate story or stories. In telling of all the intrigue and tragedy and glory the Tudors still beat the others. Yet this wonderful film study of Henry VIII and his second wife was somehow not as successful as it should have been. Although it gained Oscar recognition it did not win anything notable  and that is due to an ironic delay in it's production.Anne Of A Thousand Days appeared in 1948 on Broadway and was a critically acclaimed triumph his last one for the overrated Maxwell Anderson. Anderson and his blank verse Elizabethan tragedies Mary Of Scotland Elizabeth The Queen had been popular in the 1930s and both were turned into films with Katherine Hepburn and Frederic March in the first and Bette Davis and Errol Flynn in the second. One might say Anne was the conclusion of a trilogy on Tudor tragedy and history. Anne was also a great dramatic triumph for it's star Rex Harrison who won the Tony Award for his portrayal of Henry VIII. It was a personal success for him as well for he was currently being pilloried in the press for being the man who supposedly caused Carol Landis to commit suicide as their love affair ended.Unfortunately the story of Henry's courtship pursuit of Anne his divorce from Katherine of Aragon and the resulting English Reformation his disappointment when Anne only produces one living child  a daughter named Elizabeth and his destruction of Anne literally taken to the executioner's block at Tower Hill included bits and pieces of infidelity illegitimacy and incest the three I taboos of motion picture codes in 1948. So we missed out on Harrison making a film record of his great performance. And the play did not appear on the screen until twenty years passed.Despite the pomposity of Anderson's mockTudor writing the play was actually good due to it's story. Anne is a brave woman and an ambitious one. She is a fit wife for Henry  but she is unlucky to have the same problem that Katherine had a problem that only Jane Seymour did not have of not fathering a legitimate male heir who survived. Even Jane's child the future Edward VI would only live to be an advanced teenager before he died in 1553. There may have been something physical wrong with Henry who did die of syphilis that prevented his sperm from producing strong males. By the way he did have an illegitimate son Henry Earl of Richmond who was considered a possible heir on several occasions but died in 1536.Burton gave a wonderful interpretation of Henry the complex man seeking happiness but also determined to have his way as he is King. Critical reaction to his performance was only negative in that Henry VIII had red hair which trait he passed to his daughter Elizabeth not black like Burton's. But that was a minor flaw. Genevieve Bujold was quite memorable as Anne who was brought up in France  ironically one of the last favors Henry gave her was to allow her to be beheaded by a French swordsman from Calais not an English axeman. Anthony Quayle was certainly thoughtful as Cardinal Wolsey watching his great power collapse in his failure to secure a papal divorce for his real master. John Collicos is a properly ruthless Thomas Cromwell while William Squire is adequate as Thomas More and Joseph O'Conor gets a chance to show Bishop Fisher's moral strength.But that's just the problem here. This history lesson was given to the public  brilliantly given  just three years earlier in A Man For All Seasons which emphasized Thomas More's struggle of conscience over gratitude in the English Reformation of the 1530s. It is not to disparage Anne as a film to say that All Seasons covered the same or most of the same territory better or just or well. But it got there first. This is why Anne is rarely revived while All Seasons has been. One also has to admit that altruistic More is a better figure to sympathize and honor as his fellow martyr Fisher is than the unlucky but ambitious Anne. So the public felt. Both are first rate films and Anne does go a step further into the matter of how she's framed by Henry and Cromwell for divorce and execution purposes. But we heard all this before  and from a morally higher position.".

What a waste of time money and effort to all concerned including the audience. Well as in any thriller here too are murders corpses and blood. Just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago committed a murder with a knife and came out calm and smiling not to mention clean as a whistle as if slashing one's throat is done by a virtual agent. Also this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male and she cut his throat!!! Did she ask him politely to bend down for her? Much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one. Continuity is another huge problem as for instance The eagerhungry groom is lying in bed waiting for his virginbride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while falls asleep!?!. Next scene opens with the young couple entering the receptionarea asking for guidance to scenery spots! NOT A WORD ABOUT LAST NIGHT??? Such a waste of time even to try and write about this lowlow supposedtobe movie.".

Fortunately Woody doesn't care what people think he's supposed to do.And make no mistake Shadows and Fog is a great film.

The characters in this one of the best of his screenplays are all individuals all facets of Woody's immense understanding of the common man. The scene in the brothel is stunning in its casual ordinariness. Kleinman translation little man is all of us in the shadow and fog of confusing times. Consider the line he delivers just before he blows pepper in the crowd's face I never did anything to deserve getting in trouble. The irony here is that much of the fascism that overtook Europe came because too many good people did nothing. The lesson was as significant when Woody made the film as during the time depicted and just as significant today. A great film 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen's tribute to German expressionism is better than most critics would have you believe. Sure there is very little plot to speak of it's more a series of vignettes and gags than a cohesive narrative. Sure it ends rather abruptly never solving the mystery but none of this stopped my thorough enjoyment of this film.As the title suggests the entire movie is designed in shadows and fog. Shot with beautiful black and white photography Allen and cinematographer Carlo Di Palma create the look and feel of an unnamed East European city as seen in such films as M and Nosferatu. The lighting is set up so that in nearly every shot underlying shadows engulf the scene. In the exteriors a vicious fog rolls across the night sky obscuring most details. Through the fog bumbles Kleinman Allen is his typical neurotic schmuck role trying to find his role in a vigilante mob's plan to stop a serial killer roaming the streets. From dark night until dawn Kleinman wanders from place to place meeting a wide variety of curious characters played by an even more curious group of celebrities the most endearing of which is a desperate sword swallower Mia Farrowwho is has wandered into a brothel after fleeing her cheating boyfriendclown John Malcovich.It is a little unsettling to watch Allen do his normal schtick while the characters around him are murdered subjected to racial prejudice beaten by the police and discuss such subjects as love sex and meaning. There is a subtext involving the plight of the Jews between the World Wars foreshadowing the Nazis. Yet the gags remain as solid as any Woody Allen film. Amongst the seriousness of his subtext and the films he is paying homage to Allen finds away to bring full bellied laughter. Though his quirky neurosis isn't as resolutely hilarious as it is in such films as Annie Hall it is still enough to fill the film with mirth.The film ends rather abruptly with Kleinman having never learned his role in the plan nor the killer having been caught. Yet as the credits role we realize the mystery was not so much the reason behind the story as method in creating it.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Shadows  Fog' is for me all that which makes a perfect picture. I've seen all Woody Allen's pictures and none affects me in the same way that 'SF' does.The film is set in the early part of the 20th century somewhere in Eastern Europe. The opening scenes set up what will become the basic plot and believe me it is basic of the film. Allen plays Klieinman a simple clerk who is awaken by a lynch mob hellbent on catching a killer who has taken to strangling or slitting the throats nobody seems sure of the townsfolk.As Kleinman leaves his flat in reluctant search of the killer we are introduced to the fog swept streets of the village. It is here that we find the real character of this film. Allen uses the simple story of the hunt as a means to introduce us to us to true beauty in the night. He uses lighting and canted angles to produce a surreal setting unlike any film produced in the last halfcentury. Note the way light filtering through the spokes of the circus wagons reflects of the fog in a way so beautiful and haunting that it's easy to forget we're watching an 88min comedy shot on sound stages in New York.Setting the mood as such Allen walks us through the streets and offers a brief glimpse of the characters who inhabit the night. It seems as if the whole town is up searching for the killer and each of them is given a short moment to offer a bit of insight and then move on. However brief each character brings us further into the shadows and we soon feel a chill as the night air seems to fill the room.The scene eventually shifts to a whore house where we are privy to a spectacular scene. Five women sit at a table discussing relationships fascinating stories given that most of them are whores. Instead of cuts Allen simply places a camera in the center of the table and revolves as the ladies converse. It's a scene reminiscent of the opening sequence of 'A Touch of Evil' of the Copacabana scene in 'Goodfellas'. Amazing.There's so much more to say. Brecht's score is wonderful the cast is literally one of the best of the 1990's Cusack Malkovitch Foster Macy Riley Shaw Bates Tomilin Kavner Pleasence and the jokes are hilarious.Above everything see this film for it's namesake ... Shadows and Fog. If ever there was a homage to night and all its mystery and beauty it's 'Shadows and Fog'.".

	schema:reviewBody "I made the big mistake of avoiding this for years based on all the garbage I'd heard slammed against it and as a result it was one of the last Woody Allen movies I got around to seeing. Well it was worth waiting for as it turned out to be a real treat. This is one of Allen's strangest works probably his signature stab at a horror spoof. The black and white moody photography is compelling modeled after the dark German expressionistic films of Murnau and Fritz Lang as well as a hearkening back to those delightful old horror and Sherlock Holmes films from Universal Studios.The action is set in an unnamed village in an unknown time and place but it's patterned after the early 20th Century with a hint of Germany or even London. True to form Allen plays a dweeb who is awoken at midnight by an angry mob demanding that he assist them in tracking down a JacktheRipperlike serial murderer who's prowling the streets. He halfheartedly gets dressed and ventures out into the moonlit fog unsure of just what's expected from him while he manages a few good oneliner's in his apprehension they say the killer has the strength of 10 men I have the strength of one small boy  with polio.There are guest stars galore some of whom have very small parts but are fun to watch anyway. A traveling circus in town consists of a female sword swallower Mia Farrow and her clown husband John Malkovich who is having an affair with the Strongman's pretty wife Madonna. When Farrow catches the two of them in a caravan together she storms out alone into the dark and is taken in by a street walker Lily Tomlin who lets her unwind inside her brothel with the rest of the whores two of which are played by Kathy Bates and Jodie Foster. Some of the finest moments in the film come within the whorehouse complimented by philosophical discussion and interesting camerawork. It's there that a wealthy young patron John Cusack fancies Mia and coaxes her into bed for one night. Her ultimate guilt over the encounter leads her back into the dense fog until she meets up predictably with Woody.

	onyx:emotionText "I made the big mistake of avoiding this for years based on all the garbage I'd heard slammed against it and as a result it was one of the last Woody Allen movies I got around to seeing. Well it was worth waiting for as it turned out to be a real treat. This is one of Allen's strangest works probably his signature stab at a horror spoof. The black and white moody photography is compelling modeled after the dark German expressionistic films of Murnau and Fritz Lang as well as a hearkening back to those delightful old horror and Sherlock Holmes films from Universal Studios.The action is set in an unnamed village in an unknown time and place but it's patterned after the early 20th Century with a hint of Germany or even London. True to form Allen plays a dweeb who is awoken at midnight by an angry mob demanding that he assist them in tracking down a JacktheRipperlike serial murderer who's prowling the streets. He halfheartedly gets dressed and ventures out into the moonlit fog unsure of just what's expected from him while he manages a few good oneliner's in his apprehension they say the killer has the strength of 10 men I have the strength of one small boy  with polio.There are guest stars galore some of whom have very small parts but are fun to watch anyway. A traveling circus in town consists of a female sword swallower Mia Farrow and her clown husband John Malkovich who is having an affair with the Strongman's pretty wife Madonna. When Farrow catches the two of them in a caravan together she storms out alone into the dark and is taken in by a street walker Lily Tomlin who lets her unwind inside her brothel with the rest of the whores two of which are played by Kathy Bates and Jodie Foster. Some of the finest moments in the film come within the whorehouse complimented by philosophical discussion and interesting camerawork. It's there that a wealthy young patron John Cusack fancies Mia and coaxes her into bed for one night. Her ultimate guilt over the encounter leads her back into the dense fog until she meets up predictably with Woody. Also in small roles are Donald Pleasence in good form as a mad coroner who wants to analyze the essence of the killer's evil possibly playing on his involvement in the HALLOWEEN films and a wasted turn by Fred Gwynne don't blink or you'll miss him as one of the villagers.SHADOWS AND FOG is flawed to be sure there are a lot of loose ends remaining untied for one thing but it's visually appealing and rich in atmosphere and the language of the night.

It doesn't take a tremendous amount of knowledge to enjoy this well crafted ode to and let's face it spoof of German Expressionism a little Nosferatu here a dash of Caligari there a couple of slightly less obvious flourishes the Sniffer with a divine gift the Circus the mobs and the general atmosphere and you've got all you need. Of course this is the most basic level in the film I won't dig into Philosophy and message in a commentary but by all means it's there and worth musing over but it's already enough to justify seeing it.The idea of the confusing shadows and fog of Expressionist cinema filtered through Allen's offkilter character world view is exactly what makes the film so hysterical. The entire film is done in a beautiful black and white recalling the source material and the city's mob are all played perfectly deadpan... except for Allen who manages to bumble his way through obstacle after obstacle trying to at least get a grip on the situation. If this pile of nerves moving through a dark sordid city doesn't make you laugh I don't know what to say.The film DOES falter in some aspects however. Mia Farrow is passable as the necessary sympathetic female lead but in the end her presence doesn't fit in with the rest of the film's ambiance and one would have rather seen more of femme Fatale Lily Tomlin. Likewise John Malchovich's Clown while obviously referential sticks out like a sore thumb. It's a shame that Allen had to add these elements which end up detracting from the overall film but one couldn't hold the film alone and Farrow manages to at least be a proper target to bounce lines.In the end a very strong film and one that entertains properly but obviously not one made for the uninitiated. However for those who're on the inside of the plan and furthermore on the inside of the philosophies it's a tremendous bit of fun.Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "A title as descriptive as it is oblique Shadows and Fog is Allen's playful ode to German expressionism Franz Kafka and Kurt Weil. Though not as successful as other films of his from the same era particularly Husbands and Wives and Manhattan Murder Mystery it regardless remains something of a sadly neglected curio in his directorial cannon with Allen creating a film that is visually stunning and thematically quite fascinating despite the occasional lapses in terms of script and overall performance. The film draws heavily on the dual influences of Kafka's novel the Trial and the Fritz Lang film M as Allen  here cast as the neurotic existentialist Max Kleinmann  finds himself embroiled in the search for a vicious serial killer stalking the nocturnal streets of an unnamed amalgamation of archaic EasternEuropean cities. Ultimately the nervy and intellectual Kleinmann becomes the number one suspect in the case hounded by both police and lynch mobs alike and forced to escape into the dangerous night with a beautiful swordswallower named Irmy who has left the circus to get away from her adulterous and patronising boyfriend. The two characters form the dual arc of the story with their paths crossing throughout... whilst simultaneously acting as links back and forth between the various subplots and supporting characters.Allen's ultimate failing with the film is that he casts his net a little too wide introducing characters for no real reason and then forgetting about them before we even get to know them. It also doesn't help matters much that he decides to fill every single role no matter how short or insubstantial with an Alist actor. The stars really get in the way of the central drama between Kleinmann and Irmy and the interesting atmosphere and tension created by the mysteriously plot. I suppose essentially the film should be seen as an arthouse mystery drawing certain parallels with Steven Soderbergh's greatly underrated film Kafka from the year before in the sense that both films use a loosely expressionistic style actually closer to postwar noir... but who's really nitpicking with a film this visually stunning? and the idea of a hapless central character being plunged headlong into a plot that he has no control over. However having said that it's also a Woody Allen film so we have the neurotic central character the unrequited love and the comic vignettes to act as a sort of padding.It seems that Allen really wanted the best of both worlds here attempting to create a serious expressionist piece with a dark plot involving murder corruption prostitution and the idea of suspicion but feeling the need to compromise with the inclusion of witty oneliners a vague ending and a galaxy of stars to I suppose justify the lavish 20 million budget. In this respect Shadows and Fog is a flawed film... one that seems unsure of what it wants to be or where it wants to go. However if we scratch a little beneath the surface we find that the film like many of the director's other projects works on a deeper level than the central narrative. I've read reviews and analysis elsewhere on the Internet that talk much more eloquently than I ever could about Allen's use of subtext particularly in the idea of mobmentality especially when it comes to the Jewish characters here. Is Allen making some kind of comment on the action leading up to and beyond Hitler's reign of tyranny during the Second World War? It's possible particularly if we think about the scene in which Kleinmann is immediately greeted with suspicion by the priest and the chief of police as he attempts to hand over a 700 donation to the local church. There's also the scene in which Kleinmann watches in horror as the Jewish family  a family he knows to be honest and good  are violently thrown out of their house and arrested by the heavyhanded lynch mob which recalls certain scenes from Schindler's List.There's also the notion of madness most pronounced during the conversation between Kleinmann and the eccentric physician... a scene that really pushes the ambient highly expressionistic style to breaking point with it's rigid black and white composition use of shadows and framed distortions and constant soundtrack hum of distant industrial noise bringing to mind films like The Elephant Man by David Lynch or Lars von Trier's The Element of Crime. Or is the whole film a dream... with that first murder happening at the start of the film before Kleinmann is suddenly awoken from a deepsleep by his angry neighbours certainly this would suggest the dreamlike shifts in tone  from moments of light comedy to the deeper ruminations on god and death  and that strange and elusive climax. Naturally taking all of these factors which at the end of the day are just my personal interpretations into consideration one would be best advised to give the film a few viewings before passing judgement on it. I'm not going to try and talk it up like it's one of Allen's greatest masterpieces because at the end of the day it's really not... the script could have perhaps done with a little work and I really could have done without all the Alist cameos I think the film would have worked better with unknowns like Zelig.However I think it's a good film regardless of these flaws one that employs an evocative and highly atmospheric visual style has some nicely observed moments and delicate switches between humour and something much more sinister and has a story that rewards repeated viewings and gives way to a plethora of different interpretations. It's certainly not the best place to start for those new to Allen's cinema  though I prefer it to the universally acclaimed Hannah and Her Sisters  though it's sure to delight long term devotees or anyone with a passing interest in German expressionism Kafka or surreal European cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shadows and Fog is Woody Allen's tribute to German Expressionism and it's very interesting often funny and at times downright strange. He gives no indication of the setting or time and as is often true with Allen there's a serious undertone. His nebishy character Kleinman is woken up in the middle of the night in his home for reasons having to do with a serial killer at large. Poor Kleinman doesn't know exactly what he has to do with anything but as he puts it everything seems to know what he's supposed to be doing but him. Across town Mia Farrow is the circus performer Irmy who finds out her boyfriend John Malkovich is cheating on her so she leaves him. She winds up in a brothel with some real characters played by Lily Tomlin Kathy Bates and Jodie Foster. A client John Cusack declares himself in love with Mia and offers her money to sleep with him. When it gets up to 700 she accepts. Later she meets Kleinman and sends him to the church to donate all but 50. The priest is impressed and the police cross Kleinman's name off the list of suspects. Then they meet a beggar and she sends Kleinman back for half the money. Kleinman's name goes back on the list of suspects.Yes it's an odd but fascinating film. The atmosphere is bizarre very German  dark bleak and foggy with a scary serial killer out of M. Big stars float in and out of the film like Madonna some with tiny roles. The funniest scene is when Kleinman tries to hide out at his exgirlfriend's Julie Kavner who calls him every name in the book and then tries to turn him in.Kleinman is an innocent man caught in confusing circumstances and times not sure which side he should be on  there are two factions trying to catch this killer and both attempt to recruit him  and all the poor guy wants is a promotion at his job. Though his reactions are often amusing imagine being awoken by the police in the middle of the night and having no idea what it's about. It's happened though as it happens in the film. As Kleinman wanders the streets unsure of where he's going we can relate.".

The effect is not unlike a student film parody of a Woody Allen comedy following a hapless nebbish who could only have been played by Allen himself pressed into service by urban vigilantes hunting a shadowy killer. The familiar oneliners and stale meditations on God sex and death are all camouflaged behind some beautiful if hokey black and white photography with transparent references to more than one film school idol Bergman Murnau Fellini and so forth.

	schema:reviewBody "On first viewing I wasn't crazy about Shadows and Fog while the film looked fantastic and was welldirected the characters left me cold the film didn't seem to know what tone it wanted and the story seemed meandering and dull. On rewatch however Shadows and Fog fared much betteras was with almost all the Allen films that didn't impress at first apart from Anything Else it is nowhere near among Woody Allen's best and is around the lower middle of his filmography but I found it a good film and not among Allen's worst that it's often said to be. Visually Shadows and Fog looks fantastic with brilliant black and white cinematography and Expressionistic images that are as striking as they are haunting. Allen's films are always wellmade but Shadows and Fog visually like Zelig is quite unique from a visual standpoint. The music is very eerie and fits the atmosphere perfectly in fact if anything it adds to it. While it was confusing of what tone the film was trying to go with on first viewing on rewatch it was much clearer and that criticism seems unfair now. The dialogue is both subtle and hilariouslove the brothel scenes with sharp homages and insight in characteristic Woody Allen vein but even more impressive was the murdermystery element while a really chilling atmosphere is created helped by the visuals and music. Allen's directing is as always adept and his performance the most memorable is a lot of fun. John Cusack does nervous and angsty very nicely and Jodie Foster and Kathy Bates are remarkably good in againsttype roles. Shadows and Fog has imperfections Mia Farrow for me overdoes it and comes across as shrill John Malkovich deserved much more to do and is a little wasted and Madonna is rather out of place. The story does have its drawn out and aimless patches with an ending that felt convoluted and hurried and the characters are not very interesting a lot of them barely in the film. To conclude however a good film but considering how well the best assets come off it could have been more than good. 710 Bethany Cox".

I like it a lot partly for the awesome allstar cast partly for the blending of comedy i.e. Woody's usual schlemiel self with drama a deranged killer loose on the streets of a fogshrouded town at night. I'm not going to go into a lot of details on the film anyone can pick them up between the other user comments external and newsgroup reviews. The main reason I'm adding my two cents worth is no one seems to have noticed or commented on one of the film's underlying themes that of antisemitism in Europe apparently between world wars. For instance the Mintz family is picked up by the police as a convenient scapegoat for the recent murders despite Kleinman's Woody Allen assertion that they are lovely people. Shortly afterwards Kleinman goes to the local church to make a donation on behalf of Irmy Mia Farrow and finds the priest and a policeman making up a list of people that also includes himself. I can't quite put my finger on it but he seems to be referring to the start of Hitler's persecution of Jews in Germany prior to WW II. Of course this theme is woven in with several others regarding marital fidelity prostitution insanity and the nature of mob mentality but it does seem interesting that everyone motivated enough to write something about this film pro or con seems to have overlooked or intentionally ignored.".

It's film surrealism with a point to let us relish unreality by letting there be just enough reality to get a fingerhold before we slide back into delicious absurdity.

	schema:headline " Shadows and Fog";
	schema:reviewBody "After completing Shadows and Fog I found myself once again dismayed by the common claimthat Woody Allen makes the same type of film over and over again. In reality Woody has always been open to trying new and untested things both with his narrative structure and his filmmaking style. Shadows and Fog is another perfect example of Woody's penchant for diverse filmmaking. The 1991 film was Woody Allen's gentle homage to German Expressionism. Shadows and Fog pairs Woody Allen and Mia Farrow in a shadowy town that hides from a strangler that is on the loose. As is the usual Woody Allen film Shadows and Fog is as wonderfully comedic as it is a thoughtful exercise in grappling with life's deepest questions. Kleinman Woody Allen is a nebbish nervous bookkeeper who has been pulled into a plot by a group of vigilantes to hunt for a strangler that has been terrorizing their area. A perpetually nervous individual Kleinman wants nothing to do with a group of lawless men seeking out a murderer. Kleinman would rather stay locked in his apartment safely away from the murderer roaming the streets. To make matters worse despite the fact that Kleinman has been roped into a group of vigilantes information about his role in the group is being withheld from him. Sheepishly attempting to find his role within the vigilante group all the while desperately trying to avoid putting himself in real danger Kleinman encounters a woman in a traveling circus Irmy Mia Farrow who is also attempting to find her way through life in a much more metaphorical sense. Kindred spirits Kleinman and Irmy attempt to find a purpose for their lives all the while trying to save them.Shadows and Fog works perfectly as a nod to German Expressionism with gorgeous imagery reminiscent of the greats of the genre such as Robert Wiene and Fritz Lang. Woody Allen's frequent use of black and white photography well into the 90's is a fearless maneuver that deserves uproarious applause. Woody is a filmmaker that uses a variety of film technique achieving artistic significance yet is hardly acknowledged for that. Certain aspects Woody is commonly acknowledged for are present in Shadows and Fog for instance it is exquisitely written and has a brilliant sound design. Shadows and Fog is another worthy mention in my crusade to prove that Woody Allen is not a filmmaker that has a clear section of lowertier work as he is often accused.".

Clueless Kleinmen is assigned to guard the streets and watch out for a serial killer. In a moment of rage Irmy after catching her boyfriend Clown John Malkovich red handed with seductress Marie Madonna decides to leave the circus. While she wanders the streets she bumps into Prostitute Lily Tomlin who shelters her in her brothel. Soon after Irmy leaves the brothel she meets Kleinman. Together they wander the streets experiencing odd encounters. Unfortunately 'Shadows and Fog' hasn't received as much recognition as Allen's other works. It has the usual Allen style with a series of conversations quirky characters and a whimsical feel to it. The execution is very good especially the lighting cinematography editing and score. Allen has gathered an enviable ensemble that further includes Kathy Bates William Macy Jodie Foster John Cusack and many more. Everyone performs superbly but if I had to pick the best it would be Mia Farrow. Her spontaneity makes her performance come across as very natural. For me 'Shadows and Fog' is just as good as any other great Allen movie. It may be a little more awkward than his other movies but enjoyable nonetheless.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening of 'Daisies' features a montage of two subjects very familiar to 1966 Eastern Bloc film audiences work and war as shots of an industrial machine alternate with views of rubbling city from an airplane bomber's point of view.  These are masculine subjects in a very masculine culture. Or they seem to be.  The machine features a circular mechanism and represents repetition but also productivity and might be said to represent female principles whereas the war footage is of pure destruction.  The heroines of 'Daisies' embody both these genderspecific realms and manage to create something new.  They are idle but like George Costanza their indolence depends on relentless invention.  They are destructive but out of the destruction they produce something new.  'Daisies' was a product of the Czech New Wave but seems a million miles away from its most famous contemporaries the films of Menzel and Forman. These latter though liberal and antitotalitarian were artistically conservative  deliberately humanist works where 'real' psychologically plausible characters exist in 'real' places and every narrative progression makes logical sense.  If they seem 'timeless' to us now it is because they didn't truly engage with their own times.And of course they were male.  Where they seem closer to the 19th century novel or classic Hollywood cinema Chytilova's peers are the great European modernists Godard Paradjanov Makajev Rivette or the plays of Ionesco. Where Forman and Menzel framed their illusions of realism in formal coherence Chytilova revels in formal instability. These aren't psychologically plausible characters in a causeandeffect universe.  We first meet the two Maries after the opening credits and their automaton gestures with accompanying sound effects continue the movement of the machine.  The plot basically consists of the girls trying to chat up old men who'll feed them but what they really do is make a nonsense of plot.  The recurring motif is the posy of roses worn by Marie II and thrown by her to further the story  we remember the nursery rhyme 'a ring a ring of rosies a pocketful of posies a tishoo a tishoo we all fall down'.  And everything falls down here in a game where the rules have splintered and fragmented.  The film mixes monochrome colour and unstably tinted scenes.  Sequences that begin 'sensibly' are broken down by slapstick changes of register 'impossible' changes of location or physics or are turned from natural scenes into the robotic movements of a clockwork toy going out of control. This disruption has a theoretical point  in one scene the girls find their bodies cut up as they find their identities dissolved by conflicting desires social expectations and representations.  In another they wander around a dream space wondering why people pay no attention to them realising that 'logically' they mustn't exist because Western culture has no place for them.  Just as they parody the notions of work and war in the climactic food orgy martial army music soundtracks a cake fight so these sprites play with and destroy the assumptions of Western humanism its claims to adequately represent 'reality' especially in a time of such bewildering radical change as in the 1960s.  They do to cinema what Ionesco did to literature cut it into shreds.  The whole thing plays like parody Godard with Marie II as Anna Karina with meaningful conversations about love accompanied by the girls cutting up sausages and bananas the butterfly sequence is a wicked lampoon of 'Vivre sa Vie'.  Where Godard's heroines remained fixed and stared at the two Maries laugh look escape see their frame and break it insist on their body as something more than an object something they can play with themselves.  Not even the heroines' liberating subversivess is fixed  their mindless appetite is punished as often as their formal iconoclasm is celebrated.  But for all its theoretical rigour 'Daisies' never sacrifices its sense of humour  I first saw it when I was ten and loved it for its slapstick fun its narrative unpredictability its playful soundtrack and its tireless visual invention.  I still love it now.".

	schema:reviewBody "To take this film way out of context I've got to believe that nine out of ten Miranda July fans would enjoy this film made in 1966 well before Little Miss Moviola was born. Indeed I would recommend this film for anyone in the mood for a nonlinear romp. The film is a cutup not just comical...but even as sort of visual equivalent of Brion Gysin's dreammachine. In particular there is a scene with scissors that was captivating not in being a cutting edge special effect but in embracing the handson artforart sake editing. Through out the film Colors come and go blossoming and wilting like the Daisies of the title. Or perhaps Daisies are cited for their ability to sprout up under peculiar conditions. An antidote to the bummer that face trummerflora in the midst of any upheaval.That director Vera Chytilova was doing this under the watchful and at best blind eye of Comrade Censor I think can attribute to the film's nonlinear approach. Perhaps part defensemechanism perhaps part lyrical lysergic reaction to the disciplined times the film surely wants to defy something but settles for defying classification. Ironically that might be what makes these well cut Daisies fresh to this day. A silent film with sound. A black and white film that bursts into colors.I went in knowing nothing about the Czech New Wave and in now reading around it seems this is the wrong film from which to build a center about. I still know nothing but I am at least intrigued. Indeed I was certain one of the two main Marie's was the filmmaker herself. Wrong! The fact that Chytilova made this when she was 36 or so is almost as impressive as making it in the political climate of the time. The film is extremely playful and the actresses deserve much praise that has heretofore been lacking. If you enjoyed the film and clearly I did while others at IMDb did not a key is that there is something about the two leads beyond their costumes that snares our attention. Although I do think garlands and veils should find themselves into more femme's fatal fashion... Oh and since I'm older than this film I kept seeing the two actresses as Carol Burnett and maybe Joanne Worley?!?! Any ways the two seem to be truly delighting themselves and one wonders if some of the madness was improvised on the spot. Or were they really just puppets as the initial scene suggests??Anyways this film is as artful as it is ambiguous. I was enjoying my modernday interpretation knowing full well that it was wrong. That interpretation is that women have replaced their sex drive with a food urge but must leverage the less evolved male's sex drive to satisfy their advanced needs. And again I confess to crimes against the state and more importantly the film I know I am wrong. Stamping my own ideas on the fragile frames of the film.Similarly the flowerpower of the 60's in the US could pollinate the film and be seen a diatribe against that which is drab. But again that appears to be all hippy and none too hip to the intention.The film maker in a 1975 letter addressed to Comrade President her phrase for Gustav Husak wroteDaisies was a morality play showing how evil does not necessarily manifest itself in an orgy of destruction caused by the war that its roots may lie concealed in the malicious pranks of everyday life. I chose as my heroines two young girls because it is at this age that one most wants to fulfill oneself and if left to one's own devices his or her need to create can easily turn into its very opposite. By the way the full letter was on the DVD.I don't know I still think this is a film that begs to be taken out of context...and certainly plucked off of dusty shelves and seen by many today. Show it to kids I bet they'll laugh at this like they would at Laurel and Hardy or Buster Keaton.710 Thurston Hunger".

	schema:reviewBody "Vera Chytilova's 1966 film Daisies is a surreal psychedelic Dada explosion from start to finish. The story concerns two teen girls both named Marie who act goofy and play slapstick pranks everywhere they go. They take guys on dates to see how obnoxious they can act before making the men leave. They love food and these beautiful ladies aren't afraid to eat. Rock on girls! This film is highly trippy and experimental. I love Czech films but this one is my personal favorite. It is an underrated masterpiece that is rarely talked about. Not only does it have powerful female characters it's one of the most unique films of the 60's Czech new wave. It uses lots of camera tricks filters abstract symbolism and stock footage for a unique cinematic experience. It also uses food in bizarre juxtapositions. Because of all the food used as art the film caused Chytilova to be blacklisted. The Czech government said the film was a waste of food and lacked an important message. Oh well you can't make everyone happy. The camera tricks in this film look similar to the techniques later used in some music videos. My favorite scene in the movie is when the girls crash the banquet hall. They stuff there faces full of food and it almost turns into a food orgy. If your looking for a good time Daisies is a great film. It's bizarre colorful chaotic and filled with laughs. A true Czech masterpiece. Now if only I could visit Prague.".

The crazy 1960s cinematography the strange accents of the two main characters and the sheer hedonism the economy was quite poor at the time give a surreal edge to what is not a surreal film.  The film also hints of a Czechoslovakia identifying with Western Europe and impatient with the regime  despite its reforms.  The cinematography is fun and the story is a definite upending of the usual role of women in Czech films.  If you're looking for deep symbolism you'll be disappointed.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps because Vera Chytilova directed 'Daisies' in 1966 at the start of the Prague Spring that subsequent viewers scramble in a mad rush to label the film as a feminist outcry against the patriarchal hegemony organised along communist themes of repressive theocracy.Even without any prior knowledge of the historical context in which this film emanated it works as a playful collage of surrealistic scenes which serve as an ironic lambast and a helping of satirical lashing against the entrenched consumerism and conventional normative of the day a mad bad coming of age story embodying two young girls who decide that if the world is 'so bad' then they will be too. How exactly is the world so bad then? There is one very oblique reference to war in the very beginning of the film but in general the themes which are propelled to the forefront and unpicked with gentle satire well and slapstick comedy and cartoon animations and lackadaisical funorama focus on nihilism hedonism decay of moral values ennui and lack of any productive and meaningful life goals. Rebelling against all this is perhaps the true definition of a 'rebel without a cause' and perhaps there is never any 'age' when disenchanted incumbents won't have a go at the moral depravity of their peers as each generation discovers anew the hypocrisy and disinterment between society paying lip service to social values and the underlying reality which ensconces the exact opposite.So Marie and Marie our two protagonists are going to be 'bad'. But not too bad this isn't going to be the Czech version of 'a Clockwork Orange' by any means. Bad here means taking unscrupulous old men for a ride wizened insufferables who hope to score based on paying for a meal. Well if eating their food and sending them on their way makes the two Maries bad what in heavens name would they have done if they were 'good' succumbed to the wily charms of the octogenarians? Uugh it doesn't bear thinking.Being bad is defined twice more in the film once as the girls get tipsy in a cabaret and stage an impromptu side show in their cubicle as they start jiving quelle horreur! and once more at the finale when they descend upon a baquet hall and proceed to systematically destroy the food plateau the room's fixtures and furnishing as well as the banqueting table and all the accoutrements on it. All this is done so playfully gracefully and sweetly that the viewers get swept up in the ride we're not indignant at the wanton destruction as these two scamps wallop we're enchanted not least by the food fight and strip tease which culminate the scene.But what happens next the true denouement and final scene of the film is an ironic take of double entendre which demands kudos. The two Maries decide they are going to try and make amends having wreaked havoc with the food hall. Why they decide this remains unclear is it because polit bureau apparatchiks are whispering sweet somethings in Chytilova's ear? Is it because she wants one final stab at bohemian assertion? In any event the two Maries are going to make good they tell us so 'We shall be happy because we are good' they say. But in a tonal chorus set to a grating repetitive basso continuo which leaves the audience in no doubt that they mean the opposite. Dressed in newspaper rags which would probably have Lady Gaga enthralled if she had seen it BEFORE the meat dress they trip around setting the banquet to rights. But just like Humpty Dumpty they are never going to be able to put this together again. 'Does it matter?' asks Marie number 1. 'No it doesn't matter' says Marie number two and I can't help cheering them on.".

This is a thoughtful allegorical critique of how Socialism  Communism has worked in practice instead of how it was supposed to have worked in theory. I now realise the only reason for doing this is because both films are part of the so called Czech New Wave and were short enough to fit onto a single DVD. Where as Party and Guests had a structure and message behind it Dasies has minimal content and very little to recommend it.I think it is time to burst a few conception bubbles contained in some of the comments here.Firstly this is not a feminist movie it is an antimen film. There is a very big difference. Shame on the men who didn't realise this.Nor is it Anarchy as some people have claimed. Anarchy is a number of people working together to achieve a common objective without the need for an umbrella stricture of administrators to tell them what to do. They know what is required and get on with doing it by themselves. What people usually mean when they use the word Anarchy is chaos. Again there is a very big difference.So far as the cinematography goes changing colour filters many times mid scene and changing costumes halfway through a kiss is not artistic but the director trying hard to be arty and not pulling it off.As for the period when the film was made. After Stalinism albeit at a distance had been lifted the director did not know what to do with her new found freedom and went around like the angry cavalier who rode off furiously in all directions. Or even more like the proverbial dog with two dicks. A flurry of activity finished up producing something that was sterile. People don't like freedom they don't know what to do with it. Those interested enough should see my Satantango review for an explanation of this quote.It seems to me the destructive element of the main characters derived from boredom associated with the minimal real content or purpose in their lives and there is nothing for viewers of the film to respect in this.All in all this was a very disappointing effort. I can count this amongst the ten most irrelevant films I have seen and it scores only one point from me.".

They know what is required and get on with doing it by themselves. What people usually mean when they use the word Anarchy is chaos. Again there is a very big difference.So far as the cinematography goes changing colour filters many times mid scene and changing costumes halfway through a kiss is not artistic but the director trying hard to be arty and not pulling it off.As for the period when the film was made. After Stalinism albeit at a distance had been lifted the director did not know what to do with her new found freedom and went around like the angry cavalier who rode off furiously in all directions. Or even more like the proverbial dog with two dicks. A flurry of activity finished up producing something that was sterile. People don't like freedom they don't know what to do with it. Those interested enough should see my Satantango review for an explanation of this quote.It seems to me the destructive element of the main characters derived from boredom associated with the minimal real content or purpose in their lives and there is nothing for viewers of the film to respect in this.All in all this was a very disappointing effort. I can count this amongst the ten most irrelevant films I have seen and it scores only one point from me.";

They are taken on dates with dulllooking gentlemen whom they manipulate ditching them at the train station after their meal has been paid for. Other men they simply ignore such as one butterflyobsessed suitor who calls to plead forgiveness and profess his love as the girls gleefully scissor bananas pickles and sausages in what may be the most onthenose example of feminist symbolism ever expressed in film. It's fortunate that the girls are attractive because they are otherwise intolerably obnoxious acting like 12yearolds at a slumber party  jumping around cooing to each other and laughing in chipmunklike squeals. At one point there is the following exchange which sums them up nicely Your legs are crooked. Don't you know that's just what I based my personality on? That is beyond their pointless antics they have no personalities. I'm sure there are those who think this kind of thing is a 'daring' display of grrl power but in reality it could not make women look worse. We're supposed to be spoiled aren't we?  lines like this make me wonder whether the characters were ever intended to be sympathetic. If they are intended as a selfcritique they are a critique of the hedonism brought on by liberalization of Czech society certainly something Chytilova does not intend. At least the conclusion was satisfying involving a deserved death by chandelier. Chytilova's idea of surrealism is color filters and hyperactive whimsy. A few scenes capture interest but in general little thought is given to composition. At certain points especially near the end the film approaches Godardesque pretension which only added to my frustration. It's not just farce it's politically relevant farce! Well I'm not fooled. During the film's last moments a typewriter scrolls the words 'This film is dedicated to those who get upset only over a stompedupon bed of lettuce' as explosions detonate in the background. The implication is that you the viewer should go screw yourself if you think you have any right to criticize narcissistic wastefulness especially when there are wars going on. It's a perfect encapsulation of liberalism only things which directly harm other people are worth worrying about. It's hard to imagine a more trivial moral standard but there it is dressed up as radical chic. In the end there are only two types of people who enjoy this movie quirkaddicts who want a film to giggle over and leftist pseudointellectuals for whom nothing is too banal to justify in the name of rebellion.

It's an artsy film that is completely absurd nonsense and it's like a primer for filmmakers on how NOT to make a movie...and folks like the author of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die enjoy. I noticed that most of the reviews were by folks who enjoyed the movie and thought it brilliant...I just thought it stole about 75 minutes of my life.The script for the film is pretty much nonexistent. Instead two young women act like real jerks and bounce from one setting to another with little if any coherent rhyme or reason. They go on dates with older men and behave like pigs set fires blow bubbles annoy everyone around them interrupt night club acts take baths together talk INCESSANTLY and pretty much think they are the two most clever folks on the planet. To me it's like watching a couple 20somethings behave like they are 6 yearolds and the effect is really annoying.So should you see this film? Well if you've seen and enjoyed absurdist films like Buffet Froid or Pierrre le Fou or like taking LSD and then watching television test patterns by all means give the 'film' a try. As for me life is too short to waste seeing crap like this. The only possible good I can see with this film is that it obviously annoyed the repressive Czechoslovakian government when it debuted and it was labeled as 'depicting the wanton'. I would have described it as 'depicting the stupid'.".

They go on dates with older men and behave like pigs set fires blow bubbles annoy everyone around them interrupt night club acts take baths together talk INCESSANTLY and pretty much think they are the two most clever folks on the planet. To me it's like watching a couple 20somethings behave like they are 6 yearolds and the effect is really annoying.So should you see this film? Well if you've seen and enjoyed absurdist films like Buffet Froid or Pierrre le Fou or like taking LSD and then watching television test patterns by all means give the 'film' a try. As for me life is too short to waste seeing crap like this. The only possible good I can see with this film is that it obviously annoyed the repressive Czechoslovakian government when it debuted and it was labeled as 'depicting the wanton'. I would have described it as 'depicting the stupid'.";

Basically it's about the various antics and gags of two young women. The victims of their practical jokes tend to be established society in general which exists even in a socialist system as was Czechoslovakia at the time and older men in particular. Aggressively experimental the movie uses several types of film stocks even in a single scene as well as in your face editing cuts. There are several antiphallic gags with the girls cutting while giggling sausages bananas etc. as well as an apocalyptic food fight the girls seem to have a particular obsession with food. It's fun imaginative subversive but even at a running time of less than half an hour tiresome at times.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the strangest nonlinear films that I have ever seen and therefore it is one of the hardest films to comment on. After an excellent beginning montage sequence the film plunges into the world of two women who agree to be bad. The reason for this is supposedly that all else is bad in the world already so they should be bad too. The rest of the film involves them acting glutton especially when they are around men. So what is the meaning of this? Is it some feminist statement in which the women try to gain power by the way they eat? There are a lot of allusions to the male sexual organs that back up this theory but the real point of it all is still rather obscure. It is an interesting enough concept as it is but the downfall comes from the premise being stretched to the length of a feature film. While the excessiveness can be tolerated the same stuff is generally repeated over and over and there is little reason apparent why it could have not been done in just twenty minutes of film. As awkward and confusing as it is the length to which the material is stretched is what hammers is potency. Either way the film is certainly work a look. The colour work is fascinating the sound effects are interesting and it is an intriguing film to a limited extent due to the ambiguity of its messages and story.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was told by some film friends a few weeks back when asking about some good surrealist films not by Bunuel or Lynch to check out the 1966 Czech flick Daisies a film that's been out for a while thanks to Criterion. The cover itself looked promising and probably something I've passed more than once when in the video store bright colors a cute girl hey why not? This movie is... certainly something else. But what exactly I am not totally sure.Perhaps the film had a script  the film's director is also cowriter experimental filmmaker Vera Chytilova  but damn if I can tell from the look of this. A lot of Daisies seems to be shot and performed on the fly as though Chytilova were yelling out things to do on the spot for her girls and this is not uncommon on sets where the truly unusual is taking place. I wasn't sure at first what their names even were but apparently Ivana Karbanova and Jitka Cerhov both play characters named Marie that is Marie 1 and Marie 2. And their characters are... how can one distinguish them apart? They're both consumption machines  of food of themselves their selfindulgence as they talk and laugh in their bedroom or talk and laugh and do things out in the real world.The closest that we get to see anything outside of just pure Id from these gals is when one of them feels down after some guy on a farm doesn't notice them. The other thinks it's stupid to worry about it but the other can't let go... until the NEXT thing comes around! But really there are surreal touches here really outthere things that caught me offguard and not just the sudden color changes of the film stock which is fantastic but those moments where the director really lets things get wild. At one point the girls get a pair of scissors and chop off parts of their limbs. Don't worry no blood it's just their severed heads and limbs doing wacky things and then the film becomes bits and pieces of paper jangled together.There is a lot of experimental direction going on here and I know it's surely for a purpose of some kind. In later years Chytilova said the movie was a morality play about unabashed greed. That's fine. But it's such a strange sit because the film IS certainly satirical and yet the two characters barely have anyone else to bounce off of there are maybe one or two very brief scenes where older people maybe their parents appear while they're eating or acting their goofydippyWTF selves and at one point a boy calls on the telephone as they... cut up sausage and eggs and banana and almost cut off their toes and... yeah.It sounds crazy but I wish the movie were MORE surreal in a sense. There is still a kind of grounded reality that these girls are in and despite the attempts to make things deliberately madcap  sound effects of a typewriter not there making it into a musical number the cracking sounds at the start when the girls first appear and move like yes dolls  I also felt like the director was trying to get me on some level to see these as real people... sorta.Okay maybe not. But the point is this if it's really more of a supercartoonish satire of two laughing harpies who have no real direction and are symbols of something then there needs to be more 'there' there around them it could have gone longer if there were more characters around them but even at 73 minutes it goes on too long. If anything this reminded me most of the Czechwomen's60's take on Beavis and Butthead  yes those two ass wipes  who also were symbols meant to be made fun of not so much emulated and that was the point of that show. But amid the wanton destruction and the pursuits of pure adolescent Idness there were other people to make things a little more 'there' in what was going on. Daisies doesn't have that and frankly it gets exhausting after a while seeing the same loop of pointed but empty consumption.And I get it I do this is of its time and it's hard not to respect that. It really aims for the fences as far as doing something no one has seen before especially in a time and place where everything was still superrigid. If I'd seen this in the late 60's I'd be on my feet by the time the final text comes up which I'm not kidding dedicates the film to people who get upset only over a stompedupon bed of lettuce ! It's a wild time and I respect the hell out of it... on an intellectual level to be sure. But on an emotionalentertainment level the part where a film even this anarchic should count... nothing. That said it was obviously ludicrous though perhaps kind of poetic irony that the film got banned in its country for you know showing up the society it was in.".

The only trouble is that the fine line that exists between the dummy and the ventriloquist becomes much too fine.  Anthony Hopkins is really good as this shy awkward man slowly descending into a world of madness as great success looms over the horizon.  Hopkins also does the voice of the dummy Fats and lends his unique voice talents to create a very disturbing eerie screen presence. The dummy is in many ways larger than life and he steals almost every scene he is in.  No supernatural puppet coming to life here yet the character of CorkyHopkins gives his life to this dummy in a very unique way.  The film is suitably creepy with some very atmospheric shots.  As one reviewer noted the scene where Hopkins is to not speak through the dummy for five minutes is easily the best.  Each moment of that scene passed with incredible tension.  It is downright chilling in fact.  The other actors do very well. Burgess Meredith is made out to be much older that he was at the time and I think he did a fantastic job.  What can I say about AnnMargaret.  Stunning. She does a credible job acting and let's face it she looks like a million bucksshe even shows us more than expected as well. A spooky film and a great screen performance by a much younger Anthony Hopkins.".

It is downright chilling in fact.  The other actors do very well. Burgess Meredith is made out to be much older that he was at the time and I think he did a fantastic job.  What can I say about AnnMargaret.  Stunning. She does a credible job acting and let's face it she looks like a million bucksshe even shows us more than expected as well. A spooky film and a great screen performance by a much younger Anthony Hopkins.";

He retreats to a lakeside cabin owned by the woman he fell in love with as a teenager but things turn nasty. He is suffering from schizophrenia and uses the dummy to voice the things he can't bring himself to say. This is done superbly and Anthony Hopkins plays it all extremely convincingly. AnnMargret puts in a mostly believable performance too although at times she seems a little unlikely. It doesn't detract though her screen presence adds a lot to the movie and she looks radiant as ever. For a while when watching this film I had a horrible feeling that the dummy would turn out to have an intelligence of its own and would start walking around with a knife in its little wooden hands. Thankfully this doesn't happen and it's a much more sinister and impressive film for it. Overall this was surprisingly watchable well made and at times genuinely scary. The violence is filmed well and doesn't resort to bloodfests to get the message across. One of the few 70's horror flicks I've seen with good acting and a credible plot well worth watching!".

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Attenbourough has directed an intriguing and creepy little psychological thriller about a schizophrenic ventriloquist who 'splits' his identity with his dummy. Attenbourough has given a lot of attention to the setting creating an atmospheric effect such as the silent gloomy lake inhabited by snapping turtles and Corky's lonely cabin. The cinematography particularly the closeups are very impressive. 'Magic' is a simple film and while many have assumed that it's a horror film where the dummy is expected to become some kind of horrific entity as I thought that is not the case. Anthony Hopkins gives a stunning performance as the complex shy and lonely Corky who finally finds love and his manipulative dummy Fats. There are so many moments of his excellent acting. Some examples include the scene where Corky is subjected to 'stop being Fats' for 5 minutes the boat sequence and Hopkins's scenes with Ann Margret. Though he is more recognized for his 'chilling' Hannibal Lector persona 'Magic' definitely showcases one of his best performances. The sexy Ann Margret also does an excellent job as the love of Corky's life. She brings a lot of depth to Peggy and she shows more than expected. Burgess Meredith leaves a mark as Corky's concerned manager. Overall it's nice to see a different kind of Attenborough film. One that is quite well made and very well acted.".

It features Anthony Hopkins in the role of a shy ventriloquist named Corky Withers. Corky's act in which he uses a dummy to perform onstage magic tricks is an instant success. Corky is at height of his fame and probably a single step away from becoming an icon. But things are not as simple as they appear. Believe it or not but Corky's dummy Fats has developed a mind of its own! And Corky must learn to control it before it's too late. Anthony Hopkins I daresay delivers the best performance of his life. The role of Hannibal Lecter may have elevated Hopkins to apotheosis but Corky has a sense of vulnerability that makes it appear far more realistic than Lecter. A comparison between Lecter and Corky is inevitable for both the characters lie on the brink of insanity... while the former can control it to a great extent the latter is always at the mercy of his vicious alterego. Magic 1978 is a psychological thriller of the highest quality. And Hopkins' sublime portrayal makes it an experience of a lifetime. AnnMargret is brilliant in the role of Peggy Ann Snow. Burgess Meredith as Ben Greene virtually steals every scene that he is a part of.Magic 1978 is indeed magical.

Richard Attenborough direction is very surprising the sets are amazing. The lake that most of the film is taking place on is so peacfull and makes the film more disturbing also the NYC scene is done remarkebly well. I also love the film title scene which include some exposition about the magician in hand and also Corky Hopkins mentor which guide him into the magician  performing abilities. The films itself is moving nicely along and the story is very interesting and gripping. The resemblance between Corky and Fats The evil doll is very convincing and as the movie move forward they are getting more and more alike even dress the same.The reason I am giving this movie 6 stars is because I find Ann Margaret acting unconvincing and also the last 15 min of the film is a bit boring for me I think that it should end before. As a short story it would have been a pure masterpiece but hey it was already done before and in a much more frightening way so check out Dead of night and be prepered to be shocked.".

	onyx:emotionText "The reason for even watching this film is because of Hopkins appearance which I find well acted. It got some hint of his future Hanibal pereformance in Silence of the lambs. Richard Attenborough direction is very surprising the sets are amazing. The lake that most of the film is taking place on is so peacfull and makes the film more disturbing also the NYC scene is done remarkebly well. I also love the film title scene which include some exposition about the magician in hand and also Corky Hopkins mentor which guide him into the magician  performing abilities. The films itself is moving nicely along and the story is very interesting and gripping. The resemblance between Corky and Fats The evil doll is very convincing and as the movie move forward they are getting more and more alike even dress the same.The reason I am giving this movie 6 stars is because I find Ann Margaret acting unconvincing and also the last 15 min of the film is a bit boring for me I think that it should end before. As a short story it would have been a pure masterpiece but hey it was already done before and in a much more frightening way so check out Dead of night and be prepered to be shocked.";

This is his best work as a director probably because as a good actor he realized the potential of the story that survives on the acting skills of the lead player. Attenborough's job was easy once he had a consummate actor in Anthony Hopkins to play the key role and provide the distinct voice of the dummy.  This film's highlights are the performances of Hopkins Burgess Meredith and AnnMargaret in that order. Hopkins has matured over the years and in recent films like Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs is arresting to watch. Yet in Magic Attenborough is able to extract a superb performance in an otherwise aboveaverage film. The sequence between Hopkins and Meredith where the dummy has to keep quiet for 5 minutes is the highlight of the film. Equally interesting is the editing by John Bloom of the two knifing sequences. To sum up the acting the lowbudget direction superior compared to Gandhi and A Bridge too Far and the editing are the departments that are commendable in this film.".

Moreover I even think it probably is even better than Hopkins's Oscarwinning turn as Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs. The reason I say that is because Hopkins's in the latter film was rather hammy and way way overthetop but then maybe that was the kind of performance the director wanted. But Hopkins's performance in Magic is understated almost to the point of numbness and yet that is what I felt was so brilliant about it. The scene where Hopkins's manager Burgess Meredith forces Hopkins and the dummy not to utter a single word in the space of five minutes is one of the single most suspenseful scenes ever committed to celluloid. And although the time goes by slowly the suspense keeps building and building and you can actually see the inner pain that expresses itself onto Hopkins's face. That scene alone is worth seeing the picture for. And while I love AnnMargret she is basically window dressing here but then who cares when she is so great just to look at anyway.".

He can't handle the pressure and flees to the countryside where he meets his longlost high school dreamgirl. Meanwhile he becomes more and more obsessed by his voice tubedummy Fats. The idea of evil ventriloquist dummies might not be new The Great Gabbo Dead of Night but 'Magic' is neatly elaborated and very wellacted. Unfortunately it hurt seeing AnnMargret so underused!

	schema:reviewBody "The ventriloquist dummy is a popular horror prop ever since Dead of Night in 1945 the ventriloquist dummy has popped up in a number of films and Magic is one of the most classy and high quality. However it's not necessarily one of the best as while the acting is good and Richard Attenborough manages to create just the right tone and atmosphere for the film something about it severely lacking. The tagline bills it as a 'love story' and this would appear to sum up Magic's problems  it doesn't really know what it wants to be! The relationship between the ventriloquist and his dummy is build up as antagonistic until the very end and by then it feels out place. The plot focuses on Corky a magician who isn't all that good. But when he teams up with a wooden dummy named Fats the crowd begins to love him. However the fame starts to go to him and he soon finds that he can't turn the dummy 'off'. He goes and finds his high school sweetheart and the two start to get on well but it's not long before his fame comes looking for him and the dummy shows its murderous side.Anthony Hopkins is clearly one of the acting greats and while this film came earlier than his more memorable performances in movies such as The Silence of the Lambs and The Elephant Man it's still obvious that Hopkins is a master of his trade. The film comes across as a high quality piece but somehow this doesn't apply to the plotting as there are some very questionable character actions and events and while this may be OK in another film the fact that this one obviously wants to rise above the low quality horror films means that it's hard to ignore. Magic isn't particularly nasty there are a couple of death scenes but the blood is kept to a minimum and again this seems like Attenborough was trying not to make the film seem cheap and tacky. Most of the horror comes from the dummy Anthony Hopkins does Fats' voice and it's not far from being the most piercing and haunting horror vocal of all time which is the film's main credit. Overall Magic certainly isn't a bad film it's worth watching for sure but unfortunately it's not as great as it could have been.".

The crux as far as the audience is concerned of course is whether there is something supernatural going on or whether the vent is nuttier than a sack of almonds.It doesn't matter does it? The journey is what is important and the journey here is great fun.And Hopkins is superb. There is a scene towards the end where the struggle between Corky and Fats reaches its climax and we see who is in charge. It is a scene where the performance could see easily go over the top which would diminish the impact. Hopkins exercises restraint and produces a sequence which I found terrifying.AnnMargaret and Burgess Meredith are both also very good and credit must go to Richard Attenborough for taut direction in a piece which is not typical of his output.".

There has been quite a few 'nice doll coming alive and killing people' films like Child's Play for instance but Magic is the best it has every thing like I said about the deaths and the plot it all fits together into a great film.Oh yeah and I like the ending too I mean when I first watched it I thought that Corky Anthony Hopkins actually killed Peggy but instead he killed himself its quite sad actually.Poor Corky. 1010".

As Corky descends further into madness he struggles to free himself from the deadly hold Fats now possesses over him posing the question Who is truly the puppet? Anthony Hopkins portrays Corky brilliantly and the movie is certainly creepy but it fails to develop the character of Corky enough to fully express the personal struggle between the man and his psychosis.

When asked to give a health test in order to sign on for a lucrative TV deal he refuses and runs away. He stays at an isolated island as a paying guest with his now unhappily married college crush  played by AnnMargret. As romance starts to blossom the Fats side of Hopkins personality also starts to take over.Magic reminded me of The Wicker Man  a low budget but chilling Brit horror flick. To be honest I thought Magic was the better of the two. The similarities it shares with Wicker Man are low budget reliance on atmosphere relative realism for the horror genre a macabre performance by the leading man HopkinsChristopher Lee respectively and an isolated setting close to the sea. Magic draws the viewer in more because of Hopkins performance which shows likability and vulnerability. 60's sex symbol AnnMargret a talented actress has yet another small role that completely under utilises her.I can't understand the reason for the low rating on IMDb and obscurity of this film. Even after Hopkins carved out a name for himself in the celebrated horror movie Silence of the Lambs this was never revisited.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot is extremely weak and highly unoriginal. It goes a little like this1.Father was killed by bad guy 2.Revenge attempt 1  failure 3.Withdraw to the forest 4.Meet some imaginary kungfu masters  now this is original  kungfu masters in your head 5.Train for years. 6.Revenge attempt 2  success.The logic of this movie has been brutally murdered. I was so discontented when Yi Su's wife died in the most ridiculous way she was buried alive in a wooden box for like 10 minutes max. When Su and little Feng were digging the box up she was shown to be alive though weak. The box wasn't buried that deep at all. When the box was finally dugg up in less than 3 minutes she just kinda fell into a coma and instead of performing CPR on his wife Su sat there and cried which ultimately led to his wife's tragic death! !?God of Wushu was inspired by Monkey King but his attire is laughable.The end was really what killed the movie. It was just plain stupid. The clich goes as follow foreigners invaded the land arenas were built foreign fighters challenged and whooped China men'sasses like some bad jokes. This has been seen way too many time in martial art movies on the top of my head are Fearless and Ip man both are very good movies though. Foreign fighters are depicted as typical brainless giants with massive muscles. Beggarformermaster Su was forced to enter the ring because some white dude held little Feng captive and threatened his safety. He managed to beat the crap out of everyone of them...all at once but it was a struggled fight and Su was badly wounded. OK think of it this way Su trained rigorously in the esoteric ancient Chinese wushu and evidently had reached a total new realm of mastery because he defeated his arch nemesis  Yuan. Yuan was the main antagonist. And note this Yuan is freaking strong and viciously evil with all those mighty wuxia's feature  the deadly five venom fist bullet proofedarmored skin maneuver updown the well with ease flyinglevitating all over the places crazily strong etc. And yes Su beat this fool but he barely can handle a bunch of meat bags who practice the conventional wrestling the WWE kind and standard martial arts of MMA and. They have zero kungfuwuxia's power or anything. They shouldn't even equate Su's warmup routines but they almost got Su killed. I just don't follow. The plot was just blah and bleh the fighting scenes were nothing spectacular either. It contained useless and stupid dialogue i love you our family must stay together forever we must save our son etc.. This was a watchoncenevertouchedagain kind of movie heck how did i manage to finish the movie. Oh and the CGIs were abused too much. Not even good CGIs. They were so fake unnecessary and add absolutely no value to the movie as a whole. I'm a fan of Yuen Wooping. I love Wuxia and Chinese martial art genre but this movie was very badly made. Sorry Yuen Wooping could have done much much better! I'm thoroughly disappointed.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review True Legend";
	schema:reviewBody "Chinese martial arts films have no lack of material to adapt with folk heroes and legendary characters making that leap from history to film with the latest being Ip Man and we all know how well that turned out for Donnie Yen. In fact I'd like to think True Legend provided the perfect opportunity for Vincent Zhao to shine especially since his Su Chan does battle using a vast array of weapons some real some CGed and his Beggar Su well executing his famous technique. From the get go the film is action packed almost all the way battling it out on some amazingly created landscapes such as dark underground dungeons a deep well atop some mean looking mountainous statues and in a gladiatorial arena. As this version of the story goes it's about the downfall of Su Chan and his transformation of Beggar Su. As one of the Imperial Guards Su Chan gains favour with the Prince for his many successful exploits the most recent being a rescue mission but he has a higher calling in life deciding to dedicate his life to his family the opening of a martial arts school and the seeking of a higher form of martial arts. However his sworn brother Yuan Lie Andy On decides to exact revenge because of the sins of their fathers and soundly defeats Su Chan because of his mastery of a deadly black arts called the Five Venom Palm which comes complete with an extreme creation of a handsewn armour into his body. In any case True Legend is actually two stories in one. The first story tells the portion of Su Chan's transformation to Beggar Chan which is split into 3 acts the first which is the obligatory background story then followed by his recovery and training ending off with revenge which provided a full load of action upon action. The second part however turned out to be a rehash of Fearless and whichever film that had been set in the Chinese era of the onslaught of foreign powers and an arena is used to settle differences. The narrative though still came through as choppy with scenes that seemed a little out of place based on some questionably straightforward editing to splice scenes together but the one that takes the cake happens to be the irritating edits to the more brutal scenes in the second half of the film. Fearless was rated NC16 and the fights especially killing blows were left intact. With a PG rating for this expect plenty of little bits to be snipped off which was really disturbing as edits were made every few bloody seconds no thanks to Beggar Su having to settle a Royal Rumble type of battle. So you have now been warned.There are however some positives to be taken away from the film and that comes from the array of stars who got attached to the project. Zhou Xun is a fine actress and her presence here provided that well needed contrast of acting ability compensating for the lack thereof in Zhao's starring as Su Chan's wife Ying the pillar of strength confidence and hope. Andy On played Yuan Lie with enough creepiness and ruthlessness that he may be one of the more memorable martial arts villains amongst recent kung fu films adding to that his treading the extremely thin line of incest as well with Ying in wanting to be together forever with her.But it's the supporting cast of a notable who's who in the Chinese martial arts arena that had me excited. Imagine having the likes of Gordon Liu as Old Sage the late David Carradine and Michelle Yeoh as Physician Yu all in one film and more exasperatingly none of them had anything remotely kung fu to do save for floating atop grasslands and Yeoh even being cast as a healer. Each of them being in martial arts or related films for a significant time in their respective careers don't get to do what they're famed for. Instead a lot of martial arts fighting went to Jay Chou as God of Martial Arts!! which I suppose could have served as training ground prior to this Kato role in The Green Hornet. To give him credit Chou still has what it takes to deliver his martial arts moves quite convincingly and that's basically all that he does though bound to elicit a chuckle or two for his ridiculous get up.Something that is a little more strange is how acclaimed director Feng Xiaogang got his name in the acting credits as a pickpocket but a character which didn't appear in the movie proper at all opting instead to have a scene being featured for a few seconds during the end credit role which seemed more like a deleted scene meant for the DVD. Only time will tell on this aspect and made it seem that To Chilong's screenplay contained dispensable elements as do a few missteps that made its way on screen.It's been a long while since Yuen Woo Ping helmed a film as a director and here he applied plenty of wirefu liberally to craft a film that provided for some fantastical elements in its martial arts. Despite the hard hitting action ultimately it was let down by a less than coherent storyline and the distributors here who opted for a lower rating to entice the holiday crowd butchering the only saving grace of the film which are the fight sequences.".

It blended some classic and modern approaches.Even if it had wirefu wushu computer animated action sequences at times that isn't something I am particularly prejudiced against. What really matters is good story telling and writing and acting and well...many things etc. The lead actor and actress I thought were really great at times and I definitely have to contribute that to the director's credit especially since he has a lot more experience than them. Holy sweetness! Gordon Liu Michelle Yeoh and David Carradine!? Great to get to see them all act they were all superb even though they weren't the main stars. Seriously how does Carradine keep coming out with all these posthumous films? Did he make a robot clone? Costumes music action choreography makeup lighting sound casting animetors etc. all of these people came together and did amazingly fantastic jobs to make the picture as a whole really a superb film. There were some very nice nature images that were quite artfully done almost like a master painter's ink brushstroke. The story was captivating. I didn't think I felt like it ever really began to drag on too long at any one time the way many other films seem to do. Everything about it is really great. I highly suggest this film to everyone!The fact that most Americans still have not heard of this movie truly blows my mind. It needs to be in theaters immediately!".

	schema:reviewBody "Americans have grown accustomed to a certain kind of Chinese martial arts film. Ever since Crouching Tiger the Chinese MA film has gotten more attention beyond whatever Hollywood effort is churned out to force a Jet Li or Jackie Chan subpar effort on American audiences. Crouching Tiger was followed by films like House of Flying Daggers and Hero while those with bigger interests in the subject certainly sought out more films that most Americans might not know.True Legend seems to pick up on this. Yuen Wo Ping who is no stranger to Hollywood martial arts films having dabbled his hand in a number of Hollywood efforts seems to have taken some of what he's done for American audiences and applied it to this film. He has after all been attached to several big U.S. productions most notably Kill Bill and The Matrix series of films. These and other notable Chinese MA films which saw American audiences between True Legend and his last directorial effort Tai Chi Boxer 1996. So it may not be surprising that he's incorporated some more Western friendly elements. That may be far reaching but True Legend is certainly no traditional Martial Arts film.For Chinese MA fans this is a mixed bag. It starts out with several powerful action sequences the most notable being the opening rescue scene. Sadly this is Ping putting his best foot forward and the film never truly rises above it in terms of impressive action. That doesn't mean the film doesn't contain some other outstanding scenes that at least left me with a few 'oh snap' moments. And the combination of fantasy elements that you might see in older films like the 5 Venom Fist style MA and more modern concepts like mixing break dancing with drunken fist boxing give the film it's own identity. Sadly this creates a bit of an identity crises. We're given a historical context for the film and the story presents itself similarly to Fearless another MA biopic but the film isn't grounded in reality and some strange turns are taken those most notable being main character Su's encounter with The Wushu God. It's a bizarre CGI heavy intermission between the more grounded first and final acts. But the entire tone of the film seems to be a mix of the two the more traditional Chinese MA film and the modern special effects and wire laden Chinese MA film the kind that Western audiences might be more accustomed to. And reading about the production of the film you can certainly see that Ping did want to go beyond the traditional film to create something more modern.Despite this seemingly jumbled style the film is full of Ping's mastery. Fantastic camera work editing and special effects add to the impressive set pieces and choreographed action sequences. Again there are a ton of 'oh snap' moments and in a MA film that is a wonderful thing to have. The opening scene is an incredible display of talent action special effects and choreography that will most likely go down as one of the great modern MA action scenes. There are plenty of other fantastic action sequences and thankfully Ping knows how to shoot a proper action scene as opposed to so many other directors who think all the action has to be confusing and up close and all the editors who think that it requires cuts by the second. This film reaffirms that even after all these years Ping can still produce something that is entertaining and exciting that he is still a master of the MA sequence.Whether you enjoy this film or not will depend entirely on how much you can enjoy the fairly odd mix of styles along with the inclusion of a fifth act to end the film. It does take a bit of a right turn with the final act but it's none the less very entertaining and includes a cameo most likely our last glimpse of David Carradine who you might know worked with Ping on Kill Bill. However I would recommend this film to any MA fan. It's unique blend of quirky style fantastic action and masterful filming technique all make up one entertaining Chinese MA.".

The story is very simple but who cares? If you look for a movie with a good story i could recommend you house of flying daggers. This is a movie where you find some beautiful and stunning fighting scenes. Kungfu fans would love to see this movie.";

Unfortunately it seems that the legendary action choreographer has failed to utilise the new technology with any sense of skill and has also lost his way somewhat in the plot department.The film follows Vincent Zhao as Beggar Su a fabled folk hero in China and creator of the legendary Drunken Fist style. After his father is killed by his brotherinlaw Su goes into hiding where he is trained by an unconventional Wushu master. It's a bog standard kung fu murderrevenge plot that's been done a million times before but now with the novelty of teeth grindingly bad 3D. The new technology  only used in selected scenes  is jarring and in no way immersive adding a strong argument to the negative effect 3D can have on a film.However as messy as the 3D is it is not as detracting as the final third of the film. After concluding the revenge plot it suddenly shifts into a completely new narrative regarding western imperialism's encroachment on Chinese culture. It's an untidy mixture of Jet Li's Fearless with Jackie Chan's Drunken Master with an all too brief cameo by the late David Carradine.Ultimately TRUE LEGEND is a disorganised film that poorly uses every martial arts clich in the book. A couple of decent action sequences aside there is little to recommend even to the most avid kung fu fan. 3 out of 5Cambridge Film Festival Daily".

Vincent Zhao is the titular hero who after rescuing a kidnapped prince returns home to his wife Ying Zhou Xun and young son rather than becoming a governor as the prince offers in reward for his service. Instead he hands the governorship over to his foster brother Yuan Andy On thinking to share his good fortune with the man he thinks of as a brother and who is in fact Ying's actual brother. He doesn't realize that Yuan is full of hatred and vengeful feelings for Su's family because Su's father had killed Yuan's real father many years earlier to prevent that rampaging man from killing more innocent people. Five years later Yuan has control of an army and he is seeking vengeance....That is only the opening section of this film directed by Yuen WooPing who is best known in the West for choreographing the fight scenes in The Matrix and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. True Legend is full of fight scenes some of the quite funny some of them quite beautiful and it is also full of cameos of kung fu superstars such as Gordon Liu Michelle Yeoh and in his last role David Carradine. I find that a little kung fu fighting goes a long way but if you're going to see a kung fu film you couldn't find better than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me clear from the start by saying that the action is top notch. Only for that does this movie deserve credit. The story in itself was a bit over dramatic and didn't flow that well. And if you bothered to get into the story it will depress you a little. It looked like Woo Ping wanted to created a new hero similar to Wong Fei Hung and partly he succeeded. Vincent Zhao who is terrific plays a skilled General who loves his family. When he gets betrayed and defeated by his adopted brother he seems to have lost his confidence in his abilities. So far nothing new. And it is fun to see him regaining his confidence in the fantasy sequences. However at one point his wife sees him training and is afraid that her husband has gone mad. So she goes to rescue her son all by herself and a big fight occurs between the adopter brother and Zhao. This right here should be the finale.Spoilers But for some reason it continues and the whole confidencemotivation problem occurs yet again.Zhao has become a drunkard and is neglecting his son. The reason for drinking apart from the obvious also has another reason which is explained. He drinks the wine that is made by his wife so that he can feel her. This is actually very sweet and romantic. His attitude towards is son however is very selfish. How many times does this man has to learn the same lesson. Until this tournament comes into play.Need I go on. The tournament sequence while very enjoyable seemed so out of place and story. I get the feeling they were trying to do too much in this movie or that they tried to fill two movies into one. While I appreciate the attempt in telling a touching story it is very flawed and depressing. But do yourself a favor and forget about the story and focus on the action which is superb. Don't worry about the CGIthere is very little of it and the CGI that is used intensifies some of the action.".

So as always when watching a movie of this nature I take it for what it is so that way I'm not undermining my enjoyment of the film. I bought the DVD and watched it in it's entirety to include the special features. It's amazing footage of the Chinese countryside and mountain scenery was very attractive to say nothing of beautiful. Granted some of the CGI could have been done better but hey the guy was basically in a dream state or you could just say he was hallucinating. Even though the film did show what he was actually doing the utilization of the wire for some of the stunts were moderately appropriate for what they were trying to depict.The story of the main character involves tragedy. While the main hero wallows in self pitymisery after losing his beloved wife I would like to think it brings some sense of realism into the movie as opposed to having it be any negative aspect. Afterall don't we as humans tend to wallow in self pity and misery at times? Some may but I dare anyone to say they don't know or haven't seen anyone who didn't. The nemesis in the movie was depicted in a fantasy type manner with what he had to go to gain his noted ability of manipulating and controlling poison. But I took it as theatrics. Maybe it was a little cheesy now that I think of it. But then again it's just a movie. A concept that I find that is lost and no longer understood these days whenever I read certain reviews in newspapers.Corruption misguidedness misappropriation of blame and reprehensible acts are the foundation of the plot itself. It would also include the strong will of the human nature to survive and protect as best we can those that we love. Granted I will say the plot is something that is common in tragedies but they did the best they could even though I'm sure they could have done better on the acting for some of the characters. The fight scenes were spectacular and well done. For that alone if you're wanting a good martial arts flick solely for the fight scenes and you don't really care about the inbetweens of them then this movie will entertain you.If you chance upon the DVD I would suggest checking out the special features section.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tagline Yuen Woo Ping tries hard and manages to entertain in an uneven manner...It's been too long since The Blade's Vincent Zhao last cinematic venture. The lad for all his worth was groomed to be Jet Li's successor. For whatever reason he disappeared off the radar and wandered into the wilderness of mainland television. Zhao lacks the onscreen charisma or likable good looks of Jet Li but there is no doubting of his martial arts ability and his physical presence is comparable to Donnie Yen. Many would probably have forgotten that Zhao's career got off to a storming start by simply existing under the shadows of Jet Li in roles like Wong Fei Hung and the villain in Fong Sai Yuk before embarking on the cult classic lead role in The Blade. Impressive resume one might assume. So instead of rambling on about past laurels Zhao makes a stunning return and one might just assume his career is on the rebound.The movie goes like this Beggar So Vincent Zhao is army general but gives up the position for family life. Beggar So gives all his status to his adopted brother Andy On and lived a life of an ordinary person. Until one day Andy On returns home and killed Zhao's father Leung KaYan in avenging On's own nemesis. The result is Beggar So escaping alive with his wife waiting for an opportunity to strike back.Director Yuen Woo Ping is obviously in top form and there are a number of action sequences that are original enough for a mention. The fight in the snake well between On and Zhao is both innovative and fun. Hong Kong no longer has a huge luxury of upcoming kung fu star. While Vincent Zhao isn't exactly in his twenties but he is still young enough to relaunch a career and with a bit of luck he may even be able to match the reinvention successes of a similar counterpart in Donnie Yen. Sure Zhao can't act and when he tries more than often he is overacting in the famous Yen's style. It remains to be seen if Zhao is given a better material he will be able to embrace it as his own.As usual Zhou Xun is a wonderful actress of both quality and presence. While not exactly a conventional beaut Xun is one heck of an actress that makes the unnatural natural. She have been constantly stealing the show in numerous epics starring as side characters but in all honestly her acting ability is second to none in the current HK cinema. In fact when considered on a whole Xun is given a paper thin role with nothing to work with yet somehow she manages to impress engage and express.Moving on to Andy On he is certainly a case of missing in action. For the past decade since his terrible debut in Black Mask 2 Andy On has showed himself to be a decent supporting actor. In fact he was the best thing in 2003's Star Runner decent showdown against Jackie Chan in New Police Story. However since then he has been almost unnoticeable in all circumstances. Perhaps True Legend is what you call a relaunch of young Andy's career. While he does have some screen presence to a certain degree his acting is too one dimensional and his villainous turn is neither memorable nor effective. The kid got martial arts potential let's just hope he is not suitability wasted away.All in all True Legend is a welcome additional to modern day HK martial arts cinema. While the 3rd act may seem like a remake of Fearless and the film suffers from some obvious coherence and uneven issues. Namely the frequently fast forward style of editing making days goes by as fast as years. Director Yuen Woo Ping does compensate this by some blood crunching action display and even if it is a carbon copy of Fearless in the third act there is no doubt that Yuen is simply taking a leaf out of his previous efforts. One may wonder if the film simply ended in the 2nd act it may well be more coherent but for me it would have left me halfbaked. So honestly True Legend really isn't that bad and in fact it is quite a decent film with some good parts in between. A welcome return for Shaw Brothers and to a larger extent Mr. Vincent Zhao...Neo 2010 I rate it 710www.thehkneo.com".

A welcome return for Shaw Brothers and to a larger extent Mr. Vincent Zhao...Neo 2010 I rate it 710www.thehkneo.com";

Some of the acting is a bit overthetop but for the most part I thought it was welldone. Yes it is very similar to the Ip Man movies. The final scenes of True Legend are VERY similar to the final scenes of Ip Man 2.Sadly the only major criticism I have of this movie is David Carradine. Glad this wasn't his last film...it would have been a terrible way to go out. His performance was completely overthetop and very unbelievable. The scenes with him almost ruined the whole movie for me but overall True Legend was a fun experience for me.".

But after seeing this film I came to understand that Drunken Boxing has its place among the ideals between the masters. Su Can Man Cheuk Cheiu an ex general who led many countless battles to victory dreams of settling down with his son and his wife. But through sheer happenstance his adopted brother takes his revenge on Su's father for killing his own father in previous years before. Now with a new battle ahead Su must save his son from the clutches of his step brother Yuan Ying Xun Zhou. Except his step brother has mastered a martial art called the five venom fist. A technique that uses poison in battle. All seemed lost until he comes across in exile with his wife two beings called the god of Wushu Jay Chou to learn even further and hone his martial skills. And an old sage drunk Gordon Liu who I thought was a great addition to the team. Although I wanted to see more of Gordon the story however revolves around Su's well being and state of mind. During his exile and his retraining with the gods his wife has seen that he might be losing his mind. She has seen that he trains by himself and makes the wounds to look like he has taken on the gods. She leaves to find their son and in so doing Su finally takes his revenge on his step brother after his wife writes him a letter on her voyage. Now with a new resolve he finds and fights Yuan and defeats him but all for nothing since Yuan buried his wife in a box. Now with her death even after finding her he loses all hope and falls again to the wine. With his son beside him they come across a deadly battle for which men get killed. Now an old friend named Ma Quing Feng Xiaodong Guo must fight for his life and attain fame to call himself the best Wushu martial artist. But to battle wrestlers is another thing altogether. Now with a mean spirited team Captain The Late David Carradine Ma faces his toughest challenge. But as he sees his defeat in the midst Su comes to the rescue with his patented Drunken Style which vanquishes the enemy team. A great and Wonderful display of martial arts since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Or Ip man. Michell Yeoh is as always such an attractive addition to any film that graces the silver screen. Her abilities of acting is next to none but sad to see her as only a doctor. I would have loved to see her in action once again. But I guess it wasn't in the cards this time around. All in all a great film excellent music and beautiful styles of fighting I have ever seen for some time. Yuen Wo Ping really delivers. A must see.".

It's not quite developed enough though. In fact it feels like the fightscenes had priority over the story. Had the priority between story and fightscenes been shifted the other way around I think this movie might have been topleague.When you've seen blood splatter out the mouth of some poor kungfublasted victim for the umpteenth time it gets to be a bit of a clich. The fightscenes weren't badly done there was just way too much of it.The movie feels a bit rushed like there perhaps wasn't enough time to finish it properly. A bit like hurry up we haven't got all day just wrap it up as it is and hope nobody will notice the slack and don't worry if it's halffinished we'll just throw in another fightscene and call it a day. That detracted quite a bit. I wouldn't go so far as to say it had the Hollywood massproduction feel to it but neither did it achieve the trueart feeling that the 3 masterpieces I mention at the top has.Still it is a moving film that did indeed manage to pull on the heartstrings.

	schema:headline " Great wushu ruined by an absolute lack of direction and the most useless ending ever";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start off my review with the good part the wushu and action is brilliantly choreographed. It's not particularly overthetop or flashy but a more classic take on martial arts and one of the best i've seen in a while.However the whole of the movie has no idea what the hell it is doing. There are essentially three arcs in this movie. 1 Short builds up the character 2 The vast majority of the movie and with the real plot 3 What the hell?In fact let me qualify. The first and second arc together would be quite good alone if the third was not a part of the movie. Su respected soldier declines an offer to become governor and instead settles down with his pretty wife and has a kid. He recommends his foster brother Yuan  also his wife's brother  to the post and leaves hoping his foster brother will be happy Yuan has always seen himself living in Su's shadow. A few years later unfortunately Yuan is a bitter man and comes to kill Su and his foster father after perfecting the evil Five Venom Fists and kidnaps Su's kid. Su ends up on a mountain with his wife training to right the wrongs. Nothing brilliant but oftentimes wushu movies are not the most plot driven so it's OK. And i'll admit that the plot actually had me interested even though it was fairly corny i was under the impression that it was kind of a feel good movie with lots of ass kicking.The problem arises with the ending of the second arc and the beginning of the third into the end. You would think the second arc would end in a certain way to avoid spoilers given the way the whole movie works. But it ends unfittingly dissatisfying for no particular reason. And i This was absolutely not a movie that should have had the ending it did for the second arc. In fact excepting the very ending and the third arc the fighting and the acting were good enough that i considered giving this movie an 8 because it was simply very solid for what it tried to be until it started to be idiotic. There were even elements of plot that could have been more interesting and explored further i thought but ultimately were cast aside lazily. Primarily i refer to Su meeting one God of Wushu as he trains on the mountain. His encounter not only appears entirely ridiculous  it's made apparent that actually Su is going insane and instead of having found a master of martial arts is instead getting extremely drunk and rolls around injuring himself. At the same time however you know that Su will eventually go to fight his brother to reclaim his son so there's actually a bit of potential  the movie has definitive elements of the fantastical already so i was willing to accept some sort of Wushu god plot line or perhaps some sort of revelationepic training thing  but no apparently Su IS insane yet apparently his drunken rolling has actually turned him into the master of kungfu he was deluded about? It would work if there was some sort of element of the God of Wushu being NOT a total delusion but in fact he was and we are even shown Su rolling around like a drunk  so it really makes no sense.And that is really the crux of the problem with the movie  again it has no idea what it wants to be. It's as if the screenwriter had a brilliant idea but decided he didn't really give a damn about it making sense 45 the way through. I'll try and make an analogy say you are skiing down a slope. It's a double black diamond  steep mogul covered all that jazz  and you have wrecked the slope looking great the whole way down. At the end as you enter the flat part of the mountain just coasting to a stop you suddenly fall down and break your leg  and then deciding that you might as well beat yourself to death. Really it's an achievement in the sense that i have rarely seen a movie fall so hard on its face so quickly.Anyways this indecision leads into the absurd third act. Aside from the fact that the movie should have ended prior it has nothing to do with the first or second arc plotwise or thematically and offers nothing worthwhile. It also indulges into stupid stereotypes clichs and just is all around terrible as well as having this sort of strange funny or serious or what the hell is this? atmosphere. I wrote this review with the hopes that i could describe how bad the movie becomes but I sincerely believe i could write a legitimate college thesis on it and am unable to do so in this review. This review probably sounds very harsh but again it's really the last fifteentwenty minutes that ruin the movie and it's still boggling my mind. If you wanted to see the film already don't let this deter you  see it  what's good is quite good but simply be prepared for the awful conclusion. In fact you may want to consider turning it off after the second arc and pretending the second arc ended the way it should have because it doesn't.This review ended up being a lot more jumbled and unclear than i had thought it would but i can only hope that my sense of confusion enlightens you as to the confusion that the movie will bestow upon you.".

A few years later unfortunately Yuan is a bitter man and comes to kill Su and his foster father after perfecting the evil Five Venom Fists and kidnaps Su's kid. Su ends up on a mountain with his wife training to right the wrongs. Nothing brilliant but oftentimes wushu movies are not the most plot driven so it's OK. And i'll admit that the plot actually had me interested even though it was fairly corny i was under the impression that it was kind of a feel good movie with lots of ass kicking.The problem arises with the ending of the second arc and the beginning of the third into the end. You would think the second arc would end in a certain way to avoid spoilers given the way the whole movie works. But it ends unfittingly dissatisfying for no particular reason. And i This was absolutely not a movie that should have had the ending it did for the second arc. In fact excepting the very ending and the third arc the fighting and the acting were good enough that i considered giving this movie an 8 because it was simply very solid for what it tried to be until it started to be idiotic. There were even elements of plot that could have been more interesting and explored further i thought but ultimately were cast aside lazily. Primarily i refer to Su meeting one God of Wushu as he trains on the mountain. His encounter not only appears entirely ridiculous  it's made apparent that actually Su is going insane and instead of having found a master of martial arts is instead getting extremely drunk and rolls around injuring himself. At the same time however you know that Su will eventually go to fight his brother to reclaim his son so there's actually a bit of potential  the movie has definitive elements of the fantastical already so i was willing to accept some sort of Wushu god plot line or perhaps some sort of revelationepic training thing  but no apparently Su IS insane yet apparently his drunken rolling has actually turned him into the master of kungfu he was deluded about? It would work if there was some sort of element of the God of Wushu being NOT a total delusion but in fact he was and we are even shown Su rolling around like a drunk  so it really makes no sense.And that is really the crux of the problem with the movie  again it has no idea what it wants to be. It's as if the screenwriter had a brilliant idea but decided he didn't really give a damn about it making sense 45 the way through. I'll try and make an analogy say you are skiing down a slope. It's a double black diamond  steep mogul covered all that jazz  and you have wrecked the slope looking great the whole way down. At the end as you enter the flat part of the mountain just coasting to a stop you suddenly fall down and break your leg  and then deciding that you might as well beat yourself to death. Really it's an achievement in the sense that i have rarely seen a movie fall so hard on its face so quickly.Anyways this indecision leads into the absurd third act. Aside from the fact that the movie should have ended prior it has nothing to do with the first or second arc plotwise or thematically and offers nothing worthwhile. It also indulges into stupid stereotypes clichs and just is all around terrible as well as having this sort of strange funny or serious or what the hell is this? atmosphere. I wrote this review with the hopes that i could describe how bad the movie becomes but I sincerely believe i could write a legitimate college thesis on it and am unable to do so in this review. This review probably sounds very harsh but again it's really the last fifteentwenty minutes that ruin the movie and it's still boggling my mind. If you wanted to see the film already don't let this deter you  see it  what's good is quite good but simply be prepared for the awful conclusion. In fact you may want to consider turning it off after the second arc and pretending the second arc ended the way it should have because it doesn't.This review ended up being a lot more jumbled and unclear than i had thought it would but i can only hope that my sense of confusion enlightens you as to the confusion that the movie will bestow upon you.";

	schema:headline " Shouldn't have tried tried too hard to make this movie seem more epic than it really is";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those KungFu movie where the plot isn't all that effective but the fighting sequences makes up for it. From what I heard this is a Chinese folklore tale style of story and the direction and many different sequences make it seem like it. The fighting sequences makes the characters seem superhuman which is typical for these types of genre in china but doesn't go all that overboard with it in most scenes although still not believable at all. It does feature typical special fighting moves in this such as the Five Venom Fists. I found it kinda funny however how you can tell who the good guys are and who the villains are right off the bat because of the way they look. It just seemed a bit too generic for example with the dark spiky clothes and pale skin. Despite the plot not being all that great and the pacing a bit off the fight sequences are top notch in this and very entertaining to watch. The fight choreography is very well crafted in this and will make a lot of the audiences have there eyes glued to the screen. Yes there is use of CGI in this but it isn't used way too much to the point it gets irritating to watch in this type of movies. On a negative note this movie goes in a direction where it tries a bit too hard to look epic. Especially when it comes to the plot it doesn't have to be slightly convoluted cause when it comes down to it it's a simple story. But it tries to make it seem more than what it is maybe because the plot is a bit too narrow which isn't a good thing. Because it throws the good pacing off of the whole progression of the film. Also like some of the reviewers are saying the bit of incest is kinda awkward in this because the characters just seem to be fine with it. Anyways overall this is a good martial arts flick where there is hardly a dull moment and any fan of this type of genre should check it out. Like I said the plot isn't anything outstanding but I am giving this movie a 6.5 because the entertainment value of it all is pretty darn high.6.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Contains Spoiler I read some of the comments registered here on The Way We Were and felt I needed to add my comments.First of all I think a lot of people are viewing this movie through politically correct 21st century eyes.Comments have been made about Redford's character abandoning his kid after he splits with Streisand's character at the end of the movie. However the movie implies that Streisand's character moves from California back to New York while Redford's character stays in sunny Hollywood. If this were the case back in the 1940s it was not as common for people to hop on a plane going from coast to coast. It would not be uncommon at that time for a woman to remarry which Streisand's character does and have her new husband basically raise the kid. Especially if the natural father was as in this case across the other side of the country. Societal customs were much different than they are now concerning extended families and such.The two sides of the country also represent the main characters. Sunny beautiful extroverted physically inclined Hollywood Redford on the west coast and the grayer more complex intellectually inclined New York on the east coast Streisand.I'm also surprised at the comments regarding the characters motivations in finding the other attractive. I thought the movie made it very clear  believable. Both characters are acutely aware of their projected image to others and both characters feel trapped by these labels. This is something very significant that they share which bonds them. Redford's character chafes at his pretty boy image yet is at the same time uncomfortable in the role of writer.  When his short story is read in class he is visibly uncomfortable yet still wants the approval of his classmates. Redford's character wants to be strong yet have a vulnerable artistic side appreciated. So too is Streisand hampered by her image as an intellectual wise cracking thick skinned rebel. She unconsciously perhaps longs for a man to treat her gently appreciate her as something more than a spokesperson more as a unique person a woman.Each of the characters tentatively pin pricks the other's exterior reserve. Redford by trying to make Streisand smile relax not take life so seriously and Streisand by trying to make Redford feel respected and have his writing valued. Each receives from the other something most people won't give them. Streisand is made to feel beautiful and interesting and sexy and something more than just her political beliefs while Streisand lets Redford know that beneath the blond surfer boy looks she sees depth and integrity.The movie also deals with culture clashes within society. Redford's character is the classic White Anglo Saxon Protestant upper class while Streisand the lower class ethnic nonChristian. That they even consider forging a relationship between the two of them would have raised eyebrows at the time.I'm surprised though perhaps I missed it that no one commented on two of the films most famous lines. In an argument near the end of the movie Redford  Streisand battle it out with Redford declaring that people are more important than principles with Streisand answering back that people are their principles.I agree with many that this is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in the 1970s. I think both lead actors were perfectly cast and the period feeling of the WWII era is beautifully rendered.There are many wonderful moments throughout the film. The scene where Redford is out in the ocean on a small sailboat with his good friend and the two are playing the best ever game. When the friend calls out the category as year and Redford starts identifying first one year then another then another as his best or favorite years the viewer knows without being told that the years he's listing are his years he's spent with Streisand. The camera records Redford's bittersweet face and pulls back showing the friend on the boat silently witnessing his friend's pain then the camera pulls back in a helicopter shot showing the boat being bounced on the waves. It's an extraordinarily poignant moment in film.As mentioned in other reviews the shots of Streisand brushing back Redford's hair off his forehead are sexy and intimate without being graphic.Another moment I love is near the end of the film and Streisand says to Redford wouldn't it be wonderful if the two of them were old and they would have survived all of this. Again with brilliantly written dialogue and performed by professionals the movie accomplishes much depth without resorting to histrionics.I think it's a very romantic film along the lines of Casablanca and Gone With The Wind and Brief Encounter.I say rent the film don't try to over analyze it just relax on the couch either by yourself or with your partner and just enjoy an old fashioned story of boy meets girl boy woos girl boy loses girl in the end.".

Nothing I've seen I haven't seen a lot but still has compared to the chemistry the depth of feeling and the realistic portrayal of two opposites both beautiful in their own right.  This movie is a testament to the way we were really how it was beautiful to be decadent and disgusting in the thriving 50's of the attractive waspishness of Ivy leaguers of politics and war.  The movie is not dated either its quality making it appealing to a whole spectrum of people who would normally not be interested in something this good.  I first saw this movie in a history class and to my surprise most of the people in the class loved it people who would normally go see Titanic and rave about it for days.  I think that is if not something else at least evidence of this movie's depth quality feeling and although very sentimental realism.  If you enjoy the finer things in life dim the lights fix yourself a vodka martini straight up and watch The Way We Were.".

This movie is a testament to the way we were really how it was beautiful to be decadent and disgusting in the thriving 50's of the attractive waspishness of Ivy leaguers of politics and war.  The movie is not dated either its quality making it appealing to a whole spectrum of people who would normally not be interested in something this good.  I first saw this movie in a history class and to my surprise most of the people in the class loved it people who would normally go see Titanic and rave about it for days.  I think that is if not something else at least evidence of this movie's depth quality feeling and although very sentimental realism.  If you enjoy the finer things in life dim the lights fix yourself a vodka martini straight up and watch The Way We Were.";

	schema:reviewBody "Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford look wonderful in this great story of doomed love. Character development or arc is supposed to be one of the basic elements of a good screenplay but the whole point of Sydney Pollack's 1973 movie is that neither Katie Moroski nor Hubbell Gardner changes. She remains the seriousminded Jewish leftwing activist and he the easygoing politically uncommitted WASP they are when they first meet in college in 1937. Fascinated with each other precisely because they are such opposites they have an affair marry and have a baby but their inability to compromise  or in his case to stop compromising  leads to breakup.The main action spans the eventful decade from the Spanish Civil War and New Deal through WWII to the McCarthy era by which time Katie and Hubbell have moved from New York to Hollywood where he is a screenwriter. Though melodramatic and sketchy the political dimension of the story should not be underestimated this is one of the very rare American movies in which a communist is treated sympathetically. Presumably much of this side of the scenario stemmed from the personal experience of writer Arthur Laurents who was the same age as his protagonists and who had McCarthyrelated problems.Both stars are perfect for their roles we can see what they see in each other and we desperately want it to work for them though we know it won't! Notable in support are Bradford Dillman Lois Chiles and James Woods. The theme song emotionally delivered by Streisand as only she can is beautiful but the relevance of its nostalgic lyric to this cleareyed movie is doubtful.".

	schema:reviewBody "The theme of a golden boy falling for a girl from another world be it social class the wrong side of the tracks or fill in your clich here is one that goes back to the silent film era. One of the most famous examples is Sydney Pollack's 1973 film The Way We Were. Set from the 1930's through the 1950's Barbra Streisand plays Katie an outspoken member of the Communist party and campus activist who does not have anything handed to her she works two and sometimes three jobs in order to pay for her living and college tuition. Hubble Redford is your typical aforementioned golden boy a big man on campus who indulges in sports debutantes and allaround good times. The two know each other from the diner Katie works at he being the patron and at one point before graduation briefly bond over their shared passion for writing. Cut to a few years in the future and Katie encounters Hubble at a bar. Hubble is in the armed forces and Katie is characteristically working a couple of jobs while volunteering for various social causes. After a night of drunken sex Hubble being the drunken one they embark on an unlikely relationship that spans over a decade and includes a move to California when Hubble becomes a screenwriter in Hollywood and the conception of one child. They are happy but realize that regardless of their desire they can't completely cross social lines and certainly can't change one another particularly Katie's everferocious dedication to social causes a fight that becomes exponentially heated during McCarthy's Red Scare. The two have to decide whether they can sustain enough raw emotion for one another to persevere over everything else that is stacked up against them.There are several things about The Way We Were that require suspension of disbelief the fact that despite never having had much contact with one another that after one night of drunken lust and an awkward morning after being enough to kick start a relationship the magnitude of theirs is the first thing that comes to mind but the bottom line is that it really is a wellwritten welldirected and wellacted film. The two principal characters are full and complex regardless of whether we are talking about the socially conscience Katie or the socially acceptable Hubble. I suspect they somewhat were written with the intent of familiarity for the purpose of effectiveness and if this is true it worked on me. The era in which these two characters were set was a very interesting time in American history and the characters' actions during these times created some compelling cinema particularly when it touched on the Red Scare.But who am I fooling? The main reason people watch this movie whether for the first time or for the fiftieth is for the doomed romance and Streisand and Redford deliver in spades. The Way We Were was written for Streisand something that cause Redford to turn down the part at first because he knew the film was going to be hers and her portrayal of Katie is excellent. There are so many perceptions of Streisand nowadays some of them correct to be sure that it's easy to forget that she really does have some serious acting chops and she exhibits them to full effect here. I also happened to learn that the soft filtered lens thing with her didn't just start with her later movies for whatever reason she was filmed with that lens more often than not here but that didn't do anything more than slightly distract me because I couldn't help but chuckle. Redford gives a typical solid performance as well though his initial doubts about taking the role turned out to be valid he is not the dynamic figure in the film. However his character is a strong one and Redford does a good job.I don't know if Pollack knew he was creating a screen classic when he directed The Way We Were but he did make a very good film. If you can make it past some major melodrama and some plot holes what was the deal with their child? watch this film and just sit back and appreciate it for what it is  a chick flick that guys don't have to feel ashamed watching. 710 Shelly".

Romances were never really my thing but I had always enjoyed the work of Robert Redford so I decided to give it a try.  I was floored by the power and beauty of film!  My initial reactions to the film were once again how natural and charismatic Redford is as the classic example of the college golden boy who feels slightly trapped.  After the credits began to roll I knew right then that I had seen something special something that would pass the test of time.  I assume others felt the same way the film went on to become an international blockbuster and the top grosser of the year.Years later I watched THE WAY WE WERE again.  Now older I had a new perspective on the film and to be completely honest I enjoyed it even more!  While I still think Redford is great in this film I discovered that it is actually Barbra Streisand who gives the better performance.  As the political activist Katie Streisand has one her best roles since Fanny Brice in the original FUNNY GIRL and she provides a showstopping performance. She displays both strength and vulnerability she is at once both scorned and innocent.  Her's is one of the best performances of the 70's.The final verdict  THE WAY WE WERE stands the test of time as one of the best films of it's kind.  Watch this film for the most moving finale in film history for the knock out performance from Streisand for the longlasting chemistry between Redford and Streisand and for one of the most famous and touching love stories of this century.Out of 10 I'd rate THE WAY WE WERE a solid 10!".

	schema:reviewBody "I too watched this film because of the reference in Sex  the City and found it strangely mesmerizing despite its many flaws. It is an attempt to portray a grand love story in the context of serious political questions but ultimately it ends up as just another soppy romance pleasurable to watch but with no real substance or depth. The character of Katie isn't coherent enough at times to make the film work despite the fact that Striesand is perfectly cast in this role . At college she's cold and abrasive when Hubble makes overtures towards her but when they meet again years later she acts like a giddy school girl with a crush. There are powerful moments when they argue over principles and the future of their relationship but the problems that drive them apart aren't explored deeply enough to make it work. It's hard to believe that they could be so deliriously happy when Katie announces she's pregnant only to have everthing fall to pieces before the baby is even born. Given the supposed depth of their love for each other Hubble's affair is completely unconvincing even making allowances for the volatile political situation they find themselves in.The film had great potential to explore the pressures that outside forces can have on two people with very different views who love each other against all the odds and how these pressures will ultimately take their toll but it lacks the insight that could have made it a really great film. Instead it opts for the sugarcoated version that's bound to be a crowd pleaser but leaves the more discerning viewer feeling slightly disappointed and empty.That said I did like the ending a lot and believe that Robert Redford is a fine actor. The brief look of intense pain  regret in Hubble's eyes when he is confronted with everything he has lost and everything that could have been when he meets Katie on the street in New York almost makes up for the rest of the films flaws. He took the easy way out and is forced to admit this to himself if only for a moment before he is swept back into his glamourous lifestyle as a screen writer. Katie on the other hand has stayed true to her beliefs and she summs it up the fims theme perfectly when she tells Hubble that she likes his girl. It is a girl he has chosen over a woman that could have brought out the very best in him and helped him to be the kind of man he yearned to be but didn't have the determination or courage for and this is where the great tragedy of the film lies. Definitely worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " The best film romance for adult audiences";
	schema:reviewBody "As stated many times before THE WAY WE WERE is one of only a handful of romantic blockbusters to actually feature an intelligent script and complex characters. Writer Arthur Luarents' based his screenplay and subsequent novel on girl he knew in college who fought for liberal and sometimes communist causes. Three decades after it's release THE WAY WE WERE remains one of the few cinematic depictions of the Red Scare that swept America in the forties and fifties the backdrop of which lends the surrounding love story greater potency and depth. The film was a surprise box office smash when originally released and became the fifthhighest grossing film of 1973 and was instantly embraced as a classic.Katie Morosky is a character that Barbra Streisand born play and she delivers on all accounts. Fierce and determined yet vulnerable and selfconscious Katie is a tricky character and Streisand inhabits her so deeply that she seems nothing less than completely believable. Justifiably nominated for a Best Actress Oscar she inexplicably lost to Glenda Jackson's shrill performance in the barely remembered A TOUCH OF CLASS. This was clearly a major blunder on the side of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Robert Redford who had actually turned down the role twice before director and friend Sydney Pollack talked him into taking the part displays some of the best reflective acting ever seen on the big screen and effectively brings forth the dark side of being stereotyped as the AllAmerican golden boy although Redford did not receive an Oscar nod for playing Hubbell in this film he was nominated for Best Actor that same year for his light comedic performance in THE STING.THE WAY WE WERE is different from most romances in that it is not death feuding families or any other societal phenomena that directly tear the couple apart. Katie and Hubbell are simply passionate individuals with highly volatile and contrasting ideologies the conflict of which is expressed in several brilliantly written and acted scenes that shimmer with the type of intelligence and honesty that is rarely seen in cinema today. The film's enduring popular success with the mass audience may very well be due to the magnetic chemistry between Streisand and Redford the gorgeous cinematography and the strong directorial hand supplied by Pollack. However it is the complexity of the romance with politics and the strong characterizations by both leads that continues to make THE WAY WE WERE the best love story for adults.".

	onyx:emotionText "As stated many times before THE WAY WE WERE is one of only a handful of romantic blockbusters to actually feature an intelligent script and complex characters. Writer Arthur Luarents' based his screenplay and subsequent novel on girl he knew in college who fought for liberal and sometimes communist causes. Three decades after it's release THE WAY WE WERE remains one of the few cinematic depictions of the Red Scare that swept America in the forties and fifties the backdrop of which lends the surrounding love story greater potency and depth. The film was a surprise box office smash when originally released and became the fifthhighest grossing film of 1973 and was instantly embraced as a classic.Katie Morosky is a character that Barbra Streisand born play and she delivers on all accounts. Fierce and determined yet vulnerable and selfconscious Katie is a tricky character and Streisand inhabits her so deeply that she seems nothing less than completely believable. Justifiably nominated for a Best Actress Oscar she inexplicably lost to Glenda Jackson's shrill performance in the barely remembered A TOUCH OF CLASS. This was clearly a major blunder on the side of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Robert Redford who had actually turned down the role twice before director and friend Sydney Pollack talked him into taking the part displays some of the best reflective acting ever seen on the big screen and effectively brings forth the dark side of being stereotyped as the AllAmerican golden boy although Redford did not receive an Oscar nod for playing Hubbell in this film he was nominated for Best Actor that same year for his light comedic performance in THE STING.THE WAY WE WERE is different from most romances in that it is not death feuding families or any other societal phenomena that directly tear the couple apart. Katie and Hubbell are simply passionate individuals with highly volatile and contrasting ideologies the conflict of which is expressed in several brilliantly written and acted scenes that shimmer with the type of intelligence and honesty that is rarely seen in cinema today. The film's enduring popular success with the mass audience may very well be due to the magnetic chemistry between Streisand and Redford the gorgeous cinematography and the strong directorial hand supplied by Pollack. However it is the complexity of the romance with politics and the strong characterizations by both leads that continues to make THE WAY WE WERE the best love story for adults.";

	schema:reviewBody "I was relatively young when this film first came out. I like many others thought it was great and loved Streisand and Redford and the theme song. I recently saw TWWW again nearly 40 years later and my opinion has changed dramatically. I cannot deny that Redford and Streisand definitely seem to have some kind of chemistry. And as I felt the first time Barbra represented every ugly duckling gay or straight who somehow manages to capture the prize. Via Barbra's performance we can easily imagine what it must have been like to lie down with a prince. This I think may be one reason why the film had a certain level of success. Barbra also had moments where she spoke the truth with passion and intensity. I think people related to this outspokenness this gutsiness this willingness to take chances and not apologize for one's opinions. Barbra was also the outsider  she was the smart Jewish girl who knew she had to work harder study more and fight for what she wanted because nothing would come to her easily. It is for these reasons why I think the movie resonated. But the reality is The movie is not about anything not really. What exactly is the plot? They meet in school they meet years later they fall in love they get married he has an affair they divorce they meet again... okay so what? Barbra who does have tons of talent but in this film looked like she was performing her graduate project for Acting 101 spends a lot of time arguing and getting upset about things. But whatever those things are seem to be only tangentially connectedrelated to the rest of the story if you can call it that. Bob yes stunning to look at coasts through the film with little to do or say. He didn't want to do the film and I can see why. Yeah he looks great but what is the emotional arc of his character? A lot was cut from this film and as a result it seems disjointed. There is an inordinate amount of time spent on Bob's career as a screenwriter in Hollywood while a pregnant Barbra tends to their little beach house. And yet everyone seems miserable and unhappy. Voices were raised but nothing really happens. Near the end when Barbra has apparently given birth to their child after it's clear that their relationship is over Bob shows up at the hospital. Barbra is perfectly coiffed and madeup as if she's just come back from a spa. He stands there emotionless ready to abandon her and their newborn child. We're supposed to like him? I couldn't stand him. In fact James Wood who we meet early on in the film who seems to be Barbra's quasiboyfriend in college and who seems to support everything she was trying to do is clearly a better man for herbut he wasn't as handsome. Life is cruel isn't it? Finally the theme song Yes it is a beautiful song for what it is and Barbra sings it beautifully. Who knew that it would become an iconic song and help define her career? She didn't even want to sing the songshe felt it was too simple. She had to be talked into it. So finally in the end what are we left with? A unique opportunity to see Barbra and Bob dressing in period costumes lots of bad bad lighting a plotless rambling story that does not stay any one place long enough for us to care about much of anything lots of intense arguing and challenging others from Barbra and lots of stoic looks from Bob. And yet it was a big hit. Like I said at the beginning it was Barbra's ugly duckling status and landing the prince that I think resonated with a large part of the audience. At least it did with me... back then. At this point in time I just kind of stared at it in amazement and said What exactly is this all about?".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this movie a couple of times at different ages and I have to say the older I get the more I enjoy this film. Sometimes you see two people together and think they have nothing in common or they are an odd couple. I feel Katie and Hubbell were attracted to each other because they each had something the other lacked and wished they had inside of themselves.Katie and Hubbell were able to speak to each other honestly brutally about the other's flaws. I think they came together to form a complete being and that is why they married. Yet this film also informs the audience you can't change your core beliefs even for the sake of love. Eventually what brings them together drives them apart.Redford's performance is often criticized in the film for not being emotional enough. If things always come easy to a person there really isn't a need to make much noise when you have access to all of your dreams. Redford's character knows he has deficiencies and that he is taking the easy way out. Hubbell is really a cynic at heart but a shrewd cynic because he tells Katie in one scene that after the witch hunt is over no one will care who was red or not because people will just want to work to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle. Hubbell seems to know his time with Katie is limited he knows they won't work out at tries to break it off but can't. Hubbell also realizes Katies doesn't want the easy Hubbell and demands the real Hubbell make himself present in their relationship and in his professional life. At the end of the movie people mention they don't like Hubbell because he didn't have contact with his daughter failed himself personally but remains a professional success. Maybe Hubbell felt his daughter would be better off without him or maybe having contact with his daughter meant he would always have to see Katie and he didn't want to be reminded of losing the love of his life. Maybe Hubbell felt constricted by the demands of love realized this about himself and didn't want to expose a child to his defect. Yet the final scene saves Hubbell for me because when he walks across the street to speak with Katie and admits he can't come over for dinner and is pained to know his daughter has a good father. It was like he was never really a part of Katie's life. Hubbell and Katie were a movie about star crossed lovers that ran its course. The look on Redford's face is priceless.So all in all Redford's understated performance with just enough outrage over Katie's antics in key moments was just the right balance to Striesand's fire breathing Katie. In another actor's hand Hubbell's character would have tried to match fire with fire and that wouldn't have worked. You believe Hubbell has the strength to stand up to Katie and try to love her.As for Streisand she walked a fine line between being a strong woman and being a fool for love. She knows she is all wrong for Hubbell and that she is stronger than Hubbell but feels he could be a better person with her and the right partner for her if he would make the effort. She is going to mold Hubbell into the person she and he would like to be but always forgets he is a human being with flaws. On paper in person he is too good to be true and is prince charming. The ballroom scene where Hubbell cuts through a crowd of people and dances with Katie is something from a fairy tale. Katie's yearning for someone from a fairy tale is interesting because deep down she yearns for a knight in shining armor. Though the world around her tells her Hubbell is unobtainable because he is a WASP she is Jewish and not a blond bombshell he seems to come from money she's working class. Katie hates herself for being attracted to Hubbell but can't help it. Striesand annoys you at times but makes you root for her Katie. And why shouldn't she have prince charming? Striesand pulls out all the stops as a woman of passion and intellect who shows her vulnerability through her love of Hubbell and tries to bring him up to her level in the area of personal responsibility to others and to oneself.Visually Striesand is stunning in the glamorous 40's outfits and Redford is ready for Hollywood. It was interesting to see Katie transformed into a glamorous almost carefree person in California and that was because she was on Hubbell's turf. Back in New York she goes back to her naturally curly hair and you know she is back where she belongs ready to save the world.The end of the movie is heartbreaking and yes though everyone else has typed about it you have to the love the hair brushing gesture Katie gives Hubbell and the warm embrace that shows there is still something between them which was too much for them both to bear. I cry every time.".

The story is basically a weepy melodrama but who cares? Both of these superstars are the reason to watch. At first we cannot imagine what they see in one another. They meet in college circa 1937  Katie Streisand is a wallflower political activist Hubble Redford is the Golden Boy track star. Yes both were too old to play college students so it is obvious the director surrounded them with people their own age with some decent supporting actors like Lois Chiles and a younger James Woods. The two are reunited by World War II Redford is in the military but also part of the uppity Beekman Street crowd Streisand is a liberal who is nuts about FDR and working on various political causes. The unlikely twosome fall in love get married and do not always have an easy time. Redford doesn't mind his wife's political activity but he is bored by politics and cannot relate to them. The turbulent 1950's hit Redford is a writer in Red Scare Hollywood who takes the easy way out Streisand believes people should always stand up for their principles no matter the cost. Sydney Pollack directed this fine film and had to convince his friend Redford to take on the part of Hubble Gardner Redford was reluctant and it is easy to see why. His character while a decent guy at heart is also shallow somewhat superficial and doesn't take life seriously. The film obviously exploits Redford's golden boy looks something he always detested. Streisand's part is obviously the more interesting one as the part was exclusively written for her. And while her character may not fit in on Beekman Street she looks fabulous here. All in all this is one of the finest romances to come out of the 1970's that also has intelligence and class.".

While it has some points in its favour I found the writing and acting of not quite the highest standard leaving a sense of unfulfilment by the end.Hollywood in the 70's was at last ready to confront openly its own shame at its treatment of leftleaning actors writers and directors The Front starring Woody Allen was soon to follow and The Way We Were must have been something of a trailblazer in that respect which is certainly to its credit. Furthermore it's laudable to present the viewer with a deeper than usual lovestory against this background with many of the conversations of the leads debating interesting points on artistic integrity political correctness and the shallowness of much of the general public's response to freedomchallenging issues of the day. In the end though I got the sense that director Pollack was more interested in the love story angle than the political angle perhaps with an eye on the boxoffice and this throws the film offkilter.Streisand gets the showiest part and interestingly her name in front of Redford's over the titles and is mostly good. She's usually better when she says least for example when Redford crudely and drunkenly makes her at her apartment although her motormouth delivery obviously helps with her character's verbosity. More than once though you can see her acting and obviously hoping that Oscar was watching he obviously wasn't. Redford is altogether more natural in his part as the handsome hunk with something approaching a brain but who ultimately can't accept Streisand's at times overstrident political philosophising. However one's sympathy for his character was dissipated by his turning loverat on a nowpregnant Streisand and then abandoning her and their child almost the minute the child is born. Both these actions are loathsome in the extreme not to mention an offensive homophobic remark he makes at another juncture and by the time he's walking out on her for the last time at the conclusion having also now soldout the writing talent which Streisand alone had encouraged you realise you've been watching a woman's film after all with the dice loaded in favour of Streisand's character. I was disappointed with this revelation as to Redford's character's true colours and felt it inconsistent with much of what had gone before.The film was obviously on a twoheader basis which doesn't leave much room for the supporting actors to shine although Brad Dillman and Lois Chiles do okay with what they're given. Director Pollack keeps the narrative moving although some of the settings and costumery employed looked at times too contemporary. I'm also bound to state that I never got the impression that either lead was ageing down the years.As for the music score while Marvin Hamlisch's title song is pretty and has obviously become a standard I felt its strains were just too intrusive throughout and felt it should have been left a titlesonly piece.A film then at once ambitious and conservative political and soporific lush but talky  in the end I found it didn't enmesh these contradictions sufficiently well and missed its marks accordingly.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recall a line from The Alamo in which John Wayne says to Linda Cristal that political differences don't make for good breakfast talk between a man and a woman. That's a piece of wisdom that Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford should have remembered for their characters in The Way We Were.Meet Hubbell Gardiner and Katie Marofsky from the Thirties at Columbia University. Redford as Gardiner is your all American athlete and the Prince Charming of many a young girl's dreams. An elegant WASP Ivy League future is in store for him if he wants it. One of those girls who thinks Redford is Prince Charming is Barbra Streisand as Katie Marofsky. She's a member of the young Communists and is one eloquent campus radical for her cause. When we see her she's got a picture of Lenin in her dormitory room. We see her talking about the cause of Republican Spain and the budding young Ivy League Republicans on the campus are hooting her down. All but Redford who's impressed by her convictions even if he doesn't share them.But when the USA does get into World War II and Redford is in the Navy and Streisand now working for the Office of War Information now meet. Politics seem to take a back seat to romance and Streisand lives out a real life fairy tale as a Brooklyn Jewish Cinderella.Their love gets really tested in the post World War II period during the Red Scare. Streisand's not quite the Communist she once was a picture of FDR is now in her room. That was in fact one of FDR's main contributions to our body politic winning over budding revolutionaries like Streisand to support our democratic big and small D way of life. But he's gone now and the Soviet Union has become our cold war enemy. A lot of people are now caught in the post war reaction.Because Hollywood is the glamor capital of the world and rightwing politicos can't get any mileage out of investigating Communist plumbers it's to the movie capital that the House UnAmerican Activities Committee turns. Redford is now working in that industry as is Streisand. Redford sees the problem in personal terms Streisand sees the big picture but that's all she does see. How things resolve themselves is the basis of The Way We Were.With all the political differences there beats the heart of one of the best love stories ever done in Hollywood. When Redford's around Streisand lights up the screen with her passion for him. But it never quite covers the different world views they have.With such detail given to the stars by director Sydney Pollack the supporting cast and it's a good one never really establish their characters. Maybe that's what he wanted to have them appear as plastic as Streisand's Katie Marofsky thinks they are.The Way We Were contains the title song written by Marvin Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bregman which became one of Streisand's best loved ballads. Her singing of that song is unforgettable whether heard on record or if fortunate live at one of her concerts. Bing Crosby also made a nice recording of it for one of his last albums. Hamlisch also won an Oscar for Best overall Musical Score that year they were the only two Oscars won by The Way We Were.The sad thing about The Way We Were is that Streisand and Redford hold such different views and yet are fundamentally decent people who cannot agree to disagree. It's what makes The Way We Were such a beautiful yet ultimately sad film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Way We Were 1973 Dir Sydney Pollack  Cast Barbra Streisand Robert Redford Bradford Dillman Lois Chiles Patrick O'Neal An opposites attract romance where the male cannot commit himself yet he can sleep with the woman in question. Romance reflecting upon nicer times that grow into loveless empty worlds. Barbra Streisand plays a political activist and Robert Redford plays a Hollywood screenwriter whom she knew long ago. They get reacquainted and romance blooms but they share different views on political issues. Directed with insight by Sydney Pollack who previously made Jeremiah Johnson and They Shoot Horses Don't They? While his talent brings out the theme the screenplay blemishes the theme with its formula driven romantic drivel. Streisand plays her role with zest and intelligence but when she becomes pregnant Redford is unable to be there thus concluding upon bypassed responsibility. Redford is a fine actor but here he plays a guy who is unlikable and unsympathetic. Supporting roles are also flat with Bradford Dillman and Lois Chiles among others basically filling space. This film isn't very romantic by any means but it does feature the inspiring vocals of Streisand within the film's signature song. Although its romantic themes diminish it does reflect upon missed opportunities and moving on with hidden regret. Score 5   10".

After not seeing it for a very long time I sat down last night and played it. I can gladly say that the film has aged very well and is every bit as solid and moving as when I first saw it. Barbara is as beautiful as she ever was in any film. Redford made legions of ladies swoon with his natural rugged nontampered handsome blondness.The story is quite believable and borrows from the historical record that it is placed in. There were lots of Jewish people who got caught up in the antiFascist antiwar and antibomb movements. But the actual beliefs or disinterested lifestyles although well articulated in the film are secondary throughout helping to craft the tensions that underscore the real theme romantic but inevitably doomed love.Streisand and Redford threw themselves into this work and their on screen chemistry is wonderful. Barbara's singing of the theme music pulls at the heart strings as it is meant to. This is a beautiful and adult drama that reminds anyone who has lived through disappointment and heartbreak in love what it was all about. One of the best films for both actors. For me only Yentl eclipses Barbara's success on screen. Watch for a very young James Woods early in the film. Keep the Kleenex box close by. Still one of my favourites.".

This is a beautiful and adult drama that reminds anyone who has lived through disappointment and heartbreak in love what it was all about. One of the best films for both actors. For me only Yentl eclipses Barbara's success on screen. Watch for a very young James Woods early in the film. Keep the Kleenex box close by. Still one of my favourites.";

	schema:headline " Odd couple romance that goes off on a tangent";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie seems very much a star vehicle for singer Barbra Streisand who plays undergraduate student Katie Morosky. Set in 1930's America at the start of the movie Morosky is a politically active communist on campus who hands out flyers and speaks at antiwar rallies. The man who will become her love interest is Hubbell Gardiner played by Robert Redford. Gardiner is more a part of the elite than Morosky and is not politically active at all...he's more hedonistic hence their being a potential odd couple.For this early part of the movie you have to suspend disbelief over how much older Streisand and Redford seem in relation to the characters they play. In other words they look too old for their parts. However Redford gives a completely winning performance early in the piece as an undergraduate student. He is all easy charm manners and engagingly amusing to boot...in contrast to oh so serious Morosky.Now not being versed in the history of this production it does come across as Streisand pulling all of the strings. She is not a conventional leading lady and her pairing with Redford would not seem an obvious choice. To me their early attraction was glossed over which made Morosky seem a little bit creepy when she does get into bed with Gardiner for the first time! So if Streisand did pull a lot of strings to make this movie it perhaps represents some 'wish fulfilment' on her part! And as if to explain her presence in this film Morosky does say some things which seem to have psychoanalytical weight for Streisand's own situation i.e. Morosky's views on her looks which may engage the audience member wondering why Streisand is paired with Redford.The undergraduate Morosky may seem a tad annoying early on but the more mature Morosky does engage more...not being so militant and ridding herself of that overgrown mop of hair on her head which didn't sit right with me. It's then that it becomes more understandable why Gardiner would be attracted to her.Theirs is an intriguing relationship especially in how Morosky deals with Gardiner's friends who are more like him than her. During the period that they are in university together or maybe it's called 'college' in the US attention is paid to Gardiner's writing ability. It is this part of the story that will later have a life of its own in the movie. Initially this branch of the story seemed quite odd...why focus on this if this is meant to be a love story? Things become clearer later on as the historical context of the film's setting becomes clearer. This historical context may prove to be an eyeopener for Americans who are Generation X or Generation Y.When I jotted down notes on this film I wrote The ending is sort of established so like the start you wonder about the specifics. Hmmm not sure what I meant by that!Anyway I give this film 65100. Intriguing and Redford shows his star qualities herethe Brad Pitt of his day.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this on UK TV last night and really enjoyed it and it left me feeling emotionally touched. It's really like a Truth or Dare Part 2 as many have said but the huge difference is Madonna.Back then she was in her early 30s and doing a larger concert and really had the world at her feet as this amazing female artist who was very fit and very controversial. I was 1617 that time too when I was a huge fan of hers. Big posters of her in that famous conical outfit long blonde ponytail expression lots of 'suggestive' poses  but even though I was young and my mum was insistent in sitting behind me watching TOD it never bothered me. I was never discouraged and continued loving Madonna. I think where she has always been a bit forward etc those were the years she was reaching out on a different level but it all turned against her the Sex Book etc. Fast forward a few years and Ray of Light album reignites Madonna's flame of fame. She looks good and thou the album seems a little strange with some chant type music I think she was quickly opening our ears up to see how she was a new person in herself. Ray of Light song itself certainly was a clubfloor burner. Move on to Music album and I absolutely love it! Drowned World Tour thou not seen as her best work was one I actually thoroughly enjoyed...but onto this documentary and I have to say the very beginning of it was strange almost sinister. But rolling on and through it watching her pick new dancers for the tour Cloud is absolutely amazing! to getting ready for stage etc  you can see Madonna still gets a bit nervous as I feel she strives for a perfect concert all the time nothing wrong with that but perhaps it was a bit evident back in TOD it made her seem a little 'bitchy'. But by gawk this woman IS a great entertainer! The costumes are colourful thou the concert seems a little smaller than Drowned World it seemed a little more intimate with the fans. Anyhow watching her in Slane and she is taking care and making all aware of the rain etc when she gets into the car and while driven away mentions about 'suddenly forgetting what she sang and danced too' or along those lines maybe I'm imagining things but she looked a little upset? I felt a little emotional with that and the scenes of her sweating etc and looking a little exhausted. Suddenly it hits you while she is incredibly flexible and fit and looks great its easy to forget about her age and possible physical changes coming ahead  you know what I mean. I loved the scenes with her and her kids and with Guy in Dublin etc..and sharing moments with the dancers.The whole documentary was worth it for me.now that I remember the old Madonna and see the new one yes the lady has changed. I also think marriage and kids have contributed. Her voice is stronger deeper and sounds better than ever I think. She is not quite the young fit loud controversial rude woman we remember 12 or so years back but she is still a great singer dancer entertainer  in fact I commend Madonna on coming as far as she has all the highs and lows etc.she is still a top person many of the public have been rude and wanting her to retire and say she looks terrible  I say she looks terrific and is in better shape than a whole lot of us. She is not afraid of trying something new and never was. Heck I'm almost 30 and still regret never going into dance when I was younger because when Madonna is on I seriously want to go to a club and dance all night  she makes me feel alive again.Maybe any public reading this will think I'm talking rubbish or don't know what I'm talking about. True there is a lot to Madonna I don't know but I like to enjoy the great things in life when they happen 'for the moment' and she is one of them. She is one person I've always enjoyed watching and at least with her videos and concerts you ARE guaranteed fantastic dancers! she is all about fun! If she does happen to ease off or have a last tour as her kids get older I will always remember this woman who was never ever boring and who finally became a better person for herself. Respect!".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally after a long year of waiting i got to see this movie. My expectations for this Rockumentary where very high and i was hoping i could see this as a sequel to Truth or Dare in bed with Madonna. But nowhere this documentary can be compared to the 1991 Madonna documentary the only similar thing these two docu's share is the use for black  white footage for off stage scenes and full color footage for on stage scenes. The great difference between these two docu's is Madonna herself and it is really great to see that the same egocentric woman who shocked the world by touching herself on stage has grown to be such a tender and caring person who now uses the shockelement to make a difference in the world. The docu begins with a stunning new video of the Beast Within which is perhaps the most dark and scary thing Madonna ever did. After that you can see Madonna at work in the studio mixing the soundtrack for her Reinvention tour. Step by step you see the preparations for such a massive tour the audition of the dancers rehearsing songs shooting of backdrop screens. Then the docu follows Madonna from opening night until the last show in Lissabon and also shows some of the strongest performances she did during the tour. Songs like Vogue American Life Like a Prayer and more. After some emotional footage of the last show the docu shows Madonna's visit to Israel. In my opinion the docu would be better of without these scenes. I do understand that this also is an important part of Madonna's life but some of the footage you get to see is so hard and depressing that it leaves more impact then the 100 minutes before. I think it is save to say that although this docu isn't that good as Truth or Dare you won't be disappointed by this one.".

Uplifting and optimistic it takes you on a journey from the beginning to the end of the creative adventure of this project. It is a more mature Madonna that allows the viewer to see a certain side of her that has long been developing. Those who were expecting something more playful like her other documentary projects they will be disappointed but shouldn't be surprised because it is nothing like anything you have seen from Madonna before. Many people will ask what is her secret? Is it metaphoric or was it an attention getter? The documentary is a revelation of the essence of her happiness  her family and spirituality aside from all things material.".

There are a lot of talented people in it that deserve to be discovered like Stuart Price her musical director and all of her excellent dancers!! The documentary is done in a very spiritual mood but the're also a lot of humor. Madonna Her husband Guy Ritchie and her children are lovely and it's cool to enter in their world for about 2 hours... Plus it's a good way to understand things that are going on in the world. It's not SO political but there's a bit of that. We can see Michael Moore Gwyneth Paltrow and many other artist that support Madonna in the film.Finally you must see it. It worth a sincere 1010.

The difference with Truth Or Dare and this latter shows how much Madonna has changed in this last decade. But let's talk about the documentary it opens with the pop star choosing her dancers and it's a very good beginning. Then there's a bit of politics she asks her troupe not to vote for Bush and even Moore is interviewed during a live show of hers. The political part it's very short indeed while a lot of space is given to the artist's new belief the Kaballah. The final part shows us Madonna in Isral talking in front of an audience of the importance of peace and the need of a better future for all those children with guns in their hands. The movie ends with two boys of two different religions holding their hands. It's very touching. There are of course some performances  but not too much  the stunning and stylish Vogue the strong antiwar American Life the moving Lament and Mother And Father and much more. Of course some Madonna detractors would find it pedant and pretentious but the artist gives us a lot of beautiful and meaningful messages with this documentary and every one has seen it has the impression that if we want we can make a better world.

	schema:reviewBody "This film follows Madonna on her 2004 ReInvention world tour and shows her show backstage preparations and her experiences travelling around the different places around the world. I have never been to a gig that is as big as a Madonna show  mostly I have been in midsized venues that are just about the music rather than being a spectacular event in the way that artists like Madonna Prince and U2 are known for.In this regard the film is pretty strong because it allows me to see the spectacle without having to pay the 50 and stand in a crowded auditorium. The musical numbers are impressive even if there weren't as many as I would have liked I'm not a Madonna fan per se but she does have good tunes and her delivery is something else. The problem with the film is that it goes beyond the shows and behind the scenes with her her family and her dancers. For me the problem was Madonna herself because she came across as rather insincere and rather full of emotional and spiritual babble. She shows this in the way she talks and the very New Age and American displays of emotion throughout  some viewers will no doubt see this as honesty and frankness in front of the camera but for me it was liked they had cherry picked all the moments of forced sincerity and put them into the film did I mention Madonna was the executive producer?.This is bad for most of the film but is never worse than the final 20 minutes when she goes to Israel. This final section is pompous and so annoying that it almost totally cancelled out the musical numbers which did seem to be long ago by this stage. It is hard to take her seriously  she speaks to the dancers as if she were the wisest woman on earth probably because her dancers seem to look at her as some sort of cross between Jesus and the Virgin Mother. I don't mean to be too hard because she occasionally is natural during the film and God knows how she copes with that little bstard Rocco smashing at everything every other minute but the overall impression is one of insincerity religious clichs and the sort of sentences that wouldn't seem out of place in very cheap fortune cookies.Overall though fans will love it because it is Madonna doing her thing on stage as well as being honest and herself behind the scenes. Those a little less blinded by adoration will still enjoy the stage shows but will probably struggle to swallow a lot of the behind the scenes stuff and religious babble. Madonna is a very talented entertainer who has lasted decades in an industry not designed for artist longevity and I applaud her for that sadly this film only touches on that compared to the amount of time she spends coming off as the sort of American you would laugh at the second she walked away.".

The ReInvention tour was hyped at the time because of the heavy focus on the back catalogue used and the fans loved it. The same method of filming is used in IGTTYAS black and white over colour for live performances. The dancers again are used as characters but this is where the film goes off track slightly. In TOD you managed to really got to know who the dancers were you became familiar with their faces and humour. Here you rarely get any of that all the focus is on madonna and Guy Ritchie. There just is not a good balance between knowing madonna and what its like being on a worldwide tour with madonna dancers and crew. Yes the prayers are all here again but the edits are all so quick around backstage antics. It all passes in a blur and you have no idea what really is going on. The live sections are better as you get a better feeling what it all looks like when its up and running. I thought that the whole film did not flow properly because everyone either went on for too long meeting her dad at the ranch or too quick that back stage scenes. Madonnas children add some delight to the show you become aware of the effects on them of what its like having madonna be on a world tour.So the film is a great show of madonna in her 30's to madonna in her 40's. its a great inlook on family life and how it works around madonnas life. Its just a shame the tourfilm has not as many characters this time around.".

Madonnas children add some delight to the show you become aware of the effects on them of what its like having madonna be on a world tour.So the film is a great show of madonna in her 30's to madonna in her 40's. its a great inlook on family life and how it works around madonnas life. Its just a shame the tourfilm has not as many characters this time around.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is the best documentary I've seen EVER. Madonna shows that she pulls out all the stops and never fails to push the envelope in any department in this case it's political. I'm Going To Tell You A Secret chronicles the events of her 2004 ReInvention World Tour and Madonna showcases herself as a pop sensation devoted Mother and Wife political warrior and most of all her true self and her devotion to the study of Kaballah. From the beginning with the opening of The Beast Within Madonna begins with her partnership with music producer Stuart Price and having a very candid conversation about God and her beliefs and throughout the documentary voices her opinion on the political and material world we live in today yet she never comes across as preachy. There are several clips of her performances from the concert and her views on life off stage. It's genuinely touching making us realize that we all have to be grateful for the blessings that we have in life and to not take them for granted. Want what you have and not what you don't is one of the most important messages. Her rendition of John Lennon's Imagine is absolutely mind blowing. The images depicted of the poverty stricken countries during the song is enough to make the toughest of people cry their eyes out. She delivers many important messages with her dancers and states that we all enter the world as better people than who we are and have compassion for all mankind and take into consideration the pain and suffering that is going on in the world. Without taking responsibility for your own actions and watching what you say to others makes your talents useless. This is so true. Madonna never ceases to amaze and impress and expose the world to closeted issues that must be tackled. In her own words we are all responsible for making the world a better place. You could not ask for a better documentary. Even the if you're the least bit involved in her artmusic and not an aficionado anyone would appreciate this masterpiece. It is highly recommended.".

While Madonna is a nicer person in this film it's just not as interesting as Truth or Dare. Some highlights include her father's vineyard her children's lives and drinking at the pub with her husband. It was interesting to watch Madonna's relationship with Guy Ritchie.

So she's all about finding the meaning of things taking responsibility helping others etc. It's all very well but the thing is that she wants to bully other people like those poor brawnynot brainy dancers into doing and thinking what she does. The best parts of the film were the bits from her Reinvention tour where we get to see the tension and the playfulness and the flawless organisation of the Madonna machinery. The worse were the feelgood moments Madonna sings for her father a catholic conformist if ever there was one  and she's totally in awe of him Madonna goes to Israel and sings Imagine Madonna writes acringing cringing poem for her assistant Angela Madonna says a crying goodbye to her dancers yada yada yada....

Some amy say there are somebeautiful scenes here and some ugly scenes there but I love it just like it is and it's hard to change that.Firs the the acting is excellent and the main character Rade Serbedzija does a wonderful work as a cynical downtoearth photographer who knows he can'tescape his destiny and identity Katrin Cartlidge does an equally impressive job as well as a lot o the Macedonian bad and good guys of the film.Secondly the cinematography wonderfully depicts the harsh Macedonianlandscapes and sceneries as well as the torn souls of the land. The music has the same impact and feels so natural with the cinematography.Finally I could never complaint about the directors excellent work. This was his debut if I'm not wrong and that was very promising but I suppose this was his Citizen Kane and it'll probably be impossible to make anything similar.One rarely sees anything from Macedonia.But this is not only good forMacedonian cinema it should have won the Oscar that year.".

So I think I have an overview so that I am able to criticize. The problem between the ethnic groups in Macedonia go around in circles. But in the end it turns out that the circle goes round like a ferry wheel. Everything is happening again and again. The circle is not round though. In every end there is a change. A change which always makes the new beginning worse. In a way it is like a spiral. And Manchevski is smartly telling three stories. They are not linear but in a way they come close to what the problem really is like. With the last episode he connects the three stories and you can feel the message  his message.Unfortunately this film was quite popular only in Europe and I think even in the US but in Macedonia it was rarely seen by the people. I think if every single Macedonian Citizen had seen and understood this movie it would be much easier to solve the Macedonian problem today. Because what it says is that we ourselves kill each other. Because of hatred and ethnic principles we force ourselves to fight against each other. And that is exactly why it is leading to nowhere. Because it is a circle...and the circle is not round.

	schema:headline " From Macedonia With Love";
	schema:reviewBody "The wars in former Yugoslavia have resounded in every corner of that region and have ignited all manner of subsequent ethnic and religious conflicts within the newlyformed republics. Focusing world attention upon the region through the media has occasionally had the positive effect of raising awareness of the conflicts through art. The work of artists from former Yugoslavia has found an appreciation that has never really existed before partly due to the fact that they are the most fit to interpret the events there. The republic of Macedonia is certainly experiencing its share of strife.Nestled in between the countries of Serbia Bulgaria Greece and Albania it is surrounded by strained relations on all sides countries that have refused to recognize its autonomy for a long time. A significant Albanian Moslem minority feuds with the dominant Orthodox Christian Slav population. Hardly a week passes without a new arms network running from Alabania to Macedonia being discovered. Despite the presence of U.N. peacekeeping forces armed skirmishes ravage the countryside.Milcho Manchevski left his native Macedonia to pursue a college education in the U.S. He studied film at Southern Illinois University. Upon graduating he moved to New York and began working on commercial experimental films and music videos. BEFORE THE RAIN is his first fulllength feature for which he returned to his native country to make. He was able to secure British and French financing with his creative authoritative and topical screenplay. An inspiring tale about the senselessness of war and the fragility of humans and their loves the film is despite some minute flaws one of the most  passionate and  sublime cinematic statements of the '90s.It has an intriguing if not wholly original nonlinear narrative structure. Through three episodes titled Words Faces and Pictures respectively the viewer is introduced to three characters whose lives interconnect from minute to strongly significant ways.Kiril Gregoire Collin of OLIVIER OLIVIER is a young novice in an Orthodox monastery who cannot help but hide Zamira Labina Mitevska a fugitive Albanian girl from the villagers who want to execute her for murdering a shepherd. He does it out of the goodness of his heart but perhaps also out of the beginnings of a lustful affection for her. They flee north in an attempt to find Kiril's uncle in Skopje and meet with dire hardship and tragedy.Meanwhile in England Anne Katrin Kartlidge most familiar as the lisping goth girl from Mike Leigh's film NAKED a photo editor is in the midst of a personal crisis. She is becoming more and more disaffected with her husband Nick Jay Villiers while experiencing a difficult confused relationship with her lover Aleksandar Rade Serbedzija an awardwinning native Macedonian photographer. Unsure of what to do she distances herself from both men but cannot stem the tide of the turbulent events all around her. The story dispenses with her husband in somewhat contrived way and she ends up trying to find Aleksandar who has since left for Macedonia.Aleksandar returns to his native village only to find that the overall climate has radically changed and the simple life he tries to rediscover has since been made more complex by the feuds with the Albanians. His return is met with mixed reactions from warm welcomes from his close friends to coldshouldering by the newlyarmed local antiAlbanian faction to outright hatred from some of the Albanians. When his childhood love from a neighboring village seeks his aid to help protect her daughter Aleksandar is thrust into the heart of the conflict and his refusal to takes sides has tragic repercussions. Serbedzija interprets the role with a noble morally centered sense of confidence. One of former Yugoslavia's most well known and respected actors Serbedzija found his role to be a way of protesting the conflicts in his regionAs an artist as someone wellknown I had to speak out against nationalism and war. As Aleksandar was presumed to take sides so was I. It's my story. What ends up happening to Aleksandar when cousins take arms against cousins has happened to many in former Yugoslavia and it could happen to me.With its nonlinear structure the timeline of the film is somewhat incoherent and there are some plot developments in the middle segment occurring in England which are a bit too pat. These are balanced by the striking somewhat exotic visuals and original exhilarating neoethnic music by a group called Anastasia fine acting especially by Collin and Serbedzija and an overall poignant sense of the waste of war even a war in its beginnings. Manchevski illuminates his use of the film's titleThere was this sense of something heavy beginning to happen something looming in the air. At the same time life was continuing as before. This story doesn't deal with the political aspects of how wars start. It's about human passion and how it can lead one in different unexpected directions. It's about how a war somewhere in the world might get started and how that can affect your life regardless of where you are. Ultimately it's about taking sides.".

Another centerpiece of this story is a young girl forced to leave her village to try and save her life. The second part is mostly disconnected from part 1 and 3. The English woman is pregnant and having marital problems there is a mafia style shootup in a bar. It is entirely irrelevant to the themes presented in 1 and 3. Part 2 should have been edited to coalesce with 1 and 3. The only reason for the second installment is to provide a backdrop for the photographer to return after a long absence to his native land and witness the fissures developing. Also in part 2 we see photographs of the execution of the fleeing young womanbut at this stage the photographer was already dead!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Before the Rain 1994  After only being available on bootlegged or used but extremely rare DVDs the originals of which were released only in Macedonia and Turkey given away for free in limited number Milcho Manchevski's poetic and soulful examination of the futility of war and circularity of violence is set to be released on DVD proper through Criterion this June. Given that the film won the Oscar for best foreign film and earned numerous accolades from the major critics Siskel and Ebert raved about the film on their show one would have expected to see it on DVD a long time ago but alas it's coming now and getting the proper treatment.The film is set in Macedonia in the early 90s as tensions between the 'native' Macedonians and Muslim Albanians flare. The story is broken into 3 parts  words faces and pictures. Words follows a young monk on a vow of silence for the last 2 years. He finds to his shock one evening in his quarters a young boy hiding in his bed. He runs to tell one of the monastery heads but decides against telling after seeing the fear in the boy's eyes. The next day armed men show up looking for an Albanian girl who allegedly killed a sheep herder. No one knows of the girl but the armed men refuse to leave and keep watch in case she turns up. That night the young Monk Kiril wakes to see the boy again but this time in the light of the moon and realizes that it is not a boy but a girl with her hair chopped off. She is Zamira. He allows her to hide with him only to be discovered later in the night by the other priests. The two are forced out under the cover of darkness wished well on their way. The two seem to be heading for love but that love will be swiftly and brutally taken away from them before it is allowed to materialize.Part 2 faces takes us into the modern hubbub of London where a woman at a photo agency Anne is embroiled in pregnancy and an affair with her Macedonian Coworker Aleksander Rade Serbedzija. He has just returned from an expedition which has apparently traumatized him. His camera has killed a man he says. He asks her to come back to Macedonia with him where he remembers life as peaceful and safe despite her warnings and knowledge of the Balkan conflicts. Being pregnant she cannot go she must meet with her husband. Aleksander leaves alone to return to his homeland. While the war seems far away from bustling London violence and hatred are never as far as they seem. Over dinner Anne first tells her husband she is pregnant it's his and she wants a divorce. Meanwhile a waiter and a patron both speaking Macedonian bicker. The tension in the scene is wrought as Anne struggles to get the right words out and express her feelings and the two men head toward a devastating act of violence for Anne and her Husband.Part 3 pictures returns us to Macedonia and to Aleksander. He arrives home and finds his old home a disaster and finds that his Albanian neighbours are fearful of him. Childhood friends are now bitter enemies hatred runs hot between Macedonians and Albanians. Some in his family seem to be somewhat sympathetic others militant such as his cousin Mitre one of the armed men at the church in the beginning of the film. Aleksander inquires about Hana a woman he used to love and apparently still does. She is Albanian widowed and off limits. He goes to visit her and finds that he must pass a roadblock where he is suspiciously questioned by armed villagers. He is allowed in only after Hana's father confirms his identity. We discover that the man is Zamira's grandfather and she is Hana's daughter. Aleksander will be asked later by Hana to help protect Zamira.I will not reveal here the interconnectedness of the film as it is impossible to do so without revealing major spoilers. We come to realize however that the film is not linear in nature but circular a style employed in a much different film at the same time Pulp Fiction. We also come to realize that there a number of subtle incongruence's in the plot. People who should be dead are alive  timing and events seem to be off. Manchevski was purposeful in his editing and the inconsistencies are not simply goofs. Rather they fit the theme of the film spoken or seen numerous times throughout the film  The circle is not round. Time never dies. The circularity of violence is manifested through the circularity of the plot things don't always look the same but the result always is destruction of life. Before the Rain is a film about our humanity and how it is destroyed by hate how we are not only willing to destroy those we hate because we hate them but that we will destroy those we love when they stand in the way of our hatreds. The film is a scathing indictment of the policies of war and hate rendered through the heart and soul of art. I implore anyone reading this to seek out the film which thankfully will be far more available come this June.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is about Macedonians and Albanians and the deeprooted hatred and mistrust that exists. Filmed on location in Macedonia the photographic images are quite superb and are backed by original enchanting music by Anastasia. The film is divided into 3 parts called Words' Faces and Pictures. I enjoyed the excitement of Part 1 set in and around a monastery high on a cliff overlooking Lake Ohrid. A young Macedonian monk who has taken a vow of silence finds an Albanian girl hiding in his room. He denies her presence when questioned by  the other monks but eventually is found out and is excommunicated.The second part  set in London does not have the haunting appeal of the Macedonian segments. The massacre scene is strong stuff. Altogether it is a sad and violent film which highlights the misery we heap on ourselves through ethnic misunderstanding. The remarkable thing about this film is that it was conceived by Milcho Manchevski before the recent outbreak of hostilities in Kosovo and the displacement of ethnic Albanians. An enigmatic expression is used frequently in the film Time never dies The circle is not round. My interpretation is that we can continually strive for perfection though never attain it.".

Yes it was slightly predictable as these movies often are but I found that was strongly overridden by the comedy and 'slapstick' that happened throughout the film to make it so entertaining. All the family had matured since that first film and it was interesting to see what the children had grown up to be like and how much they had changed since the first film.

That is to say there is little to get out of it so don't waste your time preparing for it. Cheaper by the Dozen 2 is a formulaic family comedy where Steve Martin becomes a father possessed with a drive to outdo another father only to be reminded that his family will still love him no matter if they win the big moviecontrived competition or not. Tom Baker Steve Martin and his wife Kate Bonnie Hunt begin the movie by attending their daughter's graduation ceremony with his 11 other kids. Lorraine's graduation Hilary Duff no singing this time motivates Tom to start thinking about how the family is moving apart from the customary tightknit group he remembers so he wants to take the family on one last vacation. So they load up the cars and vans and head out to some lake somewhere in the Midwest or Canada depending on the film's budget a lake that has seen the evil Jimmy Murtaugh Eugene Levy buy up all of the land and build super lake homes on the shore. Jimmy and Tom have a history one that is sort of dumb and is one of those back stories that can only be written for a story like this one. I really like Eugene Levy as a comedic actor but I don't think he was right for this role. Levy excels in understated humor where his character has no idea he's being funny. The role of Jimmy is overthetop and clich and I didn't think he fit the role well at all. Carmen Electra plays Jimmy's wife and she's actually very good at playing the bimbo wife when given the chance and the kid actors are generally good as well. The story is predictable and only mildly entertaining but I guess families will enjoy the night out and there is a certain sweet charm to the final scenes of the film.".

I have really enjoyed some of Steve's movies...Roxanne Being There etc. but he seems to have lost his touch in this one.This movie is still very watchable mind you but the former Steve is missing. It seems there were too many gags ie dog  crotch dangling from balcony and not enough real comedy like we're used to from Steve such as the nose jokes in Roxanne.Also this movie has nothing to do with the 1950 Cheaper by the Dozen or it's original sequel Belles on Their Toes...other than 12 kids of course. It seemed more akin to The Great Outdoors or Meatballs.There were some cute scenes however The two kids crush  the dads both spying on them in the theatre and nearly giving birth in a canoe I found amusing. It would have been a lot more amusing had she actually given birth in the canoe though.Oddly my favourite actress in this was the little girl can't remember her name right now who had the crush on the little boy. She was really cute and engaging. I hope she appears in more movies.Thankfully I did not pay money to see this thanks to the wonders of bittorrent But I will definitely be buying the DVD. It is a good family movie just not up to my expectations for Steve Martin.Possibly I should not endorse downloading but moviegoing is difficult where I live as it entails a long costly ferry trip. Otherwise I probably would have seen this in a theatre.".

It seems there were too many gags ie dog  crotch dangling from balcony and not enough real comedy like we're used to from Steve such as the nose jokes in Roxanne.Also this movie has nothing to do with the 1950 Cheaper by the Dozen or it's original sequel Belles on Their Toes...other than 12 kids of course. It seemed more akin to The Great Outdoors or Meatballs.There were some cute scenes however The two kids crush  the dads both spying on them in the theatre and nearly giving birth in a canoe I found amusing. It would have been a lot more amusing had she actually given birth in the canoe though.Oddly my favourite actress in this was the little girl can't remember her name right now who had the crush on the little boy. She was really cute and engaging. I hope she appears in more movies.Thankfully I did not pay money to see this thanks to the wonders of bittorrent But I will definitely be buying the DVD. It is a good family movie just not up to my expectations for Steve Martin.Possibly I should not endorse downloading but moviegoing is difficult where I live as it entails a long costly ferry trip. Otherwise I probably would have seen this in a theatre.";

This only complicates the rivalry even further although the movie saves itself by not trying to imitate Romeo and Juliet. Stoner didn't disappoint me too much in this case as she tries to hide her burgeoning girlish nature from those who know her as the havocwreaking tomboy she is. A lot has been made of this subplot as well as the scene where Sarah is caught trying to steal makeup and later agrees to let Lorraine perform a makeover on her for her first date. Does it have to be pink she asks. Well if it's a darker color it wouldn't make you attractive to the boy but perhaps that's just me. In any case she doesn't really look that much different afterwards and although both fathers screw up their date like I suggested it's not a big tragedy.For a sequel it's fine. Not perfect but fine. People who complain about sequelmania in modern movies often forget that the original had a sequel too... a somewhat forgotten movie called Belles On Their Toes1952. Having said that I hope this second movie is the last. Interestingly enough I also saw the remake of Yours Mine and Ours on the same day but you can probably figure that out by my review of that movie as well.".

So we have the summer release the 2 hot teens one hot mom carmen Electra looked spectacular the overzealous and protective dad the childhood romance etc etc you get what I'm saying right.The acting of this movie is good with special mention for Steve Martin who is a regular comedy dad and even though brings nothing new to the film at least insures you never get bored. Eugene Levy also does a good job playing the eccentric dad of the rival family. Carmen Electra i realised is actually a good actress and looks great in this movie. However former preteenqueen Hilary duff looked way to thin and quite ugly.The jokes of the film mostly squeaky clean although there is some much appreciated jokes for the adults that are so needed in this film. Particularly funny is the scene where the dog spoils the elaborate lunch the take on another famous creature movie was hilarious. The film is filled with funny moments that will make you smile maybe force a half laugh but no scene is fall out your seat funny.The film also serves the regular family fare with ease but almost every scene looks run of the mill and there is nothing new to add to film in the familycomedydrama department. Being from India i found the father following his child on a date quite funny and something which i can actually picture someone who i know doing.The movie is absolute run of the mill affair and loosed out on the novelty value that the first one enjoyed. However it serves the regular enjoyable family fare.Watch it only if the company family going with friend and his girl friend for the first movie hehe requires that you watch such a film.".

It offers a few laughs but not enough to sustain its running time. The original film was an okay family film nothing special. The sequel is more or less the same and it also makes for a decent family film. I was expecting a little more though. There are a few interesting subplots but the main premise is very silly. I know it's a family movie and all but why did the story have to be so generic? Since the script is weak there is a lack of character development the film is kind of boring. There are a few funny gags and performances but they aren't good enough to save the movie.The acting is okay and only a couple people give good performances. The best performance is given by Alyson Stoner. Her character goes through the most development and she handles it pretty well. Liliana Mumy and Morgan York also give good performances though they don't get a lot of screen time. The strength of the comedy should have been the rivalry between Steve Martin and Eugene Levy. Levy is only mildly funny while Steve Martin is not funny at all. He just tries too hard and it comes off as annoying. Bonnie Hunt gives a decent performance and she has a few funny lines. Hilary Duff gives an annoying performance as Lorraine and she's hardly in the film which is a good thing. Carmen Electra makes for good eye candy but she doesn't do anything special. Piper Perabo and Jamie King both give decent performances. Tom Welling just gives a bland performance while Jonathon Bennett only has a few lines and his character is not developed at all.Director Adam Shankman only does an okay job behind the camera. I like the way he captures the Baker family and their love for one another. There are some nice moments in the movie about family values and the ending is pretty nice. Besides for that he just keeps the film bland and uninteresting while leaving out some of the Baker kids. On the one hand I wanted the film to be longer than 90 minutes so all the characters could have been portrayed well. On the other hand if they had kept the same story and made the film longer then the movie would have been unbearable. On a last note compared to Yours Mine and Ours Cheaper by the Dozen 2 looks like a masterpiece. In the end the movie is only average but it should make for a nice rental if you're looking for a family film. Rating 510".

It was a lot of fun and it never seemed to run our of energy especially for the always funny Steve Martin. Martin is back in this sequel and so is much of the same cast Bonnie Hunt in particular. Joining the original cast is a new set of players including American PIE regular Eugene Levy parodymovie regular Carmen Electra and another batch of kids and teens. This is CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2 and if I was wrong about the first film I was more wrong to think this one will be better.In this sequel the family that couldn't get along leaves all their indifference behind a long time ago. Now their one big happy family. While going on a camping vacation as usual they have to live inside a rotten old cabin they get into some competition with dad Tom Baker's Martin old rival Jimmy Murtaugh Levy and his family composed of sexy wife Sarina Electra and eight children. See Murtaugh is athletic and daring while Tom only wishes that his kids jealous as always would have a better vacation. So on goes a series of challenges and competitions they go through fighting for who gets the better summer this year.Unfortunately it might have not been the audience. Having missed it on the big screen I caught CHEAPER 2 on TV and since I wasn't really anticipating anything a sequel to CHEAPER is nothing big to get excited about. That probably helps to be able to enjoy a movie like this. But while lowering your expectations might help at being kind to your response to it that doesn't necessarily mean liking it. Martin and Levy funny men by the way are at their best efforts as Hunt playing responsible mother Kate but they can't shine in a script than limits what they can do. Kids as usual will drag you to the video store to rent or buy it and maybe you should. But don't be surprised if you won't like it. It really isn't made for you.Rating  out of 5.".

Unfortunately it is bought by an old rival with a big family of his own. This leads to an aged competition that goes back and forth for the rest of the film. Standard screenplay with very little to surprise anyone. Directed by Adam Shankman who previously made the unremarkable The Wedding Planner. He does his best with what little he is given. Steve Martin is involved in several mishaps while trying to encourage family activities. Bonnie Hunt is the voice of reason as she was before. Eugene Levy joins as the standard rival who acts like he is twelve and Carmen Electra plays his much younger wife who is surprisingly understanding but still pretty cardboard. Hilary Duff makes an appearance as one of Martin's daughters but it is merely just a celebrity appearance. Nobody seems challenged least of all of production designer. The children get older but that is hardly the purpose here. This film exits purely due to success of the first film which is watchable at best. This film got cheaper by several dozen. Score 1  10".

No mention of their old home no mention of Mark being Fedex in the first movie he's practically WALLPAPER here! or of Beans SERIOUSLY! they don't mention the frog that died! or even of their jobs. Hell they don't even mention any of the characters from the first movie. They don't even show the house except for a few brief minutes at the beginning!!On top of that none of the characters seem interesting anymore. I already mentioned in my review for the first movie that I hated Clark but at least I had a reason to loathe him because he was so moody and he had some purpose being antagonized by Sam Winchester. Here he's just...funny. And just the silly kind of funny. That I felt Hank was in the first movie when he wasn't being treated as an antagonist. And oh yeah...Hank is replaced with some silly guy. But since he's not an antagonist he's not interesting.This is not a sequel. The first movie was horrid but at least the kind of horrid that made for an interesting first viewing.

The film has heart and that's what works for it. Shankman and his cast and crew must have had a great time as was also apparent on the DVD extras. Steve Martin and Eugene Levy are good. Martin has played the comedic family dad perhaps more than a dozen times and he has become quite skilled at it. The extremely talented Bonnie Hunt is criminally underused but she has an effective presence nonetheless. Carmen Electra is a surprise. She plays a hot mom but not the clichd one rather one that is compassionate gentle and caring. Electra does a good job and proves that she can do more than being just an airhead or a seductress. Piper Perabo is also underused. Jaime King is very pretty. Hilary Duff plays sort of a spoilt brat which is a change from her sweet pretty girl image but her acting is quite bad and she needs to eat. The child actors were all fun to watch. Overall it's all goofy family fun and quite enjoyable when watching with the family.".

Not only are the laughs or even attempts at laughs few and far between but and resemblance to hilarity is not even close enough for the movie to shake it's ugly stick at.I feel ripped off for paying so much to see such a horrible movie. I hate to sound like the old timers but if this is any indication of where cinema is going leave me out.";

It's a colorful occasionally moody historical adventure shot on Shaw Bros.' sprawling Hong Kong backlot and features a climactic battle in which the titular hero takes on an army of bad guys singlehanded.David plays a swordsman tricked into a duel to defend his honor with a corrupt swordfighting teacher Ku Feng who causes him to cut off his own arm. He leaves the gallant fraternity' and broods in isolation making a living as a waiter at a roadside tavern. When a wandering swordsman played by Ti Lung learns who he is and gives him a pep talk David is stirred but refuses to take action. When Ti is killed by the same corrupt teacher who uses a lethal threesection staff David is finally spurred to action and armed with a dead warrior's sword given to him by the tavern owner's sympathetic daughter Li Ching he goes after the offending gang of fighters and figures out a 3sword move designed to beat the 3section staff. Before he's through he leaves a trail of corpses littering a massive bridge leading to the gang's fortress.David Chiang may not have been the best martial artist but he had a wiry energetic quality that served him well in this type of slashing and swirling fighting style. He also exuded a brooding intensity that came in handy in his portrayal of the onetime swordsman who is crippled both physically and psychologically and has turned his back on his calling. Chiang and Ti Lung worked well together in violent tales of male bonding in turbulent eras. The villains here Ku Feng and Chen Sing both excelled at playing devious and crafty characters capable of unctuous charm one minute and great cruelty the next.Famed martial arts director Lau Kar Leung worked on the fight scenes in which kung fu takes a back seat to swashbucklerstyle sword and weapons play. Lau was an expert in both styles of fighting. This was one of a group of costume epics made by Chang Cheh prior to his series of Shaolinthemed martial arts films dating from 197376 which put kung fu in the foreground and were made initially in collaboration with Lau who broke off in 1975 to direct his own films.".

A hotheaded up and coming hero a diabolical plot was hatched by Lung I Ching a veteran swordsman in the martial arts world to keep these young upstarts at bay. With his threejointpoles which always seem to defy gravity he schemes and manages to duel with Lei Li defeating him and caused Li's arm to be chopped off.Herein lies the difference between this One Armed Swordsman and the original Fang Gang. Fang Gang had lost his arm because someone else hacked it off in a fit of rage. Here Lei Li actually gambled with his arm  the loser of the duel would have to remove it and retire from society. While Fang Gang had to learn his martial arts all over again Lei Li was already skilled with his left hand because he was originally ambidextrous. Also Fang Gang's weapon of choice is his father's iconic broken sword Lei Li doesn't seem to have any preference and could fight with any.While there is a token romance with the daughter of a village blacksmith the introduction of a special sword didn't seem to auger well and it didn't last  it lacked something special be it emotions or prowess and seemed too generic. Anyway I can't help but to chuckle at Ti Lung's character Feng ChunChieh also a young upcoming swordsman who uses two swords. ChunChieh and Lei Li formed a sense of brotherhood when the former protected the latter from bullies only because the latter doesn't wish to use his martial arts skills anymore. They become fast friends but from the way their scenes were shot  the numerous hugs backslapping arm holding eyes longing you might be expecting one of them to say that if only he knew how to quit the other.That aside you'd come to expect the usual ketchup blood laden violence which have become the hallmarks of Chang Cheh's swordfighting movies. Here it doesn't get any less bloody and scenes can be quite graphic with the numerous decapitations of limbs and one really interesting decapitation of half a human body across the waist. There are plenty of set action pieces like that iconic fight on the bridge with many footsoldiers simultaneously. Scenes like these are what Tarantino adopted in his homage Kill Bill double feature where the hero goes on an unstoppable roaring rampage. Though I must admit the introductory fights don't contribute much to the plot  just there for the sake of showing off what Lei Li can achieve.All in all it's great fun just to watch what our parents were watching as they grew up and comparing these films to the standards of today. While cheesy the good old classics stand out for their groundbreaking effort in those days to bring us what has evolved till now.Code 3 DVD contains minimal extras just one trailer a photo gallery the original poster one general paragraph passing off as production notes a biography and selected filmography of the cast and crew.".

And I don't like the current stuff with too much CG and wirework.That said I love this film. Especially in the original Mandarin. Fine production values two heroes Chiang and Jimmy Wang Yu and a great villain Hero Lung. A classic movie baddie.The only possible improvement would be if Bruce Lee had starred. Still I'll have to say Chian is perfect as a young master swordsman who would rather cut off his own arm than live with dishonor.I've heard that Jimmy Wang Yu was not a trained martial artist but a pretty tough guy in real life. Too cute guys.".

And I don't like the current stuff with too much CG and wirework.That said I love this film. Especially in the original Mandarin. Fine production values two heroes Chiang and Jimmy Wang Yu and a great villain Hero Lung. A classic movie baddie.The only possible improvement would be if Bruce Lee had starred. Still I'll have to say Chian is perfect as a young master swordsman who would rather cut off his own arm than live with dishonor.I've heard that Jimmy Wang Yu was not a trained martial artist but a pretty tough guy in real life. Too cute guys.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's very confusing. Director Che Chang made a series of five films which starred Yu Wang as the OneArmed Swordsman. However Chang ALSO made some other films with the phrase 'OneArmed Swordsman' in the title...but not the same guy! In this case the great martial arts actor David Chiang stars as Lei Li...A OneArmed Swordsman! Confused? I sure know I was! It is possible that the titles I am talking about are only the English language titles...but they do involve a hero who is missing an arm. My assumption is that the franchise was so successful that Chang decided to put out as many onearmed films as possible! Oddly however this is the only one armed film with Lei Li.By the way the version of this I was was the American dubbed one. Because of this it might have been edited heavily...I have no idea but this often is the case with martial arts films. It is a Shaw Brothers film...which generally is a VERY good thing as they tended to make some of the best martial arts film of the era.When this film begins we can see that Lei Li is kind of stupid...at least when it comes to losing his arm. He's attacked by some jerks and he defeats them. When their master comes along and confronts Lei Li for this Lei Li challenges him to a dueland the loser promises to give up an arm!!! Naturally the master wins and he's decent about it...telling Lei Li to forget about the bet. But Lei Li is an idiot and soon lops off his arm in a memorable and silly scene! This is how this onearmed dude came to be in this film. Unfortunately after this Lei Li is pretty defenseless....or so he thinks. Jerks come to town and bully the crap out of him...simply because everyone sees him as a useless onearmed guy...and he is during much of the film. What happens next to make him go from a onearmed loser to a onearmed hero? See the film and find out for yourself.This is clearly a better than average martial arts film. Even with the celerycrunching sound effects and silly dubbing typical of most films in the genre the fighting scenes are better than usual and the story a bit different from other onearmed films. Oddly however they did no followup films with Lei Li...and I would have enjoyed this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chang Cheh had already directed an iconic OneArmed Swordsman Jimmy Wang Yu a few years earlier but for reasons unknown to me decided to 'reboot' with The New OneArmed Swordsman featuring David Chiang as the protagonist. Unlike stern and stonedfaced Wang Yu Chiang plays the everjolly jovial Lei Li a very skilled traveling swordsman who is forced to cut his own right arm off after loosing a fight with villainous mastermind Lung IChih Feng Ku leader of the Tiger Gang. Li retires from being a fighter and resigns himself to becoming an aid at a local restaurant constantly subjected to the mockery of the patrons. When fellow traveling swordsman Feng ChunChieh Lung Ti rides into town he and Li bond almost immediately but Feng likewise looses a battle with IChih and is killed in the process. Li swear vengeance and goes up against IChih his supposedly unbeatable weapon an interlinked tripleiron staff a weapon that can only be bested by three swords and his army of goons.The New OneArmed Swordsman was one of the first Hong Kong films to become a hit in WestGermany under the title Das Schwert des gelben Tigers or The Sword of the yellow Tiger sparking a wave similarminded films to flood the market. Indeed during the early 1980s you'd have been hardpressed to pass a cinema that was not showing at least one Kung Fu flick or a video store that wasn't stacked.Especially David Chiang does an amazing job being very charismatic at the same time makes the viewer believe that he could pull it off and decimate a legion of fighters with only one arm. Like in many other movies that feature this duo Chiang and Lung Ti have a very good chemistry something like the Dean Martin  Jerry Lewis of martial arts movie. Perhaps even too good a chemistry As some may have pointed out the constant gazing at each other and assuring themselves of their friendship at times reminds one of Brokeback Mountain and relegates the supposed loveinterest the cuteasabutton Ching Lee to a mere sisterfigure. Feng Ku is a reliable baddie and is well versed in changing from an almost fatherly figure to a menacing fighting machine within an instant.The specialeffects are bloody but may seem a little dated especially in times where most martialartsmovies are saturated with CGI and actors flying around on wires. But for those interested in honest hardworking Kung Fu and sword fights there can be few better recommendations than The New OneArmed Swordsman.810".

For me their best work seems to be that made in the early 1970s in which the plots were still delightfully oldfashioned but the action was harderhitting than ever. This film happens to be extraordinarily gory the goriest I've seen from Shaw outside of FIVE ELEMENT NINJAS.The plot is a reprisal of the films that made Jimmy Wang Yu a star i.e. THE ONEARMED SWORDSMAN and its sequel. David Chiang is the hero who loses his arm in a duel and becomes a reclusive waiter until Ti Lung shows up and galvanises him into action once more. Chang Cheh was an excellent director and he's at the top of his game here not only are the widespread action sequences impressively skilled and visually masterful but the rest of the movie looks fantastic too especially the framing shots. The incredible bloodshed is really ghoulish here and really goes over the edge at times. Chiang has never been better as the brooding hero  don't expect any of his trademark humour here  and Ti Lung excels in a starmaking turn. Add in Ku Feng's truly malevolent bad guy and you have a classic of Shaw cinema.".

Zita Perczel an attractive blonde actress plays Erzsi the daughter of pompous businessman Sandor. She wants to marry Istvan Bodo a handsome young novelist. Just now this particular novelist is struggling aren't they all? but the pengoes are sure to come rolling in just as soon as Istvan publishes his latest novel. Oh so that's how it works. Sandor showing what his priorities are makes it plain that he consents to his daughter's marriage to this bum I mean this novelist only providing that Istvan's novel is a success. Actor Gyula Csortos  who reminds me of Edward Arnold  gives a good performance as Erzsi's father he makes it quite clear that he's giving his conditional consent only because he's confident that the novel will never sell.But then the book gets published to favourable reviews and suddenly Sandor must scramble to sabotage the novel's success so as to block the marriage. Why doesn't he just withdraw his consent? Come to that if Istvan becomes financially successful why does Erzsi even need her father's consent?There's a funny performance by Gyula Kabos as Szalai the publisher's publicity agent. He runs an advert in the Budapest papers purporting to be a personal ad from a nonexistent wealthy young man seeking matrimony if he can find just the right young woman a woman like the heroine in Istvan Bodo's novel. Naturally this causes a run on book sales as mercenary women hope to read the novel so as to pattern themselves after its heroine.There's a 'surprise' ending that's really no surprise at all. Thanks to Szalai Istvan's novel sells so well that Istvan is now a wealthy young man seeking matrimony just like the guy in the ad. And  surprise surprise  he based his novel's heroine on Erzsi. So the young man in the advertisement guess who does indeed marry a woman just like the one in the novel guess who. I could see this coming from the other side of the Danube.As I say this is froth and it certainly has its charms without expanding the sum total of cinema craft. Good performances all round and some impressive direction and exteriors. 'Danube Rendezvous' achieves what it sets out to do entertain audiences and nothing more. I'll rate this movie 8 points out of 10.".

They pursue their betrayers and are themselves pursued. But the film maintains an unexpectedly slow pace for this type of movie despite being basically a chase story. You almost get the feeling that all of the actors are waiting nervously for Charriere to do something throughout the film but he spends a lot of time sitting and thinking and smoking before answering questions in a heavilyaccented English.Charriere seems to have gotten a bit too comfortable by the time he made this film looking a bit too portly to be taken seriously as a swashbuckling fistfighting burglar. The film also contains the typical countercultural themes of the time involving fear of aging which was perhaps a bit of a marketing ploy to the audiences of the time. It seems a bit out of place in the overall story.Read Henri Charriere's two autobiographies first then perhaps watch the Steve McQueen filmversion of the first book which was released only a few months before Charriere died . Only then will you maybe acquire the curiosity to see the man behind the amazing books. Otherwise you may fall asleep before the film is over.".

Poor production values especially the sound editing which may have been at least partly caused by overdubs as the cast seems to have been from all over Italy France Spain UK. And Charriere is awful his English is all but incomprehensible and his acting is a flat as the surface of a CD. The story might have been interesting if the dialogue had been written better and the director and crew more talented. As is it's only real value is seeing Charriere on film as he died shortly before the release of the Steve McQueenDustin Hoffman film Papillion based on his memoir.".

Seven years later when he meets Cassie's son Sebastian Robinson Wally sees many of his mannerisms in the kid. This should be interesting. Funny too. First of all there is nothing uncomfortable in here. But it is Sebastian who will get to you. The banter between Cassie and Wally is good but when Sebastian comes on the scene you know you have to see this through. Believe me the kid will get to you. The lines and not entirely easy ones that Thomas Robinson has to say as Sebastian are unbelievable in that they are flawless and to the point. Amazing for a 6yr old going on 30. There is comedy but it comes between Wally and Sebastian and it's quite enjoyable. You find yourself wishing there were more scenes with Wally and Sebastian. These scenes are the hooks and why you stay. There is some adult humor too but it's old hat and kind of expected. Nice to see Jason Bateman getting a lead and this should be a stepping stone to other leads. The chemistry between Bateman and Aniston was good for the characters they portrayed. Aniston is still Rachel character from the Friends TV show and seems most comfortable with that role so there is nothing new with her in here. Hey we like Rachel. What's not to like? She had a chance to branch out when she did DERAILED a good drama with with Clive Owen but that was just a onetime thing apparently. Too bad as she was good in that one. Jeff Goldblum performed well as always but still has that Gary Shandling look on his face like he is going to burst out laughing hysterically at any moment. All the cast performed to expectations and that was very good. This does play out like a madeforTV movie but the chemistry between Bateman and Robinson makes it all worthwhile. This was their show.

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see the sneak preview of this movie last night walking in with low expectations. I'm not a huge fan of Jennifer Anniston and the concept sounded a bit low brow...so I went in pretty cynical. I was pleasantly surprised! It not only didn't suck but was actually pretty great. I thought the subject could have easily made this very cringe worthy and hard to believe  and yet it was handled in such a way that it didn't seem THAT farfetched as Hollywood movies goand the characters remained believable and even sympathetic at times.I LOVED Jason Bateman's character. He is negative neurotic funny and cute all at the same time. Aniston played her role very classy and did not try to be cutesy or overly dramatic.I rarely believe cute little kids in movies yet the show stealer for me was Sebastian the son. This kid is going to be a super star one day if he keeps it up! He is just the right amount of adorablequirky while never overdoing it. His big brown eyes well up with tears in just the right way choked me up a couple of times and yet could deliver 'quirk' with complete deadpan expression. Brilliant! All in all I laughed teared up and managed to enjoy every minute of the experience. Is it Citizen Kane? No. But it's darn good entertainment.".

	schema:headline " Tired Insemination Premise Gives Rise to a Surprisingly Sharp Comedy with a Smart Cast";
	schema:reviewBody "If the Hollywood studios still made the type of urban comedies they made back in the early 1970's starring George Segal usually as a neurotic nebbish then Jason Bateman's bigscreen career would certainly be secure. As he displayed consistently on Arrested Development the actor's dry delivery and slyly observant manner are a perfect match for Wally Mars the comically cynical equities analyst he plays in this sadly overlooked 2010 romantic comedy codirected by Will Speck and Josh Gordon who much to my surprise helmed the Will Ferrell figureskating comedy Blades of Glory. Although he is the true protagonist of the story the movie was marketed as a Jennifer Aniston vehicle. She plays rising TV producer Kassie Larson his longago girlfriend who has relegated him to the friend zone even though he obviously hasn't gotten over her.Written with verve by Allen Loeb who also cowrote Aniston's recent 2011 movie the Adam Sandler starrer Just Go With It the story revolves around Kassie's ticking biological clock. In a sevenyearsback flashback she is seen deliberately bypassing Wally as a possible sperm donor in favor of a more predictable candidate Roland a struggling associate professor at Columbia who happens to be married and dropdead handsome. At an insemination party Wally gets wasted and drops the carelessly placed vial of Roland's semen down the bathroom sink. This leaves Wally no choice but to replace the sample himself. Kassie eventually becomes pregnant and moves back home to Minnesota. Flash forward to the present and Kassie returns to Manhattan with her sixyearold son Sebastian in tow. The fact that Sebastian acts like a miniature version of Wally gets completely past Kassie but not Wally who slowly realizes that out of his stupor years ago his son was conceived.Although this indiscretion would seem like the perfect excuse for Wally to reveal his true feelings for Kassie complications ensue when she starts a relationship with Roland now desperately on the rebound from a bitter divorce. At the same time Wally forms a close bond with Sebastian who naturally gravitates toward him because of their mutual idiosyncrasies. Bateman handles Wally's evolution from selfabsorbed fatalist to paternal protector with aplomb and surprising depth. Aniston is better served here than in most of her standardissue romantic comedies and the sharp interplay between these two actors especially in the beginning scenes is refreshingly rapidfire like a modernday His Girl Friday. With his constantly forlorn expression interrupted by moments of genuine happiness Thomas Robinson is terrifically understated as Sebastian and his unforced scenes with Bateman represent the true high points of the film.A crack supporting cast has been assembled. As Wally's best friend and manager the sarcastic ladies' man Leonard Jeff Goldblum takes a predictable role and gives it his special offkilter twist. The result is his funniest turn in years for example his use of the term illadvised during the moment of revelation is hilariously unexpected. The same can also be said for Juliette Lewis who plays Kassie's constantly inappropriate best friend Debbie with her spacey delivery intact as she slings clever putdowns at Wally. Even Patrick Wilson saddled with the nowin role of the golden boy Roland who has no capacity for honest introspection is funny in a role that gets diabolically transparent as the proceedings get complicated. The 2011 DVDBluRay offers a standard set of extras  a fifteenminute makingof featurette The Switch Conceived about ten deleted and alternate scenes running for nearly half an hour in total one a more purposeful variation on the central scene and a brief blooper reel. Give it a try.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I saw The Switch over this weekend and I must say I expected this to be a complete failure and it surprised me to not be that. Matter of fact the movie stands out pretty well through Aniston's filmography. The story is not complicated runs smooth and gets your attention. The story revolves around Wally Mars Jason Bateman a middleage single guy who has a hardtime finding his match and Kassie Larson Jennifer Aniston his bestfriend. At Kassie's semenparty Wally gets drunk and switches the donator's sperm with his own without realizing and forgetting completely about what happened to next day. After seven years of being separated by distance Kassie movies back to her town and of course she starts to talk again to her bestfriend. Problems appear only when Wally sees that Kassie's kid is acting pretty much similar like him so he remembers what he did and decides to tell Kassie the truth. Of course this story has it's clichs and I'm the most bored person on the earth by clichs but this movie is a little bit different. It's not that funny it has it's funny moments which were handled well but the movie itself is more of a romance than a comedy so I enjoyed it more than others who expected a million laughs from it.As far as the acting this is definitely Aniston's best movie this year and I liked her attitude in this even though she portrays almost the same character but it's such an improvement from The Bounty Hunter. Jason Bateman was very good hilarious at points as usual and actually approached a more serious tone for this role. The rest was good and I really was not bothered by anything at all. The characters were lovely and I was surprised for them to not look overacted and exaggerated.The cinematography editing were pretty much normal nothing to be mentioned and the score was as usual typical for a romantic movie. With all these I want to say that this movie is not BAD and I don't understand people who love to bash this movie just for it's clichs and stuff like that. This movie is a simple good time for a boring afternoon. It's far from being great but it's such a better choice than most of the wack stuff that studios put out.".

I would have loved for this to have been a serious drama. Bateman plays the best friend that is clearly in love with Aniston. Not THAT clearly but we assume correctly so because this film isn't going to surprise us. She decides to have a baby with sperm donor Patrick Wilson once again wasted. Bateman drunkenly spills the sperm and replaces it with his own. This isn't really the kind of plot I look for in my comedies unless they are gross out or dark. This film revolves around this being some kind of charming act. 7 years later he realizes what he has done but just telling Aniston would be too clever for this film. Instead he bottles it up and lets it all out at the most inappropriate time. There is nothing to like about this character. He sneakily sends guys away from Aniston gets drunk to suppress his feelings unknowingly fathers her child lies and ruins lives. He is a foul waste of space but this film shows him to be the charming hero. Wilson meanwhile is recovering from a divorce and is looking forward to getting involved in his supposed child's life. He is cruelly sidelined. He is much more likable than the leads. Though I respect the decision to not make him out to be a typical villain they could have least explored him. Here we have a guy trying to overcome a difficult time and takes responsibility even though he needn't. Who the hell wrote this? Had Bateman raped Aniston or swapped her baby we'd be in horror territory. This really has me questioning humanity but I suppose the fact it inspires forgiveness is something.".

It was Jason Bateman that really carried this film. He's a very underrated actor. The film is about friend of the opposite sex with one the male of course having more feelings than the other. When he finds out that she wants to have a baby and is looking for the perfect man for his sperm he's hurt cause she didn't pick him. The film really explores parenthood in the modern age and also dynamics of friends and even fatherhood. It's a comedy but it has many dramatic and poignant elements to it. I'd recommend it.".

Jennifer Aniston wants to have a baby so she throws a party to celebrate her sperm donor. Jason Bateman plays her best friend who gets drunk and accidentally spills the contents down the sink. He replaces it with his own jerked off recipe with complete inspiration of Diane Sawyer. Directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck who are backed with total contrivance. They do their best with one of the lamest scripts produced this year. Bateman fares okay as someone accepting possible fatherhood but the signs of birthright are total bullshit annoyances such as the whole noisy eating thing. Aniston takes the predictable road to dating the sperm donor before Bateman gives the reality shout out. We know where this is headed and it gains nothing more than a mighty yawn from me. Jeff Goldblum and Juliette Lewis play either parties best friends and both are total cardboard. Goldblum gets to get up in the middle of the night and listen to Bateman drone on about Aniston and the whole sperm process. Lewis is annoying as Aniston's friend whom Bateman nor the audience is very fond of. One could see how a concept such as this could have had potential but the provisions of bad screen writing must remain within the realms of formula. This is one of those cheesy stories that hides behind a theme of parenthood when in reality it is jerking you off worse than anything Bateman did in the washroom. Parental theme is switched with lousy writing. Score 3   10".

	schema:reviewBody "The Switch 2010Okay it would be easy to dis this movie as a canned obvious emotionally thin contrivance. It's a vehicle for two popular stars playing characters in their 30s who are despite good looks and basic social skills single and childless. They have to fall in love but life gets in the way in kind of stupid ways. You can't take it seriously and you can't even quite care enough to hope for the best whatever that is.But it's also easy to like this movie despite its obviousness. Jason Bateman is a joy to watch. Maybe his performance is like the movieglib and facile. But like the movie he is endlessly watchable and his character is the one with the most depth. His interactions with the boy of six or so are terrific. The boy too is adorable and helps the movie get some feeling.Jennifer Aniston plays the woman who wants a child but has no one willing to be the dad more or less though the viewer knows better. And she's a terrific actress actually even if her role here and elsewhere is often not as demanding as it could be. I suppose Meg Ryan has some kind of edge on her for this kind of stereotypethe lovable lonely urban girl who just can't get love right despite the obviousbut Aniston is an update on that type.But it is Aniston and Bateman together that really make the movie glide along and make you smile. They have great rapport and good timing comedic and serious both. I wouldn't say they have chemistry I guess that's the problem their characters have so maybe it's great acting but they make their scenes pop in a way the rest of the movie trundles. The story writer Jeffrey Eugenides is better known for sprawling novels and lots of interrelated characters but even there there are little hooks that come off a hair obvious. That's the problem here in the end. There's a big trick a wonderful and funny hook of an idea and that almost alone has to handle all the consequences. Some better character development would have been a joy.Oh and it's been a long time since a movie with two directors has been able to pull off consistency. I don't know the logistics behind it but maybe one of the hesitations all along is a lack of singular conviction. Or not. Maybe this is such a formula product any number of directors could have chipped in.Watch it for the two leads together. And for some fun warm laughs if that's your thing. I enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE SWITCH is another story about artificial insemination and the impact it has on the participants. Yes it has been done many times with varying results but what makes this version of the story different and worthy of merit and attention is the sparkling screenplay by Allan Loeb adapted from the short story 'Baster' by gifted author Jeffrey Eugenides 'Middlesex' 'The Virgin Suicides' 'My Mistress's Sparrow is Dead' and short stories 'The Speed of Sperm' 'Air Mail' 'Ancient Myths' etc. It is a film that gives us the opportunity to remember the fine comic time of Jeff Goldblum Jennifer Aniston Jason Bateman and Juliet Lewis courtesy of the fine direction by Josh Gordon and Will Speck.. Wally Mars Jason Bateman is an oddly neurotic character who has a very difficult time connecting to people especially in the dating department. His best friend is Kassie Larson Jennifer Aniston a successful woman who abruptly decides her biologic clock is ticking down and decides to have a baby by paying a sperm donor. Wally is shocked but Kassie's other best friend Debbie Juliette Lewis bubbling brilliantly supports her conviction to take charge of her life and plans a party to celebrate Kassie's incipient 'donation'. Kassie selects a potential donor in Roland Patrick Wilson who is a square and married teacher but 'needs the money'. At the party when the 'donation' is to be deposited Wally gets drunk and accidentally spills Roland's 'contribution' and in drunken desperation replaces it with his own  a secret he doesn't even share with Leonard Jeff Goldblum with whom he works and has a strong friendship. The inseminated Kassie moves back home returning seven years later with her sixyear old son Sebastian Thomas Robinson a very fine child actor. Kassie courts the now divorced Roland a blow to Wally who in his 'babysitting' chores grows close to Sebastian who is very much like Wally. How the story ends is predictable but heartwarmingly humorous especially watching the relationship between Wally and Sebastian develop. In addition to the strong cast of leading actors there are cameos by Kelli Barrett and especially the significantly impressive Scott Elrod watch this young actor's career blossom!. Largely due to the smart dialogue delivered by specialists in comedy this film works well. Grady Harp".

Poor Jason Bateman who certainly has shown great comedic skills in the past gets the dubious assignment of playing a complete schmuck with absolutely no backbone why Jennifer Aniston falls for him in the first place is beyond most human reasoning. The absurd plot involves Bateman getting drunk at a sperm donor party for Aniston she and Jason are just friends and then accidentally switching his specimen with the intended party a madetolookfoolish Patrick Wilson. Then Jennifer conveniently moves out of town until she has the child an obnoxious son similar to his obnoxious dad and returns a few years later. When Jason finally sees the kid he immediately recognizes his offspringbut fails to admit the truth to Jennifer and thereby drags the movie on and on. In the middle of this nonsense Jennifer's sort of best friend Juliette Lewis gets to thrown in a few offcolor jokes and Jeff Goldblum Jason's understanding colleague acts like he wandered onto the wrong set. His glazed look is all one needs to know regarding his contempt for the material. The end result is that this bomb of a film made no money and everyone involved should be totally embarrassed. How this movie and its premise ever passed muster with studio executives will never be explained. Suffice to say that someone probably lost hisher job when the dismal receipts came in.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have made no secret of disliking a lot of SyFy's movies but I do keep watching them for the novelty valueif anyand to see whether they actually do something worthwhile. Actually like I have said a few times already SyFy have thrown out some stuff that are not that bad in comparison to their usual standards. But most of the time their movies range from lame to bottomofthebarrel.Miami Magma is far from SyFy's worst seriously I'd rather watch this again rather than rewatch something like Titanic II Quantum Apocalypse or Alien vs. Hunter but it is not a good movie either. In fact after I'd watched it apart from one or two decent actors I'd found I'd already forgotten about it after 10 minutes. So does Miami Magma have its good points? Yes actually it does. Compared to some of SyFy's movies the acting excepting Melissa Ordway is while not great a little above average. Rachel Hunter you may not initially believe as a scientist but her turn as the lead is quite credible and while his character is rather clichd and thrown in Brad Dourifthough he has done much better work before does what he can. I was taken as well by how likable the ex was.Also the scenery and photography are decent when they could have easily been slipshod. However in terms of production values some of Miami Magma is shot in a somewhat dull way and although there have been much cheaper effects before and since here the effects do give the sense that it was done on lowbudget and in a hurrywhich I expect it probably was.The acting was not the problem here and the production values while far from applause worthy wasn't a particularly huge part as to why Miami Magma didn't engage. The problems were the script the pacing the story and the characters. I will say before criticising any of these assets that all four assets have been done much worse in other SyFy movies but that's not excusing the fact that they were very problematic here. To start with I was intrigued in a sense with the idea and the start was promising. But the film was mostly dull and didn't thrill in any way which in a sense is what the genre is partly about. The script is cheesy and doesn't flow effortlessly from one line to another also every lineand character screams of been there done that.Speaking of the characters they are no more different to any other character from SyFy's other movies meaning they are stereotypical and mostly underdeveloped. Except that not many other SyFy movies have characters that are very morally inconsistent especially Melissa Ordway whose performance consists of overacting and pandering. There is the brilliant yet misunderstood scientist the big business villain of the piece the hunky nerd the estranged exhusband and the seemingly innocent little sisterso far apart in age to the main character you actually question whether they're actually sisters. Stereotypes are not always a problem but it is when the character in question has nothing interesting about them which is the case here with all of them. The destructive scenes are lame at best the best they get is a sequence where bikiniclad girls run away from a steam tsunami. I personally don't see anything interesting about an oil rig and a warehouse being blown up in all honesty how about blowing up Miami while you're at it? Not just that but SyFy have never been reliable with science and geography and Miami Magma is no exception with scientific errors that would have even the worst scientist in the world groaningie. liquid nitrogen really? and in an attempt to give some plausibility to the whole Gulf of Mexico thing ignoring that Gulf of Mexico is on the wrong side of Florida to be affected by a volcano. Overall I've seen worse but Miami Magma fizzles more than it crackles sadly. 310 Bethany Cox".

There are a few scenes of smoke clouds and flowing lava but when I say few I mean it they're few and far between and skipped over in favour of the usual cheap bigcompanyconspiracy plot as some oil drillers chase after a whistleblower threatening to reveal the truth about their dark dealings.The characters are onedimensional and the acting not much better the only familiar face they could get on board here was Brad Dourif playing a suited bigwig who has a handful of scenes.

	schema:headline " This movie certainly puts meaning to the word disaster in the natural disaster movie genre...";
	schema:reviewBody "World on Fire as the DVD is titled when purchased from Amazon or Miami Magma as titled here on IMDb is definitely one of the more boring and uneventful of natural disaster movies that I have seen. It even makes Dante's Peak seem like a masterpiece.The story is about an underground volcano that threaten Miami and it is up to two scientists to save the city and avert a catastrophe.Of course it is every single disaster movie follows this exact same script and mold down to the core  no pun intended. However World on Fire just never made it out of the trench to so speak. The plot and storyline was as predictable as they come and even for a natural disaster movie it was painstakingly predictable to the point where even a blind man would see it coming.Throughout the entire movie there is but a handful of oddly placed localized incidents involving magma or superheated steam. There was surprisingly little magma in the movie which really was a disappointing lack of things for the movie and it worked as an anchor around the movie dragging it down severely in its enjoyment. And also throughout the entire movie there is not a single moment where you feel that the entire city of Miami was in any danger at all. And then it just ended  with the scientists saving the day of course.As for the acting in the movie well it wasn't Oscar nominated material let me just put it like that. I was mildly thrilled to see Brad Dourif's name on the cast list but it was a short lived thrill and not even he could muster to lift up this movie.And don't get suckered in by the fancy DVD cover the way that I did. It promises a massive volcano erupting over a metropolis on fire and for some reason there are celestial bodies on the sky also erupting with fire. But nothing and I cannot stretch the word nothing enough here even remotely like the DVD cover is to be found anywhere in the entire movie. It was just false advertising and luring with hopes of a massive natural disaster movie that just turned out to be a fluke and nothing more than a fizzling lit match.If you enjoy natural disaster movies then know that there are far far better movies available on the market and World on Fire is hardly worth the effort of spending 97 minutes on. World on Fire? Nah more like Nothing on Fire.".

	schema:headline " Put a volcano in a swamp and it fizzles...";
	schema:reviewBody "Since we've had volcanoes destroy LA Volcano and NYC Disaster Zone Volcano in New York someone decided to let Miami in on the action. The original title Miami Magma had both alliteration and assonance and was really quite clever. Unfortunately SyFy decided to change it to Swamp Volcano which is merely confusing since swamps do not evoke Miami and vice versa and only a very small portion of the movie actually takes place in a swamp. And unfortunately the rest of the movie is on equally unsolid ground.This cautionary tale about oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico starts off with an explosion on an oil rig owned by Holter Energy. The explosion occurs when they drill into magma instead of oil. Unfortunately the CEO Brad Dourif and head of PR Cleavant Derrick seem to be more concerned about misleading the public and hiding an illegal although very lucrative drilling operation in downtown Miami. Geology professor Antoinette Vitrini Rachel Hunter becomes concerned when her exhusband Brad J.D. Evermore informs her that Holter's drilling activities seem to parallel her unpublished research. She has even more to be concerned about when she learns that her assistant Brandon Griff Furst on whom her much younger sister Emily Melissa Ordway has a crush has sold her research to Holter. When she confronts Holter she only manages to convince them that they need to kill her to keep her silent. Unfortunately by this time volcanic activity has started cropping up around Miami so Antoinette must race against time and potential assassins to save not herself and her sister but all of Miami. Can she and Brandon do it? I'll give the writers credit for some plausibility in suggesting that the Gulf of Mexico could be the caldera of a supervolcano even though it's pretty widely accepted that the gulf is the result of continental drift. However apparently they don't know geography terribly well since Miami is on the Atlantic side of Florida and therefore highly unlikely to be affected by vulcanism in the Gulf of Mexico. They really should have set the movie in Tampa. Equally hard to buy was the whole concept of a steam tsunami generated by an underwater eruption. Volcanoes erupt underwater all the time. They have to be pretty close to the surface in order to generate any kind of steam plume that could be threatening and steam plumes don't behave the way they did in this movie. The steam tsunami really behaved more like a pyroclastic flow which might have worked better. And I'm not sure I buy that liquid nitrogen could be used to redirect the flow of lava from an eruption. All in all not very credible science.The rest of the writing wasn't terribly credible either. Antoinette and Emily appear to be very far apart in age almost too far apart to be sisters and it might have worked better if they were written as mother and daughter. It's also hard to buy that Antoinette who is supposedly an experienced professor wouldn't take better care to make sure that all of her students were accounted for before leaving one behind to get boiled in the swamp. Emily starts off as rather immature and there's really nothing to indicate the kind of growth her character experiences throughout the movie. Brandon's motives both for selling Antoinette's research and for his altruism at the end of the movie aren't really clear. And just about everyone involved with Holter seems to be motivated solely by greed which just makes all of them seem one dimensional.Oddly in spite of the bad writing I actually found the acting to be quite enjoyable. I expected to have a hard time buying Rachel Hunter as an academic but she turns in a credible performance and I enjoyed watching her. Likewise Melissa Ordway does a good job of making her character likable in spite of her early flightiness. Griff Furst does an excellent job of playing the hunky nerd. J.D. Evermore is quite likable as Antoinette's ex so much so that you wonder why she treats him with such hostility at first. Cleavant Derricks does manage to make his character a little more complex although the complexity rapidly disappears as greed takes over. And Brad Dourif use his intensity well to show a man who is so driven that he allows his greed to overtake his sensibility.The effects are rather cheesy and the movie could have used some scenes of destructions of familiar landmarks I mean there must be some in Miami. Likewise the scenes of those who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time could have been better done. The steam tsunami scene was hard to buy into. And one would assume that the tennis players might have noticed that the ground was getting hot before it opened and spewed forth lava turning a tennis ball into a deadly hot object I'll give them points for good CGI showing the hole in the coach's chest as well originality in the writing of that scene.All in all it was about what I would expect from a SyFy original film which sets the bar pretty low. However if you're in the right the mood don't expect too much and don't take it too seriously it can be an enjoyable film.".

The characters were what made the movie interesting though even there it seemed that people were acting in contradiction.

	schema:headline " Non exactly erupting with excitement about this movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Miami Magma or whichever of the apparently numerous titles this film goes by isn't a particularly bad movie in itself however it has flaws that simply can't be overlooked.OK so it's a somewhat generic low budget disaster movie but that should really only be an excuse for few or ineffectual special effects. In contrast it certainly doesn't mean you can automatically get away with poor scripts and acting both of which are in abundant supply here.The movie starts with the loss of an Oil Rig off the Florida coast. Now in reality this would cause great consternation to all involved and a major and long running intervention by local state and government departments and probably a good deal of international attention too? Apparently not though and apart from a few questions at a press conference it is quickly excused and forgotten. This isn't twisting reality for the sake of the movie rather its ignoring it completely as it would just slow things down and complicate the writing task.So all is clear for the Evil Corporation to bulldoze their plans through and hit trouble  and disaster. No problem in theory however the bad guys are simply wooden and ridiculous and Imo this is down to both poor writing and bad acting. I point much of the blame on Cleavant 'Sliders' Derricks who is simply awful and Wallace Merck and...well all the baddies!!! In contrast the good guys are a fairly decent overall although I am getting somewhat tired of the lead roles being both Intelligent  Supermodel material...but maybe that's just what Hollywoodesque scientists are nowadays. But putting this one gripe aside they are at least far from cringe worthy and maybe even fair to say above average for the SyFy movie universe. However one cannot balance the other entirely and so overall its a thumbs down on the casting account too.The story as a whole follows a somewhat predictable routine once you've gotten past the shoddy beginning. There a definite lack of the big Volcano effects one would usually expect and for some odd reason even the low tech low budget magma and lava is kept to an absolute minimum. For a disaster movie it sure does seem to minimise the actual disasters!So how do I rate the movie??? I initially wanted to add a few points because or the decent good guys however immediately these and more were knocked off by the terrible baddies who ruined any scene they were in. And the SFX...well there really weren't many to speak of so that doesn't help either. What finally made the difference as to which aside of average the score would fall was the apparent apathy of the authorities from beginning to end The Major and a few National Guard is all they could muster!?!. If they don't care why should I?410...lazy writing lazy bad guy actingPs. If you want a similar film bit done not only with bigger budget but also better writing standards and definitely better all round acting then stick to Volcano or Dantes Peak neither of which are classics but still offer a better experience without the badbad guys making you throwing your popcorn at the screen!".

	schema:reviewBody "This was an extremely welldone documentary about men's bodybuilding and the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest in particular.The film of course features the most famous bodybuilder of all time  Arnold Schwarzenegger. There are also profiles of his handful of competitors most notably Lou Ferrigno who gained notoriety by being the green monster in The Incredible Hulk TV series.Anyway this film really shows the hard work but not the steroids by the way the dedication and the egos of the bodybuilders particularly Schwarzenegger. Arnold is the defending champion in the field and also has the biggest ego and is pictured as a man obsessed with winning. To this day has he ever lost in anything? Like him or not what this man has accomplished is amazing. Ferrigno's story is more about his dad than anything else a man living out his dreams through his son. However unlike other driven sports parents i.e. Jimmy Piersall's father in Fear Strikes Out he gives Big Louie nothing but encouragement.However  please note because I was fooled for years too  until the DVD came out  that it turns out that much of the dad's role was made up just for the film which is why I put documentary in quotes. In reality he had little to do with his son's training according to a feature on the DVD disc. There is a 25year reunion with some of the people involved here and it's very interesting as they point out what was added for dramatic effect. These filmmakers must have inspired Michael Moore. Also featured in the film were several contestants in another competition Mr. Universe which was held at the same venue as the main attraction. In here we see good guy Mike Katz battling bad guy Ken Waller. Katz was particularly an intriguing study and provides a good example of what motivates many of these guys to build such incredible bodies.A lot of what these contestants do  and Schwarzenegger was a master at this  was play mind games at these contests trying to psych out their opponents. All of that is pictured.The physical work the mental games the families of these guys their social life outlooks on life and the behindthescenes look at a unique sport  all are fascinating. I found it such when I saw it over 25 years ago and it's still an extremely entertaining film.".

	schema:headline " Pump It Up!";
	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to imagine that before he became a multimillion dollar movie star and the Governator of California Arnold Schwarzenegger started his film career with one docudrama the aptly named Pumping Iron.Basically a documentary about the world of bodybuilding circa 1975 Pumping Iron focuses on Arnold Schwarzenegger's last effort at attaining the Mr. Olympia for the sixth time in a row before officially retiring from the best sport and heading off to Hollywood for a film career. Five years before he had starred in the mighty Hercules in New York which I have been quoted as calling the funniest bad film ever.Not much to say about a film like Pumping Iron though so I resort to going over the movie's historical impact and the socalled controversial questions often raised after people watch the film for a first time.First of all this is the movie that started bodybuilding. It's hard to think of a time when bodybuilding wasn't strange and abnormal but when Pumping Iron was made bodybuilders were considered insecure freaks with big egos. Bodybuilding ads were printed underneath the comic strips of daily newspapers. People took them as a joke.Arnold is often referred to as the father of modern bodybuilding he literally started the entire craze you see today and a lot of people who criticize his intellect and films and tabloid sexual assault claims forget that everyone is flawed but not everyone has enough self discipline and motivation to move to the United States from Austria become the king of bodybuilding boasting the largest chest every measuredto this day then moving into film and grossing billions of dollars at the box office in total then becoming Governor of California.That's pretty amazing.I don't believe that the majority of the sexual assault claims filed against Schwarzenegger are true. I'm sure some of them are though. Interesting how they all surfaced right around election time huh? But regardless of whether he's a womanizer or not which I know he is to a certain extent he's still a very admirable guy who's participated in fitness and after school programs for years not to mention raising four kids without ever divorcing his wife. I'm not saying that the key to a lasting marriage is adultery though. And he kicks butt onscreen like no other guy in the history of action film knockoffs. There will be your pale imitators like Stallone and VanDamme but there's only one Conan the Barbarian.Yes I admire Arnold Schwarzenegger as do millions of people across the world. There's a reason that he started the bodybuilding craze of the past few decades as well as grossing billions of dollars at the box office many of his films some of the greatest pieces of action cinema ever made appearing on thousands of magazine covers and becoming Governor of California. First of all he exceeds where most screen heroes fail he's got bigger muscles see Stallone a more likable personality see VanDamme andeven though many people criticize him for itI think his acting is quite good. It's easy to smile watching one of his comedies and easy to have fun watching his macho man action films. Commando is one of the cheesiest films ever made but would it work without Arnold?Pumping Iron is not exactly a documentary since a lot of it was staged just for the film but as Arnie said before most of it is truethe competitions the training etc. The tension between the bodybuilders and some of the dialogue however is not true. It was all for cinema.But this is the movie that made people flee to the gym during the 70s and 80s and it continues to do so. I myself am a bodybuilder with a gym built into my house and this movie is a big inspiration for methere's a lot of great inspirational material in it. And it doesn't matter if your sport is bodybuilding or not even a sport at all the motivational message stays the same for whatever you do.In a recent 25th Anniversary Interview included on the newlyreleased DVD of the film Schwarzenegger separates the fact from the fiction. His psyching out of Lou Ferrigno was just for the camera so was the statement about losing his car and not returning for his father's funeral because he was training. Yes he used steroids as did everyone back then since they were in an experimental stage and not illegal. And he handled the biggest question of all in two sentences Schwarzenegger Yes I smoked a joint. And yes I inhaled.Twentyfive years later he now also claims that when he said the pump blood flow to the muscles resulting from weight lifting was better than coming in a woman he was just saying this to get attention and to get people to lift weights more. It's not better than coming he says now. Trust me.45 stars.John Ulmer".

There's a reason that he started the bodybuilding craze of the past few decades as well as grossing billions of dollars at the box office many of his films some of the greatest pieces of action cinema ever made appearing on thousands of magazine covers and becoming Governor of California. First of all he exceeds where most screen heroes fail he's got bigger muscles see Stallone a more likable personality see VanDamme andeven though many people criticize him for itI think his acting is quite good. It's easy to smile watching one of his comedies and easy to have fun watching his macho man action films. Commando is one of the cheesiest films ever made but would it work without Arnold?Pumping Iron is not exactly a documentary since a lot of it was staged just for the film but as Arnie said before most of it is truethe competitions the training etc. The tension between the bodybuilders and some of the dialogue however is not true. It was all for cinema.But this is the movie that made people flee to the gym during the 70s and 80s and it continues to do so. I myself am a bodybuilder with a gym built into my house and this movie is a big inspiration for methere's a lot of great inspirational material in it. And it doesn't matter if your sport is bodybuilding or not even a sport at all the motivational message stays the same for whatever you do.In a recent 25th Anniversary Interview included on the newlyreleased DVD of the film Schwarzenegger separates the fact from the fiction. His psyching out of Lou Ferrigno was just for the camera so was the statement about losing his car and not returning for his father's funeral because he was training. Yes he used steroids as did everyone back then since they were in an experimental stage and not illegal. And he handled the biggest question of all in two sentences Schwarzenegger Yes I smoked a joint. And yes I inhaled.Twentyfive years later he now also claims that when he said the pump blood flow to the muscles resulting from weight lifting was better than coming in a woman he was just saying this to get attention and to get people to lift weights more. It's not better than coming he says now. Trust me.45 stars.John Ulmer";

	schema:reviewBody "Pumping Iron is one of the best movies I have seen in recent memory.  This movie is a documentary about body building in the nineteen seventies when Arnold Schwarzenegger was just beginning to carve out a name for himself.  I just typed his name and spelt it wrong and sure enough my spell check has Schwarzenegger in it how's that for fame?This movie first covers the top amateur body builders at the time through the Mr. Universe contest.  The documentary then covers the professional body builders competing for the Mr. Olympia title.  The movie is great because not only is it thoroughly entertaining if you pay attention to the details but it also makes you want to exercise.  Perhaps not to the extend of Arnold but exercise none the less and physical fitness is good.In addition to Mr. Schwarzenegger being in the movie Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno challenging Arnold for the crown.  Lou's father is perhaps one of the most incredible characters in the movie and contributes to many humorous moments.  One scene in particular stood out in my mind.  Lou and his father were at the gym training and Lou was doing some front presses. Prominently in the background was an overweight dope looking man.  Lou a giant at 6'5 275lbs was doing his exercises and screaming with exertion. Yet the poor dopey man kept on going with the funniest look on his face. The movie is too good.  I highly recommend anyone who enjoys a good mockumentary to watch it.  If you enjoy films like Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show Pumping Iron is for you only real!".

The truth is the drama in this movie was created to make it look exciting. The tension between Arnold and Ferrigno was hyped up the time when Waller hides Katz's Tshirt was exaggerated the way Arnold portrays himself as having no emotions is made up etc. The directors and the bodybuilders really did a great job at creating extra tension. If we just watched a bunch of guys lift weights for 90 minutes then it would be boring. This added some excitement. The only part that wasn't touched was the parts with the competitions. The bodybuilders were so used to the crew that they didn't even notice the camera crew was there. Therefore people get a real straightforward honest view of what the bodybuilding world is like. Anyone who is a bodybuilder or is into weightlifting needs to see this movie at least once. Being a person who lifts weights religiously I watch a segment of it each time before I go to the gym. It is a really great motivational tool.".

Also look for the future Incredible Hulk Lou Ferrigno as the new upandcoming bodybuilder. I cannot praise this movie enough its changed my life.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great docudrama that can't be missed by Arnold fans or those who like to pump major iron. Without a doubt this is what helped launch Arnold's career and start the fitness revolution that would later come about in the 80's. It also helped to bring bodybuilding out of the basement into the mainstream.The documentary follows mainly Arnold Schwarzenegger The Austrian Oak and Lou Ferrigno as they train and work their way up to the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest in Pretoria South Africa in the Golden age of bodybuilding. Along the way we meet plenty of other famous bodybuilders such as Franco Columbu Ed Corny Robby Robinson Ken Waller and many others. Director George Butler goes behind the scenes of training and shows how Arnold thinks trains and intimidates to stay on top as the worlds greatest bodybuilder. Arnold of course delivers some famous lines even in his early days. The pump is as good as having sex with a woman and cuming is classic. We also get to see many staged scenes like Arnold talking about skipping his father's funeral how he gave fake advice to other bodybuilders and a staged scene with Lou's parents at breakfast. Arnold is shown as this unstoppable German machine while Lou is the man who trains in the shadows and is unleashed on the world. Lou supposedly is being trained by his father in some cheap gym in Brooklyn while Arnold trains at Gold's in Venice Beach California. Finally at the Mr. Olympia contest Arnold and many others do pose downs to see who the overall winner is. Arnold takes on Franco in the finals and defeats him though some think Franco was the better. Arnold then retires from competitive bodybuilding for now and the rest is history.Some other memorable moments are of course Ken Waller and the shirt hiding incident with Mike Katz. Though somewhat staged as well it still makes for an entertaining watch. Mike Katz's story is one of the better moments in the film where he goes into how he got into lifting and bodybuilding. Indeed there's always a method to our madness. Franco's scene The Italian Way in his home town in Italy is great when he dead lifts a car. Some like Arnold Lou Katz and Franco have short bios of themselves in the film. The entire film is not totally staged but some of it is. I guess Michael Moore watched this documentary. One of the biggest fakes in the movie is the participation of Matty Ferrigno in his son's training. This was staged to show father and son working together. In reality Lou had a hard time with his father. Of course one can't forget Arnold smoking a joint after he wins the Mr. Olympia contest. No this is not fake. People who are not into lifting I'm sure would find some parts boring but that's reason it's a docudrama to get a more mainstream crowd to watch and get into the characters.Overall this docudrama gets a big 10 out of 10 no Arnold fan or person who is into bodybuilding can possibly miss this. There is no better film to watch when one is lifting to get serous motivation for pumping up. Be sure to watch the 25th anniversary DVD edition that tells all.".

The rivalry the pranks back stage at tournaments the reverse psychology and the rumours they would spread to throw their fellow competitors into disarray.There was scepticism as to whether most of the content of this movie was scripted or performed adlib.  One get the impression it's a bit of both especially when you see a very young Lou Ferrigno throw a tantrum infront of his father Matty and telling him he's gonna beat'im Arnold that is to become the next Mr. Olympia.Overall it's one film to watch as a motivator study guide to understand the psyche of iron pumpers and to note how Joe Weider marketed talents such as Arnold Lou Ferrigno and Franco Columbu immortalising them into the world of body building.  6.810".

One get the impression it's a bit of both especially when you see a very young Lou Ferrigno throw a tantrum infront of his father Matty and telling him he's gonna beat'im Arnold that is to become the next Mr. Olympia.Overall it's one film to watch as a motivator study guide to understand the psyche of iron pumpers and to note how Joe Weider marketed talents such as Arnold Lou Ferrigno and Franco Columbu immortalising them into the world of body building.  6.810";

It is true to say that before Schwarzenegger came along men with muscles in film were often portrayed as stupid or slow. Arnold showed in this film that he had tons of personality his charisma was as big as his chest and he made Bodybuilding seem cool. Look at films made since Pumping Iron the lead actor often has to have muscle. Stallone Van damn etc all owe a lot to Schwarzenegger for their success. Pumping Iron itself is an interesting exploration into the strange world of competitive bodybuilding and it successfully shows the variety of characters that exist within the 'sport'. Since it was made bodybuilders are even bigger and certainly more muscular today than they were in Arnolds day. Truth is his build would not win today but at the time he was the best their was. There were more muscular men  Franco is much more muscular but he had the ability to show his body to the best advantage hiding weaknesses and pushing his strong parts to the fore. Certain sides of bodybuilding are omitted  drug taking homosexuality  but the film itself is very entertaining and crams a lot into a relatively short film.I recommend the DVD edition that others have mentioned as you get a lot more from it.".

At any rate now that I've made fun of the movie I'd like to say that I am hugely impressed with it as a documentary about bodybuilding. It is one of those indepth documentaries that follows its subjects around at all hours  in the weight room at home before during and after competitions etc. We meet all kinds of gigantic bodybuilders a couple of whom we recognize from movies and TV shows that they did later in their lives  probably most notably Lou Ferrigno who later starred as The Incredible Hulk and this other guy named Arnold Schwarzenegger who you may have heard of if you've been living on earth for the last three decades or so.spoilers It is amazing to me the intensity of the training for these competitions but I suppose that they all know that the harder they work the better the chances are that they will get ahead of the competition who are also working themselves to death. Schwarzenegger and his colleagues are absolutely massive in this documentary it's a curiosity piece even just to be reminded of what a human mass he used to be compared to today although he's still a pretty huge guy.We see all the work and effort that goes into these competitions from behind the scenes watching the bodybuilders at home with their families as they prepare for upcoming competitions we see the sportsmanship as well as the less sportsmanlike things. There are scenes of them trying to sabotage each other in order to get ahead even Arnold who really towered above his competition in sheer size and symmetry which amazes me because it just seems like it would diminish the elation of a victory but I guess the competitions are to be won at all costs.Mike Katz really struck me as a particularly good sport when he didn't win sitting sort of in a daze and saying how great it was for the winner and that he must really be thrilled and he just had to go shake his hand. I felt really bad for the guy because you could feel his disappointment although I always had this feeling that he was holding his frustration back because there was a camera pointed at him. Still a great sport I have to say. I also loved an earlier quote from Katz who was a great sport but not necessarily the most wellspoken one I'm the type of person who's the type of dog who's gonna fight back.'The movie has a very heavy documentary feel this is not a very produced documentary. The camera is shaky handheld out of focus at times there are rough transitions and zooms etc and all of this serves to add to the realism of the entire thing. It's kind of disappointing that one of the final competitors was a welldeserving African American competitor and there is not a scrap of coverage of him in the entire film he is not given a single individual shot or line of dialogue. That's a hell of an oversight if you ask me regardless of how good the rest of the documentary was.I was amazed at the part where Arnold is talking about how he wouldn't even return to Austria to go to his father's funeral because he was in the middle of the competition and didn't even want to think about it. It's incredible how much these guys shut off their entire lives in order to compete in these bodybuilding events.Actually the reason I sought out this movie was because I heard on the radio that it is extremely difficult to find right now because the whole state of California seems to be trying to get their hands on it because Arnold is currently running for Governor and evidently he smokes pot in this movie. It's true although personally if I was Arnold I would be more concerned about the scene where he talks about how the competitors admire him so much so it's really easy to give them bad advice so they'll fall behind or even worse the interview where he talks about the deep pleasure he gets from bodybuilding where he says things like I am cumming day and night! I'm in heaven!'".

Mike KatzThis documentary shows men at the very top of their sport even though their choices may make them outcasts in their time. By juxtaposing Arnold's story with Mike Katz and Louie this documentary shows what it means to succeed. Maybe you want to be the undisputed best at your game but you'll have to sacrifice your emotions like Arnold and your human decency like Waller.Perhaps you're a Mike Katz in life. You'll never get to be the best in the rat race but you keep your heart with your family and never let them down. Or you might be an Arnold driven blindly to success without a thought to the dying father back home or to the people you push down as you climb up. And there's Louie his speech and hearing problem made him strong. He is sheltered and pushed too hard by his overbearing father who always feels the need to be Louie's ears and voice. But Louie always pushes back trying to find his own voice and his own life. None of the men here are weak yet the sport always seems to be portrayed that way like they are freaks or outcasts. I am not a bodybuilder and I don't plan on becoming one but the ideas and emotions presented in this movie are universal. The world needs men like Arnold and it needs men like Mike. And most of all it needs men like Lou who never lay down and never give up even in the face of seemingly unsurmountable obstacles in life.This film can teach you about yourself through the men portrayed on the screen. It is not merely a presentation of the sport of bodybuilding. Pumping Iron brings us into the lies and lives of the men we see all around us men who have been pushed and men who push themselves to be the best they can be.

	schema:reviewBody "I've had the old VHS copy of this film for years.  For Christmas I got the 25th Anniversary DVD and it is FANTASTIC.Spoilers AheadI love seeing the bodybuilders of the film sitting around 25 years later and remembering the glory days.  And if you look at how bodybuilders today look like chemically laden freaks versus these true masters from the 70's you will see these champions truly were great.  They had Herculean physiques that actually looked GOOD.Arnold in the film comes across as ruthlessly determined to win at all costs even not going to his father's funeral as it was too close to a contest date.  Well most of what Arnold says in the film was made up to create some drama and make him look like as he described the Germanic machine.  In reality he had a good relationship with his father who died a few months after his 1972 Olympia win and Arnold did indeed go to the funeral.  Nowadays when Arnold looks back on the film he admits that he went a little overboard in how he portrayed himself.Back then bodybuilders did try and psyche each other out before contests. However they also all trained together and socialized together.  They did try to gain the upper hand at contests but nobody ever took any attempted psycheouts personally.  Ken Waller and Mike Katz for example have always been good friends.  The tshirt thing was a joke that was made into drama on screen.  Waller recalls how long afterwards he was booed at contests for the tshirt incident.Lou Ferrigno was indeed doing his best to unseat Arnold as Mr. Olympia but neither he nor his father had any dislike for Arnold.  Arnold has always been Lou's idol when he was starting out.  Much of how they were made to be such enemies was done to create some drama for the film.  That was the reason why George Butler had Lou always training in this little dungeon of a gym in Brooklyn.  They wanted a contrast between champion Arnold in sunny Venice Beach while poor Lou is in this dark little gym training with the neighbourhoos schmoes.  i.e. That guy with the afro doing dumbbell curls. Lou actually did a lot of training at Venice Beach but for the film he had to train in Brooklyn instead.  You'll notice how despite their war with each other whenever Arnold or Lou talk to each other in the film they're always smiling at each other when they talk.  I think that one of the most positive aspects of the film is that even though they competed against one another on stage they were all friends.People have commented on how Serge Nubret the black bodybuilder who placed 2nd in the heavyweight competition was virtually ignored in the film. There were two reasons for that.  Nubret was from France so Butler wasn't able to include him in the precontest scenes.  Secondly and most critically Nubret was a VERY late addition to the contest.  I don't think either Arnold or Lou knew he'd be competing with them until they were in Pretoria.  Thus the film crew didn't know about it either.  It was too late to work him into anything or to suddenly add him into the cast of characters.  There's a photo in Flex Magazine where Arnold Lou and Matty are being told that Nubret will be taking part in the competition.  They all look surprised and not too pleased.Overall I find the film to be inspiring on many levels.  It inspires me to keep working out.  It inspires me about attaining my goals.  I can't recommend this film more highly.  The extras features on the DVD are worth the price of it alone.".

Arnold is simply great and Lou is great as well. The movie is very inspiring and very entertaining from beginning to end and Arnold really makes it work because if though this is a documentary Arnold himself plays a evil character telling stuff about how he didn't attend his fathers funeral getting Lou to yell and saying Lou is a child and he is his daddy. It's all part of the mind games. As for Lou he is basic and great to follow. The best thing about this film is seeing the why Lou and Arnold remain friends even through the entire competition and after. The film is inspiringfunny and just a great viewing experience every time. A must see for Arnold and Lou fans for sure".

This one is however heavily underrated and they both got the same imdb score from me 710  34 stars.This is another attempt to make another Nashville. There's a humongous ensemble cast of actors some of the best on the planet a couple of the best who ever lived. The screenwriter doesn't connect it all very well and lots of the characters seem superfluous or underdeveloped unlike in Nashville where even the characters who are only in a couple of scenes are as familiar to the viewer as a close friend. I would particularly have liked the Danny AielloTeri Garr section to have been removed. It falls pretty flat. The Sophia LorenMarcello Mastrioanni section the section that most film buffs are going to be excited for also plops by its end. And Kim Basinger a good actress truly deserving her L.A. Confidential Oscar is not very good as the Southern U.S. reporter her accent is difficult to get around and her character is often annoying too. Sometimes though her pieces succeed.Many other of the vignettes succeed quite well although there are never any fireworks about to shoot off. The Tim RobbinsJulia Roberts plot is very funny. The three publishers Sally Kellerman Tracy Ullman and Linda Hunt's attempts to sign photographer Milo Stephen Rea to their magazine are all very humorous. The love quadrangle between the two designers Forest Whitaker and Richard E. Grant and their lovers is very good also. Anouk Aimee's section is also great maybe the best part Rupet Everett is good also. I loved her so much in La Dolce Vita and 8 12.

	schema:reviewBody "This is an entertaining spoof built around a Paris fashion week and was actually filmed during that event. It's a typical Robert Altman film with multiple story lines fast cutting from one setup to another and overlapping soundtracks which all make it hard to follow at the cinema and very suitable for rental so it can be replayed. It would take too long even to begin to summarise the subplots and characters but in addition to a galactically stellar cast there's a host of guest celebrities including lots of couturiers and of course dozens of models on and off the catwalk in and out of designer clothes and in the climactic scene without clothes at all. It is always healthy  both for laughers and laughees  to laugh at powerful people who take themselves too seriously and by poking fun at the fashion industry and its surrounding media circus Altman is performing a social service as well as being a true artist. But I don't find his satire as cruelly biting as some people do. He treats some characters sympathetically or neutrally  eg  the designer played by Anouk Aime and Marcello Mastroianni's mystery figure.  And even the extreme characters  eg Richard E Grant's screamingly gay designer or Kim Basinger's gushing TV reporter  are only a little more exaggerated than some reallife equivalents.The final nude catwalk parade is not only a visually delightful and neat solution to the problem of a designer having lost her collection but is also a postmodern take on the fairytale of the emperor's new clothes  nowadays the crooks wouldn't have to pretend they were making clothes for the vain emperor but would be able to sell him nudity so long as it had a trendy designer label!".

Being just a regular jane and not blessed with 15 or so credits in Filmmaking at NYU the subtly of the art was lost on me. I desperately wanted just a little exposition to grab onto and all the film's inside jokes and vague obscure references to Italian films I found to be self indulgent. I'm not saying this film was bad  just bad for me. I think he could have pulled off the same feel and frenzied little European farce with a TOUCH more connective tissue in the plot. Not a lot just a little for the audience to care about the story the characters and whatnot. The thing I found in the film that I even cared more than a fig about was the Simone storyline.".

But this is like a Woody Allen film either you love it or hate it.  Since the story is too complicated to explain and the best thing about this film I'm sticking to mostly nonplot aspects in this review.One of the challenges in your first viewing will be this film's utter lack of exposition.  You will be asked to board this train while it is moving in fact you will need to leap from track to track. The story is not unfolded as much as it is thrown at you in pieces.  Two minutes after you are tossed into a conversation already in progress you will be asked to join another.  Unless you have a mind as competitively poised as a supermodel you'll miss much of the movie the first time.Don't let the immersion in the world of fashion fool you into thinking this is a movie about' fashion.  Fashion is merely a backdrop a setting for Altman to play his scenes.  That he so thoroughly masters his subject is merely a tribute to his intelligence and sophistication.Like Milos Forman in The Firemen's Ball' Altman has created a wonderful menagerie of human foibles with which to lampoon us.  Our pettiness our lack of shame our corruption and our low regard for each other are portrayed so truthfully and cleverly that we don't notice who is the real subject of the satire.  We smugly assume it is the fashion world on trial.Even the opening credits were fun  what a collection of personalities all stitched on garment labels!.  Every casting decision was a good one every performance was satisfying.  The only thing funnier than Danny Aiello in drag is watching him being told he looks like Barbra Streisand.  And the only thing funnier than that is realizing it's true.While we're trying to figure out a murder we are also being dazzled by the constellation of world stars of all kinds parading before us.  That Altman dared to attempt such a feat the group photo at Versailles alone must have been a challenge is not half as astonishing as that he pulled it off.  But the stars too are merely a backdrop to funny stories and situations.  No one but Altman could make an Elsa Klensch cameo so surprisingly hilarious. The interview about the pouf skirts was just plain funny.  But will most of the audience appreciate it?  I doubt it.'Another delight is Altman's pervasive references to clothing so dominant you will miss half of them.  A cab driver identifying a murderer tells the police all white people look alike.'  How does he tell them apart?  By their clothes.'  Film is confiscated from a fashion shoot because the murder suspect was inadvertently captured in the background.  But his face was cutoff in every shot.  We don't know what he looks like' the detective complains.  But we know what he was wearing.'  Every conversation every plot each detail is so thoroughly selfreferencing to fashion but mostly there are dozens of funny moments.  Even the red herring of murder is based on our mistaking an innocent fashion item for an omen of death.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am Diogenes the Dog. I nuzzle the kind bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels!  DiogenesLike most of Robert Altman's films PretaPorter involves a large cast of characters gathering together to put on a performance in this case a prestigious fashion show in Paris.The film was marketed as a satire but it really isn't. This is fashion industry as scatology a world of sht in which everything is grotesque and warped. As with Diane Arbus' famous photographs on freaks Altman deliberately blurs the boundaries between the ideal and the abnormal the beautifully formed and the deformed the feces and the sanitary the inside and the outside.All the characters here are thus freaks in some way all part of the same freakish human circus. There are dwarf attendants and magazine editors transvestites crossdressers lesbians gays the obese the pregnant adulterers illegitimate babies mortuary attendants and a multitude of abrasive caricatures. Mixed in with these are the ideal bodies of the celebrities the exposed unnaturalnatural bodies of the models identical twins who exchange their sexual partners filmstar parodies television personalities and original filmstars reliving previous roles.Altman then contrasts modern sex icons Basinger Roberts etc with ageing disintegrating sex icons of the past Sophia Loren Lauren Bacall etc and goes out of his way to tarnish surface beauty by imbuing the film's sex bombs with abrasive personalities.The much derided abrasiveness of the film is therefore intentional. Altman isn't just dealing with caricatures he's dealing with the grotesque. Of course grotesque art is by definition the least ideal form always a war of attraction and repulsion. As such the reoccurring motifs here are dogs animals and dog feces. More than juvenile poop jokes Altman's recalling the scatological traditions of Diogenes the dog philosopher.Diogenes was associated with public outbursts and obscenity. His ragged unashamedly dirty existence radiated disrespect and contempt for all who gazed upon him. But while he was an animal putrid and filthy he was nevertheless more civilised than his cultured audience. In a similar fashion everyone in this film is held under the contemptible gaze of Diogenes whose mischievous dog feces show scorn for an intrusive and aggressive kind of not so much modern culture typified by television celebrity photography fame and fashion  the usual boring targets of satire but the hypocrisy of all culture.In the film both television and photography are implicitly connected by characters accidentally stepping in dog feces. These accidents occur in both private and public places playfully linking the home studio and streets with a media culture which both intrudes on privacy exposing shameful human behaviours foibles and frailties and disguises these behaviours by glitzing and glamming them up. So Altman is less concerned about the fashion industry than about what garments and technology alternatively hide and expose the prevalence of his symbolic doggy poop serving to bring the high down low. Everything is grotesque whether you're on or off the catwalk.The film ends with a nude catwalk scene one of Altman's most brilliant sequences. Here models walk fully nude whilst the words You're so beautiful the way you are hum on the soundtrack. The sequence derides the commodification of beauty serves as an admittance that humanity is as grotesque as its ornamentsapparels works as a dig at the fashion industry's obsession with authenticity the true inner subjectself the stripped down ego or essence and of course points toward the end result of all fashionasfetishwear total naked sex. More than this though the sequence suggests that there is beauty in freakishness and freakishness in beauty which is why a strange aura of both life and death radiates from this sequence. The catwalk models are like clones cold stick figures one of which is pregnant. The pregnant model speaks of a mystery about birth and something new but she is also the least sexual of the models. Conversely the others are like zombies dead crawling out of a tomb yet are beautifully sexualised.This blurring this confusion ugliness in beauty beauty in ugliness is the very point of Grotesque art. Unlike the satirist the grotesque artist does not analyse and instruct in terms of right and wrong or true and false satirelogical grotesqueirrational nor does he attempt to distinguish between these. On the contrary he is concerned about demonstrating their inseparability. Satire generally aims at three reactions from the audience  laughter anger or disgust  but it aims to produce these separately. The grotesque however produces a reaction of confusion. With satire there is an alternation or distinction between laughter and the gross evil which arouses anger. With the grotesque however laughter hatred and anger seem to meld.Beyond this there are references to Funny Face and Blow Up guess why and Altman reenacts a scene from De Sica's Yesterday Today and Tomorrow with the same actors Loren and Mastroianni. It's like the two lovers from De Sica's film itself a film in which Loren and Mastroianni played multiple characters stepped out of it and resumed their tale 40 years later in older bodies. Surprisingly the same lead actors from Fellini's La Dolce Vita also appear adding a dark tinge to Fellini's tale of those seeking the good life.Tactics like this create a further effect. The characters lose weight becoming flat depthless images. Consider when the real Elsa Klensch is interviewed by Kim Basinger who plays an Elsa Klensch character or when real celebrities like Cher and Harry Bellefonte briefly appear but yet still come across as empty screen representations of themselves. The film paints a world obsessed with the image but stresses that there are few authentic images. The supermodels of the 90s were clones destratified personae simulations of imagined and imagined bodies part of man's ritualised games of narcissism. By the films end even a naked repudiation of this narcissism becomes a form of narcissism.7.510  Two viewings required.".

Consider when the real Elsa Klensch is interviewed by Kim Basinger who plays an Elsa Klensch character or when real celebrities like Cher and Harry Bellefonte briefly appear but yet still come across as empty screen representations of themselves. The film paints a world obsessed with the image but stresses that there are few authentic images. The supermodels of the 90s were clones destratified personae simulations of imagined and imagined bodies part of man's ritualised games of narcissism. By the films end even a naked repudiation of this narcissism becomes a form of narcissism.7.510  Two viewings required.";

To you I would say the following  Don't take my word for it...see it for yourself and figure out what YOU think of it.  It is my opinion that the worst film from Robert Altman is still the best film of the year with rare exceptions and so naturally I would recommend this film to anyone.  However Director Altman does NOT make films for everyone.  He often makes films for the 'Advanced' filmgoer.  His work is often disjointed and overlapping to an extent that it requires one to actually ay attention to the goings' on rather than to spoonfeed the answers to the audience.  Couple this with his tendency to allow the plot and the character to meander evolving slowly over the course of the film and you often get a movie that is distinctly 'unHollywood' which can turn some film goers off.  So I would recommend that you not only sit through this film but allow yourself to actually watch it without any preconceived ideas of how a movie is supposed to be.  Then I think you will find a witty sexy satire that is more about our own vanity and betrayal than it is about the fashion industry.  But like I said don't take my word for it or the words of anyone else for that matter If you are curious please watch it.  And make up your own mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1994 when Robert Altman made Prtporter he was 70 years old. He was one of the few important auteurs of a profession celebrating its first centennial. Again the wise filmmaker's satirical approach directed on this opportunity to the fashion world was misunderstood. This time the maestro pointed his finger to consumerism on a global scale by covering a convention of the haute couture circle in which fashion was the vehicle to expose the dehumanised materialism of contemporary world.Starting with a prologue at Dior's in Moscow which could be Rome or Paris Altman described a multinational microcosm defined by its unrestrained marketing of material goods. Altman did not underestimate fashion as a key element in our lives as a matter of fact he used fashion as the clue to gain access to the film. As expected Prtporter was not a paean to designers models photographers or fashion magazine editors. After the convention's creator unexpectedly dies Altman and cowriter Barbara Shulgasser aimed at the surface of the fashion world searching for its essence for a trace of humanity and led us to an unexpected ending which is a sort of purification a baring of the bodies and souls. Altman at 70 knew very well that mankind's main alternative was and is the transparent ethics that radiates from pure spirits committed to preserve life on this planet beyond fabrics and fashions.To tell the story of this garment catharsis Altman used as his stylistic technique the superficiality that permeates the milieu he's describing one I know after working in a couple of such events in my youth. Everything is bright and beautiful but somehow it seems as if nothing is happening. The audience is denied all the myths that have led many designers and models to haughtiness so their attitudes become more vacuous and their incentive to rapacious consumerism is more obvious. Being unable to speak of art or the fashion essence in a contemporary setting where commerce rules Altman used a fragmented narrative with overlapped dialogues often improvised as in his other reflections on the crisis of communication a central theme in Nashville. Altman is one of the few filmmakers who is able to reunite large casts and create characters of high sociological value mainly in McCabe  Mrs. Miller Nashville A Wedding Short Cuts and Gosford Park and to a lesser degree in HealtH and The Player but he is also averse to psychological realism that old strategy inherited from the 19th century novel and that some people still ask for in our postpostmodern world...In this film Altman relied on famous faces to construct a game of facades with few strokes choosing among the best of them those who are able to create a believable character with a few significant details those who can go from the subtle as the wine spot on a reporter's sweater to the pompous as the dark glasses of the Irish photographer or Sophia Loren's hats. On the other hand he relied on the audiences' own information making them interact with the film adding data or making associations. For example only those who have seen Vittorio de Sica's Yesterday Today and Tomorrow and Sunflower can enjoy to the full the cinematic homage to Sophia and Marcello Mastroianni. Their story echoes Sunflower while there is a reprise of Sophia's striptease in Yesterday with a different and sad effect on Marcello or if you have been in an event like the one in the film you may remember people as the characters played by Tim Robbins and Julia Roberts two reporters who spend the whole event making love in their hotel rooms.Prtporter is a good film which contains some of the typical Altmanian digressions that some do not enjoy. But as Andrei Tarkovsky once said When you are in front of a really major figure you have to accept him with all his weaknesses which become distinctive qualities of his aesthetics.".

Ready to Wear loses its way early and drifts aimlessly along for its lengthy 133 minute runtime.

	schema:headline " Interesting Homage";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an interesting homage to the filmmakers who have gone before Altman and to the careers of many who dress up his celluloid clips. The writing misses not that it doesn't create interesting sequences or moments but it seems to go no where. But no one does this type of film better than Altman and even when Altman is bad there is always a lot to look at.The film moves quickly but it always leaves you wanting more. The characters of Kellerman Ullman and Hunt had they been developed could have been a film within a film and been an interesting comedic farce. Unfortunately that possibility is never realized. Stephen Rea's character is just plain annoying there's no exaggeration and no depth and it appears he has one expression. Forest Whitaker is always a pleasure to watch because of the depth of his persona. Ruppert Everett does nothing more than come off as a spoiled little boy playing in an adult world. One bright note is Chiara Mastrioanni.But then you move to the pro's. Loren and Mastroianni are delicious to watch. You can't help but watch the Diva Loren walk and talk. Mastroianni's puppy dog routine is endearing because it harks back to the film history they have created together. The homage to Yesterday Today and Tomorrow is particularly of note not just because one is amazed at how well Loren still looks but because Altman takes the scene and puts a rather timely note to it. Lauren Bacall seems totally wasted as she wanders in and out of the goings on with no purpose. Jean Rochefort and Anouk Aimee probably get the acting laurels because they both manage to underplay while everyone else is over blown. Julia Roberts and Tim Robbins although set in an interesting situation become tiresome and their characters rather void of any color. Kim Bassinger is perfect as the announcer because she completely conveys her inability to comprehend the fashion world and still be in awe of those who inhabit that world. Danny Aiello's turn is probably the best realized character for laughs in the film while Teri Garr is totally wasted.But that's the point of the movie. The fashion world is over blown and Altman has chronicled that in this film and yet at the same time managed to pay homage to some incredible film careers films and legends.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is an interesting homage to the filmmakers who have gone before Altman and to the careers of many who dress up his celluloid clips. The writing misses not that it doesn't create interesting sequences or moments but it seems to go no where. But no one does this type of film better than Altman and even when Altman is bad there is always a lot to look at.The film moves quickly but it always leaves you wanting more. The characters of Kellerman Ullman and Hunt had they been developed could have been a film within a film and been an interesting comedic farce. Unfortunately that possibility is never realized.

Granted it is not done in Altman's usual style and may seem vague or shallow to some but I believe that this is a misconception. The characters... some are rather undeveloped but I have a hunch that this is on purpose. 2 hours is not enough to form a picture of a person and so I think Altman made them so undeveloped because these are when all is said and done regular people. A large amount of correspondents a few model designers a bit of these a few of those... the only character which seemed foolishly vague in my opinion was the Communist Italian. Apart from that I only saw people that I would see on the street or on some show or some that I wouldn't see at all that merely write stories which others publish and get credited for.The theme of fashion design seems to be quite irrelevant here or rather it serves as the backdrop for an array of the aforementioned characters. Who cares about a fashion show when such drama is going on? Who cares who designed what dress when a mischievous Irishman is so irreverently teasing famous personages in such a hilarious manner? Who cares what outfit was voted best when two complete strangers are trying to sort out the mess their arrival was? All in all I believe that this movie fits comfortably among Altman's successes. The story is gripping logical and possesses a vivid array of characters reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's films yes not exactly chronically correct Guy Ritchie came later but I just wanted to make the image. and funny. An enjoyment from beginning to end.".

The more films of Altman one sees the more one appreciates this wonderful man and his unique ability to create witty cinematic essays on subjects such as weddings A Wedding the music industry Nashville the movie industry The player soldiersdoctors during wars MASH to name a few all with his stock ensemble of actors who often return to play bit parts in his works. What amazes me is that these actors return to play antiheroes often doing roles that are real and often portraying the follies of human beings rather than largerthanlife characters in movies that the average filmgoer may mistakenly dismiss as droll.Is Pret a porter a film on the fashion industry? Look closely and the film merely uses the fashion industry as a backdrop for painting a larger canvas of human foibles. For instance the dog faeces in this film just as bird droppings in Altman's Brewster McCloud provide humor social commentary and linkages between scenes that would seem disjointed in Altman's deliberate attempts at jumping from one scene to another and back in the midst of a conversation that other directors would have preferred to run its course. There is a method in Altman's madness. Pret a porter while taking swipes at the fashion industry is equally poking fun at journalists who send live reports on the phone sitting in hotel rooms and translating TV news of the hotel industry who provide identical suites with different fancy names in the same hotel of high flying journalistsexecutives who fuss on details of their hotel rooms in identical ways by just throwing their weight around and appear discerning of TV commentators Kim Bassinger's character who know very little of the subject they specialize in etc. It is also a film that provides humor to the attentive viewer The murderer must have died from jumping in to the Seine. If he survived the jump the pollution would have killed him or the lengthy conversation on the pouffe skirts which ends in Are you pouffe? The Julia RobertsTim Robbins sequences provide social commentary on contemporary love that goes beyond the world of fashion as a counterpoint to the parallel sequence of Mastroanni and Loren as lovers of a past generation.Though Altman has made better movies McCabe and Mrs Miller  A wedding and Nashville this one is not an insignificant work. Linda Hunt Tim Robbins Julia Roberts may be playing roles of frail pathetic personalities but they play those roles with sincerity and flourish. In my view the film uses fashion as a metaphor. Using neckties to identify strangers using clothes to make a social statement photographing clothesshoes of a murderer than his face give more insight on people affected by fashion than the fashion industry. It requires more than one viewingand definitely more if you viewed an edited for TV version with 1318 minutes lopped off as I did!".

It is well worth the price of a rental not that this scene has very much to do with the rest of the story such story as there is. This scene does prove that if you are Robert Altman in 1994 or Walerian Borowczyk in 1974 you can stage an extended scene of naked supermodels for a feature film merely because you wish to.

Enraged by Butch's affront and already determined to get revenge on him for a past wrong Tank sets about getting even with his old enemy by hiring a hulking brute Gates to beat Butch. When the confrontation occurs however Gates breaks his hand on the battlehardened Butch.

If you like myself don't think too highly of it then consider this your first boarding call.The Bullet spoken of in the title is the film's central character a 35yearold Brooklyn heroin junkie Mickey Rourke.  The film begins with his release from the pen after serving an eightyear sentence and then proceeds to closely follow the lives of him and those around him  the parents an eccentric little brother a completely shellshocked headcase of a big brother Ted Levine creating yet another standout psychotic as well as various players in the substance supply industry Tupac Shakur makes his last screen appearance as the druglord Tank and does a decent job in a rather thankless role.  I'd summarize the plot more clearly if I could but the fact is these people's lives just aren't that simple.Bullet is one of those rare movies which somehow leak through the cracks and make it into production with their soul or lack thereof intact.  One of the few who dare pay attention to the dregs of society.  Worse still actual dregs of actual modern day society. The REAL dregs.  The uncool dregs which are far less likely to break out the oneliners after offing someone then they are to strip the corpse of all valuables and sell them for drug money.Bullet wastes no time whatsoever on making it's characters presentable. I admit it there's no way this film could ever have raked in the cash.  On the surface the majority of scenes depicted in Bullet are the furthest thing any decent human being would classify as entertainment.  But below this poverty and violence is a complex and intriguing world filled with complex and intriguing characters.The film's craft cannot be faulted.  The direction is superb the soundtrack appropriate  at times eerily so  but even despite all this most viewers will recoil in disgust at the request to tune into the lives and minds of characters as genuinely vile violent and emotionally unstable as these. Characters that would instruct packs of tenyear olds in mortal combat. Characters that can no longer see the future beyond their next hit. Characters that assault their own image in the mirror.  This is ground most viewers aren't willing to tread and why this film was doomed to fail commercially.  But that by no means makes it bad.  Those who can stomach the imagery and see beyond it will not be disappointed... with the movie. How you'll feel once it sinks in that these kinds of things happen on a daily basis in what is supposedly the most civilized country on the planet is anyone's guess.".

Nothing is hollywoodized as far as being over the top yet the characters are professional as in comfortable in front of the camera. They are almost stylized.Back to the realism. The family here is so real they feel like they could be neighbors. However there is an added component of the family being Jewish and honestly this is the first time I remember seeing a Jewish family being portrayed in middleclass street style if anyone has suggestions for other examples email me.By the time it's over you feel like you know the characters or that you've met people exactly like them if you've ever lived in a moderate to large sized city. Mickey Rourke as Bullet is great as usual. It's almost as if this role were made for him. I see him as a tragic heroic figure fighting against the demon heroin. His kid brother is Adrien Brody a talented artist and headed down the same path as his brother if he's not careful. There's the 3rd brother played by Ted Levine who isn't quite right after coming back from the war. You will feel affection for this man before the end credits. There's the mom and dad who could be anyone's mom and dad watch it and you'll see what I mean. A real standout in the film is Bullet's sidekick John Enos III. In 1996 when this movie was made let's just say Enos was a perfect specimen of the male form. YUM. Mickey was likewise in excellent shape! Not only is Enos gorgeous but he plays the faithful buddy who is also very wrapped up in his looks role well. Tupac as Tank the villain isn't the greatest actor but he does OK. His clothes and his style are noteworthy. A couple of the gang members have screen presence including Pudgy and Bullet's old pal who is now one of the white guy gang leaders.There's a daytoday sort of realness in the plot. It shows probably a week in the life of the characters. Some disturbing images of abandoned buildingsturnedheroin houses not sure if they are called that but if you know what a crackhouse is like it's the same thing but with heroin. who knows maybe heroin houses are the forerunners to crackhouses and I just don't know it. Lots of sad junkies doing their various things shooting up giving blowjobs for drugs buying selling ODing. Weaknesses in the film have less to do with the plot and the actors as it does with what seems to be shtty editing. That's a shame too as Bullet 1996 has many elements that could have turned it into a classic.I decided to watch Bullet for 2 reasons 1 Mickey Rourke and 2 it was going to be on HBO at a time when I was looking for a movie to watch. I was glad I watched it. I'll watch it again too. Give it a chance and see what you think of it.".

Not a direct quote I thought this film would be like a Die Hard type film but I was very surprised.

So that explains why this movie never got the respect it deserved as most people like to avoid these films as these stories of dysfunctional family's gang wars etc make the news everyday in our livesexcept we only see the headlines and a brief story but with 'Bullet' we see the full 99min unrated story of a broken family and street life.This movie in my view is a 'masterpiece' like many other movies out there but this never got enough attention but now its gaining more attention and becoming a classic gem. The direction in this movie is excellentsome great arty shots of the streets in Brooklyn's and flashbacks from bullet himself... excellent music score also. As for the characters they all play superbly . Bullet is the street thug who just got out of the pin and cant come to terms with normal life whilst an old friend is on his trail for revengeas bullet trys to step on his turf. This is 'Tank' played by Tu Pac this has to be one of the best ruthless thug characters i have seen played on screen since the 80s.Rourke is amazing as the bullethe roams around the streets with his bad addiction.....taking one day at a time he looks cool in this movietheir's so much i could say for his characterbut id be here typing for weeks so just watch him for yourself.... also 'Ted Levine' plays a superb role.I seen this film in 96 i loved it then but didn't understand it as much theni just loved the characters. But now my eyes are open and i can see the message don't slip cause its tough and mean out here. This movie tells the story of the street thug and all that comes with it like no otherforget menace to society etc...this is the 'real' deal....'You ain't gonna make it out theretake long hard look in the mirror' Butch Stein bullet".

The sinister dark atmosphere only amplifies this spiral not getting anywhere except for the places where he has already been.I must say it's a very good movie about life. I'm not surprised it was so underrated. Americans want energetic criminals who know what they are doing who are invincible... or either succeed or get killed. Rourke however is a criminal... a criminal addicted to heroin with a demented brother... with no money and no chance of getting out of it. Just like a life of a criminal really is.I recommend this movie to European fans as it is very European even though it was made in USA. Again  very good.".

I also enjoyed the other characters in the film and feel they were portrayed very well and had depth. Pitting 'Bullet' against 'Tank' played by Tupac Shakur worked perfectly.

The cold sarcastically funny environment and characters that come to light in this film make it real. The musical score that Mickey Rourke personally did is outstanding! Even at the beginning of the movie when they pan the upstate New York setting as John Enos and his brother come to pick him up from the penn the music goes from classical to hip hop beautifully with the change of seasons and finishes with Barry White. Just a trippy movie with believable characters who we all grew up with in one way or another. The family dynamic is quite bizarre but real too. Any one who grew up Jewish and not wealthy can relate to it. I really dug this movie and ended up buying it.

Rourke's character is the title character and yes his name is Bullet. He wears a hoodie for most of the movie and you know he is down and out. I'm laughing just writing about it. You can't take this movie too seriously. I've seen worse movies and this is really not that bad and Tupac put in a decent performance as the main villain. Overall it's a pretty tough movie with a touch of goofiness. Other good Rourke flicks are The Year of The Dragon Angel Heart and Wild Orchid.For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

Rourke's character is the title character and yes his name is Bullet. He wears a hoodie for most of the movie and you know he is down and out. I'm laughing just writing about it. You can't take this movie too seriously. I've seen worse movies and this is really not that bad and Tupac put in a decent performance as the main villain. Overall it's a pretty tough movie with a touch of goofiness. Other good Rourke flicks are The Year of The Dragon Angel Heart and Wild Orchid.For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com";

The character who should have been nominated for every possible award was the brother Luisplayed by Ted Levine. The movie is worth seeing just for his performance. ALthough he is a leftover from the Vietnam war he is totally insane but you have this compassion for him. He truly loves his family and brother and that shows in the final few clips of the movie. You can't help but get chokedup when he and the family were attending Bullet Stiens funeral and the brother Luis is standing in full military officers garb at attention with the dog. At the final moment of the scene you can see a tear drop run down Luis'sTed Levine's cheek. SPOILER COMING UP!!!!!! In the next scene he cuts TanksTuPAC throat using his military trainingsame training he gave the neighborhoods kids in previous scenes. You get a sense that he is crazy but is well aware of the situation. ALL in ALL an excellent movie. How about the scene were Lester is the bathroom with the two women in the toilet stall and he is screaming outWho's the best looking Mutha Fer in this place?!?!?!. A total classic sceneline.".

Surprisingly I came out not feeling too bad about it at all.First of all it was a 3D concert and I was a little worried at the beginning. Initially there were a lot of huge effects and sweeping camera angles that became a little dizzying. But when it settled into the actual concert portion I felt just fine. Before I saw this movie I had always thought of Miley as a somewhat mediocre performer. I changed my mind after tonight. That girl has got so much energy and talent I was thoroughly impressed! The behindthescenes clips were fun because we got a glimpse of the making of it and got to see how Miley's personality outside of performing.All of the wellknown songs from the T.V. show were performed along w some new ones from Mileynot Hannah to make the distinction. I think I might have enjoyed the Miley section even more than the Hannah part. She even performed a very sweet song that she had written for her grandfather who had passed away. The Jonas Brothers were as adorable as could be. Unfortunately they didn't perform my favorite song S.O.S. But we did get to hear When You Look Me in the Eyes and Year 3000 while Miley changed from Hannah into Miley. All in all I thought it was a perfect show for kids and grownups alike. If you didn't get the chance to go to one of her actual concerts I think that this was the next best thing. I know that I had a blast and I'm in my 20's! ".

During this period of time millions of preteens look up to them with little puppy dog eyes then they pull something off that's really dumb and then look at the example kids look up to. Let's go through teen stars. Hilary Duff is seen occasionally but look at Material Girls. Not exactly a movie to be proud of. Jamie Lynn Spears got pregnant at 16. While this is quite common and I'm not saying they're bad people but they've made mistakes. Next Lindsay Lohan. Britney Spears. Enough said.Wasn't there a point when most every one of these stars was Ms. Teen Incredible? Now don't we frown up them? I'm not saying every child star hasn't had a major earthshattering problem but these days aren't more child stars turning into pretentious teens with babies that grew up listening to the same music their parents grew up listening to? I pray every night that in 10 years we won't be watching our kids' icons shave their head and end up in rehab before they can legally drink but aren't the odds going against them. Is there a parent out there right now that can't be imagining this while they watch this movie?As for the film itself I'm not going to say that Miley Cyrus doesn't have a better voice than a large number of celebrity teens that try and start careers with lackluster talent but is this anything special? I can't help think the same thing with the Jonas Brothers. You've got people like LeAnn Rimes and Jodie Foster that started at least this young an moved on to multiGrammy and Oscar winning careers. There are few worse things to do than watch wannabe stars parade around pretending they're kings and queens of their worlds. What'll happen when the novelty of these Disneymade stars wears off? They'll never shake that image. 3D special effects were excellent but the things they effect are so depressing that they're wasted.I know I'm blunt and agree with the cynical speculators that question what'll happen to these kids but I can't apologize for what I think.".

How did this teenage kid end up with her head shaved doing a strip dance on a fake wrecking ball? Well just check out this awful movie! It is obvious right from the start that she is owned by Disney and kind of a spoiled brat. Not many child stars are ever responsible with their fame nor should they have to be. Her parents clearly enjoy it more than she does although she's a pretty big snob.This movie is of one of her largest concerts during her Hannah Montana career. It came out when I was in the sixth grade and I still remember how popular Hannah Montana was at the time. Every girl in my school not me wouldn't shut up about her the school played her music over the intercom hell kids began dressing like her! SHE HAD MINIONS! Of course by grade eight it was Justin Bieber and she was becoming more of a really bad punk stripper singer than a role model for kids.Her music is really rednecksounding on some levels then some is like really bad pop music. This boring movie is basically one very long advertisement with her singing and dancing. There is no plot it's just her concert on DVD while her fata5s parents enjoy the attention as much as their snotty kid. And what does it teach children? That you have to be a bleachedblonde thin popular ditz to fit in! You could be anyone from a twoyearold to a wizzled up old man and it's highly unlikely that you'll get anything from this movie. Disney thank you once again for being a failure.".

Yes the Jonas Brothers are in the movie very little with good reason. THEY are not the headliners. The movie itself seemed short but yes for those of us who could not get tickets to the concert this was a great alternative. She's a great role model for the younger kids and I must say if you wait to try and see this on DVD how many of us own a 5 story movie screen to enjoy the 3D effects?

The behinds the scenes extras were a lot of fun plus the concert songs gave you a great feel of what the concert actually was like. My only complaints would be that though it was Miley Cyrus's movie I would have loved to see the Jonas Brothers featured more and a bit more behind the scenes footage would have been nice. Overall though I thought this movie was really good! If you didn't get the chance to see the concert live I would definitely recommend this. You will get a great feel of how fun the concert was but you won't have to pay nearly as much! excalty i wouldn't not mine at all it cost pretty much go see hannah montana or miley cyrus and jonas brothers they are in 3d honest man iam pretty excited right now is still on.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had been reading some negativity about Miley Cyrus aka Hannah Montana which some people are concerned she is going to be another Brittney Spears 10 years from now. Brittney is still young even though she has been around longer than Miley has and she herself was once a Disney alumni. Anyway people shouldn't get so bent out of shape about Miley being the next Brittney because she has a very strong supportive family behind her who I'm sure are protecting their daughter not to fall in the wrong hands of people that are going to direct her in the wrong path of show business. Thus far they're doing very well and everyone should just relax and let the family do their job just like every good family out there. The documentary does show you the phenomenal success Hannah Montana has become and many young people are really excited about this teen sensation. With the TV series attracting millions Disney put together this film so people will get a look at what she's like live in concert and there's no doubt everyone was really having a good time at her show screaming almost nonstop. The Jonas Brothers are another popular favourite among the teens that are also in this picture and this may had been their huge break cause they been touring with Miley for quite some time now and on any given night of their performance. They really are becoming a crowd pleasing favourite at Miley's shows. Not only does the movie see the happenings on stage they go behind the scenes as well which you'll see the whole crew rehearsing for the tourgetting costume changes for Miley  seeing her with her dad Billy Ray Cyrus learning a song that Miley wrote about her grandfather. This documentary may not suit interest for anybody but if people are fans of Hannah MontanaMiley Cyrus. This one is for you.".

Billy Ray is NOT trying to push his daughter into the business for money. He has enough money for himself. These parents aren't the ones making this girl famous.... the kids are!!! If you have a child that is into Hannah Montana you know what I'm talking about. She has her popularity based on the Disney show. However she's gotten so big that they have expanded the money making. Sure it's a ploy for Disney to make money but Miley is a great role model for younger girls at the moment we all remember Britney Spears. I pray her parents watch over her and not let her end up like that.Anyway we give the movie 2 thumbs up from all of us for a total of 6 thumbs up!!!

Sure many little girls look up to her and would probably give away one of their arms just to meet her but that's not me. I dragged my friends to see it all around 1923 and they all ended up enjoying it. I enjoyed it. I do enjoy her show on the Disney Channel and think her songs are catchy with amazing hooks and riffs. The whole concert was just what I expected it to be fun and upbeat almost reminiscent of the bubblegum pop heyday of the late 90s early 00s I will admit I was one of those crazy fanboys. So I guess going to see this was a way for me to relive that and even my friends as well.

	schema:reviewBody "Kay Pollak's 2004 heartwarmer S som i himmelen As it is in Heaven contains every stereotype of Swedish humanity and inhumanity yet manages to be a crowdpleaser. It contains plenty of ammunition for cynical critics continuity errorspotters and for saccharinedebunkers yet manages to depict the colours of life in a small community evocatively. The film also runs the gamut of proverbial messages about 'finding one's own voice' and 'just doing it despite one's fear' without completely removing the lump from the throats of the cynics.Its success as a crowd pleaser comes from two facts. Firstly small films about strangers bringing new life to rural Christian communities provide plenty of scope for the exposure of hypocrisy while at the same time allowing repressed characters to break out of their hairshirts. The same year and with a similarly Swedish breeze The Queen of Sheba's Pearls did it and Babette's Feast also comes to mind. Secondly any film about small communities taking on the whole wide world will strike a human chord in our increasingly individualself focused and impersonalized world. This film's structural similarity with the likes of The Full Monty Brassed Off Calendar Girls and On a Clear Day shows its indebtedness to the formula. But it is a formula with life left in it yet and this seems to be because people need positive message films that evoke a sense of community almost in spite of themselves.The stranger is burnedout maestro Daniel Darus on a quest for selfrediscovery. The town he visits or rather revisits is unbeknownst to the townsfolk the place of his childhood. He was bullied mercilessly by classmates here supposedly because he was a sensitive musician without aspiration to drive a truck. Here he takes the job of cantorchoirmaster despite the usual suspicions of artists and outsiders. The place is of course populated by a wide range of recognizable types whose character arcs can be predicted the brokenhearted fairhaired girl so beautiful she nearly glows the cellphoneringing local businessman the woman whose beauty is lost amidst domestic abuse the steely pastor and his less austere wife who at first seem right out of Ingmar Bergman. Also present jealous uptight spinster Siv check geriatric whose soul still sings check elderly couple who may have repressed desires for each other since kindergarten check obese person whose function is to point out we should not laugh and say 'fatty' check intellectually handicapped boy who proves able to sing a good 'A' check.Pollak's film is not all warm fuzzies however. It diverts from the 'let's put on a show despite setbacks and moral opposition' subgenre. It contains violence and an ending that might well be a metaphor for dying after achieving creative nirvana. The violence of the film is mostly a function of male anger and repression but in never delves deeply into why the school bully who grows up into a wife beater is like this. Similarly the small town Pastor so closely adheres to the moralistic blackwearing superProtestant stereotype that his secret indulgence in girlie magazines is hardly surprising. His repressions and hypocrisies are just there dangling unrelated to psychological reality. Perhaps the unexplained photograph of a young boy a lost son perhaps glimpsed once over his shoulder holds the secret.Perhaps these holes are functions of the editing like several inconsistencies and continuity glitches that can be spotted such as Siv's unexplained reappearance in the choir twice after moralistic outbursts. In fact none of the hitches in the film last very long and all seem resolved within a scene. Apart from in some awkward love scenes the film's 127 minutes seldom drag but there is a feeling that things may have been left on the cutting room floor.The film remains solid threestarfare despite the holes that can be picked in it. This is simply because in a world of technologyfocused flicks and materialistic selfseeking any glimpse of human community is deep down welcome for anyone even the cynical.".

The villagers who has followed the genius in silence are slowly tempting him to share of his greatness.Each role in this movie has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own chord in short but precise words a symphony of love.Not love in the sense of relationship but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters each revealing their own present story their needs their skeletons desires and much more.I shall not forget to mention the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist whose dramas are played in unforgettable harmonies of emotional feedback. They touch each other with a pain connected in their own disability to love themselves.Michael Nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic. And fantastic it became from start to end not one second less or more than enough you are left with a feeling of change and a taste for more.To this day definitely one of the best movies I have had the pleasure of watching.".

The villagers who has followed the genius in silence are slowly tempting him to share of his greatness.Each role in this movie has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own chord in short but precise words a symphony of love.Not love in the sense of relationship but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters each revealing their own present story their needs their skeletons desires and much more.I shall not forget to mention the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist whose dramas are played in unforgettable harmonies of emotional feedback. They touch each other with a pain connected in their own disability to love themselves.Michael Nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic. And fantastic it became from start to end not one second less or more than enough you are left with a feeling of change and a taste for more.To this day definitely one of the best movies I have had the pleasure of watching.";

Perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that the Lena character makes at the beginning of the movie and other social comment but perhaps it is because of the central message which I believe has the same appeal everywhere in affluent societies.The message of this movie for me is the same as the movie Titanic. Life is short people and as far as anyone really knows it's all we've got. It can be taken away at any time. So isn't it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls separating us from other people because we're so afraid of being hurt? Tearing down the walls is painful but feeling alive lies on the other side of those wretched walls. Feeling alive is worth taking the risk. Give and you will receive.

Get a grip folks it's a parable a fable for we affluent westerners who are materially rich but whose souls are in abject poverty.So join a choir or a band or help build housing or distribute food for those less fortunate than you.

I loved how it dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps a Hollywood film tends to include. In this film characters worked through problems they had had for decades they worked through prejudicm they learned to open up. But it did not come easily and not just by singing a song or two. It was painful it took arguments it took confrontations. It felt like real life.One scene that really stuck out to me was the scene in which Gabriella sings her song. Helen Sjholm is one of my favorite singers her voice is lovely and you could tell that she was not just lipsyncing to a previous recording during filming which I often find in other movies she really sang with her whole body and soul. You could feel what Gabriella was feeling in that scene. Had this movie been made in Hollywood her song would most likely have been sung toward the end and it would have made her husband open his eyes and see the error of his ways as well as making the other people in the village realise a thing or two. Instead it came halfway through and it did not bring any solutions. Her husband did not become overwhelmed and realise what he's putting her through and it didn't seem to make anyone else in the village more open minded. It was beautiful it was pure and it was touching but it did not magically solve all her problems. That felt real to me that's probably what would have happened in real life. The whole movie felt like real life to me nothing neatly wrapped up but everything with a sense of joy and happiness. You rarely find a movie which feels so realistic.There were a few things that bothered me but hey no movie is perfect. If you haven't already you should go see As it is in Heaven and be filled with a joy for life a sense of hope and the feeling that you've been touched on a level movies rarely reach.

It also manages to be inspiring and thoughtprovoking without preaching or manipulating. The movie unfolds slowly and with great subtlety. At first I wasn't sure if I'd like it. By the end I was captivated and moved. You will think about this film long after you've watched it.The central character Daniel lived as a child in a small village where he was constantly bullied. He eventually moved away and grew up to become a world famous symphony conductor. Emotionally isolated driven and passionatealways seeking for a perfection in music which he could not attainDaniel destroys his health and is forced to retire.He returns with no particular plans to the sparse village where he lived as a child and ends up becoming conductor of the local church choir. Over time as Daniel and the choir rehearse subtle but amazing things begin to occur. The choirmembers though they've lived as neighbors in the village for years begin to experience true communityperhaps for the first time. Daniel discovers as a gift rather than an achievement the thing he had wrecked his life searching for Love. Not just romantic love but love given and received in the context of community. Community with people who it turns out are just as broken as he is. Within this context the music he always dreamed ofmusic that will open the heartemerges. And the music is beautiful.Some in the village struggle with what this emerging community will cost them particularly those who would use fear or violence to hold others close to them. These antagonists are met not with violence in return but with grace. This film does not succumb to the myth of redemptive violence as so many of our stories tend to do. Rather those who rely on imposing their will upon others though fear and violence are exposed as fearful and desperate themselves. They are regarded with compassion.At the climax of the film the choir enters an international competition but to everyone's surprise including their own they transcend mere competition and bring instead an even greater level of community. This is the message of As It Is In Heaven Letting go of fear and of what we hold over others and what others hold over us being honest accepting oneanother and experiencing true community. Truth. Forgiveness. Mercy. Compassion. Grace. Love. Here on earth as it is in heaven.".

	schema:headline " Moving Film Even for the Choir Skeptic";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Nyqvist wonderfully wins over audiences in his portrayal of the well renowned conductor Daniel Dareus. His one goal in life is to create music that opens people's hearts. Ironically it is his heart attack that sends him to the place where he begins to fulfill this aspiration. Daniel retires due to his heart condition and returns to his childhood village where he sustained beating because of his musical background. The whole town is aware of his arrival and are all anxious to seek his professional help. Daniel is quick to refuse all of these callings for help thus trying to alienate himself. The first person to meet Daniel is the minister Stig who welcomes every newcomer with a Bible. Daniel tells him that he is only there to listen. His refusal creates initial tension between these two characters and it quickly spirals out of control. Shortly after their meeting the church choir asks if he will listen to them sing and give them some pointers. Still trying to alienate himself he is slow to reach out to this group. He is given the cantor position and with this group he begins to find what he has been searching for his entire life.The choir members play a pivotal role in this movie. To a cynical movie critic these characters seem very predictable and stereotypical. This may be true but it was very effective and the film was widely accepted in Sweden and many other countries. The problems of this small city seemed very plausible. I thought the characters were brilliantly scripted and acted. Daniel's outstanding performance was complemented by Lena and the other choir members. Lena's stunningly beautiful character catches Daniel's eye right away. As Daniel's love for Lena and the group grows he becomes aware of the problems in everyone's lives around him. Daniel and his music become a remedy for all of the problems of this small town. Inger is able to get away from her loveless relationship with the minister. Gabriella finds some security from her abusive husband Conny. All of each other's problems that they had once ignored had evolved into a support system and they began to treat one another like they were family.The religious symbolism is a recurring theme that takes special attention to notice. At the center of this joyous choir is the savior Daniel he is the Christ figure and his choir members are his disciples or followers. Gabriella tells Daniel how she goes home and relistens to his every word on tape. There is one choir member Siv that does not agree with Daniel's ways. She represents Judas the man who gave up Jesus Christ. Siv reports to the minister who is looking for a reason to get rid of Daniel. Stig is similar to the religious leaders because they accused Christ for not doing the will of the Lord and Stig accuses Daniel for not following the church in his choir direction. Daniel has such an impact on the lives of others that most of the people did not attend church so that they could be with him. Daniel also goes into the river representing the baptism of himself. Finally like Jesus Christ Daniel accomplishes his life's purpose at the time of his death. The religious tone in this film is definitely Swedish the religious skepticism is very Bergmanlike and is a shared belief of the Nordic countries. As It Is In Heaven reminds me of Babette's Feast because of the strong religious symbolisms.As a film with few flaws Pollack leaves me questioning one scene in particular. Conny is finally sent to jail and Gabriella comes to visit him. She brings him pictures of their children and tells him that he needs to change if he wants to see them again. I can not imagine that anyone who has been abused like her would ever give a man a second chance. There is little likelihood this would happen in real life. Unless there is some culture barrier that is keeping me from understanding this part of the movie it personally does not make sense to me.This is a tearjerking film even for a choir skeptic. I couldn't care less for choir let alone a film about a choir but this film was captivating. The plot that was slow moving at first but completely necessary for the building of Daniel's character and the growth of the choir group. Chills ran through my body on two different instances Gabriella's song and the end of the film. The film's ending was predictable but still very touching. As It Is In Heaven leaves the viewer with a feeling that they want to open people's hearts with something that they love.".

The whole town is aware of his arrival and are all anxious to seek his professional help. Daniel is quick to refuse all of these callings for help thus trying to alienate himself. The first person to meet Daniel is the minister Stig who welcomes every newcomer with a Bible. Daniel tells him that he is only there to listen. His refusal creates initial tension between these two characters and it quickly spirals out of control. Shortly after their meeting the church choir asks if he will listen to them sing and give them some pointers. Still trying to alienate himself he is slow to reach out to this group. He is given the cantor position and with this group he begins to find what he has been searching for his entire life.The choir members play a pivotal role in this movie. To a cynical movie critic these characters seem very predictable and stereotypical. This may be true but it was very effective and the film was widely accepted in Sweden and many other countries. The problems of this small city seemed very plausible. I thought the characters were brilliantly scripted and acted. Daniel's outstanding performance was complemented by Lena and the other choir members. Lena's stunningly beautiful character catches Daniel's eye right away. As Daniel's love for Lena and the group grows he becomes aware of the problems in everyone's lives around him. Daniel and his music become a remedy for all of the problems of this small town. Inger is able to get away from her loveless relationship with the minister. Gabriella finds some security from her abusive husband Conny. All of each other's problems that they had once ignored had evolved into a support system and they began to treat one another like they were family.The religious symbolism is a recurring theme that takes special attention to notice. At the center of this joyous choir is the savior Daniel he is the Christ figure and his choir members are his disciples or followers. Gabriella tells Daniel how she goes home and relistens to his every word on tape. There is one choir member Siv that does not agree with Daniel's ways. She represents Judas the man who gave up Jesus Christ. Siv reports to the minister who is looking for a reason to get rid of Daniel. Stig is similar to the religious leaders because they accused Christ for not doing the will of the Lord and Stig accuses Daniel for not following the church in his choir direction. Daniel has such an impact on the lives of others that most of the people did not attend church so that they could be with him. Daniel also goes into the river representing the baptism of himself. Finally like Jesus Christ Daniel accomplishes his life's purpose at the time of his death. The religious tone in this film is definitely Swedish the religious skepticism is very Bergmanlike and is a shared belief of the Nordic countries. As It Is In Heaven reminds me of Babette's Feast because of the strong religious symbolisms.As a film with few flaws Pollack leaves me questioning one scene in particular. Conny is finally sent to jail and Gabriella comes to visit him. She brings him pictures of their children and tells him that he needs to change if he wants to see them again. I can not imagine that anyone who has been abused like her would ever give a man a second chance. There is little likelihood this would happen in real life. Unless there is some culture barrier that is keeping me from understanding this part of the movie it personally does not make sense to me.This is a tearjerking film even for a choir skeptic. I couldn't care less for choir let alone a film about a choir but this film was captivating. The plot that was slow moving at first but completely necessary for the building of Daniel's character and the growth of the choir group. Chills ran through my body on two different instances Gabriella's song and the end of the film. The film's ending was predictable but still very touching. As It Is In Heaven leaves the viewer with a feeling that they want to open people's hearts with something that they love.";

To accompany him from being the stranger to gaining a very important position amidst them. To learn that although he seemingly had everything in life he's about to find even more  it's so moving. He's openminded and embraces everything new and is willing to understand it to dive deep into it. He is confronted with unfairness to others and tries to make this village a better place. Just like the choir everything around him becomes better more aware more lively. Unpleasant arrangements break feelings and selfconfidence blossom. The need to really feel alive becomes louder and louder. His mission to bring to mankind the music that's able to open hearts finally succeeds. Everyone sings his own note. And then he can hear it the whispers from heaven calling him home. I'm so sad that I can't write in my native language. This way I'm limited in my expressions. I wanted to tell you so much more.

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I really enjoyed this movie and its message which is about daring to live life to the fullest. Very poetic with heartwarming and funny and sad scenes very lively it was a pleasure to watch. Here are my exceptions though The movie was way too long and at some point it kept adding more and more additional conflicts so that it started to lose the main story line. I disagree though with another comment that its unrealistic to have so many people with strange problems in such a small village. I think this was absolutely realistic! There are incredible dramas going on everywhere we just don't know this about people we meet only superficially. I disliked the ending which was so loaded with symbolism and extremely forced. It left a bad taste as it was just too much. I did not like it that so many big issues were dramatically mentioned in the group when some accused others in front of everyone else of major things people would just be more ashamed to voice everything so personal in front of everybody even if those people are a group one is closely working with. And defending oneself is a humanbeings strongest instinct. So why on earth would Daniel let himself be beaten and never fight back not even to defend himself? I mean he was not weak he could at least try to defend himself when attacked but it just drove me mad to see him do nothing. It was as if the storyteller tried to forcefully bring across a message like violence is not needed but the way he chose to do this was not good. I am also against violence but the character loses credibility when he stays unmoved despite all the attacks. And Gabriella...why on earth would a woman who has spent years with a man beating her up go to that man when he gets arrested and say I do not wish you any harm. You have just done your best like all of us. Oh really this spoiled so much! Was she going to be a saint or what? It would be normal for her to be bitter but not so almost holy and therefore not human. Was her work with Daniel and the music so great that it made her forget all of the st that happened to her? Oh please. So these were the spoiling moments. Nevertheless I still think this is a delightful movie all in all which is amazing enough given my discomfort with quite a few things. Watch it!! ".

	onyx:emotionText "Firstly I really enjoyed this movie and its message which is about daring to live life to the fullest. Very poetic with heartwarming and funny and sad scenes very lively it was a pleasure to watch. Here are my exceptions though The movie was way too long and at some point it kept adding more and more additional conflicts so that it started to lose the main story line. I disagree though with another comment that its unrealistic to have so many people with strange problems in such a small village. I think this was absolutely realistic! There are incredible dramas going on everywhere we just don't know this about people we meet only superficially. I disliked the ending which was so loaded with symbolism and extremely forced. It left a bad taste as it was just too much. I did not like it that so many big issues were dramatically mentioned in the group when some accused others in front of everyone else of major things people would just be more ashamed to voice everything so personal in front of everybody even if those people are a group one is closely working with. And defending oneself is a humanbeings strongest instinct. So why on earth would Daniel let himself be beaten and never fight back not even to defend himself? I mean he was not weak he could at least try to defend himself when attacked but it just drove me mad to see him do nothing. It was as if the storyteller tried to forcefully bring across a message like violence is not needed but the way he chose to do this was not good. I am also against violence but the character loses credibility when he stays unmoved despite all the attacks. And Gabriella...why on earth would a woman who has spent years with a man beating her up go to that man when he gets arrested and say I do not wish you any harm. You have just done your best like all of us. Oh really this spoiled so much! Was she going to be a saint or what? It would be normal for her to be bitter but not so almost holy and therefore not human. Was her work with Daniel and the music so great that it made her forget all of the st that happened to her? Oh please. So these were the spoiling moments. Nevertheless I still think this is a delightful movie all in all which is amazing enough given my discomfort with quite a few things. Watch it!! ";

	schema:headline " Anything but Heavenly";
	schema:reviewBody "It is almost impossible to believe that Kay Pollack's As It Is in Heaven was made only ten years ago in 2004 for it feels dreadfully more dated than that. This Academy Award nominated film which is essentially the Swedish version of a Lifetime Original Movie with a domestic violence plot line to boot follows renowned conductor Daniel Darus Michael Nyqvist as he returns to his childhood home in the north of Sweden after suffering a heart attack in the middle of one of his concerts. As a kid Daniel was ruthlessly beaten and bullied by his peers but he escaped this harsh childhood with the dream of making music that would connect with people. Upon his return home Daniel becomes the cantor for the local church choir and starts to bring the townspeople together though what he sees as the spiritual quality of music. Complications arise when Daniel confronts a jealous church pastor an abusive husband and various choir members who doubt the sincerity of Daniel's project. Unfortunately the only remarkable thing about Heaven is how painfully generic it is. Everything in this film is simple and dull as if the story arcs characterization dialogue and music were all clumsily smashed into creation by a blindfolded kid with an unwieldy sledgehammer rather than by a skilled artist with a deft touch. The problem begins with a weak script that relies entirely on meager clichs. For example our hero Daniel is the stereotypical passionate artist but he's severely lacking in depth. All we know is that he loves music falls in love with a girl and then dies both randomly and predictably. His foil the uptight Pastor Stig Niklas Falk is disturbed by Daniel's freeflowing ways and surpasses Daniel only in onedimensionality. In a particularly ridiculous scene Stig gets into an argument with his wife Inger Ingella Olsson over his conservative ideas about sexuality. Stig slut shames his wife explodes and has passionate sex with her and then denounces the whole incident the next morning. This tired portrait of the repressed and hypocritical clergyman does nothing for the film nor adds any interesting conflict or complexity.Beyond the disappointingly shallow characterizations Heaven makes a misstep with the plot's desperate grabs for sentimentality. There is of course the domestic violence plot line with the overdone overthetop abusive husband that makes a mere caricature of this real and important social problem. The issue is not that people like the outrageous abuser Conny Per Morberg do not exist in real life but that he and his wife Gabriella Helen Sjholm are written in such a hollow way so as to make it seem like the professionals behind Heaven have never actually encountered a real human being who has been involved the cycle of abuse. In the end Heaven exhibits a detached artificiality that undermines the film's attempt to say something meaningful about the tragedy of abusive relationships and about the empowering triumph for those who survive them. Then there's Tore Andr Sjberg the young man who is at first shunned and underestimated by members of the choir for his intellectual disability and then ultimately accepted. Despite the fact that the film obviously casts Tore in a positive light it is nothing more than cheap idealization. Heaven doesn't demonstrate respect Tore as person or a character but instead uses him as bait for warm fuzzies and reduces him to the object of a patronizing smile. The film's dialogue also betrays some serious flaws. Heaven takes little advantage of the filmic medium and the characters often end up explaining their motivations and feelings outright rather than illustrating them through distinctive behavior wellwritten characterization and revealing cinematic techniques. For instance when Stig shuts down the choir he yells at Daniel unnecessarily I'm taking the choir away from you! Later when Inger criticizes Stig's vendetta against Daniel she shouts You're not angry at him but at what he evokes in you! Of course the English subtitles may not capture the exact essence of the original Swedish but the fact remains that a truly solid script would be able to communicate its themes without any of these clunky verbal explanations. Some movies are disappointing in their failure to live up to their full potential but As It Is in Heaven is not one of them. Wobbly from the start Heaven is terrible in a boring kind of way. Perhaps time is partly to blame for how stale the movie feels and it is possible that in its day Heaven had some aura of charm and novelty. However in 2014 it's difficult to see through the haze of bathetic storytelling and overdone conventions.".

Also I grew up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. It's nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like S som i himmelen. This was a very good film and I'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it's large ensemble cast but Director Kay Pollock really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing. Helen Sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was fantastic and I would look forward to more of her on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this wellrounded cast. I would highly recommend this film and rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.".

	schema:headline " Despite not entirely living up to the original Paranormal Activity 2 is still another grueling excerise in subtle intimate terror";
	schema:reviewBody "Happening in the months leading up to its hit 2009 predecessor Paranormal Activity 2 follows Katie's sister and her family as they experience a series of similar paranormal phenomenon in their home. Determined to get to the bottom of the increasingly threatening occurrences they decide to set up a net of security cameras in and around the house to see what really goes bump in the night. Alas the terror only escalates pushing each of them to their breaking points as they confront a ruthless being that feeds off their very woe and angst that sickeningly wallows in their fear until revealing its final master plan...Despite arguably cloning original's formula this is still a largely enjoyable and chilling sequel. Although if you weren't a fan of the original's slowburning and brooding terror I find it hard to see you appreciating this.

	onyx:emotionText "Happening in the months leading up to its hit 2009 predecessor Paranormal Activity 2 follows Katie's sister and her family as they experience a series of similar paranormal phenomenon in their home. Determined to get to the bottom of the increasingly threatening occurrences they decide to set up a net of security cameras in and around the house to see what really goes bump in the night. Alas the terror only escalates pushing each of them to their breaking points as they confront a ruthless being that feeds off their very woe and angst that sickeningly wallows in their fear until revealing its final master plan...Despite arguably cloning original's formula this is still a largely enjoyable and chilling sequel. Although if you weren't a fan of the original's slowburning and brooding terror I find it hard to see you appreciating this.

You knew there would be a connection between the two movies but instead of their plot lines flowing and making sense like the Saw movies the 'connection' was a mishmash of stereotypical horrorparanormal genre revelations.There's two or three scenes out the movie that will make you jump briefly but only because they catch you off guard. You are kept on edge the whole movie because you realize that like PA1 one You were kept in some suspense waiting for that really scary moment that just really never came it fell flat.The ending epitomizes the entire movie. For about 1015 seconds the screen turns black no credits no nothing...just black and you're wondering if it'll be like PA1 where there's a last second surprise. No nothing happens. The credits begin to roll the final suspense and final let down... The ending symbolizes the entire movie in 10 seconds.Not to let an opportunity pass by it is left wide open for a sequel.However on a humorous up note PA2 introduced Stenchilada which will stay with me for awhile. I will also say that this version may actually transfer better to home 'video' for viewing and may be a little scarier watched in an intimate setting especially if you have a little one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Last year Paranormal Activity was released nation wide and became the new Blair Witch Project it was a movie you just had to see because all you kept hearing was how scary it was. The trailer was pretty clever in only showing the audience's screams and members hiding under their coats and covering their eyes. I thought it was an extremely clever film and one of the best horror movies we have had in a while and I noticed others either they loved it or they hated it. In my opinion as a film buff it's what we don't see and our imagination that is most terrifying but in this generation of internet texting and TV we have a bunch of ADD people who need to see blood or monsters in order for that to scare them. Paranormal Activity was a huge hit at the box office and a sequel was immediately planned which I didn't appreciate because now it's about the money. However I still decided to give the film a chance and see how the story continued and it actually wasn't as bad as I was expecting. Instead we get more of a prequel to the first film and it explains how Katie became haunted by the demon. This time the demon is haunting her sister and her new family in their beautiful home.In 2006 a burglary occurs at the home of Kristi and Dan. Every single room is completely trashed except for their infant son Hunter's bedroom. The only thing stolen is a necklace that Kristi's sister Katie had given her. Dan installs a number of security cameras throughout the house to watch over their son Hunter. The family starts to hear noises and see items fall or move on their own. Martine the family housekeeper and nanny believes evil spirits are the cause and attempts to cleanse the house of evil spirits and Dan fires her after catching her burning sage. Katie and Kristi talk about being tormented by a demon or unknown spirit when they were children. Dan's daughter Ali begins investigating the mysterious happenings. She discovers that on occasion a human can make a deal with a demon for wealth or power by forfeiting the life of their firstborn son. She also realizes that until Hunter there had not been a male child born in Kristi and Katie's family since the time of their greatgreat grandmother.What I liked about this film was the characters who were a bit more likable than the first film they seemed so real to me. The family reacted exactly how most people would act towards finding out that they are being haunted by a demon. There are some genuinely creepy moments one of the biggest being when Kristi is sitting in the kitchen and BAM!!! the cabinet doors fly open as she's trying to keep it together and trying to convince herself that it's not real. There are some laughable moments like when the demon keeps knocking the cooking pan off the rack and all I'm thinking is how bored is this demon that he just wants to more annoy Kristi vs. terrify her? I tell you though clean freaks beware of this demon! My only other complaint being is that the effects were a little bit cheesy with the demon pulling Kristi out of her room. The first film seemed more realistic with the way the demon was behaving by dragging Katie out of bed. However I did like how the film ended and I think this was a fun addition to the Paranormal Activity story. I wouldn't mind if the sequels continued on other characters but for now I think it's a good closure and we should leave it at that. I do recommend the movie for a fun scary night it's always more effective when you're at home alone in the dark.710".

All you see for 1015min is green rolling around on the TV along with some cheap growling effects. Screw this movie. Don't walk into this movie expecting to see a lot of spiritual contact with the living because you will be disappointed. It's mostly a movie playing with sound effects to try to creep you out.

A year later she went back with me to see the sequel and she was actually terrified this time around. And a girl in the theater actually got so scared she threw up outside the theater.Paranormal Activity is one of those rare gems where you love it or you hate it. Most audiences don't like to sit through what they like to call nothing when the film is genuinely trying to build up to tension to get to know the characters before plummeting them against the unknown. I really like the establishing of the characters where we get to know Christi Hunter Ali and heck even the dog.The premise is simple A family related to Katie in the first film moves into a house has a baby and everything seems to be like one big happy family. Then one day they find that their house is in shambles. Naturally they want to discover why so a surveillance system is set up to monitor the house. What they discover is that there is something beyond a simple breakin and their lives especially their baby could be in jeopardy.I like the fact that the father is a skeptic. He absolutely refuses to believe in the paranormal. The teenage daughter loves the fact that they are being haunted and relishes on what phenomenon would happen next. I like that. It's good build up because we know as an audience that things will eventually get worse especially if we learned anything from the first film. It's all about character development in which this film thrives on.As the film progresses the scares really come out of nowhere. As a sequel they really had to take it up a notch not with just having a baby and a dog but to show those naysayers that Paranormal Activity isn't just about a film with slamming doors. Doors slam but they take someone with them. The filmmakers listened to their fans and not only that they did a great job fleshing out the backstory and intertwining the two movies together where it all makes sense.I only have a few nitpicks somewhat minor but I really did wish they fleshed out the Martine character more. She was a nanny who knew a lot about evil spirits and I wish they spent a little bit more time with her character. Another thing was that there parts in some of the trailers that didn't make it to the final film. Extended DVD perhaps? I also was a tad let down by how everything concluded. It wasn't a total letdown definitely leaves room for another installment but a little too abrupt for my taste.If you are a fan of Paranormal Activity or at least bit curious of how this one turns out you owe it to yourself to see this one. It's definitely one to experience at the theater with other fans and something to look forward to on your home surround system.".

It currently stands at two entries but will have many more by the time people tire of seeing the same film multiple times. Paramount did a very good job with the first sequel and was aware of what the fans wanted. Paranormal Activity 2 has more quick scares than the original and builds on its story. It also canonizes the first one's theatrical ending.The movie is both a prequel and sequel to Paranormal Activity. The cast of characters has been enlarged to include the sister of the first film's Katie. Her sister Kristi lives with her husband Dan and his daughter Ali. They have a newborn son Hunter who serves as a focal point for many of the scares. After Hunter's first birthday unusual things begin to happen. Objects begin to move independently and loud noises trouble the family. Dan installs security cameras everywhere and Ali becomes afraid the family is being bothered by a demon. She does some research and finds out that her hunch is true. The demon is after Hunter because of some deal family ancestors made with it a long time ago. After Kristi becomes possessed by it Dan performs a ritual that transfers the demon to Katie. At this point the events of the first movie take place. Kristi's new normal life is interrupted when Katie arrives and kidnaps Hunter.The sequel is clearly a corporate production. The movie follows a formula for the entirety of its running time. The characters speak for a few minutes about inane things a scary event happens and they react. Admittedly the first film does this too but it is able to link the boo moments into a feeling of lingering dread. Its downtime doesn't permit viewers to relax like they may this time. Baby Hunter becomes necessary to artificially insert tension and get audiences ready to jump. It's more unsettling to see a defenseless child whose crib is always kept in a different room despite his frequent crying than it is to see capable people in terror.Given the lack of a wellpresented story the movie has to resort to several clichs to sew each vignette together. The family's Hispanic maid and lovable dog are the only characters besides Hunter that interact directly with the demon. The maid warns the family to take precautions which Dan ignores. She is fired and the dog has a seizure just in time for the longest vignette. There are even photos of ethnic people on the walls as an added touch. These outdated stereotypes and the scare formula make the movie seem like such a product. The script was intelligently written to tie in well with the original but it's superfluous. If you want to see a shaky camera movie this fall go see The Last Exorcism.Not Recommended".

This review may contain spoilers.So the first disappointment is that is is a prequel that at some point runs parallel to the original story. This doesn't explain much of what happened and what would happen to anybody but is merely an expansion of the original story a parallel if you will  that gives no payback at the end. This is due to the obvious option to leave the franchise open to another film. Just wait for PA3 the explanation coming sometime next year. this franchise is the most successful movie ever done from a cost  profit standpoint  i could see why they want to keep on milking this cow for at least another run.The story felt somewhat as an afterthought even if they claim it was announced about at the same time as PA1. It had the same approach but this time being the second release some of the elements felt a little forced  as viewers I feel we had higher expectations on the scary parts and though there were a couple hits here and there the movie built up too slowly and lacked the surprise of the original. Overall is a cool flick to watch at night around halloween and somewhat of a decent story parallel to the original. but there's a lot of holes and questions and really no resolution. Not bad at all but nothing of a game changer like the original. Also I admire the concept of going to the grocery store and spending 40 on groceries to make sandwiches and then selling those for 10000 each. From a business standpoint this movies are plain brilliant they took my money for sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the first film at the cinema and not being too disappointed but not completely overwhelmed with praise I thought I'd give the second one a chance after hearing pretty good reviews from it. I'd also heard that those who liked the first one would find the second one better. I however did not feel this way in the slightest. First of all I had to convince my boyfriend to come and see the film with me making the first 20 minutes of nothing incredibly painful for particularly myself as it was my fault we even bothered to see it. Regarding these first 20 minutes I watched in anticipation of it getting better and tried to appreciate that tension had to be created for a successful climax. This however did not occur. I found myself laughing at the incredibly slow progress of 'scary' events such as the mobile spinning and a couple of bumps here and there. I was not the only one. The whole audience at my screening laughed at the film's poor attempt to shock the viewer by levitating a baby. The ending was also pretty meagre as it ended with more people dying just like in the first one except in the first one it had been unexpected. By the end of paranormal activity 2 I felt almost cheated. Despite this there were some positive elements to this film. The scene in which all the cupboards opened suddenly and unexpectedly was probably the highlight as this did actually spook me. The possession part was also pretty OK particularly when she was dragged down the basement. These were the few scenes that stood alone from the cheesier more predictable events such as Kristi being dragged down the stairs  this part had me laughing at it's pure failure to even surprise me. Cristisms aside the acting had improved vastly so from the first one and I found the actors to be more convincing. I also liked the link between the two films though I felt it was rushed even so. To conclude Paranormal Activity 2 is not worth seeing if you are not easily scared. For those of you that find a couple of pans dropping terrifying then this is the film for you. Other than that I recommend seeing some more old school horror type films like The Ring which I suspect this film got it's main idea from anyway. As for my own enjoyment the most entertaining part of my experience was the teenager that tripped in the middle of the aisle before jumping out of his skin at a 'scary part' as he went to sit down.".

	schema:reviewBody "I do not know what is it that made Paranormal Activity such a big hit that it even had a sequel actually a prequel which is now also a hit. The first movie was only mildly disturbing in its videocam style documentation of the strange goingson in a suburban house. This second film follows in basically the same tread with almost no variation.PA2 recounts the ghostly experience of a woman who is the sister of Katie the wife in the first movie. She moves into a house in Carlsbad California with her husband stepdaughter her own toddler son and their trusty dog. Because of a breakin they set up security cameras around the house and that is where this footage comes from. These events supposedly occur 30 days before the death of Micah Sloat the lead guy in the first movie.While the first movie had the advantage of novelty this second one really felt boring already with the very slow build up of action. However do people really have time to wait for more than 50 minutes into a horror movie before anything that could be called scary happens? We get the same gimmicks like sudden bangs and pulling people which already happened in the first movie. I cannot think of anything really new here except the presence of the toddler which was tense. After all that nothing the supposed climactic scene in the basement was terribly unintelligible.This second movie ends by connecting to the first installment. However the epilogue statement seems to hint at still another episode. I think this series has really taken its novelty effect to its full course. Enough already!".

There are strange occurrences in the household including the house being trashed during a supposed break in. This prompts the installation of video cameras with recorders to record events in and outside of the house. The daughter stumbles across something on the internet suggesting that there may be a demon in the house. This is seconded by the nanny who senses an evil presence. Sounds like a kind of scary premise right? Well that's about it the premise is never developed. While We learn that the mother and her sister experienced Disturbances when they were growing up we never learn what was the nature of them only that they do not talk about them. We never learn if there was an ancestor that made a Deal with the devil it is brought up and suggested and the movie fleshed out with that premise just accepted. However it is never explored in any way and that really makes the plot WEAK. I know it will seem a cheap shot but I will make it anyway on the cast listing on IMDD the camera installer man is listed at the top. He gave perhaps the most solid performance of any of the actors and actresses so perhaps it was meant that way. Three stars is my rating a good premise developed with a weak plot and mediocre acting only goes so far. The sad part is that this could have been so good and so frightening. My gut tells me like other reviewers have mentioned that this was a rush job to capitalize on the first movie and not an attempt at a good memorable movie as it is not.".

With this instalments story you cannot call this a sequel or prequel as it would not attract to any of the terms. Taking place at the same time as the original we are this time placed in the house of another American family related to Kate and Micah who undergo a similar situation to their counterparts at the same time. It's intriguing as links and connections build between the two films and the fear installed inside me was enough to satisfy my needs. The main reason 'Paranormal Activity 2' has the edge over it's predecessor is the fact it's budget is increased by approximately almost 3 million. This gives the film an overall better structure and polish which leads to a larger variety of scares and more interesting camera viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The proper translation of this movie title would be Reserved for Death. This is a neat little cloakanddagger spy story shot in glorious black and white and released in 1963 at the height of the Cold War. What makes this movie different is that it was produced in East Germany! Here is the basic set up Erich Becker played by HansPeter Minetti is a former East German national living in Stockholm Sweden. He flies to Frankfurt in West Germany to meet someone about a job. We learn that Erich will have to take a night train to Erfuhrt East Germany and meet a certain Dr. Jadenburg played by Martin Flrchinger and then bring him back to West Germany. Erich is given false papers with an assumed name so the East German authorities will not know. Clearly this job is spy mission on behalf of the West German government!Once Erich is on the train he meets a young woman named Hanna played by Irma Mnch who knows about the plan. She then reveals other details that give Erich doubts about continuing. A reluctant spy he considers getting off the train before it enters East Germany. But the last stop before crossing the border is quickly approaching! Are any other spies involved? Who can Erich really trust? And are the East Germans already aware of this mission and setting up a trap? On the face of it this looks like a classic 1960's spy movie of the Smiley variety. Some might consider it a propaganda film but this viewer disagrees. The depiction of West Germany using stock footage and their own props seems fair and accurate. At the border both the western and eastern customs officials were presented as polite and efficient properly German in other words. With that said the Bad Guys are definitely those people who sent Erich Becker into East Germany on a dangerous mission.It is important to know that at the time this movie was made the Berlin Wall had just been erected. The official position of the East German government was that the border was sealed to protect their own citizens against Fascism and Aggression primarily coming from the United States. West Germany might have more luxuries but its politics were bankrupt. Yes some people might be lured away from East Germany by promises of money but it came at a moral cost. Any film made in East Germany that did not agree with this view would simply not be released. And any foreign films that depicted East Germany in a negative way would never be shown there. Censorship in East Germany was a constant way of life...Of some interest here is that the two primary actors in this movie HansPeter Minetti and Irma Mnch were married in real life and had a son Daniel. Born in 1958 Daniel Minetti is also an actor who is currently working. HansPeter enjoyed a long productive career in East Germany until 1990 at which point the regime collapsed. Thereafter he received a lot of criticism for his strong support of East Germany. No more major roles for him!".

	schema:reviewBody "For those of you who have read Hemingway you will be surprised and captivated by the boyishness of the prewar Hemingway that O'Donnell gives us so beautifully.  The episodes in the life of the author that are covered by In Love and War are for the most part not pretty.  However they give an insight into the writing of America's greatest author that no other movie of his work has ever done.  Those who expected a movie version of A Farewell to Arms did not receive it because the autobiographical In Love and War does not tell the same story that the semiautobiographical book A Farewell to Arms did.  In Love and War is far closer to the truth as other Hemingway scholars will attest.  In that way this movie is a valuable historical and biographical resource for people interested in Hemingway and his experiences in WWII Italy.If you are watching this movie just for fun however and not to gain insight into a book or an author's life there is much here for you as well. Bullock and O'Donnell have a wonderful chemistry and the lighthearted moments are weighed against a tale of great agony and suffering without being preachy or too painful.  There are serious moments when the reality of life and war come home to Ernest and there are beautiful moments when Catherine explores Italy.  It's a wonderful mix of the dramatic and the light without being overdone or showy.  The realism is striking.  I hope that everyone who watches this movie enjoys it as much as I did.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's something screwy in the Imdb ratings for this movie. Almost 25 of the votes are 10 yet its rating is 5.8!!  No way. This is a genuine 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 film depending on your personal likes and dislikes. I give it 8.In Love and War is based on the real experience of 18yrold Ernest Hemmingway who could not get into the regular Army because of a problem in one eye. However he made it to Italy as a journalist and actually was wounded near the front lines. He fell in love with his nurse and they vowed to marry after the war.Hemmingway is played by Chris O'Donnel which is my only 'beef' with the casting. Although he does a fine job we all know that Hemmingway was a more gruff person and it never seemed realistic.  Sandra Bullock plays the nurse and I liked her very much in this role.Anyway when he gets sent back to the USA she stays in Italy. She thinks she is in love with an Italian doctor and breaks off her pledge to Hemmingway.  He doesn't take it well he smashes up things goes into a drinking depression and is never the same. Even after the nurse returns to say she is sorry and still loves him. His pride kept him from forgiveness and presumably was responsible for his suicide in his early 60s. Overall a fine film about young men and women and their roles in the war and its aftermath. The photography is beautiful and the dialog unifirmly wellstructured.".

Ernerst Hemingway the main character is a young man who serves as a reporter. War is always connected with risk so one day Ernie appeared in the hospital. Here he mets his love Agnes von Kurowsky. She is a beautiful and talented nurse who can't stay indifferent for this handsome and charming youth. I can not say that this movie became my favorite one but I like it. This is a romantic story. However In Love and War touches many issues that are actual even now days.There are a number of positive moments for me. As it was already mentioned the problems appeared in the movie can be interested for many people. Such topics as friendship love bravery betrayal and pride are reflected in the movie. And now a few words about the way the film was shot. I like the director's work. The movie contains many interesting foreshortening. There are a lot of scenes with nature and we can enjoy different landscapes. The choice of actors is good. The main character Agnes von Kurowsky is created by a brilliant actress Sandra Bullock. She is so aristocratic and realistic in the film that I believe her for 100. Besides the ending of the movie is unexpected.Nevertheless there are some negative moments either. The beginning of the movie is overextended and some scenes seem unnecessary. My strongest disappointment is in the fact that this movie does not cause any strong emotions. Of course it makes you sympathize with the main characters but you are not immersed in the atmosphere entirely. As a result the movie won't stay in memory for a long time.Despite of the boring beginning the film is worth watching. It is a thoughtprovoking and touching lovestory. Moreover it is based on the real events. So we can get some details about Hemingway's life. If you want to create your own clear impression of this story I would recommend you to read a book ''A Farewell to Arms'' at first.".

It deserves a 910 for portraying a side of reality which Hollywood rarely dares to show.One piece of criticism I have is that there is an implication at the end of the film that Hemingway suicided because of his failed relationship with Agnes. However it is unlikely that this is the case. After writing brilliant pieces of literature especially in the late 1920s Hemingway's writing took a downward turn and he could no longer meet the high standards in the literature world that he himself had set. Depressed he was often writing under the influence of alcohol in an attempt to 'enhance' his work. Nonetheless these pieces were still unable to please his critics and it was during this stage in his life that he committed suicide.For interest Ernest and Agnes occasionally wrote to each other afterwards but one of Agnes' boyfriends burnt the letters that Ernest wrote to her including the his reply to her letter breaking up their love relationship.".

The movie not just answers the question in the title of my review but shows us in detail how it really happens. From the very beginning you start to believe actors emotions and feelings they express and of course the setting. The story starts when young reporter Ernest Hemingway Chris O'Donnell comes to an Italy town as a volunteer in period of World War I. Soon he is injured and transported to the hospital where he meets Agnes Sandra Bullock  he instantly falls in love with her but he is not her only admirer. Surrounded by a number of lovers and all atrocities of war will Agnes respond Ernest in kind?The thing I like most is the way how the war is shown. Notwithstanding that there are little battle scenes and action always takes place in hospital we can see all terrors of war from the backyard. You always sympathize with very young soldiers who are in the hospital especially those who are deadly injured.Even if you are not a fan of war films or romances I advise you to watch the movie just to broaden your horizons and not to forget what the war is. The love storyline is quite simple the same thing can be said about characters but there is something catching in this movie something that makes me think that one day I will watch it once again. 810".

He is shot in the leg during World War 1 and spends the remainder of the film within a boring romance with a nurse until arriving at an ending that should grant every viewer their money back. Directed by Richard Attenborough with realistic yet graphic images of war. He previously made Gandhi and Chaplin so this is a major step down. O'Donnell and Sandra Bullock are hardly convicting because they are used to jerk viewers around with their romantic bullshit as oppose to address real issues regarding the war. In bland supporting roles are MacKenzie Astin and Ingrid Lacey who can only hope that this garbage isn't the end for them in terms of their careers. Had the film concentrated on conditions of victims hospitals and effects of the war then it might have been convicting but it sidetracks that by turning the concept into romantic drivel in its peep show depravity.

	schema:headline " A very moving understated love story";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the 1989 book Hemingway in Love and War by Henry S. Villard and James Nagel this is an extremely effective and often very moving depiction of the teenage Ernest Hemingway's relationship with the 26yearold nurse Agnes von Kurowsky in Italy during the latter stages of the First World War. They fell in love and were planning on getting married after the war ended but Agnes broke up with him as she thought that he was too young. The experience left an indelible mark on Hemingway and it directly inspired several of his works most notably A Farewell to Arms. The film has a very strong script and it is extremely well and sensitively directed by Richard Attenborough who was the obvious choice to handle this material. It bears some superficial similarities to his previous film Shadowlands in that it likewise concerns a famous author who has his first real experience of romantic love but then has to deal with the loss of that love albeit in an extremely different way. It is not on the same level as that film one of Attenborough's absolute best but it nevertheless a very good film.Chris O'Donnell is very good as the 1819yearold Hemingway. He is depicted as a brash arrogant headstrong young man who joined the Red Cross in search of adventure. Considering that it was the War to End All Wars he did not believe that he would get another chance to fight. However the reality of the situation hits home when he receives a severe leg wound in the process of saving a young Italian soldier named Roberto who dies shortly thereafter. He is taken to an American Red Crossrun hospital where he meets Agnes who is played very well by Sandra Bullock for the first time. Hemingway is immediately smitten but she maintains a polite disinterest for him for some time until she realises that she has fallen for him as well. The two of them have a very sweet understated romance. Seven years is not much of an age difference in most adult relationships but it's a very big one when it is between 19 and 26. Hemingway is very brave and certainly very intelligent but he is still a teenager and occasionally does stupid things most notably when he lies to his friend and rival Harry Villard and says in her presence that he and Agnes slept together. She slaps in the face  I'd have probably done the same thing in her position  but eventually forgives him.The main problem is that Agnes is a mature woman while Hemingway is very immature in many respects. He rushes headlong into their relationship and proposes marriage with only a vague and fairly unrealistic plan for their postwar life. Given that she accepts his proposal she is initially swept away by the romance of the situation but she soon develops doubts about it. When Villard tells Agnes that she will be good for him as she can take care of him she points out that this is what his mother is for. While Agnes is not quite as strong a character as I would have liked O'Donnell and Bullock have great chemistry and many of their scenes together particularly the last one are very affecting. The supporting cast is very good particularly Emilio Bonucci as Hemingway's more serious romantic rival Dr. Domenico Caracciolo Mackenzie Astin as Villard and Ingrid Lacey as Elsie MacDonald.The film was aptly titled as it also explores the horror of war something which Attenborough previously did albeit more extensively and effectively in Oh! What a Lovely War and his masterpiece A Bridge Too Far. This is best handled in the case of Hemingway's friend Jimmy McBride who suffers horrific injuries to most of his body. He eventually loses the will to live and commits suicide as the pain is just too great. The discovery of his body is the most moving scene in the entire film. As far as I can tell McBride is an entirely fictional character so it is possible that his fate was intended as a reference to Hemingway's own suicide in 1961. Hemingway shows a softer side as well as his writing ability when he dictates the perfect letter to McBride's parents supposedly from their son. It was a very kind thing to do.I've read several of Hemingway's novels but I am certainly not an expert on either his body of work or his life. However I learned from a New York Times article published to mark the film's release that it took some liberties. In reality according to her Dear John letter she came to realise that she was very fond of him as a son rather than a sweetheart whereas she truly loved him in the romantic sense in the film. Their relationship is consummated in the film but they probably never did so in real life and the article argues that they were probably both virgins when they returned to the United States. I'm of two minds as to whether it was a good decision to have them sleep together in the film. Finally they never saw each other after Agnes sent him the Dear John letter but they have one final meeting in the film. While the two of them never seeing each other again would have been a more poignant ending their last brief encounter is necessary given the way that the film is structured. At the end of the film Hemingway is as most people would picture him bearded brooding and drinking.Overall this is an extremely strong film on the subject of first love doomed love and the problems associated with notable age gaps in relationships. That said it is more of a FebruaryMarch relationship than a MayDecember one! The film's biggest problem is that it loses a little bit of its momentum in the last 20 to 25 minutes.".

Their relationship is consummated in the film but they probably never did so in real life and the article argues that they were probably both virgins when they returned to the United States. I'm of two minds as to whether it was a good decision to have them sleep together in the film. Finally they never saw each other after Agnes sent him the Dear John letter but they have one final meeting in the film. While the two of them never seeing each other again would have been a more poignant ending their last brief encounter is necessary given the way that the film is structured. At the end of the film Hemingway is as most people would picture him bearded brooding and drinking.Overall this is an extremely strong film on the subject of first love doomed love and the problems associated with notable age gaps in relationships. That said it is more of a FebruaryMarch relationship than a MayDecember one! The film's biggest problem is that it loses a little bit of its momentum in the last 20 to 25 minutes.";

As everyone knows all the events of that times are so hard and tense because of the World War I but love has a great power. Despite on War this ate gave people the opportunity to make a very happy couple. The romance between Agness and Ernest erupts unexpectedly. And even such an independent person as Agnes that doesn't believe in love at first sight fall in love with the 18 year old boy. Actually in the move they felt such a pure feelings to each other that makes us thinking about our habitual life. The plot of the story is deep and characterized by touching and sentimental features. Sandra Bullok in the role of Agness is so reserved representative and unruly nurse that at first we may say that she doesn't interested in anything except her job but when everything happens we can see that her heart is not so cold as it seems. Another main character Chris O'Donnel plays in the role of Enrest. In the movie we can see that this 18 year old boy is an independent reporter that is also handsome nice and confident in life. I should say that it's very impressive that such opposite people fall in love with each other. I think it help us to trust in something incredible. But even here everything can't be good. Dr. Caracciolo fell in love with a young Agness. To my mind the only one disadvantage of this move is the absence of happy end. Such a beautiful love story does not have any good result and it made me disappointed. This film is worthy of viewing and I think it won't leave anyone indifferent.".

So thanks to the director and the cast for creating this feeling of hope for the better.When I watch any film the first thing that draws my attention is the atmosphere created by many details that may seem meaningless separately but combined together they give a clear picture of the narration and make you involved and sympathetic to the characters and people of that time on the whole. At the same time it cannot be denied that everything in the film is depicted so idealistic and so gorgeous that the whole picture becomes a little bit unrealistic and some scenes  naive.Another thing is the state you are in when you are watching a film. Sometimes you need and crave such films to experience the same trials with the main characters sympathize with them and simply cry being overflowed with emotions.

They are beautiful and act well. I do not have much to say here.While watching the film I had a strong desire to find a book the film based on just because I am more interested in reading books than in watching their screen versions. An interesting fact is that the film is based on the book Hemingway In Love and War 1989 by Henry S. Villard and James Nagel but there is one more book  which was written by Hemingway himself  A Farewell to Arm 1929 depicting the exact story of love in another way. In the latter book you will find fictitious names and the events so developed and so changed that almost nothing of the plot seem to be the part of Hemingway's biography. Probably as in many fictional books that have been written due to the influence of some circumstances of authors' lives Hemingway turned the story another way round on purpose. Thus if you are really interested in Hemingway and his literary career it is necessary to pay attention to three sources to charge about the objectivity of the film the books mentioned above and Hemingway's biography.To sum it up I really liked the film because I did not have an aim to search for imperfections but I do not want to rewatch it again as I will start doing it subconsciously. Probably it does not fit the structure logic and filling of a review but at least these are my honest opinion and thoughts I wanted to share.My rating is 9 out 10 minus one for the idealistic representation.".

	schema:reviewBody "In love and War is a movie based on the book Hemingway in Love and War by Henry S. Villard and James Nagel that describes the events of young Hemingway's life during the wartime. Ernest Hemingway goes to war in Italy where he is accidentally shot and sent to a local hospital. There he falls in love with an American nurse. The movie depicts the first serious challenge for Hemingway  War and the first Love of a young boy who is known as one of the most prominent writers of all time. This will be captivating for anyone who loves warlove stories and those who don't know this part of Hemingway's life.First this movie is worth watching because of the cast. Chris O'Donnell plays young Hemingway. Though this actor is not very famous his acting is pretty impressive if consider for example the difference in the character in the beginning of the movie when Ernest is a naive fearless 18year old boy who is willing to make a contribution to this war by any cost and at the end of the movie when Ernest is disappointed in love and life man. I think this work of a young actor is worthy of respect especially when your partner is an incredibly talented actress Sandra Bullock. She plays Agnes Von Kurowsky an American nurse who falls in love with Ernest. Sandra Bullock is known mostly by her famous comedies as Miss Congeniality Proposal etc. But in this movie she is introduced as a brilliant drama actress who portrays Agnes as delicate and tender. Second the director's work is firstrate. There is no moment when you get distracted from the plot because of bad director's cut. Also the music score is quite professional because soundtracks do not distract from the movie events but at the same time I can't say that some soundtrack stuck in my mind so they're not outstanding.If compare this movie with other war movies it stands out from the list because there is only one scene showing military actions but the other part of the movie shows the life of wounded soldiers in the hospital. On the one hand that's a good thing because when Love is the main plot line you don't expect to see firefights and dead soldiers so it's certainly a plus. But on the other hand the life in the hospital is so merry so you actually forget that it's wartime.All in all it'a good melodrama for allages even for children. They can learn new things about Love War and young Hemingway. Except perhaps one sceneBut parents may close their children's eyes. I can't say I'm delighted after watching this movie but it's simply because I hate both melodramas and war movies. And all the negative things I noticed are the disadvantages of the book the movie is based on so let's say the movie is the best it could be and I advise to watch it to everyone. It's 9 out of 10.".

In 1918 18yearold Hemingway had volunteered to fight in the war and during an attack in Italy his leg was wounded a lot and he was taken to the hospital where he was lucky or not to meet 26yearold nurse Agnes and to fall in love with her. But did she feel the same? Good and even more bad things can be said about this film. And the plot with the costumes are one of the strongest points of the picture. Although there are many similar works this looks different. Probably the fact that this very story is based on real events makes me worrying about the main characters and all depicted atrocities of the war also make their contribution into perception. Some episodes will settle in my mind for example when a little girl called a nurse Angel or the man committed suicide or those first signs of the love. I think any person will definitely find something to think about after watching the film.Though the plot is fine the majority of the film you would feel bored. The cause of it is a long beginning along with the actors' play. Sandra Bullock played Agnes von Kurowsky and I really like her and have seen so many movies with her The Proposal The Lake House Miss Congeniality and the others. And in every film she was brilliant and bright and the one who made a great impression on me every time I saw her in the movies. But here she was plain and uninteresting. It seems that she tried to reserve her emotions and maybe she does not fit to this role. She looked sleepy and factitious. What about Chris O'Donnell as Ernest 'Ernie' Hemingway he was not bad there but not impressive and charismatic as I anticipated his character should have been. He was not energetic and sassy enough as he was trying to be and his playing just spoiled my impression on this film.To conclude all mentioned above I want to say that this was OK good because it was about the war and love and everything but it was not impressive at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zhivko Chingo wrote a children's book in the 1970s a Yugoslavian best seller 'Golemata voda' 'The Great Water' about the way the children of Macedonia responded to the critical changes Communism created in the country in 1945. It is stunningly brought to the screen by Ivo Trajkov as a labor of love and dedication and as an attempt to pay homage to the philosophical sensibilities of the Macedonian people in a difficult time of transition.The film begins in the present as old Lem Meto Jovanovski is experiencing a heart attack and while he is being wheeled into a hospital and examined and wired he has memory flashbacks to his childhood in 1945 when the WW II was over Stalin was in power and orphans were placed in 'orphanages' reeducation facilities to learn the Communist life. Young Lem Saso Kekenovski was brought to the 'orphanage' when his parents were imprisoned for their antiStalin stance and since he is new to the system he must quickly adjust to the Dickenslike poor house conditions. He is befriended by his 'instructors' Ariton Mitko Aposolovski and Olivera Verica Nedeska learning how to adjust to the role of obedient brainwashing. The most influential person in Lem's life arrives in the form of young Isak Maja Stankovska whose girlfriend has been in the camp prior to Isak's arrival. The manner in which Lem struggles to repay Isak's kindnesses is by acting as a liaison with camp commander to find Isak's love. It is this friendship's course that serves as the tender core of this film.The struggles quietly underplaying all of the camp surface activity are many the dichotomy of a Communist ideology removing the Church from existence with a people dependent upon the spiritual values of religion the StalinTito issue the adjustments to the policies of Communist regime in a country where fierce national pride had ruled and the depersonalization of children into political pawns despite the need for role models and the luxury of growing up with friends and confidants. But it is the powerful effect of retrospect as the old Lem relives this tragic time that fills this film with luminous meaning.This is one of the few films that has been made in Macedonia a former portion of Yugoslavia now the Republic of Macedonia and it is a genuinely touching finely tuned work of art one that depends on a large cast of nonprofessional child actors gathered from the Macedonian schools by Ivo Trajkov. The DVD is accompanied by a statement by Trajkov not only about the film but also about the pride of Macedonians that is enlightening and tender. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp".

The magic in the book performed by young Isaac turns the adaptation for screen into a very different matter.The story has been already told in some other comments. I guess it's better to give more ideas on other issues that are crucial to the miseenscne for the work.First of all the absolutely perfect team work of Czechs Macedonians Dannish and people from some other countries who contributed to the making of this film. Their superb work is duly translated to the finished film. It's not that often that the use of sound is so chilling and perfect as it is in this film.The children actors who take the load of the lead roles are perfect. I think somebody said before that because of the almost absence of dialogue their being there in front of the cameras is enough. Really this is misunderstanding the dramatic effort needed to convey feelings states of mind and many other facets of the psyche especially for a child. I should say that their work is believable natural engrossing and in many moments chilling never cheesy or overacted. Their work reminisces of certain horrifying films related with the situation depicted here as in Trzok where the lead role lies on the back of a very young child and makes the film all the more convincing because he ACTS the way his character is supposed to behave.This film as in the book has many fictional intimate and surreal scenes. They are committed to the screen very convincingly. The portrayal of a camp from the period it's set in is accurate.Maybe there are people who can vote a meager 1 to this film. It's respectable. But objectively after reading the comments it is clear that some people shouldn't be allowed to have any opinion on anything if there's such a deep ignorance that makes them think that. Ignorance doesn't make reality disappear.This is not a small film. Thank God these films are oriented to people with knowledge of contemporary history and not to the big American audiences.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE GREAT WATER. Based on a novel it starts in the lead characters moment between life and death. In the present day opening scene an ageing politician wordless Meto Jovanovski  is rushed to the hospital. The trauma triggers flashback recollections of his orphanage childhood. In that single moment when he is about to step to the other side to face himself his loneliness pain  fear and a never forgotten friend the dying man remembers everything. Every single moment that shaped his life forever. As he was captured as a kid by the partisans after the Second World War ended in Yugoslavia he is taken to the made up orphanage where friendly political indoctrination is in progress. Saso Kekenovski in the lead role with his bugwide eyed hollow stare is memorable as a lost soul. Same goes for his bloodbrother Isaac  Maja Stankovska utterly convincing playing a boy who delivers a chilling portrayal of a Damian lookalike powerful Darth Sidious. Their acting is effortless even though there are not many dialogues the scenes and their young faces perfectly describe every single scene. The movie itself is something like Empire of the sunDevil's Backbone style prison story with some horror moments. The big difference is that is based on true events which were really happening in Macedonia. Beautifully filmed on some breathtaking locations with many memorable scenes this small movie which deserves to make it big. As an extra ingredient there is a gravelydeep voiceover by Rade Serbedzija in the English version of the movie which is magnetically reminding us about the young Lem's survival in the camporphanage. Very surprised that a super group LEB I SOL did not contribute a soundtrack to this movie because one of their more memorable songs is a title of the movie. Nevertheless after Mancevski's success with Before the Rain there was a void in the Macedonia's film industry. Ivo Trajkov managed single handedly to erase all that with this perfect and truly memorable film.Andreja Kmetovic".

The novel upon which this film is based was written by Zhivko Chingo. Entitled  The Great Water  or  Golemata Voda  in Macdonian it is the story of Old Lem Meto Jovanovski recalling his early youth. Reminiscing his childhood as a boy played by Saso Kekenovski he recalls the shocking and abysmal conditions of his socialist's party school where he suffered indoctrination decreed by the Stalinist propaganda. Director Ivo Trajkov documents the children's gloomy dreary atmosphere amid the dark often torturous conditions of the Czeck government's state run orphanages. Deprived of faith hope and spirit Lem dreams of freedom are nonexistence until he meets Isak Keyten Maja Stankovska who's very appearance promises friendship. Under the watchful eyes of the Warden Mitko Apostolovski and his aid Komrade Olivera Verica Nedeska life is grim at best. Still Lem believes if he can win friendship in the eyes of Isak then hope lies in his future. The dark nearly impregnable prison presents itself as a bottomless pit where all dreams are forbidden. In this movie the author's worse nightmares are the currency by which children exchange their obedience for a day's existence. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Not many movies are made about WW2 that revolve around Russia's point of view although this movie doesn't really focus much on the war itsself than it does the casualties of war and collateral damage.Lem is an orphan who is captured by soldiers and put into an orphanage where he and many other orphans are being brainwashed to follow Communism. Being the new kid in the orphanage he's forced to learn all of the routines that all the other kids already know.After being there for some time a new kid arrives by the name of Isak Keyten.Now all of a sudden Lem doesn't feel so alone and tries his best to befriend the older boy.The only way he could eventually befriend the boy was to ask the Commander in charge of the orphanage what happened to Isak's girl friend who had been in the orphanage prior to Isak's arrival.This movie does a beautiful job of showing how innocence can be lost rather quickly when children are forced to grow up fast in a hostile environment.".

Like so many guys and girls picked from the different parts of Macedonia which was once one of the republics of the Yugoslavian Republic Lem is brought to an orphanage house which serves as an agent of regimentation. The Socialist regime needs ambitious and welltrained guys and girls who are expected to be dieheart patriots against the Nazist and Fascist threats. Poorly aware of the Socialist training and its consequences Kim starts to be exposed to the building blocks of socialism.His life starts to change once a mysterious boy steps into the wrecking camp. Kim's curiosity and penchant for being closer to this mysterious boy draw the two characters to chain of irreversible events. Based upon a very famous Macedonian novel the movie is excellent in the great performance shown by the actors and actresses. The director's way of introducing the story to the viewers is so good.There is only one thing missing in the movie.That's the choice of the music for the movie.I am convinced that the director could choose better music.".

	schema:reviewBody "It took me over 2 years to actually find this movie well they're two parts actually on tape and it was definitely worth it. I'd seen it on TV when travelling in Europe but remembered it only vaguely...all I knew was that it impressed me tremendously.OK so the first part Les annees lumieres focuses more on the privileged classes during the Revolution and how 1789 comes to be...LaFayette Mirabeau and so on. Most importantly we get acquainted with our three protagonists of sorts  Danton Robespierre and Desmoulins.The yummy parts are actually in the second part called Les Annees Terribles. Here Heffron masterfully focuses on the triumvirate of power centered around the main characters and how their ideologies distance them from one another. I don't want to get into too much detail but the dynamics especially between Danton and Robespierre are not only cinematically superb but also historically accurate. It should be noted that this isn't some boring historical costume soapopera...What makes this film especially the second part so memorable and vivid in my eyes are the performances. First German film legend KlausMaria Brandauer portrays Danton in a complex and yet very charming manner. He's masculine powerful but also tender. This multidimensional portrayal of Danton is something Gerard Depardieu lacked in Danton but I'll forgive him. Second Francois Cluzet does a great job with Camille Desmoulins. He just needs a hug. Lastly the best performance in the entire film came from the incomparable Andrzej Seweryn as Robespierre. It was a refreshing take on someone usually shown as a bloodthirsty asexual tyrant. Seweryn delicately balances Robespierre's almost naive yet uncompromising belief in virtue with his empty personal life. Here the man behind the Reign of Terror is just that a man. A man who is conflicted between personal ties and what he believes is best for the people. And when these three excellent performances are meshed together with a great script we get the best movie on the period ever. If you can find it definitely see it c'est le meilleur. Vive la revolution!UPDATE I'VE BEEN GETTING TONS OF EMAILS ON WHERE TO BUY THIS IN THE USA. THE ONLY PLACE IS 'VERSION FRANCAISE' BASED IN BETHESDA MD. Their website is www.francevision.com and they have it still only in VHS.Hope this helps!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this film both the English and French versions!  The detail was astounding and the film managed to tell this complicated story without dropping any threads.  JeanFrancois Balmer is touching as the hapless Louis XVI a wellmeaning but outoftouch ruler totally out of his depth in the political and social upheaval that was to destroy him. The three main revolutionaries Desmoulins Danton and Robespierre are shown as genuine human beings with emotional ties to each other but who start going their separate paths at a time when disagreement leads not to estrangement but to death.  The film is divided into 2 halves The Years of Light describing the political changes taking place in France as the revolution approaches and  The Years of Terror beginning with the arrest of the King and proceeding through the Terror through to the death of Robespierre.  The second half is better with more action and suspense as familiar characters become swept up in the destruction and insanity of a Revolution going out of control.  Andrej Seweryn is superb as the cool tyrant sending his enemies and their families to their bloody deaths while gently describing his view of the world as one governed by a spirit of goodness and virtue.  His sudden fall from power in the National Assembly is spellbinding and the movie roars to a conclusion as the first of the revolutionaries becomes the last victim of the guillotine.  The only jarring performance in this film is that of Peter Ustinov in the first half who tends to play himself rather than the great moderate Mirabeau.  The rest of the international cast is wonderful.".

I saw this film ten years ago in France and still cannot forget it. Since then I have been trying to purchase it for my classes and for my students and have been unsuccessful so far. They keep it like a big secret. I never understood why. Maybe because the revolution was shown in its true colors? Even in France this film is not shown very often hard to find and not known enough.

The September massacres the murder of pious princesse de Lamballe only because she used to be the queen's favorite and had returned to assist her queen  etc show the irrational violent gratuitous side of the revolution the expedite COMITE DE SALUT as handy political tool to get rid of political opponents.

I got into it so much that I wanted to learn more about other historical events at one point.The funny thing was we were forced to watch it french class when I was in grade 9 and I was the only one who really paid attention it seems. Not too many people were feeling the story I guess but again to have the tiniest interest in history is what's needed to get through this one.Yes it's super long but the acting is fantastic. It was filmed quite well and I gotta say has it's bloody points too! It's got some tame gory parts to it the guillotine and when people get gunned down etc etc. Overall a great movie that I think everyone should check out!".

	schema:reviewBody "I do have do admit I was never very interested in the French Revolution when I was in high school but only became intrigued with the topic in later life when becoming interested in contemporary politics. If I'd have to recommend a film or series that what make a viewer interested in what happened during the Revolution it would definitely be La revolution franchaise.As for the actors Brandauer does a superb job as he almost always does though is perhaps the least believable of the protagonists considering Dantons largerthanlife image. This Danton is a schemer a manipulator but less of a force of nature as Gerald Depardieu would portray him and more of an opportunistic snake. Francois Cluzet does a fine job as Desmoulins comes across as almost too blueeyed but the scenes are invariably stolen by Andrzej Seweryn as humanistcumfascist Robespierre who plays the character as humanely perceptive as I've ever seen in a film about the topic.Further credit must go to Balmer and Seymour as the doomed royal couple. Especially Balmer as King Louis XVI shows us a very accurate portrayal of a weak undecided monarch a yeasayer who merely drifts with the tide of time that will eventually sweep him under the guillotine. Sir Christopher Lee who has a very small part as executioner Henri Sanson a very interesting and multifaceted character in his own right responsible for the beheading of almost all major protagonists. Lee plays the character as a stern dutiful man who shown only through nuances and facial expression has yet retained his humanity basic compassion even a disdain for the latter wave of The Terror that kept him busy for month at end. Indeed one would almost have hoped for a spinoff which focuses entirely on the Monsieur de Paris. Another testament to one of the most brilliant actors of our times.The settings from the grandeur of Versailles to the filth of the Parisian streets are completely convincing even more so than recent films like for example The Perfume.One of the strongest aspects of the film despite being filmed for an anniversary of the revolution it doesn't glorify or portray the events and those involved in a heroic light. Quiet the opposite the protagonists are all shown to be either nave Desmoulins opportunistic Danton or generally yet very humanly flawed andor fanatic Robespierre Hebert SaintJust et al. The French mob is shown as what it was simply a mob and it comes as no big surprise that in many places the French word for people La Peuple has since become an insult directed at the unwashed majority easily lolled by demagogues carrying only to fill their bellies be it with bread or so it would seem more often with liquor driven mainly by the disdain for those whom they often quiet rightly conceive as something better than themselves.If anything the film is a reflection of more contemporary even current politics be it democracy where the Peuble is generally bought by the highest bidding politician communism with it's stubborn ideology or fascism where the loudest demagogue captures the hearts and minds of people if not to say poisons them.If I'd have to recommend any film or TVSeries on the French Revolution this would be the one. Coming in at almost six hours the four parts never seem long or boring. Quiet the opposite. At the end of the run one is almost saddened that one has to leave those fascinating times and people well granted of course that 90 percent of them have lost their heads by the time the credits play anyway.A deserved 8 from 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Divided into two parts this long film relates the events of the French Revolution a dramatic moment that we all know and one of the turning points in the history of mankind. Therefore as most people know the historical facts let's go to the film itself.Directed by Robert Enrico and Richard T. Heffron has Klaus Maria Brandauer Andrzej Seweryn JeanFranois Balmer and Jane Seymour in the lead roles respectively incorporating the revolutionary Georges Danton and Maximilian Robespierre and the illfated french kings Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The cast also includes other notable European players as it is an entirely European production.The most interesting thing about this film is the historical accuracy that all production tried to achieve not only in the account of events but also in terms of costumes and locations where it was shot. This allows the audience to fully understand the sequence of events and how each character lived them. Unlike other films which often took place on the barricades of Paris and glorified or not the revolution this film tries to be impartial and manages to show us a more idealistic and human side of those who initially planned and made the revolution and how they lost control of it due to its disunity and inability to cope with the speed and the derailing of events increasingly bloody. The film also tells us the attempts of the king to solve his country's problems and how he was hamstrung to address them without endangering himself in one way or another. The Balmer's Louis XVI is a genuinely good man who initially in part due to the circumstances collaborates with the revolution but the radicalization of events would dictate his downfall and death not so much by his mistakes but mainly because he has become politically inconvenient for the radical party.The more negative note is the soft version of the cruelest moments of the revolution a fact that makes this film unable to mirror its hardness. The socalled Terror is no more than a few massacres in prisons summary executions more suggested than visible and mobs in the streets with torches and spears. We didn't see the pillaging of Versailles the destruction of the earlier king's graves or the countryside revolts which rise up against the excesses of a revolution that made successive attacks against the Christian faith or any other religion followed by the french people. Maybe this decision of turn these scenes softer has its origins in the age restrictions to prevent the movie from being classified as adults only. Still this movie is an interesting document that allows us to revisit the French Revolution and even transmit historical knowledge not everyone likes history in a fun and interesting way.".

Cube's cousin works at Pinky's Record Store where he hides out on his pregnant girlfriend. Next door live drug dealers with a nasty pit bull. There is a subplot involving taxes and saving the property etc. Witless and predictable with uninspiring directing by Steve Carr. Ice Cube plays the humourless lead which works against the mood of the film. It is as if Cube arrived on the wrong set. Mike Epps plays Cube's best friend who is a complete idiot. John Witherspoon plays Cube's less than friendly father. Perhaps the worst element is an embarrassing appearance by Lister who breaks out of prison and seeks revenge on Cube. Perhaps he should seek out the producers of this film. Tamala Jones plays Epps's pregnant exgirlfriend although being part of this film gives her something else to be angry about. The conclusion presents theft and drugs as fun as oppose to the endless trouble brought to those who dabbled in it. Nothing of value in this film that prides itself on being stupid.

This time Craig moves out of the ghetto and into the suburbs mainly because his dad fears that Deebo will come after Craig. Deebo has escaped from jail and he is out to find Craig. Craig's father sends him to live with his uncle and cousin DayDay. That basically sums up the story line. What made this film so funny is the three Jokers and facial expressions. This movie has lots of funny jokes and clever lines. Mike Epps' character DayDay is probably the most unique character in the film next to Joker. I loved the screenplay for this film mainly because it had clever lines and funny jokes. Next Friday also has some pretty good acting which in general make the movie even funnier. This I think is Mike Epps' first film and I have to say that he did a damn good job for a first film. Like I said earlier in this review most of the comedy comes from facial expressions and clever jokes. I would have to say that the funniest facial expression in this film was when Mike Epps' character is first introduced. The character Joker is the funniest part of the film. Every time a joke comes out of his mouth or any word for that matter will make you laugh. When I first heard of this film I really anticipated that it was pure crap but then I saw it on TV and I was proved wrong. This movie kicks ass. 10 out of 10.".

In Next Friday you guessed it it's a week later and Craig is going to live with his uncle and cousin over in the Suburbs.  The abscence of Smokey is explained when Craig makes mention that Smokey got sent off to rehab.  So much for Smokey.  Anyway in his place we get Craig's idiot cousin DayDay and his even dumber uncle Elroy.  That's it.  Although DayDay is dumb as a rock and annoying as hell his Uncle Elroy is occasionally funny.Throughout Next Friday's measily hour and a half it still ran too long I laughed a grand total of ONE time.  This was because of Pinky.  I'm serious had this guy been in the movie more than just five minutes it probably would have gone down better.  His scenes had me on the floor. I'm sure that this movie may please its target audience but there's no way that anyone could like it as much as the first.  If I were Mexican I would be offended at the crude racial stereotypes and that whole minime scene was probably the single most STUPID moment in cinematic history.  Anyone who laughed at that is in desperate need of a laugh.  One more thing if you haven't seen this yet please don't.  Just rent the first one again.  Please. That's all I'm gonna say.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off you have to realize that without Chris Tucker it's not going to be the same movie.  I think that's what the filmmakers realized also and therefore they took the movie in a completely different direction than the first.  That being said they did a pretty good job.Dayday is no Smokey but they don't make him out to be Smokey.  I do have to say that the Joker brothers make this movie.  I was rolling every scene they were in.  Next time more Joker brothers.My only knock on the movie was that they repeated a lot of jokes from the first movie.  Hey I saw the first one and it was funny  but you don't have to cram the exact same lines down my throat.  It kind of cheapened the movie.  All in all I would say it's very funny if you don't go in expecting the same movie as the first.".
