	schema:reviewBody "The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after the completion of this film only adds to the poignancy of dierector BAbenco's powerful message. The film is split into two halves  the first in a reformatory where a group of youngsters are abused and violated by the violent law enforcers and guardians. The second backdrop is the city where they are confined instead by their own actions and morality which includes mugging pimping and killing different characters who enter their lives.The differing gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people. Particularly interesting is teh character of Lalica a transvestite who is mother and lover to some of the children. Her reaction to the arrival of Sueli a prostitute is both poignant and tragic. There is no happy ending to this story and i reccomend to watch it with caution as there are some very uncomfortable scenes to watch especially in teh opening twenty minutes. But whilst watching it it is important to remember that this is not just a fictional tale. The actors are not trained professionals but instead boys selected from the streetsof Sao Paulo. They actually lived this life that is portrayed so vividly on screen and in da Silva's case died at the hands of the police who are depicted so brutally. A documentary? A piece of fiction. It borders on both but it certainly makes for heart wrenching material and is a film that actually leaves you breathless and thinking long after having watched it.1010".

It is particulary effective when it develops other characters as they are seen by Pixote especially those of the streetwise transvestite homosexual Lilica and the aging alcoholic prostitute Sueli unforgettably portrayed by Marilia Pera one of the few pro actors in the cast who become surrogate parents to the young boy in a kind of improvised family whose economy is based on mugging Sueli's clients.  Both the tragic denoument which comes at the end of a film in which tragedy follows tragedy ad infinitum and the final shot of Pixote playing alone on the railroad tracks with haunting accompanying music on the soundtrack are unbearably poignant.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Pixote over 20 years ago and the thing that I always think about the movie is how when I was first watching it my friend who was also watching it nudged me and whispered His face...look at his face referring to Fernando Ramos De Silva.  His face is growing harder and older and angry...how do you ACT that?  It's true watch the movie and you'll notice that the face of Pixote becomes visibly more and more changed over time due to the life that he lives.  The seesaw of the adult means of which he's forced by circumstance to live his life and the reality of being a boy a little boy alone looking not only to survive but to gain at least a small semblance of childhood that is pretty much a lost cause.  I think the most heartrending scene is when he nurses at the breast of the prostitute  not for sex but because of his need to have a mother to be only a baby nursing at his mother's breast.  You see that and you also see that the prostitute recognizes his suckling for what it is and for a moment she accepts this and encourages this until she remembers who she is and that she is not about to undertake raising a child.  She then stops his nursing and sends him away.And that's just one moment out of so many in this movie.  This is a film that without being in the least exploitive nonetheless throws doors open wide to let the viewer see exactly what exists on the streets of Brazil reminding us that if it exists there the chances are pretty good that the same sort of thing exists elsewhere.  It doesn't show us anything but the truth.  There's no need for embellishment  the actuality is sobering enough.  It's a hard movie to watch.  I haven't watched it since I've had children of my own  truthfully I've been kind of afraid to.  I will again though.  This movie is too too good to see only once even if once is all you think that you can stand.".

The film is in part a social issue film where the way the children are treated by the system is condemned and in part a story about a young lad who grows old far too soon. The social issue although maybe broadly relevant is hardly au courant some three decades after the film was made however I didn't feel like this detracted much from the film due to the excellent characterisations and strong story line. It's also not limited by the generics of the prison movie as a lot of the action takes place outside the prison walls.The main character an extremely small boy Pixote pronounced Pichote is especially winsome and actually played by a real life delinquent who was subsequently shot by police in a shootout. He has developed a firmness of independent judgement and level of character that you generally only find in people well into adulthood something that he's had to do to survive. It's painfully clear at some points though that he is just a skinny little boy that needs his mother.There is charisma to spare in the acting performances including a youngster who does an extremely catchy homage to Roberto Carlos the great Brazilian singer as opposed to football player for the prison gig and appears destined for stardom if he can stay alive.The kids are in peril because the police are beating them to death in order to find out who killed the judge whilst the incompetent prison authorities turn a blind eye and fall into a state of apathy concerning the wellbeing of their wards see no evil hear no evil speak no evil.Babenco appears fascinated by prison culture and in both this film and his return to the genre with Carandiru 2003 he uses nakedness to remind us of the fundamental vulnerability of the human captives in his film. In the poster for Carandiru you can see the survivors of a prison riot lying naked in a yard stripped of their clothes in which they could conceal weapons in Pixote a hole packed with naked children. Beaten unclothed and helpless it's quite easy to connect with the camouflage of swagger and defiance that they need to survive is taken away. Fundamentally a human is a fragile creature that hurts and most of their persona is just a coping strategy.There's a dreamlike feel to a lot of the film which is often brazenly erotic the transvestite Lilica dancing in front of a crowd whilst having her under carriage rubbed by an onlooker's raised foot and anarchical. It's not easy to label the film as nightmarish because some of the experiences even when negative are extremely rich and the friendships heartfelt.A classic faux pas of many nonAnglo movies is that whenever whites appear they are cardboard cutouts but here the old American john is as wellrealised and succinctly characterised as he could be.Favourite scenes of mine include the postgluesniffing fascination of Pixote and the halflit dormitory riot which is truly mad.".

	schema:reviewBody "Is it enough that a film seem real?That's the pitch here and in so many films. This one even starts with the filmmaker speaking to us before the film proper telling us about the horrible situation and literally showing us the lead child actor in his regular life of squalor. We know also from the publicity that the other children are real though presumably all of the adults are actors. This film is set up to impress on this score. The situations are brutal and fully believable. The kids are effective. The scenes seem genuine.But its just bad film bad drama bad storytelling except for two bits  unless you count the value of realism. That's because it has no narrative structure. Yes we see the child harden and why but is that enough? Not for me. It takes more than the real to make a story I think.I will recommend two scenes to you. They both feature Marlia Pra who we saw as effective in Central Station. She plays a prostitute who enlists the children to mug her johns. One scene has her after a successful heist in the woods with the children seducing the oldest who we know is in a relationship with one of the boys. This scene works amazingly well lighted by the headlights of the stolen car animated by her dancing body.

A life of sexual twisting is visited on that contact and she breaks. The camera decides to show the boy now lost in the last scene that follows. But it is the woman whose loss we know.These two scenes demonstrate how much greater reality a talented actress can give us more surely than the real thing.See it for those two scenes.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

	onyx:emotionText "Is it enough that a film seem real?That's the pitch here and in so many films. This one even starts with the filmmaker speaking to us before the film proper telling us about the horrible situation and literally showing us the lead child actor in his regular life of squalor. We know also from the publicity that the other children are real though presumably all of the adults are actors. This film is set up to impress on this score. The situations are brutal and fully believable. The kids are effective. The scenes seem genuine.But its just bad film bad drama bad storytelling except for two bits  unless you count the value of realism. That's because it has no narrative structure. Yes we see the child harden and why but is that enough? Not for me. It takes more than the real to make a story I think.I will recommend two scenes to you. They both feature Marlia Pra who we saw as effective in Central Station. She plays a prostitute who enlists the children to mug her johns. One scene has her after a successful heist in the woods with the children seducing the oldest who we know is in a relationship with one of the boys. This scene works amazingly well lighted by the headlights of the stolen car animated by her dancing body. The words tell us that she was a sexy gogo dancer who was fired but the motions tell us that and so much more.

This contemporary topic has been deftly handled by famous Brazilian director Hector Babenco in his film Pixote the law of the weakest which is brutal yet an honest film about the vicious circle of violence whose victims happen to be children who have all been rejected by their families. Holding family members responsible for the plight of their children Hector Babenco shows how poor children are forced to choose a criminal career path as they have been abandoned by their family members. Although Pixote was made in 1981 it has not aged a bit due to its status as a work of reference documenting the plight of homeless Brazilian children. Some scenes and situations might shock sensitive viewers but Pixote doesn't fail to deliver home the message that life is stranger and harsher than filmed images as this film's protagonist Fernando Ramos da Silva was killed in 1987.

The performances Babenco gets from his nonprofessional cast are amazing especially his tiny young lead. The film almost totally avoids the twin traps of false sentimentality although it's got plenty of emotion or needless flashiness. It occasionally feels aimless but somehow in the end it always adds up. Probably the weakest most problematic moment is the opening where the 'director' Babenco or an actor? tells us that these actors are real people gives us some facts and figures about them and tells that their lives are much like those shown in the film. It then took me the next few minutes to forget about that and get involved with the characters and not get all caught up in pondering the artistic complexities of 'real people' playing a dramatic variation on their lives. The film doesn't need that kind of blunt framing device.So perhaps I don't consider this terrific important film a 'perfect' masterpiece as so many do  but I deeply admire it and respect it would encourage everyone to see it though you doubtless find the experience upsetting and look forward to seeing it a third time. You will never be able to look at a poor kid on the street quite the same way again.".

On the other hand Roy Glenn Sidney Poitier's father objects to his son marrying a white girl. Sidney Poitier stops him by saying Dad you see yourself as a colored man I see myself as a man Was it as didactic as it sounds in 1967? Who cares?

	schema:headline " Liberal Angst over Interractial Relationship in the 1960s";
	schema:reviewBody "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner takes place during the course of one day as two families struggle to overcome their concerns about the interracial marriage of their children. This film is a treat for the eyes with lovely sets and beautiful people. It also has a nice 1960's feel that is reinforced by sophisticated wardrobing and an easy listening soundtrackfeaturing The Glory of Love as the signature tune. The film relies very heavily on the use of dialog and reflects the elegance of a time when people were entertained by stimulating conversation. The San Francisco backdrop also is the perfect setting for a movie that challenged racial convention.But there are a few serious flaws. This is an introductory role for Katharine Houghton Hepburn's niece who plays Sidney Portier's fiancJohanna Drayton. Her inexperience is apparent particularly in comparison to heavyweights Portier Tracy and Hepburn and as a result she is unconvincing in the part. Moreover her character is not wellwritten or welldeveloped which makes it difficult to understand why Sidney Portier's characterJohn Prenticewould fall in love with a woman who appears to have so little to offer intellectually given his significant professional achievements as a doctor. One also must ask why it was necessary for his character to be cast as a doctor in order to be seen as an acceptable partner for a young white woman who had not really accomplished anything accept being born into a privileged family. The answer is simple. Making Prentice a doctorand not just any doctorbut a world renowned expert in tropical medicine made the interracial relationship more acceptable to white audiences during the 1960s.The other cast members are outstanding and the onscreen chemistry phenomenal. Katharine Hepburn Christina Drayton and Spencer Tracy Newspaper Publisher Matt Drayton deliver brilliant performances as Johanna's parents. John Prentice's modest working class parents are played with great dignity by Beah Richards and Roy E. Glen. Mrs. Prentice and Mrs. Drayton favor the marriage and both characters provide passionate articulate arguments as to why their husbands should agree. But their husbands voice serious objections and the families spend the evening in intense discussions over the issue accurately reflecting the racial fears that existed 40 years ago. Prentice's father reminds him that in many states interracial marriage is illegal and that he is getting out of line. There are also a number of very memorable and funny lines. In the scene in which Matt Drayton wonders why the colored kids dance better than the white kids Portier's response is classicyou dance the Watusi but we are the Watusi!For readers under 40 the Watusi was a popular dance in the 1960s and also an African tribe. Cecil Kelloway who plays friend of the family Monsignor Ryan deftly brings a sense of humor and moral guidance that is effective because it is not preachy. He challenges Matt Drayton's liberal credentials and suggests that Drayton's misgivings about his daughter marrying a black man reveal his hypocrisy. Isabel Sanford Weezy from The Jeffersons TV program plays the feisty maid of the Draytons.It's been said that in the final scene Tracywho was very ill at the time and who died shortly after the movie was completeddelivered one of the longest soliloquies in American film history in only one take. Katherine Helpurn was clearly so moved by the scene that it's hard to believe that she is just acting as her eyes brim with tears.Although the some of the sentiments are dated this film is highly entertaining and provides a rare opportunity to experience outstanding performances from six gifted actors who bring compassion and depth to Stanley Kramer's film. Its' angst relative to interracial marriage also reminds us of how far we have not come.".

It remains relevant today even if not to the same degree. And even though I'm almost thirty years old I can say with mixed emotions of embarrassment and vindication that Spencer Tracy taught me a better way to tie a tie. Who's says movies don't teach you anything?The film is dated to be sure by many things from clothing to music cars and expressions. At times the dialogue seemed a bit hokey and others simply brilliant. I swear I half expected an entourage of gogo dancers to spontaneously burst through the streets of San Francisco. And if I never hear the Story Of Love ever again in my life it would be too soon.But I can't help but think that the more things change in thirty years sometimes they remain the same. Certainly there's more examples of interracial couples today than thirty years ago and therefore a greater degree of tolerance but for a lot of narrowminded individuals it's still as controversial or appalling as it was thirty years ago.Some of the lines actually had me laughing out loud enjoying the moment as it follows into another well complimented scene. I'm speaking in particular of the scene where Katharine Hepburn fires her employee for her prejudicial views and basically everything that follows that scene for the next five minutes.I try my best to imagine what it would be like to be in the shoes of any character in the film to appreciate what it might've been like for them in that time and while I think I can muster an inkling I don't think my creativity is up to a challenge of that nature.

The film is wonderful because it was the last film made by one of Hollywood's greatest duos Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.This film was made while Spencer Tracy was dying.  Spencer had to put his entire salary in escrow in order for the film company to allow him to do the film.So why did Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy agree to do this film without immediate payment? Because it's a film about forbidden love it's a film about loving someone no matter what society thinks or what the rules are. This is something Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn knew a great deal about.What makes this film outstanding is by the end of the film you realize Kate and Spencer are not even acting they are relaying their feelings about each other through the film. Once you catch that the drama of the final few scenes is just unparalleled and Spencer's final speech about his love for Kate Christina can drive even the most twisted soul to tears.A few things to catch in this film watch Kate's face when Spencer recites the line 'screw what the rest of the world thinks about your love'...those are real tears. Watch Spencer Tracey as he paces back and forth on the terrace near the end of the film. He realizes he is about to begin one of the last scenes he will ever film. He's line 'well I'll be a son of a bitch'...is more a realization he's about to make his last grandstand on the big screen in his entire career.Spencer Tracy is one of America's greatest actors.

Most people who review the film I assume are liberals so I guess I offer a different perspective. For me this is a sad film. It is sad because the vision of America that the liberals Tracy and Hepburn's characters have here just did not pan out. The moment when Poitier's character says you see yourself as a colored man but I see myself as a man shows just what sort of society these people imagined we would have and it's tragic that history did not turn out that way. From the vantage point of 2017 race relations are worse than ever before. With SJWs Affirmative Action crime in the inner cities antiwhite racism immigration problems etc the vision that race would no longer matter just simply did not pan out. As whites today this film can only make us sad. It's tragic. I almost wish things did turn out that way that race in America could have become a nonfactor and that none of the crazy problems we face today exist but they do. And so viewing this film in retrospect it seems so innocent and naive in a tragic way. Beautifully filmed with a San Francisco location and a lovely soundtrack this is by all means a tremendous film and I probably like it a little more than snotty liberals who probably can find this or that reason to view this film which to me seems progressive as reactionary.".

I think this movie is excellent I enjoyed the performances of all the actors and the message is important. Racial prejudice was common in 1967 and the very first interracial kiss on TV was still to come it happened in 1969 on Star Trek. People needed to hear the message this movie contains that color and race are not something that should prevent two people who love each other from marrying. I am a white American married to a Japanese female and I am proud that our children will grow up to live in a world where people have tolerance for different cultures and beliefs. It is sad to watch Spencer Tracy in this movie knowing he died weeks after it was made. But it was nice that he could act with Katherine Hepburn the love of his life so close to his death. That must have made him happy.".

	schema:headline " A stacked deck with a FABULOUS view";
	schema:reviewBody "Hmmm. I'm torn about this movie but I guess overall I find it too out of balance to work as other than as an historical piece.The things I like about it? The soundstage version of an outrageous San Francisco home. A bridge to bridge view from the patio which is not to be confused with the separate garden. Filled with expensive art. If such a place existed what would it cost today? 10 million? 15 million  but when the parents go out for ice cream they drive what would be a sort of old looking small to midsized car. Ah Hollywood! Seeing Isobel Sanford in something that doesn't involve Sherman Helmsley. Katharine Hepburn going through four slightlyoddball costumes over about 9 hours of movie time. And what is with her and her choice of hats?!? The bizarro offkilter scene with the dancing delivery boy.The things I don't like? Well first and foremost the fact that this movie is set up so as to eliminate any sense of the REAL complexities of life. Poitier's character is not just a great guy he is a physician. Wait no ... not just a physician but one who has been on the faculty of some of the best medical schools...AND who has devoted his career to public health AND who is internationally wellknown. Gosh you think is there ANY white man that Joanna might ever meet who could be as wellcredentialled as him? And Joanna we are told has always been HAPPY!!! as a baby as a child as a teen in college. Why she's just the most perfect thing. Her parents? Unabashed liberals. Generous and kind to the help even giving a 5000 bonus to an employee being fired. His parents? Sober and hardworking. Sacrificing for their son. Kind and loving.Wouldn't it be nice to see at least one of the parents being SOMEWHAT unpleasant? Kramer just sets things up in a way where there is no real tension in the movie. We know Tracy and Hepburn's characters are too good to turn into bigots and that they are such great parents that their daughter's happiness is all that will matter. They may be friends with a Catholic monseigneur though a point is made to say at least twice that they aren't Roman Catholics what's that about? but he is the most liberal happygolucky priest that existed in the 1960's and raises not a single objection to interracial marriage uncharacteristic of the Irish priests I knew of from the 60s  but maybe it's because he's so busy drinking Scotch  if you'll excuse THAT offensive Irish stereotype in a movie about prejudice.The look and feel of the movie is a little odd because of the juxtaposition of real locations SFO the ice cream store with the very faux stage set style used in scenes like the driveway in front of the house. For a movie that is supposed to be exploring the gritty reality of racism in America seeing someone drive a phony delivery truck past the fake plants outside the fake house seems particularly jarring and inappropriate.And of course everyone is rich or welltodo. Even the retired postal worker and his wife can afford to fly up to SF on a last minute airfare which were even less cheap back in the 1960s than they are today and we are assured can afford to fly to Geneva for the wedding? So ultimately their problems about love and marriage seem less important because we don't really worry that John or Joanna's lives will be seriously crippled if they don't marry  they are both so VERY charming successful selfdirected and fulfilled that we know that they would find someone else if it came to that.For that matter no one seems too bothered by the more substantial problem which is that people who fall in love in 20 minutes and plan to marry only weeks after meeting are quite likely to find themselves unhappily stuck with a person they knew nothing about  regardless of their color.And poor Sydney Poitier who I think was probably a good actor but seemed to have to sacrifice his talent on the cross of being the first great crossover black movie actor  always playing someone who is whiter than the white folks around him usually better spoken always smarter always having to deliver the overwritten didactic speech about how times are changing for the black man and never allowed to use a contraction in a sentence lest he sound too ethnic. I find his acting to be terribly mannered most of the time but I think that is mostly because of the straightjacket forced on him by the types of roles he played in the 1960s.So the movie just feels very manufactured  structured so that every point of view or objection will be raised but rationally batted aside and that  less than 12 hours after they show up the couple will head off to Switzerland with a family united behind them and the audience can all leave the theater feeling that love conquers all and dealing with racism is just a matter of having a good conversation over drinks.".

The thing is most people forget  had Poitier been just a regular guy who had a less than stellar job and been less than beautiful this story would have ended up in the recycling bin. Just as gay people or Hispanics today in order to create positive stories about themselves have to idealize their characters to a godlike level the same thing had to be done back then. And it was also appropriate to have not one but two confrontation scenes one with Poitier and Roy Glenn  father and son  and one with Beah Richards and Spencer more subtle but equally poignant. GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER is a film that resonated back then despite its deadline plot and tidy ending because it came at the right time and needed a positive resolution. I doubt audiences back then would respond to any other. Although it would not shock me if people then would be thinking Hollywood had finally lost its edge with this one. It was a keen decision to have Kate and Spencer be the leads because in doing so they were assuring not only boxoffice draw  people would be returning to watch their favorite unmarried couple bicker lovingly yet again  but a strong statement. After all these two have the biggest subtext in the entire film they had had their own iconoclastic relationship it was coming to a close and one only had to see Kate's expression just to a side of Spence's shoulder as he gave his closing speech. She was sitting at the right of the screen her eyes glistening with tears feeling the time was close knowing just how much they loved each other even to the end. On this element only  the final lingering shot of Kate and Spence embracing each other getting ready for dinner and an uneasy future GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER is perfect.".

It remembered me when I had to make that first visit at a girlfriends house meet the parents be friendly to some completely unknown people act as an adult as a man when there are four parents around... And there are scenes with a flip I will never forget like Spencer Tracy eating his ice cream and changing his mind over it Hilary being fired or the two fathers settling about the situation as 'the only reasonable people in the boat'.The film also started me to think over how I would react as a parent in such a situation. Today marriage between races is not that shocking but I can easily imagine for my future daughter someone who would shock me with his proposal. It easy to see others on screen struggling to break down their own walls and prejudices but in real life it is so much harder. It is so true what Mahatma Ghandi said  'You must be the change you wish to see in the world'.It's just a funny twist from life that I've seen 'Kinsey' a few days ago where Katharine Houghton also appears as Mrs. Spaulding almost 40 years later 2005.This movie became one of my favorites  1010.".

	schema:headline " Explores interracial marriage and hidden prejudice but a ridiculous scenario";
	schema:reviewBody "This landmark classic of the 1960's Civil Rights era brought to light the controversial issue of interracial marriage. Its ongoing relevance lies in viewers examining their own hidden prejudices and considering their personal response to an offspring bringing home a fianc of a different race. While I applaud the theme it's not at all effectively presented in this absurd situation.The story revolves around a liberal upper middle class white couple Matt Drayton a newspaper publisher and Christina Drayton who owns an art gallery. Their assumed anti racist attitudes are put to the test when their daughter Joanna brings home a widowed black doctor John Prentice and introduces him as her fianc. She has met him during a 10 day trip to Hawaii and they must jet off that very night to Geneva as he has a post with the World Health Organization in Switzerland. Joanna seeks the blessing of both sets of parents so John's working class parents from Los Angeles are also invited to dinner. They are no more pleased than the Draytons that their son has chosen a white fiance the prejudices operating both ways here. Thus the memorable dinner party is set up...The Drayton parents are played by those beloved stars Spencer Tracey and Katharine Hepburn. Personally I feel the movie is totally over rated due to a sense of nostalgia for this pair. The film addresses the whole issue of hidden prejudices in those who pride themselves as anti racist. The Drayton couple who have an AfricanAmerican maid are nevertheless very open minded for their day. Christina has even fired an employee because of her prejudiced views. Hepburn is cast in her typical independent feminist feisty role as the proudly liberal Mrs. Drayton whom I personally found irritating with her superior airs.Personally I much preferred the ordinary working class Prentice parents to the affluent fashionably liberal and agnostic Draytons. I think 1960's audiences would have related better to a more typical white suburban couple from middle America than to this rather atypical pair. How many mothers of that era operated an avant guard art gallery? It might actually have imparted greater depth to the story if these parents had been trying to reconcile their formerly buried but now surfacing prejudices with the tenants of their faith. A Catholic priest family friend does give his opinions on the nuptials but he's a goofy rather than wise or inspiring character. By the way is there some implication here that the agnostics of that era were a more enlightened lot than all the religious church attending Christians?As for myself the movie is most notable for the on screen presence of the handsome Sidney Poitier. This is probably his most memorable role as the polite respectable well educated fianc doctor who has risen above his blue collar roots. The annoying daughter played by Katharine Houghton doesn't seem to have much of a role. Even though it's all mainly about the parents her character could surely have had a little more depth. Skin color notwithstanding I could hardly picture the perky clueless dewy eyed Joanna and her serious intelligent older late 30's and infinitely more mature fianc having much in common now that they've left their tropical Hawaiian paradise and are back in the real world.My major problem with the film is the hokey unrealistic drama of it all. The couple must leave for Geneva that very night for their imminent marriage. No time to get accustomed to the fianc or make plans all very dramatic. But especially the whirlwind...and I do mean whirlwind... ten day courtship. These 'intellectual' parents aren't exhibiting much intelligence in their priorities here. I cannot imagine any parents now or even back then more upset with the color of the fianc's skin supposing it was purple than with the fact that their daughter had known him for such an incredibly short period of time...distinguished Yale educated doctor or not. Balmy tropical nights swaying palm trees and tall cool drinks rather than getting acquainted with each other in daily routine life. It's unbelievable absurd and outrageous removing all credibility from the film. This movie proved dull and disappointing the scenario totally ridiculous. However its theme is certainly thought provoking causing a personal examination of conscience in the viewer. Even though interracial marriage is common and quite acceptable in many not all circles today this is a definitive though woefully flawed piece of cinema that put the title phrase in everyone's vocabulary.".

Set in the 1960s this was definitely topical. We are treated to first class acting from Sidney Poitier who is arguable one of the greatest and most dignified actors to grace the screen. Great performances from Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn who play shocked and concerned parents. This film also focused on the important issue of walking the talk righteous people who preach certain ways of living but we see it put to the test when they themselves are in that situation. The parents who raised a unbiased and open minded daughter must deal with her choices. Spencer Tracey's speech to his daughter and Sidney is one of the best in film. He passes on an important message of understanding and righteousness to not just his daughter and son in law to be but the rest of America watching. A showcase of brilliant acting and messages in a film that was ahead of its time.".

I like 'time capsule' films of the period so I gave it a try.The scenery and settings are enjoyable the soundtrack typical of the period. The acting of Spencer Tracy and Sidney Poitier was very good. So were his parents and Katherine Hepburn. The portrayal of the daughter was somewhat stereotypical of a liberal earlymid 1960s upper class bay area girl.Tillie future 'Weezie' of 'The Jeffersons' gave a great performance both as an individual but also as a member of any group who sees one of their peers move beyond what they were told they were allowed as well as a genuine protectiveness toward 'Joey'.The most disturbing question of the film was briefly addressed by Spency Tracy's character  why present this as an all or nothing ultimatum that has to be settled in a day? The answer was given as 'we love each other why wait?'. But if he really loved her he would have given both sets of parents a little time to absorb something so important. This would be true even if they were the same race. Why force someone to accept or reject someone for life within the first hour of meeting them? I suppose it had to be done this way for the dramatic effect.By glossing over this very important question the rest of the film become an axe grinding message for me. If you are for them right now you're good if you question it you're a 'bigot'. Real life isn't that simple. Were they planning to 'play chicken' with everyone for the rest of their lives after they got married? How would that affect their children vs choosing the timing of their battles a little more carefully? What a terrible message to send to anyone choosing that path in 1967.It was also disturbing to see someone who's presented as so perfect Poitier display such ingratitude disrespect and rejection of his own father in such a self righteous manner without any apparent judgment of Poitier from the filmmaker.There's not much to say about Tracy's closing it was easy to see coming a mile away and a relief to get it over with.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most appealing aspect of this film is its overt shameless portrayal of an issue that was completely and utterly taboo at the time of its release...interracial marriage however the film itself is only moderately entertaining.Spencer Tracy's performance was very good especially when considering the complexities of his character a liberal journalist who finds himself resenting the fact that his own daughter plans to marry someone of another race and there were a few other notable performances I especially liked Monsignor Ryan played by Cecil Kellaway. The writing was one of the stronger aspects of the film as well mostly because of the utter straightforwardness about a topic that would make many Americans in 1967 cringe. By showing on screen the shock that each family member received when initially aware of the marriage allowed for an equally shocking effect on the audience and the reactions seen on screen were probably similar to those of many Americans at the time and unfortunately today as well.By having the Prentice family over for dinner at the end the families are forced to look beyond whatever prejudices they might have and interact with people that are virtually foreign to them. In this sense the movie carries a great message with it...and this message is still very applicable to today's society.The biggest problem with this film was the believability of the issue. Due to Katharine Houghton's Joey's bubbly overacted performance it was impossible for me to believe that these two were actually as deeply in love as they said especially when you consider the fact that they have only known each other for 2 weeks. In addition I thought the forced nature of the necessity for approval from the parents was completely unrealistic. In essence some of the major plot points and details are flawed keeping a movie that could have been great just soso. Nonetheless it is worth watching at least once especially if historic context of the film is considered.".

In this sense the movie carries a great message with it...and this message is still very applicable to today's society.The biggest problem with this film was the believability of the issue. Due to Katharine Houghton's Joey's bubbly overacted performance it was impossible for me to believe that these two were actually as deeply in love as they said especially when you consider the fact that they have only known each other for 2 weeks. In addition I thought the forced nature of the necessity for approval from the parents was completely unrealistic. In essence some of the major plot points and details are flawed keeping a movie that could have been great just soso. Nonetheless it is worth watching at least once especially if historic context of the film is considered.";

	schema:reviewBody "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is the 1967 Sidney Poitier film about interracial marriage that made the AFI Top 100 list. So why the mediocre rating by this reviewer and many others? I mean we have the great Sidney Poitier as well as Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. We have the decent director Stanley Kramer who did On the Beach we have the great era of the 1960s and we have a controversial theme. Well the key to the mediocrity lies in a very weak script by William Rose that doesn't ring true in many ways.John Prentice Poitier wants to marry Joey Drayton Katharine Houghton and all hell breaks loose between the parents Tracy Hepburn Beah Richards and Roy Glenn. Problem is the script tries to be politically correct while ignoring any semblance of reality or nonnerdness to coin a word.For example a 2faced employee wishes the couple well with whispering asides to Hepburn in a WAY over the top cartoonish manner for both the well wishes and the asides. Joey says Mom she was well RUDE! actually she wasn't rude at all she was 2faced...big difference lost on the writer. And to get the lady out of their collective hair Hepburn gives her 5000.00. Not much of a punishment for being 2faced.Then we get this wacky priest who drinks sings We can Work it Out in the most pretentiously hip unhip touch of the film and thinks its funny that Mr. Liberal Tracy has such a problem with the marriage. As far as Poitier's speech to his father You think of yourself as a black man I think of myself as a man I have this to say I'm sure men have thought that but I doubt they ever said it i.e. it came out of the writer not out of reality. And I have no idea why they left that scene in where Tracy rams a black guy's car and the guy yells There oughta be a law! It didn't make sense it didn't fit into the film and I suppose it was just an illconcieved joke by the writer.And Tracy's speech at the end is supposed to be so touching and it reduces Hepburn to tears...but really it's big on schmaltz and low on substance. This film is TV movie quality and made it into the AFI Top 100 hey AFI ever hear of this other Poitier film from 1967...a little film called In the Heat of the Night? Such is my BIG GRIPE. How does this film make it while one of the best films of the decade doesn't? Answer Politics. This one was about subtle middle class racism that one was about blatant Southern racism. Well all I can say is see both films and YOU decide.".

For example this movie was nominated for an astounding 10 oscars!  Ten oscar nominations for a movie with all the style and artistry of a tv sitcom!Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is an impossibly sugarcoated pitch for racial tolerance and interracial relationships.  Nothing wrong with its intentions but the script is so terribly selfcongratulatory in its liberal piousness and everything just gets tied up in such a nice neat totally unreal way.  The film's characters all seem to live in a selfcontained and sheltered environment that the real world comes nowhere near.  Then to advance their cause the filmmakers all but put Sidney Poitier in a red cape with a big S on his chest!  He is so incredibly handsome and noble and pure that Strom Thurmond wouldn't object to him as a soninlaw let alone those bastions of liberality Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn!  Pure malarkey...I also have to say that Katharine Hepburn's oscar has to be one of the least deserved in the Academy's history.  She is her usual self here but its such a nothing role!  All of the other actresses nominated in 1967  Audrey Hepburn Dame Edith Evans Faye Dunaway in Bonnie and Clyde and Anne Bancroft in The Graduate  were each far more deserving of the honor. Don't get me wrong I like Kate  but she was much more deserving of the honor in 1962's Long Day's Journey into Night and 1968's The Lion in Winter.".

All we get is what a Hollywood hackwriter considers to be meaningful dialog. We're embarrassed for both Tracy and Hepburn in this being their final movie. No wonder Hepburn cries real tears in the last scene having to witness the horriblydogmatic speech Tracy is forced to spew...after he had delivered so much fresh and timeless dialog in his professional life to be reduced to recite so many hackneyed phrases in one sitting must have been torture for Hepburn to witness as his final act. Judgement at Nurmburg it ain't. We're also embarrassed for Poitier following his raw and realistic work in such great movies as Blackboard Jungle In the Heat of the Night and A Patch of Blue this part must have been a disappointment to a great actor. Unlike some other reviewers here I like most of Poitier's early work he's usually portrayal of a successful black man who has more redeeming qualities than most of the whities he encounters and most audiences cheer his various portrayals as both believable and sympathetic. But to here portray a powerful and brilliant guy who's asked a girl of a different race to marry him and then promise to her dad to abandon his commitment if her folks object just breaks his character down to nothing. The maid's part borders on junk as well not just because her dialog is shallow but we also have to witness Tracy deliver the dishonest line that she's a member of this family when neither the daughter or her folks do or say anything that convinces us that she's considered much more than a servant. Scenes with the Catholic Priest are quite hard to buy as he offers nothing from the Christian perspective to a situation that will require commitment far greater than mere conjugal love. Many people who don't like part of this movie fault Katherine Houghton's performance for being false and airheaded. Her character is just emblematic of what's wrong with the whole picture.".

	schema:headline " When he died he would not end. The world would end. Don DeLillo";
	schema:reviewBody "Eric Packer genial asset manager sitting in his limo contemplating about himself and his visions while playing with numbers that represent an immense fortune behaving almost in an autistic way once he tries to connect with the real world outside. Eric Packer also as the symbol of the small financial elite that rules our planet arrogant shameless and above all what's common and human.What happens when you have all you want? When there's no challenge no real desire anymore? When the last goal you want to pursue is like a real Icarus to fly so close to the sun that you can't but let melt the wax of your wings and fall very deep?This is IMO the essence of the story in Cosmopolis with that difference that the protagonist in DeLillo's novel caused his downfall intentionally while the financial disaster we live in the last few years was caused by the megalomania of the 1.When I first read the novel I felt confused and a bit dumb too. DeLillo tried to send messages that I didn't understand at all. Then happened Occupy Wall Street and the pie into the face of Rupert Murdoch so I gave the novel a second chance. I got hooked by the very complex character of Eric Packer cold and emotionless on the outside and in his actions but so vulnerable and lonely once you got to know him better. He's a very sad example of how far people can go in our society just for the sake of money. I've read the book 2 times more just to enjoy the countless thoughtful quotes and one liners weaved into stylistic dialogues as only DeLillo can pull off.So why have I written about the novel in a review about the film adaptation of this novel? Because I think that David Cronenberg did a fabulous job in trying to bring this book on screen. As a real master he has chosen to stay true to the dialogues taking the risk that people just like me when I first read the book couldn't get the meanings of them. He took from the novel what could work on screen and left scenes out that he thought could disturb or change the mood of the movie. In the first part of the movie he focused more on the little world of Eric into his limo rather than to shift the emphasis also outside the car. Not that I don't feel sorry some scenes didn't make it on screen the famous street scene at the end and for me the reality outside in the streets of NewYork could've gotten more attention but I can see his POV and I can live with it.In this daring exploit Cronenberg made sure of the presence of an excellent cast with remarkable performances of the supporting actorsactresses for the short time they appeared in the movie. The biggest challenge of course was the casting of Eric Packer the doomed capitalist who appears in almost every scene. Once again David took a risk in hiring Robert Pattinson but he was confident and he was right. Pattinson nailed this character to perfection. Especially when Eric as his world starts falling apart Rob showed how able he is to bring out the psychotic insane aspects of human being.This is a movie that makes you think that can give you an uncomfortable feeling and mirrors what's going on in some levels of our society. I understand that it is a difficult watch for people who haven't read the book that they are disappointed but never was promised that this movie was going to be easy. The biggest issue IMHO isn't the movie itself but the fact that in theatre you haven't a button to pause and rewind so you can hear the dialogues again and again. Once the words are spoken they're gone and I can imagine people reacting like WTH?? Though the movie stands on its own it can only improve your experience if you go a bit prepared to the screening. With my review I've tried to help those who're interested enough to give it a try. For those who didn't understand and by that didn't like the movie even Cronenberg and Pattinson didn't understand the story quite well but they went for it and created a masterpiece. There's nothing wrong with not understanding everything. It doesn't make the audience dumb it doesn't make the movie bad and it doesn't make a brilliant performance less brilliant.Sorry for mistakes as English isn't my first language.".

What is derivative in our system and how the human mind and the human condition is dangerously shifting. This is pure Cronenberg very mental talking about the society through the portrayal of individual psychology.This is for me the most accurate yet quite pessimistic depiction I've seen of what the society of money and information means for human beings. And it digs quite far thus can become hard to understand. Our relationship to Time has changed you focus on minutes and seconds. It used to be manageable but now it goes out of control. Chaotic profusion of information selfcontradiction being an enigma for ourselves blurry perception blurry identity and do we even have one ? We as a spectator can feel on the edge as ambivalent as Eric Packer both reflective and impulsive. Anyway I think the viewer will throw his own inner themes in the profusion of concepts that rise from the film. Cronenberg is still the master of suggestion window big open for interpretation.Maybe it won't touch those who feel they perfectly fit in their times. Facebook users people talking about money people caring for what they've been told to care. Maybe you have to feel a bit out of phase out of place at least sometimes to get engaged in the film.It is brilliant in connecting the concepts together in some momentum. There is terrific cinematography by Cronenberg on depth of field and what happens insideoutside the limo Eric Packer's inner sanctum.

	schema:reviewBody "I had avoided watching Cosmopolis because of the unsympathetic reviews it received from critics. Surprisingly this is a very thought provoking film that delves into the disastrous consequence our society is headed for. First of all Critics the so called paid ones Were you actually listening to the dialogues or were you just not paying attention to what was going on? Did any of the dialogues strike even a remote chord of reflection on  for example the fact that the firms or companies most people work for actually treat them as worker bees? That actually while we talk and stress on our individuality and unique perspectives are actually forced to follow and sacrifice ourselves to a vision of the more powerful and influential members of the society? Robert Pattinson is a revelation he has been working very hard in all the movies recently such as The Rover Maps to the Stars among others. We are sure to see more of this talented actor as he seems to choose his roles in movies more carefully than his equally if not more talented peer Danielle Radcliffe. The open ended conclusion in the story is bound to leave a few viewers a bit miffed but the whole point of the story is not the conclusion but about smart billionaire's approach to life especially when he feels little empathy or achievement because everything in life was given to him. This is today's generation who live their lives as if death would never conclude life. If you see closely you will notice that today's work pressures are created artificially by people like the ones portrayed by RPatz They are joyless mostly unhappy workaholics who would keep pushing people without having any empathy about what they are going through! All in all a movie well worth watching more than once thanks for reading!".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some films you watch and pretty much immediately you know it's not enjoyable. But you stick with it. You hope that there will be some big pay off at the end and then you'll think wow must watch that again now I know where it's going.Well I'm sorry to say this is not quite one of those movies. True it started off with me instantly being bored by it. Maybe five times I nearly gave up but waited for the big pay off at the end.

	schema:headline " Unpredictable absurd comedy perfect midnight movie";
	schema:reviewBody "And a rat became the unit of currency.I loved it but it won't be for everyone. This is most definitely a midnight movie. It's a challenging and dense movie not much of a plot with the focus on lots of talking and long shots. A neo noir in looks and feel about corporations capitalism the future rats as currency and a highly philosophical selfdestructive corporate analyst of some clandestine organization simply called Complex. From the first shot to the last you're always following Eric Packer Robert Pattinson in nearly every scene so everything's seen from his perspective. It's mostly a singlelocation movie where Eric talks to random dudes related to his company or any woman in his white stretch cyberpimped limo with an huge protest in the background. Oh man it looks awesome and gets messed up over the course of the film. If you're a fan of David Mamet and Richard Linklater's works like Before Sunset Waking Life Glengarry Glen Ross and especially Edmond another great midnight neo noir you'll feel comfortable with the pacing. A lot of talking one takes long takes of people talking about very dense corporate details with not much sense that might go over your head in a first watch. It feels very much based off a play or novel where incredibly verbose characters pontificate about corporations the world and time in weirdly absurd conversations. But it's not a film where all those cinematic techniques are evident or shoved into your face I just happened to notice he had been talking to a sweaty jogger of a mother who's also Eric's chief of finance while he had his prostate examined in his limo for 6 straight minutes. Eric Packer is a cold alienated and highly selfdestructive almost sociopath who goes on about the philosophy of time corporations how the world works violence and any other topic. His character reminded me heavily of Patrick Bateman Christian Bale in American Psycho just without all the 90s pop culture and music references. The selfdestructive and hedonistic urges of upper class socialites is evident in most Cronenberg movies and Eric is no different. The dude's bored with the world disillusioned and is a thrill seeker just so he can feel real while he spends most of his time in a purgatorylike limo. Like most of these heavy talking movies the plot is sparse and it's just Eric wants to get to a barber for a haircut which hints that it's an absurd satirecomedy. He's adamant of making the trek in his white cyber limo eternally stuck in New York traffic over a whole day that goes into night instead of just walking across the street which would only take 5 min. It's almost an absurd comedy at times like having his prostate examined in his limo by his personal doctor while talking to someone or he and Benno Paul Giamatti casually shooting up an apartment and at each other with futuristic guns in the weirdest Mexican standoff. How he's so stubborn about staying in his limo even though some big distractive imminent scenario is about to happen. How funny it is people related to his Complex company just happen to see his limo and jump in for a long convo.Robert Pattinson is a captivating actor to watch and the camera is transfixed to his face even when it's creampied later on thanks to an anarchist protester or pastry assassin played by Mathieu Amalric Quantum of Solace Diving Bell and the Butterfly. There's another famous French actor here with Juliette Binoche Certified Copy Three Colors Blue playing a highly sexual 41 year old friend. This is a challenging role for Pattinson not really for the character he plays of an upper class corporate man but how he spars against highly experienced wellknown actors in very long single takes or oneshots. Actors just acting a lot in that stagey way. These actors seem to come and go with not much of an arc between their characters except for a couple as is the case with most of these heavy talking movies more focused on the journey Waking Life Edmond. It's a bizarre movie one that will require quite a few rewatches just to get the nuances of the incredibly dense and fast flowing conversations. Also the rat protesters reminded me of eXistenZ and the film works almost as a counterpoint to that movie where instead of the anarchists we're on the side of corporate.I can see some people not liking the movie just because of the pacing and heavy talking nature of it but being in love with such midnight stagey movies like Edmond or talky Richard Linklater films I was not as confused. The verbose conversations can only have been based off a novel. Samantha Morton as Eric's Chief of Theory talks about stuff you won't understand on first watch and is emblematic of how the film's dialog gives more than you can handle which is why I can see Cosmopolis being ripe for rewatchability. It's really an absurd comedy and satire at times with a pretty serious and cool ending scene with Paul Giamatti. People who were expecting Cronenberg's early body horror might be disappointed although there are some choice moments but the film's definitely in his older speculative techno scifi style. My prostate's asymmetrical.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's say that for every 10 Twilight fans at least one is guaranteed to give Cosmopolis a go for no other reason than Robert Pattinson. And among those Twilight fans dumb enough to mindlessly try the film out at least 9 of 10 will despise what they see.David Cronenberg rather faithfully from what I understand adapts Don DeLillo's socio economic commentary rolled into a film about young billionaire Eric Packer who goes on a long limo ride across New York City for a haircut. What he fails to recognize however is that he was completely wasting his time Cosmopolis has no business being a movie.Cronenberg's clean and tight approach to the film can't be denied its technical kudos but everything he films is emotionally anemic. Cosmopolis has no story its characters are talking heads and its scenes just a collection of political gospel and esoteric ideologies. Not an ounce of this film goes into giving its characters souls and the more you hunt in search for just a sliver of one the less attention you pay to the themes so fundamental to the film's core. If you can focus long enough in any given scene you'll pick up some thought provoking nuggets but our natural curiosity as an audience is to look for the story behind the highbrow dialogue. Doing so however distracts from paying attention to all that can be praised about this material.Therein lies the reason Cronenberg should have left the novel alone. Ideas like the ones presented in Cosmopolis deserve time to simmer. If I had read the book I certainly would have taken the time to reread portions of it to process the commentary on capitalism rather than thinking at multiple times throughout the film oh there are rats that's a symbol for what this film is trying to say about capitalism! With the exception of Packer's newly made wife Sarah Gadon the cast of supporting characters suffers a similar fate in spite of some big names in Juliette Binoche Paul Giamatti and Jay Baruchel. By the time you can begin to so much as chew on the ideas raised in one of any of the several scenes in which Packer meets with a new character in his limo and talks about bigtime stuff that character is gone from the film completely. You never get a moment to catch up so that you can be in step with what's going on.Providing further distraction from understanding anything that's said in this movie is how Cronenberg  as he always does  charges this film with sexual and violent tension. He's not adding any that's not already in the story but he accentuates it. Consequently moments in the film will yank you out of your perpetual state of philosophical processing and snap you back into the moment of the film usually a violent outburst or a quick cut to a sex scene. That's part of what makes Cronenberg a revered director but in this case it's what makes Cosmopolis such a tough watch.For those hoping to see what Pattinson does as a topbilled star given weighty material Cosmopolis proves to be an unfair judge. He seems comfortable with the bizarre style of dialogue but the character and the story are so empty that the film can hardly be considered a fair judgment of his wouldbe dramatic prowess.As with any work of art steeped in its ideas the more you sit with it or reexperience it the more you're likely to warm up to it and I have no reason to believe that will not be true of Cosmopolis. At the same time a majority of viewers will likely not be equipped with the experience of processing this language as the film necessitates and the first runthrough obviously the most important suffers drastically as a result.Steven CThanks for reading!

However I believe this constant overflow of information is deliberately used to make the viewer feel how overly fast complicated and abstract is the world in which characters such as Packer live in  moreover the dialogs are exactly the same as in the Cosmopolis book so it's definitely not another attempt from our friend David to drown the viewer in useless pseudo philosophical sentences ...Besides as the film goes on even if the details of the dialogs or the relationships between the characters remain elusive it becomes gradually more immersive and while not understanding one can feel the oppressive atmosphere Eric Packer lives in  the climax being the marvelous face toface final scene ! Such an atmosphere could not have been created without the terrific job of Robert Pattinson  miles away from his former teen vampire performance he was perfectly fit for this role  a young handsome and bored golden boy about to let go of the artificial world surrounding him. the other actors do a great job as well especially the man Eric Packer confronts in the endShort version  If you are ready to not understand everything and to rather let yourself enter a very particular atmosphere watch Cosmopolis.

	schema:reviewBody "Young billionaire Eric Packer Robert Pattinson decides to take his  stretch limo across New York City for a haircut. Along the way he  conducts business meets friends family and acquaintances before being  mobbed by anarchists and confronting someone who has malicious intent  to harm him.  This film reminded me of a good Shakespearean play I only understood  about half of it but enjoyed it a lot. There are long elongated  stretches of duelling dialogue which are spoken in a half alien  language of metaphors and double meanings. The word 'this' takes on new  meanings and is used in  it feels like  almost every sentence. Much  like a Shakespearean play there are odd comic moments and in keeping  with Director David Cronenberg's cannon brief scenes of extreme  violence. These few instances ignited some of the more drawn out and  dare I say duller scenes to keep the audience on tenterhooks. Despite  these flashes this wont be a film for everyone and a man next to me in  an early afternoon screening fell asleep while a couple on the row in  front left about half way in.  Robert Patz' character reminded me a little of Michael Fassbender's in  Shame. Both felt like they were on a path to destruction which they  both sort of wanted or at least drew themselves towards. RPattinson  defies the advice of his security to actively search out trouble and  seems to show no emotion in doing so. In fact there is very little  emotion in any scene and the whole cast seem to live in a world of  robots. Sarah Gadon plays RobbieP's wife as an android with almost no  movement or signs of feeling. Equally The Robster's bodyguard played by  Kevin Durand is focused solely on his employer's safety and shows no  signs of living in a world outside of the film. This and also the  cinematography lead me to wonder if the film was set inside a dream. It  certainly had a dreamlike quality to it. Pattinson is surprisingly  excellent in this film playing a character that is sealed off from the  outside world in such a way that he barely notices when it is crumbling  in front of him. He has stoicism and magnetism that is rarely matched  on film.  As I said a couple of paragraphs ago I didn't understand a lot of what  was actually going on. There is a lot of financial talk and discussions  on a metaphysical level which went over my head. None of this stopped  me enjoying myself though and I only felt bored once in a long scene  featuring RobPatz and Paul Giamatti. The scene was livened up though  by a wonderful creeping score which slowing increased in volume as the  tension racked up as well as a short sharp burst of violence.  This film definitely won't be for everyone but I do hope hordes of  young Twilight fans go and get bitterly disappointed and confused.  Personally I thought it was very good but felt perplexed at times.  Unlike the source novel the ending is slightly ambiguous which I felt  was a good thing. This is a film I'd recommend to hardcore Cronenberg  fans and anyone who doesn't mind having to think a little but if you're  only interested in RizzlePatz cos' he's super hunky then stay away.".

This is a film I'd recommend to hardcore Cronenberg  fans and anyone who doesn't mind having to think a little but if you're  only interested in RizzlePatz cos' he's super hunky then stay away.";

I feel to class this as dull is to look for the wrong thing in a director who is anything but conventional. I thought of the apocalyptic dream imagery of JG Ballard and his mercurial solipsistic protagonists. It is not without its heartstopping moments too with sharp darts of piercing sex and violence.

	schema:reviewBody "Riding across Manhattan in a stretch limo in order to get a haircut a 28yearold billionaire asset manager's day devolves into an odyssey with a cast of characters that start to tear his world apart. Cosmopolis in my opinion is one of the most underrated weird movies i've ever seen it's basically about a rich guy living in a world where the rich rule the world and the poor live on the streets and they have some kind of king The Rat and this guy called Eric is an insane guy with a lot of money who cheated his wife like 3 or 4 times shot his bodyguard and was hit by a pie on the face and in the process he tracks down the guy who wants to kill him. First of all Robert Pattinson gives a great performance in this movie alongside Paul Giamatti Sarah Gadon and the rest of the cast and crew. I watched this on theaters a couple of years ago and my experience was pretty bad people walked out of the theater screaming and calling names the actor and the movie and demanding their money back but honestly what did you except it's a film that went to Cannes and got directed by Cronenberg about the economic crisis and a guy who is insane and even shoots his own hand because he thinks he is the king of the world. Cosmopolis is by no means a classic but it's by no means a bad film and it deserves better respect for what it tried to do and if you watch it for the first time just do your research and learn what you're getting yourself into but also if you hated it the first time try to give it a 2nd chance and try to study the film closely because it's nowhere near as bad as Maps to the Stars was not even close.".

Almost all of the dialogue is spoken in a monotone and is not natural language but a forced attempt at poetry that is so bad it isn't even funny. It's just one sequence after another with this flaky billionaire head of a company having ridiculously unnatural conversations with characters who are never formally introduced and who act like they are on Quaaludes or have had lobotomies. Imagine going to some offBroadway play that is going way too far in its attempt to be weird for two entire hours with the worst actors possible who just say random things that make no sense.

At least 50 of the dialogue should have been ditched. I kept pace with all the dialogue but found it too lengthy and was often bored during this movie. When a Shakespeare play is made into a movie they intersperse other scenes to make use of the visual nature of the cinema. I found Robert Pattinson not up to the task. Looked like he was just saying his lines and he missed the nuance of the meaning that could have been presented. In particular the doublemeaning that could be placed on many important moments.The bluescreen out the windows of the cars was terrible. The whole thing felt like a shoddy production. The dialogue actually mentions that the car has cork soundproofing that doesn't screen out all the background noise of the streets but inside the car it is dead silent and there is no movement no juddering no change in the light reflections on the windows no feeling of the car moving. This makes it feel staged and fake. The sex scenes are awful especially the 2nd one. They are just trying to remember their lines and there is no chemistry between the two. I usually enjoy Cronenberg films and think I can see what he likes so SPOILER ALERT it's clear to me this character is devastated by his miscalculation and the massive losses his company will suffer. He doesn't have the balls to kill himself so he's hoping to run into someone else who will kill him. Paul Giamatti does a nice job and it's clear Paul's character won't kill Robert's character. Though I found the religious overtones with the towel over Paul's head too heavyhanded. I see why this story appeals to some now. But recently there have been so many govts bailing out finance companies if anything such a character these days would really not have to worry too much. Furthermore many of the super rich have declared bankruptcy but kept their personal wealth and gone back into remake themselves. So no this is not a story for today. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Not even Robert Pattinson fans. Pattinson fans can see him with his shirt off. The character talks about working out and yet Pattinson has a puny body not worth looking at. His body looks like that of a patient who is terminally ill.".

Yes you can argue that the film is about the dialog and I'll admit there is probably some profound insights to be found. But what good does insightful dialog make if you're about to fall asleep constantly. Besides if you argue that the dialog is at the center then there are plenty of scenes of graphic nature which do absolutely nothing to further the story in itself. As far as the dialog is concerned those scenes could just as well have been placed in a coffee shop. Paul Giamatti's performance although short was a small highlight of the movie. Even though it also dragged on it once again showed why this guy stays on the radar all the time. For those that are only interested in the movie due to Pattison's torso there is some material for you. His acting though is not that good.

As the limo very slowly rolls and stops on it's interrupted journey through the mean nasty city which is bursting into revolutionary madness the protagonist a surprisingly compelling Robert Pattinson manages to keep my gaze averted from all the increasingly ugly things occurring outside the tinted power windows and focused upon his sincerely fascinating face. I felt as though I was being invited. emphatically to pay attention to the man behind the curtain except in the case of this profoundly disturbing film the Wizard is not a loud mouthed little phony. No this Master of this Universe is a genuinely powerful and twisted fellow. If you hate to have to think or ponder or even consider for a moment what anything means in a filmor in lifeyou're sure to really really hate this deliberately annoying and confrontational film. But if you're anything like me and you don't mind being asked to contemplate the bizarre nature of our ever more devolving collapsing society then you too should find this deeply unusual cinematic stunt to be quite worthwhile. It's not always fun or pleasant to watch but it's extremely original and undeniably haunting. And it has some neat surprises from some very good supporting players especially a superb Paul Giamatti as an especially ominous and unpleasant sort of Angel of Death.".

As the young priest rises in rank to Monsignor Bishop and eventually Cardinal he must tackle abortion interfaith marriage racial discrimination Nazism and selfdoubts about his own religious calling before the nearly threehour film reaches the closing credits. Despite its episodic nature The Cardinal is an entertaining film generally well acted and filmed by master cinematographer Leon Shamroy against some of the most beautiful landscapes and interiors that Rome and Vienna can offer. The Jerome Moross score enhances the beauty of the visuals and provides an appropriate mood that is haunting and liturgical in tone. While Tom Tryon as the Cardinal Stephen Fermoyle does his best a stronger actor with greater screen presence might have anchored the film and given it greater stability. Tryon at times appears colorless and unconvincing as a man who could rise so quickly and to such heights in the Italiandominated Church bureaucracy. The film's acting honors instead go expectedly to such veterans as John Huston Raf Vallone and Burgess Meredith. Also the film has dated somewhat as the conflicts depicted between events and Church dogma have been for the most part left in the past abortion excepted. Perhaps a sequel is in order with Cardinal or maybe Pope by now Stephen Fermoyle faced with pedophile priests gay marriage and a Church that has lost many of its followers over the decades. But despite the diminished relevance The Cardinal remains a comforting old fashioned view of the Roman Catholic Church during a period when the mass was said in Latin the celibacy of a priest was unquestioned fish was eaten on Fridays the sacraments were taken seriously and a poor son of Irish immigrants could rise from Boston curate to Cardinal without showing any more signs of aging than a light dusting of powder on his full head of thick hair.".

And since the film is all about the moral and personal issues facing him as he enters the College of Cardinals an actor with more emotional capabilities would have been more impressive.The other flaw is the three hour length for a film in which the story is simply not that compelling.

All the interiors of church activities are impressively staged and photographed in beautiful WideScreen photography. The performances around Tryon range from good to excellent including John Huston Carol Lynley Bill Hayes John Saxon and Burgess Meredith. Huston is particularly commanding as the brusque Cardinal Glennon who confronts Tryon with You're not afraid of me are you? when the young man speaks his mind.All of the technical aspects of the film are professional giving the story more credibility than it deserves from a rather lumbering script.

	schema:headline " On the Cutting Edge of Catholic History";
	schema:reviewBody "Otto Preminger's blockbuster film The Cardinal is kind of like an ecclesiastical Winds of War with its priestprotagonist seemingly on the scene of a whole lot of history from before World War I until just before the outbreak of World War II. The church of those times is vastly different than the Roman Catholic Church of today.Tom Tryon plays Stephen Fermoyle whose parents Cameron Prudhomme and Dorothy Gish as did so many Irish married couples determined that one of their kids would be a priest. They put aside money for same and the film opens with young Tryon completing his ordination in Rome and coming back to be assigned to the Boston Archdiocese.Tryon undergoes many crises of faith both personal and historical. As The Cardinal is history as how the church would write it for itself a lot of things are passed over and answers we might come up with today would not be what Catholic folks especially would have thought back then. One thing that did get me though maybe it was in the novel the film is based on is the big event for American Catholics in that time period was the 1928 presidential campaign and the nomination of Alfred E. Smith by the Democrats the first Roman Catholic to be nominated by a major party for president. I could not believe that Preminger made a film about the Catholic church in that period with an American protagonist and didn't mention that at all in the film.Preminger assembled a truly international cast of players of the second and third tier. Note the absence of any big name box office stars. He also shot the film in various locations around the world Boston Rome Vienna and other places where the odyssey of Tom Tryon takes him.Fellow director John Huston got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in his role as Cardinal Glennon of Boston loosely based on Archbishop of Boston at the time William O'Connell. Preminger said that Huston was cooperative in every way and Huston said he resisted successfully the impulse to call his own shots on his performance remembering this was not his film.Carol Lynley playing both Tryon's sister and niece does well in a dual role and Patrick O'Neal and Murray Hamilton play a contrasting duo of Ku Klux Klansmen in Georgia. Romy Schneider is fine as the Austrian woman who loves Tryon and nearly shakes him from his vows of celibacy. Austrian actor Joseph Meinrad is memorable as the only true figure portrayed by name in the film Cardinal Imnitzer of Vienna who makes a devil's bargain with Hitler and has cause to regret it. I think viewers will also like a pair of fine Italian players Raf Vallone and Tullio Carminati who play a pair Cardinals the former the friend and mentor of young Tryon and the latter the Papal Secretary of State based on Cardinal Merry del Val.My favorite moments in The Cardinal are with Burgess Meredith as the parish priest from a diocese in Northern Maine where Tryon is sent as a curate. He's a simple man of great faith who is dying of multiple sclerosis. He's an old friend of Huston's and their reunion scene on Meredith's death bed is touching and sublime. This may very well have been Meredith's best screen role and he never gets enough credit for it.Curious also that in this day when there is so much controversy about openly gay actor Chad Allen playing a missionary it's ironic that closeted gay actor Tom Tryon plays a prince of the church here. Tryon after he left acting and became a successful novelist came relatively out of the closet. Today there would be the same howls of indignation as there were for Chad Allen if The Cardinal were made now.As this is history as the church would write it itself The Cardinal misfires in making its main points. But the performances that Otto Preminger gets from his cast are dignified and in some cases very moving. Not a bad film but definitely falls short of being a great one.".

	onyx:emotionText "Otto Preminger's blockbuster film The Cardinal is kind of like an ecclesiastical Winds of War with its priestprotagonist seemingly on the scene of a whole lot of history from before World War I until just before the outbreak of World War II. The church of those times is vastly different than the Roman Catholic Church of today.Tom Tryon plays Stephen Fermoyle whose parents Cameron Prudhomme and Dorothy Gish as did so many Irish married couples determined that one of their kids would be a priest. They put aside money for same and the film opens with young Tryon completing his ordination in Rome and coming back to be assigned to the Boston Archdiocese.Tryon undergoes many crises of faith both personal and historical. As The Cardinal is history as how the church would write it for itself a lot of things are passed over and answers we might come up with today would not be what Catholic folks especially would have thought back then. One thing that did get me though maybe it was in the novel the film is based on is the big event for American Catholics in that time period was the 1928 presidential campaign and the nomination of Alfred E. Smith by the Democrats the first Roman Catholic to be nominated by a major party for president. I could not believe that Preminger made a film about the Catholic church in that period with an American protagonist and didn't mention that at all in the film.Preminger assembled a truly international cast of players of the second and third tier. Note the absence of any big name box office stars. He also shot the film in various locations around the world Boston Rome Vienna and other places where the odyssey of Tom Tryon takes him.Fellow director John Huston got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in his role as Cardinal Glennon of Boston loosely based on Archbishop of Boston at the time William O'Connell. Preminger said that Huston was cooperative in every way and Huston said he resisted successfully the impulse to call his own shots on his performance remembering this was not his film.Carol Lynley playing both Tryon's sister and niece does well in a dual role and Patrick O'Neal and Murray Hamilton play a contrasting duo of Ku Klux Klansmen in Georgia. Romy Schneider is fine as the Austrian woman who loves Tryon and nearly shakes him from his vows of celibacy. Austrian actor Joseph Meinrad is memorable as the only true figure portrayed by name in the film Cardinal Imnitzer of Vienna who makes a devil's bargain with Hitler and has cause to regret it. I think viewers will also like a pair of fine Italian players Raf Vallone and Tullio Carminati who play a pair Cardinals the former the friend and mentor of young Tryon and the latter the Papal Secretary of State based on Cardinal Merry del Val.My favorite moments in The Cardinal are with Burgess Meredith as the parish priest from a diocese in Northern Maine where Tryon is sent as a curate. He's a simple man of great faith who is dying of multiple sclerosis. He's an old friend of Huston's and their reunion scene on Meredith's death bed is touching and sublime. This may very well have been Meredith's best screen role and he never gets enough credit for it.Curious also that in this day when there is so much controversy about openly gay actor Chad Allen playing a missionary it's ironic that closeted gay actor Tom Tryon plays a prince of the church here. Tryon after he left acting and became a successful novelist came relatively out of the closet. Today there would be the same howls of indignation as there were for Chad Allen if The Cardinal were made now.As this is history as the church would write it itself The Cardinal misfires in making its main points. But the performances that Otto Preminger gets from his cast are dignified and in some cases very moving. Not a bad film but definitely falls short of being a great one.";

To many of us who hoped to see significant and even radical changes toward a more modern Church the Cardinal dramatized many of the problems that we believed needed correcting. The Second Vatican Council didn't go as far as some of us would like and the Church hasn't seen much reform since but when I see the Cardinal today I'm reminded how much more confining Church doctrine was before the Council did its work.By the way in response to the comment that no one could have done all the things that the Cardinal was portrayed as doing in the film my understanding is that the story is based on the life of Cardinal Spellman of New York. The details are changed but in fact Cardinal Spellman was from Boston and did undertake many of the same roles in his career including working as a Vatican diplomat from 19251932.".

	schema:headline " Ooooooooooh !!! That soundtrack.";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't care if anyone believes this but I was actually attracted to this film via its incredible grandiose and very emotional soundtrack which I heard on a Frank Chacksfield Cd ! I thought with an incredible score like that the film just cannot be bad ! Might sound stupid but there it is ! So I found this on a DVD from the USA  very nicely presented in colorful red packaging together with a bonus DVD about the life of O Preminger !In fact I did enjoy the film quite a lot ! Excellent picture quality and reasonable sound. Being a Roman Catholic and always educated in catholic schools jesuits and De La Salle Brothers having often attended Holy Mass I felt on watching this film to be on familiar ground so to speak. I thought the film illustrated well certain contradictions within the church notably of course with regards to racism and the Nazis in the World War II where its rle seemed to have been ambiguous to say the least.I am one of those people who believed that the doctrines of religion have been fixed by God for eternity  you must either accept them as they are or reject them  no one said it would be easy for this reason I believe that you can not and must not modify religious doctrine to suit the fashion at a given moment in time. If you cannot accept the church's position on one or other point then you are perfectly free to refuse the Church the time of the Inquisition is long past but you certainly should not try to change the doctrine of the Church to suit your own particular views. Only God can do that ! For this reason I agree with the reaction of Fermoyle confronted with various crucial situations .... abortion interfaith marriage racism Nazism etc etc. Sometimes unpopular stances have to be taken and it is good to see Fermoyle have the courage of his convictions even if we do see at times that he is no more than a human being who has doubts about what he is doing and his own weaknesses.The film is a series of very intense episodes each one being good to watch but the linking together of them not very smooth just as you're getting involved in one of these begorrah ! You're whisked onto the next one without knowing really how the one before resolved itself.I had never heard of the actor Tom Tryon ! He was not bad but I think the part could have been played better by certain other more well known actors. Tryon had a good powerful and imposing physique but in some scenes he appears rather emotionless or should I say not emotional enough.The film is pretty long there's an intermission which allows the spectator to take a breatherand I found the second part a bit more interesting and intense than the first. That said the film doubtlessly needs several viewings to be fully appreciated. There are other intense moments where Fermoyle has to choose between permitting the life of his sister or that of her childtobe but not both of them an extremely painful decision for anyone to have to make also his priest friend who is dying of multiple sclerosis. I was reading the other comments about this film and one of them was limited to the episode of ROmy Schneider's husband who had been sitting at table one minute hears the Gestapo comes and in oneandahalf shakes of a duck's tail has precipitated himself out of the window to his death on the street below ! It's true that you don't see it coming and remain flabbergasted because it all takes place so quickly. Funny though that that particular episode should have marked the commentator to such a point that it was the only detail of the film that heshe wrote about !Another extremely emotional scene is when Fermoyle journeys to Georgia USA at the request of a black priest whose church has been burned down by KKK extremists. He takes a very strong stand against this and pays for it by being whipped by the KKK. A few hours later one of those who has participated in the whipping  the harmonica player  comes back and helps him up ! Although Fermoyle realizes that he was one of the evildoers he just gives him a pat on the back and walks off with him. It's a difficult and very uncomfortable scene to bear. I could not forgive a man who had done that to me !The scene in Vienna where the church singers are bothered by a band of marauding Nazis is extremely intense violent and uncomfortable for the spectator ... the way those Nazis just smash their way into the church building ...... Fermoyle manages to escape via a secret passage to the church crypt .suddenly it just fades away and we jump forward in time. It was a little frustrating as that was the end of the film. I was surprised to see Romy Schneider in this film I have seen her often in French and German films but did not know she had starred in American ones. She was very beautiful but her rle was pretty limited. Perhaps a little more passion between her and Fermoyle would have added some spice to the story ......... never mind !To conclude then a fairly long film with intense moments. I'm absolutely not sure whether today many people would like it as unfortunately religion seems to be declining in Western society. But to those people who are religious or have an association with religion or concerned about its development it is sure to have a certain interest and relevance.".

Solemnity shouldn't be the way but it is and a rather phony solemnity at that. At times they all behave like creatures from another planet and nothing they say or do sounds or looks credible. The over long saga is told in little disjointed episodes the only thing that remains constant is the inexpressive brow of Mr Tryon. Most of Otto Preminger's opus looks terribly dated now. The Cardinal is perhaps the most dated. Carol Linley goes from saintly sister to exotic dancer in one single throw and Romy Schnaider has a brief and calculated moment. If I had to save something it would be the scene in which John Huston goes to visit his dying friend Burgess Meredith. But those kind of moments are rare. For some reason that I haven't been able to figure out there is a long musical number by Robert Morse but as absurd as it was it came as a welcome change from the agonizing pace the film suffers through its interminable length.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Cardinal is directed by Otto Preminger and adapted to screenplay by Robert Dozier from the novel of the same name written by Henry Morton. It stars Tom Tryon Romy Schneider Carol Lynley Dorothy Gish Ossie Davis Burgess Meredith John Huston Cecil Kellaway and Maggie McNamara. Music is by Jerome Moross and cinematography by Leon Shamroy.Film follows the life of Irish Catholic priest Stephen Fermoyle Tryon from his ordination to his appointment as a cardinal. His journey over time will see him tackle crisis' within his own family a struggle with his faith racism and fascism.Preminger's epic vision is evident the visuals often superlative and attention to detail is rather magnificent yet The Cardinal is too bloated and too episodic for its own good. In what is clearly meant to be a detailed examination of the Catholic Church and faith both good and bad just comes off as film makers straining for emotional wallop instead of challenging the viewers.Film is basically strung together in one by one formation. One scene finds Fermoyle Tryon looking quite lost at times faced with something nasty the next is how he deals with it. Then the next nasty thing comes his way and then he deals with it. And so on and so on. OK maybe it is a bit literate at times desperately reaching out for some poetic worth and Preminger has camera fluidity in abundance but the script is too often flaccid even corny and there's just not enough pulse raising performances around Tryon to make the near three hour experience worth itIf cut by an hour with a better leading man and with a script writer willing to really get gritty with the source then The Cardinal may have been a far better movie. As it is it's a misfire that wastes possibilities all over the shop. 510".

It stars Tom Tryon Romy Schneider Carol Lynley Dorothy Gish Ossie Davis Burgess Meredith John Huston Cecil Kellaway and Maggie McNamara. Music is by Jerome Moross and cinematography by Leon Shamroy.Film follows the life of Irish Catholic priest Stephen Fermoyle Tryon from his ordination to his appointment as a cardinal. His journey over time will see him tackle crisis' within his own family a struggle with his faith racism and fascism.Preminger's epic vision is evident the visuals often superlative and attention to detail is rather magnificent yet The Cardinal is too bloated and too episodic for its own good. In what is clearly meant to be a detailed examination of the Catholic Church and faith both good and bad just comes off as film makers straining for emotional wallop instead of challenging the viewers.Film is basically strung together in one by one formation. One scene finds Fermoyle Tryon looking quite lost at times faced with something nasty the next is how he deals with it. Then the next nasty thing comes his way and then he deals with it. And so on and so on.

	schema:headline " Preminger's Critical Mass";
	schema:reviewBody "Just watched this on TCM I had seen it once before about fifteen years ago. It's a type of film that doesn't seem to get made anymore  the cinematic equivalent of the good read examining the life of a character set against a backdrop of historical events. I've read that Henry Morton Robinson's hugely successful novel one of the biggest bestsellers of the early '50s was a key cultural landmark for American Catholics I'm not Catholic myself. Telling the story of Irish immigrant's son Stephen Fermoyle from Boston altar boy to achieving the titular honor the book clearly resonated with US Catholics seeking a new sort of identity in the postwar world. The fact that it was clearly based on the wellknown Cardinal Spellman probably didn't hurt sales.Starting in the mid '50s Otto Preminger made a habit of filming recent bestsellers to take marketing advantage of the books' established publicity. But The Cardinal was published well over a decade before Preminger filmed it in 1963. I'd guess part of this was due to censorship as a major subplot deals with abortion.Why a Jew like Preminger would film a novel like The Cardinal can only be guessed at I have not read the recent Preminger biography but I wonder if it wasn't at least partly due to the fact that much of the story takes place in Preminger's native Vienna.The Cardinal has great work from title designer Saul Bass cinematographer Leon Shamroy and especially composer Jerome Moross  his main theme should be much better known. Preminger himself directs in his usual objective style long takes few if any reaction shots and occasional use of Preminger's trademark  the actor starts from the side of the frame walks toward the camera to CU range then away from the camera I can't be the first person to notice this  have critics come up with a name for this shot?. As always with Preminger there are moments when a few reactive closeups might make things a bit clearer notably the suicide jump in immediate response to the Gestapo visit. A CU or two of the panicking paranoid victim might make the scene come across as a bit less jarringly outofnowhere.In the very long title role Tom Tryon is adequate. I'm not sure if a more expressive actor could have done much better as religious uncertainty is hard to visualize. Perhaps someone like Richard Burton might have brought more vulnerability to the section where Fermoyle is tempted by an Austrian girl Romy Schneider.John Huston steals all his scenes as a wily church politician and got a Supporting Oscar nomination to boot. Indeed The Cardinal is the film that started him on his second career as an actor. Carol Lynley also got a nomination and does especially well in her confession scene although the film fails to take much advantage of the gimmick of Lynley playing two characters. Burgess Meredith as a saintly parish priest Dorothy Gish Raf Vallone an unbilled David Opatoshu and many others make effective appearances. I have to mention Bill The Ballad Of Davy Crockett Hayes as Fermoyle's pianoplaying brother. He's quite lively Hayes had been a second banana on Ernie Koxacs' 1956 TV show and surprisingly good in the dramatic scenes. I wonder why he never had more of a Hollywood career outside of a longtime soap gig.One other participant in the production should be cited. According to Wikipedia the Papal liaison for the film was one Joseph Ratzinger now known as Pope Benedict.The Cardinal is definitely far better than the similar Shoes Of The Fisherman and I prefer it to another priestly lifestory The Keys Of The Kingdom. It could probably be considerably shortened without too much harm  the Robert Morse musical number could definitely be cut and the Ku Klux Klan episode is unnecessary as well as unconvincing. Among Preminger's bestseller films I rate The Cardinal higher than Exodus if not as high as Anatomy Of A Murder.".

	schema:reviewBody "A young Catholic priest named Stephen Fermoyle Tom Tryon from Boston confronts bigotry  Nazism and his own personal conflicts as he rises to the office of cardinal .In Austria he takes on the question of whether to remain with the priesthood or leave his promise so that he can be with a gorgeous woman Romy Schneider he wishes . In Georgia he contends with Ku Klux Klan and helps another priest Ossie Davis to face off racial bigotry . And in Austria he finds himself personally involved in the dealings of the collaborationist Cardinal Innitzer Josef Meinrad with the Third Reich under command of governor SeyssInquart Frey.Good film with thoughtprovoking issues and dealing with an IrishAmerican's rise from a simple priest to the college of Cardinals . The priest singlehandedly attempts to stop bigotry  Nazis  strife and many other difficulties . The film concerns shocking themes for that time as when he must decide whether to save the life of his sister or her unborn child conceived out of wedlock . The Vatican bankrolled some of the film and the Vatican liaison was a young Joseph Ratzinger future Catholic Pope 2005 as Benedict XVI. A truly memorable cast full of good players with special mention to starring Tom Tryon and Romy Schneider . Tryon was nominated for a Golden Globe in 1963 for his acting  but suffered immensely under Otto Preminger's notorious abusive treatment of actor  at one point during filming Preminger fired Tryon in front of his parents when they visited the set then rehired him after being satisfied that Tryon had been sufficiently humiliated  this type of treatment was a big turning point for Tryon who eventually retired from acting and turned to a successful writing career . Furthermore  an outstanding support cast as Burgess Meredith  John Saxon  Carol Lynley  John Huston  Robert Morse  Cecil Kellaway and feature film of Russ Brown and equally for the late Maggie McNamara in her last character. Enjoyable and sensible musical score by Jerome Moross . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Leon Shamroy. The motion picture deals with historical events and specially about the Anschluss  it was the occupation and annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938 . Earlier Nazi Germany had provided support for the Austrian National Socialist Party in its bid to seize power from Austria's Austrofascist leadership.Devoted to remaining independent but under considerable pressure from both Austrian and German Nazis Austria's Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg tried to hold a referendum for a vote on the issue. Although Schuschnigg expected Austria to vote in favour of maintaining autonomy a wellplanned coup d'tat by the Austrian Nazi Party of Austria's state institutions in Vienna took place on 11 March 1938 prior to the referendum which they canceled. They transferred power to Germany and the Wehrmacht troops entered Austria to enforce the Anschluss. The Nazis held a plebiscite within the following month asking the people to ratify it . Although the Allies were committed to upholding the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and St. Germain which specifically prohibited the union of Austria and the German Empire their reaction was only verbal and moderate. This epic point of view of a rise of an obstinate young priest from a backwoods clergyman until Cardinal was well directed by Otto Preminger  but emerge some flaws  being alternately compelling and uneven .".

The story is crafted with care and I became very involved with the film and it's characters fates.

An example of this is when Fermoyle has to choose between the life of his sister or her unborn baby a very agonising choice well portrayed by Tryon.  And to the film's credit it generally shows both sides of the argument in good debate with little or no patronising overtones.  Any film that attempts to entertain and challenge the viewer and succeeds  such as this  should be applauded.  After the end credits rolled I was still thinking about a number of things contained within the movie.My only problem with the movie was that the sound quality was awful and it's a bit difficult to hear what's being said.  A technohead with some flash equipment to clean up the movie is badly needed.You certainly don't need to be a Catholic or even religious I'm not to get a lot out of the film.

When I first saw this movie I was a practicing Mormon and now that I am of the Catholic Faith I love this movie even more than ever. There is a rumor about this movie that it was loosely based on the life of Cardinal Spellman. Was it? Could be but I haven't found proof but now that it has been completely restored on Video and in WideScreen what a pleasurable experience and what a cast. Perfection! And of course even though briefly in the film John Huston as usual is the scene stealer but when you watch it I think that the reason this movie is so enjoyable is that not only does everyone look like they love being in the film they all look like each one of them is trying to steal the scenes from one another and that just makes the film more enjoyable. In the book The Hustons John Huston was suppose to have told Preminger to watch himself when directing Tom Tyron because Tyron was a very nervous person and he was not to scream at him in any way and the first thing that Preminger did after hearing this was to walk in back of Tryon and scream at him which sent him almost into having a nervous breakdown right there on the set. This was Tom Tryons last movie assignment and it could well be because of Premingers attitude toward him. Nevertheless Tryon went on to become a very successful author and if it wasn't for him we wouldn't have The Dark Secret of Harvest Home in which when it was filmed for television we were to enjoy Bette Davis playing Widda but back to The Cardinal if anyone asks if this movie was the movie that made me convert from Mormonism to Cathocism the answer is no. It was The Sound of Music although later I was disappointed to find out that Mary Poppins was a Protestant!".

I'd say Tom Tryon fit into that category.Directed by Otto Preminger The Cardinal starring Tom Tryon in the eponymous role is a long somewhat dated film given what we know about the behavior of some priests today. Here's a guy not sure he can continue being a priest because of celibacy and little did he know that about 50 aren't and are priests anyway.Other actors in the film include John Huston Burgess Meredith Bill Hayes John Saxon Dorothy Gish and Maggie McNamara.Tryon plays Stephen Fermoyle a man from Boston at the turn of the century whose family has always assumed he would go into the priesthood. After finishing his studies in Rome he returns to America. He's a good man and an ambitious one but it's a quiet ambition. He isn't capable of crushing others. In Boston he helps others but he runs into problems in his own family when his sister Carol Lynley leaves home and becomes pregnant. Stephen has to then make a tough decision and an agonizing one. In Austria he questions his vocation and takes a leave of absence. He meets a beautiful vivacious woman Romy Schneider with whom he falls in love. But the priesthood wins.Along the way to Cardinal he is surprised by the Church's refusal to become involved with a raciallycharged issue in a diocese in Georgia. He becomes involved anyway. Finally in Austria he becomes involved in the Church's attitude toward the Third Reich. Unfortunately the film is neither intense or compelling moves too slowly and goes on too long. There are some strong scenes at the end though. The acting is fine. Tryon would eventually leave acting and become a successful writer before dying of cancer at the age of 65.Lots of familiar faces and a beautiful production.".

This time around we have an opening sequence of a pair of POWs being rescued in Vietnam by their captain John Saxon. Stuck away in a pit awaiting release Giovanni Radice and Tom King get an unexpected visitor in a Vietnamese woman half burned from a flamethrower falling into their pit. Do they rally for release? No instead they quickly grab the charred woman and begin biting into all sections of her body to quench their desire for human flesh. Captain Saxon is alerted to the presence of the pit opens it and recognizes his men rejoices at finding them and extends an arm to help end their imprisonment. The men continue to gnaw on their Asian buffet and finally Tom King jumps up and gets some Italian by biting into Saxon's forearm. The film then goes to the present where the two cannibals have been in hospital going treatment for many months and Saxon has nightmarish dreams and trouble looking at raw meat in his fridge. Well to spin a long story short...Radice is released and soon feels compelled to bite into the neck of a beautiful blonde while she is being licked all over in a movie theater. He runs and walls himself in a strip mall flea marketthe film was effectively shot in Atlanta besieged by one of the most ridiculous groups of bikers in film history and the cops. Soon Saxon convinces him to leave and go back for treatment but people everywhere now have been bitten and a new cannibalistic human rabies engulfs the hospital and other sundry areas of plot exposition. Cannibal Apocalypse is really an absurd film but is done very effectively on many levels. Don't see the bastardized version put out by Vestron Video but be sure to see the new DVD. It has a pristine print of the film lengthy interviews with Saxon Radice and Margheriti and many other bonuses. It is a bloody film with about four or five scenes maybe going beyond good taste. There is also a rather sick storyline of Saxon and a babysitter. A European perspective perhaps. Saxon is quite chilling in his stoic manner and Radice stands out in his role. King is laughable any time he opens his mouth. The rest of the cast  though mixed with Americans and Italians  comes off pretty well. The nurse is gorgeous. I liked the fellow playing Dr. Morris and particularly like the guy in charge of the police. He has this craggy dour look and some great lines for a film of this ilk. Despite a ridiculous story and dubious subject matter Cannibal Apocalypse comes off rather well because of Margheriti's artful direction. His directorial eye managed to create several good scenes  not just the hyperbolic guts scenes but other scenes as well. The opening is very effective as is the chase through the sewer. Certainly not a great film but better than you might initially expect. The musical score definitely is a standout.".

It is absolutely stupid in concept above average in execution and isn't totally successful because of its timidity in showing disturbing in your face gore. I like the way Saxon and most of the others play the ludicrous material with a straight face but unfortunately there are too many dull sections and not enough cannibalism! The movie begins well enough in the all too brief Vietnam sequence but never lives up to the promise shown in the first ten minutes. It's quickly downhill all the way after that only rescued by one or two blackly humorous scenes. What you end up with is a halfbaked Romero ripoff. I say go straight to 'Dawn Of The Dead' or 'The Crazies'.".

You'll have to get past the silly  inept Vietnam openingscene but then this movie turns into an urban tale of virusoutbreak. A cannibalvirus that is. There's some violence there's some drama there's some nudity there's some very nice gore and there are four cannibalfugitives on the run. Awesome mixture that works! Add to that a satisfying ending and we've got a hit! A hit with John Saxon in it no less. Cannibal Apocalypse indeed feels at times a bit like Romero's Dawn of the Dead 1978 but the one movie that kept coming to my mind was David Cronenberg's Rabid 1977. So if you're tired of all those half naked cannibals eating human flesh and slaughtering animals in the jungleflicks and if Umberto Lenzi's Nightmare City 1980 just made you laugh instead of anything else then go watch Antonio Margheriti's Cannibal Apocalypse aka Invasion of the Flesh Hunters.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie that follows a lot of the conventions of a zombie movie the main difference being that instead of being dead these flesheaters are alive just taken over by a virus that turns them into deranged cannibals. It's an interesting concept and this film features a lot of interesting scenes that you just don't see portrayed too often such as a bizarre molestation in a film theater and a long tense standoff with a crazed gunman in a resale store.This movie shows the influence of Dawn of the Dead all over it from the resale store biker rampage and standoff to the final scenes in which a group of four with the exact same genderethnic makeup as in DotD hole up against outside invaders. The interesting twist this time is that THEY are the pursued flesheaters rather than the other way around.This movie while having rich and deep cheese deposits also actually has some quality to it. It sustains a creepy and tense tone tied around John Saxon's growing obsession with consuming human flesh and his struggle and fear about giving into those impulses. Saxon carries off his 'upright soldier' persona so well that one both empathizes with his struggle and fears what will happen once his intensity is channeled into being evil. The direction is actually very good with many shots carefully composed to create and sustain a great deal of tension and menace. And then there's just the story which covers the first days of a viral outbreak as it begins to spread and people begin to wake up to what is going on which is also pretty fascinating.There's also an additional layer of tension to the movie compared to a traditional zombie movie in that after someone's been bitten you aren't sure WHEN they will start turning into a crazed flesheater. In a regular zombie movie they're dead until they wake up again here they're a normal person until suddenly they just snap which is cool.Though this is supposed to be an 'extreme gore classic' it's pretty tame by today's standards. When your big gore payoff shot has been done to comic effect in Death Becomes Her the edge is pretty much gone.Okay now onto the individually delightful cheese elements Stock helicopter footage opens the picture. There should be some kind of film festival of movies that incorporate unrelated stock footage the supreme champion obviously being Hell of the Living Dead.A guy pets a dog with an obvious explosive around its neck. He explodesand then the funky disco music begins! What's more the music was actually pretty good! Please note potential cannibals should not keep huge slabs of unwrapped bloody meat in their fridge. I mean obviously everyone does but if you suffer from cannibalistic tendencies A young girl comes onto John Saxon who wouldn't? by wanting to borrow a hair dryer. Her hair is not wet. She then reveals herself as an unhinged psychotic while blowing him um with the dryer while he's trying to have an important phone conversation with another unhinged psychotic which would earn a punch in the mouth from me but I am not susceptible to nubile vixens. Motorcycle chase in warehouseresale store! Hardbitten detective asks about mad gunman Is he subversive? Queer? Black? Commie? Uptight mother advises daughter to stop acting like a hussy! They set real rats on fire! That's not nice.There are EXTENSIVE background materials on the DVD one of which tells two interesting stories 1 That John Saxon couldn't understand enough of the script badly translated from Italian to know that he was in an extreme gore flick and 2 Radice tells an incredible story about refusing to kill a real pig leading to his accidentally almost severing an assistant's hand with a meat cleaver. Oops. But the docs get boring pretty quickly.Hey there are lot of other reviews of bad and cheesy movies plus a lot of good movies on my website Cinema de Merde which you can find through the URL in my email address.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vietnam vet Norman Hopper John Saxon has suddenly begun to relive the nightmare of war in his dreams. He receives a phone call from an old army friend Charlie Buckowski that he rescued in Nam Buckowski and another man Tom Thompson had been found in a Viet Cong prison with a craving for human flesh and both had since been in a mental hospital for psychological analysis. Hopper turns down the offer of meeting his old mate as he is struggling with demons of his own he believes his wife may be an adulteress he is also attracted to the very young girl next door and more importantly he is stressed at his increasing craving for raw meat and blood. Buckowski goes on a shooting rampage and kills a few people and is locked up again but then escapes along with Thompson and he urges Hopper to help them escape the city. Saxon a fluent Italian speaker and a veteran of many Italian films jumped at the chance of working with the great Margheriti and was immediately impressed by the directors rapport with actors and his talent behind the camera Saxon was also attracted by the seemingly novel idea that war might be spread by a virus he was shocked though when during filming he suddenly realised that the virus was a cannibalistic one and he refused to be in any of the scenes containing such acts. For those who like the adventure aspect of a jungle set Cannibal film this might disappoint slightly except for a few flashbacks this is entirely set in Atlanta and plays more like a Nam Vet action film with some gore on the side. Still though the characters are interesting and time is given to their development Saxon impresses as the troubled Hopper which is hardly surprising but he may have been helped somewhat by his depression at the time due primarily to financial problems he had after the breakup of his marriage. His fellow actors including John Morghen recount that he was rather aloof and distant and not much fun during filming. Margheriti was renowned for his period set Gothic costume dramas and Cannibal Apocalypse was a big change of style for him gone are all his trademark stylings and in come the more appropriate washed out colours and a steely grey look of the city. The gore is for the most part pretty tame by genre standards but its still effective. The faux disco score was tacky as hell and at times seemed inappropriate to the visuals but this is still a fun film and is recommend to fans of the genre".

The film now looks pretty good earlier versions were very murky looking there is some strong and effective antiwar content and the story has held together pretty well over the years but viewers should be forewarned that it's a lot tamer than most other Italian CANNIBAL shockhorror titles.Also here pretty surprisingly is one of star John Saxon's strongest lead performances. He's army sergeant Norman Hopper who while serving a tour of duty in the Vietnam war stumbles across a POW camp where two friends Charlie Bukowski John MorghenGiovanni Lombardo Radice who earned his title Italy's pin cushion for roles like this and Tom blaxploitation star Tony King are being held captive in an underground pit. During a gun fight a woman is caught on fire and falls down into the hole where Morghen and King feast on her corpse. Larry is understandably horrified but figures the two are just raving mad with starvation and rescues them. Years later in Atlanta Georgia where this was filmed Norman is happily married to Jane Elisabeth Turner no... not THAT one and living peacefully in suburbia. But the war comes home when a very manic Charlie escapes from an asylum starts sinking his teeth into victims and ends up trapped in a department store battling it out with both a biker gang and the fuzz. Norman is called in to talk some sense into his friend and does temporarily. Charlie is hauled off but not before informing out hero that they along with Tony who's in the same mental institution as Charlie and others have picked up some strange very slowprogressing cannibal virus somewhere while in Vietnam... and anyone who has been bitten in the meantime is also infected. Before long Norman is finding himself biting a seductive teen neighbor Cinzia de Carolis as Cindy Hamilton in a naughty spot and climatically on the run from the police with his two former military pals plus a nurse in the sewers underneath the city.Well I hated the music and there's more hohum action scenes than horror but Morghen though badly dubbed is very good as the sweaty frantic Charlie Saxon is excellent in a rare lead role with some actual substance there's a very downbeat ending and several standout gore scenes the most memorable being when Morghen's stomach is blown away by shotgun blasts. That footage plus the good picture quality and all the extra content on the excellent DVD earn this a few extra points the FLESH HUNTERS VHS I'd only rate as 310.The DVD includes long excellent indepth interviews with directorwriter Margheriti and stars Saxon and Morghen that not only cover this film but also their careers and their feelings on their careers. Saxon's recollections are pretty amusing. He claims he'd never watched this entire film but he was afraid while filming that he was taking part in a CANNIBAL HOLOCAUSTstyle mondogore effort which this is certainly not. Others extras include trailers the alternate opening sequence and a tour of the shooting locations.".

	schema:reviewBody "Italian director Antonio Margheriti's goriest film is this a socalled video nasty that was banned here in the UK back in the '80s at the height of the cannibal phase when anything with the word cannibal in the title was removed from sight in the shops. Yet while a unpleasant film  considering the subject matter that's unavoidable  CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE isn't really that gory or indeed horrific. Margheriti shows his penchant for the action genre over the horror throughout with plenty of cool fist fights shootouts and siege situations which are invariably more exciting than the horror elements the film has to offer. Sure there are half a dozen moments of graphic bloodshed which made this film a nasty but don't be fooled this is just as much an action flick as it is a horror.Margheriti has long been one of my favourite directors and once again he creates an aboveaverage always interesting genre picture. Even during some long pauses in between the action and bloodshed the film grips us with the macabre situations thanks to the strong realistic characterisation and a plot which is a little more original and unique than most. Instead of heading off into the South American jungle like Lenzi or Deodato Margheriti instead brings the cannibalism to the American streets of Atlanta Georgia which leads to some new and interesting situations including a citywide battle between the police force and the cannibals themselves. Here the cannibalism is seen as a biological virus just how it works is explained only through some theoretical garbage a throwaway line designed to bamboozle the viewer which is spread by being scratched or bitten by an infected victim just like zombies or vampires.Once again Margheriti seems to be working on a relatively low budget but manages to create some impressive stylish action sequences. There are some great setpieces in the film including a tense scene in which genre regular Radice is held under siege at a flea market after having bitten a woman at the local cinema butchering half a dozen security guardspoliceHell's Angels in the process. Also check out the sewerset finale which is topnotch stuff very exciting and the prologue is even a miniwar film set in Vietnam a theme which Margheriti would develop for THE LAST HUNTER. Once again the dialogue gives us some priceless and memorable lines for the cast to devour and boy what a cast.The three main cannibals are made up by genre veterans John Saxon John Morghen and former blaxploitation star Tony King. Saxon takes the lead role of Norman Hopper who is bitten whilst rescuing his comrades in IndoChina and tries to suppress his cannibalistic urges before finally taking a bite out of the Lolitalike girl next door. Saxon always seemed to be an actor above the films he was in a real presence and his acting as he struggles psychologically with his bodily urges is great stuff and a delight to watch. John Morghen aka Giovanni Lombardo Radice is often an underrated actor playing dirty perhaps mentally handicapped characters like the boy in CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD. Well it's another nervous twitchy ontheedge role for the actor as the most evil of the cannibals and a surprising moving performance by the actor. Tony King who later would pop up in loads of Margheriti films like TIGER JOE plays his role completely overthetop and hammy right until his death which I greatly appreciate. There's even a police sergeant right alone the lines of Arthur Kennedy in THE LIVING DEAD AT THE MANCHESTER MORGUE to add to the fun and spout some more insane angry dialogue Oh my god son  put it down! is a particular favourite when he sees one of his officers devouring a woman's breast.To give the film that realistic look the special effects are handled by Fulci's goremeister Giannetto De Rossi who once again excels with his work. As well as loads of people getting shot bitten and the like highlights include tongue and eyeball violence and the oftremembered shotgun blast to Radice's stomach in the sewers at the end of a film leaving a gaping hole which Margheriti is quick to zoom in on. Top quality stuff and it'll leave you wondering just how they achieved that effect. As per usual for the genre Margheriti gives us a downbeat ending but what is surprising is the inherent tragedy present in it it finishes almost like a Shakespearean tragedy. They have to go and spoil it with a silly twist but it still packs a punch in any case. An unfairly maligned actionhorror crossbreed effective in the two genres it manages to cross successfully and another feather in the hat for Margheriti.".

To be clear this metaphor was wholly intentional by the cast and crew in an interview on the DVD the lead actor explains the metaphor more clearly and concisely than I will be able to in this review.The general plot is that several soldiers while fighting in Vietnam contract and this is the central metaphor an ambiguous infection that makes them hungry for human flesh. It sounds like a set up for a fairly straightforward zombie or cannibal movie but the focus is really on the soldiers' inability to readjust to society as well as their desperation to be accepted as human beings. They're the good guys rather than the horror villains and we sympathize with them as they try to find dignity in a world where they are fundamentally unable to fit in. The film's protagonist is the former commanding officer. The most engaging aspect of the film for me was this character's difficulty in balancing his loyalty and obligation to support and protect his former troops with his obligation to serve the broader needs of society. I watched this film after recently being replaced as the president of a local organization and perhaps for this reason I found the moral challenges faced by this character entirely compelling. It asks the question which really resonates with me of how to follow through on an old commitment to lead support and protect a group of people after you are no longer officially recognized as their leader and no longer have any official powers with which to support or protect them.Anyway it's pretty cool. Even on a superficial level it's reasonably enjoyable it's got all of the quirks you'd expect from an old Italian B movie including goofy music unnecessary nudity etc. Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a great fan of director Antonio Margheriti whose impressive repertoire includes brilliant Horror as well as great Spaghetti Westerns. His doubtlessly greatest film is the Gothic masterpiece Danza Macabra aka. Castle of Blood of 1964 starring the great Barbara Steele followed by the brilliant revenge Western E Dio disse A Caino And God said to Cain 1970 with Klaus Kinski and La Vergine Di Norimberga Castle of Terror 1963. Even though not one of his masterpieces Apocalypse Domani aka. Cannibal Apocalypse of 1980 is an original and highly entertaining film. This is quite different to other Italian Cannibal movies that are set in the jungle as it takes place in the city almost entirely only the first five minutes take place in the Vietnamese jungle. This film was banned in several countries after its release but it is not nearly as gruesome as one might expect. It is full of nauseating gore no doubt but compared to other contemporary Cannibalfilms such as Cannibal Holocaust 1980 Cannibal Ferox 1981 ore Eaten Alive 1980 Cannibal Apocalypse is actually quite tame.Cannibal Apocalypse is about a mysterious virus that gives people an irresitible hunger for human flesh. American soldiers have been infected with the virus in Vietnam and have brought it back home with them... The greatest aspect of Cannibal Apocalypse is arguably the brilliant casting of John Saxon and Giovanni Lombardo Radice. Saxon is as always great in his typical stoic manner. The best performance however comes from Radice who is once again excellent in his role here. Giovanni Lombardo Radice enjoys a deserved cultstatus among fans of Italian HorrorGore films and his role here perfectly illustrates why  his character of the name Charles Bukowski! is one of the first infected with the cannibal virus and Radice excellently portrays the Vietnam veteran's bloodlust and insanity. The film often resembles a Zombieflick more than the Cannibalflicks of the time. The people infected however are not braindead flesheaters but intelligent thinking people  only with the unconquerable hunger for human flesh... One of the greatest elements of Italian Cannibal flicks were their scores and even not quite typical Alexander Blonkensteiner's score is great. Cannibal Apocalypse may not be one of the greatest Italian Cannibal films but it is definitely highly original. Lovers of Italian HorrorGore cinema can not afford to miss this!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit this film reminded me of how drab and ugly styles were in 1980 yechh! From that opener you can tell this film is prettydated but it has a few charms that are worth exploring namely an outrageousscript by Margheriti and Dardano Sacchetti that would NEVER get greenlighted today by any studio. Yes this is another one of Quentin Tarantino's favorites and it isn't hard to see why. It's just an insane genreexplosion that owes a lot to the Italian cannibal genre and a goodbite of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. You might add Jacopeti and Prosperi's Mondo Documentaries too because I think they really opened this particular door. Zombie the Italian title for DOTD was a hit in Italy in 1979 thanks to the Argento's promotionalcampaign and betterediting I know a sacrilege but I have always preferred the Argentocut it's more fun!. With that came a wave of imitators mostnotably in Lucio Fulci's Zombi USAZombie 2 Italy  other  and City of the Living Dead. The worst were the copies by Bruno Mattei but that's anotherstory.1980 a drab miserable year but a time when the culture was still pretty active and vibrant. Corporatedomination of film and most other media hadn't beenconsummated yet so there were still genuine indie films and it was a sad thing to watch all this die as a kid. This is really why horror wasn't that good in North America for sometime and it's still trying to recover a waitandsee. The Vietnam war had only been over for fiveyears when Cannibal Apocalypse was released so the wounds were still ripe. That's what makes this film so gutsypunintendedand even depressing. At onepoint during the production star John Saxon was sodepressed by having signedon to such a bleak movie that he contemplatedsuicide. Now how many films can say that? It just wasn't a goodtime in America though inretrospect life was better than it is today 2006 which should scare most youngpeople. There were more outlets for frustration and rage in 1980 and horror wenttobat since catharsis is one of its bestfeatures. You have to release those fears and frustrations and that's what horror is for many people. Horror is healthy people we know this! Cannibal Apocalypse workswell in this area so it has some very goodpoints to it. We should remember that this movie was made at a time when the draft stillexisted. The draft is definitely comingback you can betonit. Still not scared? John Saxon stars as Lt. Norman Hopper who leads a rescueparty into a Vietcong camp to recapture some of his own troops. A battleensues and a Vietcongwoman where were the blackpajamas?! is torched with a flamethrower and falls into the pit she and her compatriots have been holding Hopper's men in. All this seems like a normal lowbudget war movie that was shot in Georgia until...the starvingG.I.s begin EATINGHER. OK Crations and Halliburton's catering are pretty bad but Jesus Christ. Somehowbecause the writers don't tell us howthe soldiers have become infected with a rabieslike virus that makes them cannibalistic. Cutto 1980 one of Hopper's soldiers is released from a veteran's hospital disrupting his already strainedlife and wreakinghavoc on American society or at least Atlanta! Hopper has already been fighting his cannibalisticimpulses and winning but the return of PFC Bukowski done with charm by the legendary John Morghen has broughtback flashbacks and memories of Vietnam he thought he'd forgotten. In an earlyscene Hopper bites a flirty neighborhoodgirl and he begins to succumb to the cannibalistic disease.And this is what is so great about Cannibal Apocalypseit challenges your loyalties to the characters and coaxes you into siding with a band of cannibals led by noneother than JOHN SAXON!! For this reason and the gore I think this is why the film became so infamous and censored. Yet these are the things that make is as good as it is! In many areas it was censored of heavilyedited. Until the release of the 2002 DVD Margheriti died in November of 2002 Americans have never seen this film in its entirety. Saxon has said he has never seen it and I doubt he ever will. Who can blame him? Yet he gives an incredibleperformance as Norman Hopper even one of his best in his entirecareer outside of Enter the Dragon. Granted it's just another in a longline of exploitation films that Mr. Saxon acted in but it's a great role that he did justice to. Of course his own personalmisery didn't hurt either. But Antonio Margheriti's Castle of Blood The Virgin of Nuremberg direction is excellent and he didn't have much to workwith here. Sacchetti's theme of a violentcannibalism spreading by bites is a solidmove however. It's very primal and hits the audience on a subconsciouslevel even though it owes a debt to Romero. It isn't asdeveloped as it should have been but this was another rushproduction.So as an antiwar filmnotsogood the theme gets lost in the action and gore. But that's OK it's a film that leaves people speechless and that's what a decent horrorfilm is about too. From Cannibal Holocaust to Dawn of the Dead this is a hybridfilm that is unique to the time that made it. But it is so audacious so brazen that it must be seen. It lags in the middlesectionpunintendedbut really picksup towards the climax and reminds us that movies about the infected are not new. I would even credit Cronenberg's Rabid 1977 as being first on this one and a definiteinfluence on this film. There was something in the air then and it seems to have returned. Call it war chaos genocide socialunrestbut it's back. Bestmove just pssonit you remember. Nowonder Morghen's character was namedafter the American poet Charles Bukowski! If America is good at anything it is slang.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Vietnam vet's quiet suburban life is disrupted by visions of his past flesh eating and wartime violence along with the sudden return of several of his army buddies whom are suffering from the same depraved visions and longings.A nice little gut munching premise but Cannibal Apocalypse doesn't deliver. There seems to be an aversion to outright gore and what there is is poorly done. In fact the extended scenes of bloody carnage the opening sequence the biting of the tongue Giovanni Radice getting shot straight through at the end of the film only underscore the shoddy effects which I've seen better versions of in no budget direct to video flicks.After accepting the fact that this wasn't going to be a cheesily fun gorefest I sat through the rest of the movie hoping for something redeeming enough to justify this film's reputation.What I got was a muddled mess of derivative influencesmost notably the works of Romero the liner notes of my copy of the DVD helpfully point out exactly how many influences were used in the film as if they weren't obvious enough sprinkled liberally with some action movie clichs.Perhaps I could've forgiven all of it had this film not insisted on taking itself so damn seriously. Badly done gore and derivative plotting can be watchable if there's a bit of a sense of humor spiked through the proceedings but all of the actors are playing it with a very straight face underscoring how utterly dull as dishwater the whole mess is.On the whole an overhyped relic of the cannibal craze lacking the sheer trash genius of Cannibal Holocaust or the campy gore of Cannibal Ferox.3 stars one for low budget favorite John Saxon one for the nice little coda provided in the last 60 seconds of the film a classic nudge that things aren't really over and a touch of the tone that the rest of the film lacked and one star for the titlebetter than the rest of the film.".

	onyx:emotionText "A Vietnam vet's quiet suburban life is disrupted by visions of his past flesh eating and wartime violence along with the sudden return of several of his army buddies whom are suffering from the same depraved visions and longings.A nice little gut munching premise but Cannibal Apocalypse doesn't deliver. There seems to be an aversion to outright gore and what there is is poorly done. In fact the extended scenes of bloody carnage the opening sequence the biting of the tongue Giovanni Radice getting shot straight through at the end of the film only underscore the shoddy effects which I've seen better versions of in no budget direct to video flicks.After accepting the fact that this wasn't going to be a cheesily fun gorefest I sat through the rest of the movie hoping for something redeeming enough to justify this film's reputation.What I got was a muddled mess of derivative influencesmost notably the works of Romero the liner notes of my copy of the DVD helpfully point out exactly how many influences were used in the film as if they weren't obvious enough sprinkled liberally with some action movie clichs.Perhaps I could've forgiven all of it had this film not insisted on taking itself so damn seriously. Badly done gore and derivative plotting can be watchable if there's a bit of a sense of humor spiked through the proceedings but all of the actors are playing it with a very straight face underscoring how utterly dull as dishwater the whole mess is.On the whole an overhyped relic of the cannibal craze lacking the sheer trash genius of Cannibal Holocaust or the campy gore of Cannibal Ferox.3 stars one for low budget favorite John Saxon one for the nice little coda provided in the last 60 seconds of the film a classic nudge that things aren't really over and a touch of the tone that the rest of the film lacked and one star for the titlebetter than the rest of the film.";

It is a road movie a film about cars and a search for meaning in American life that could easily be called Zen and the Art of Drag Racing. Shot from the inside of a car it is an authentic vision of what it is like to be driving across America at a specific historical moment. Promoted by Universal Studios in 1971 as an answer to Columbia's Easy Rider the film was originally released to less than enthusiastic audiences but has since taken on the status of cult classic and it is richly deserved. Unlike Easy Rider it is a film that simply observes and what it sees is pure Americana its people gas stations diners and drag strips. We feel the claustrophobia the spaces the speed and the loneliness.The film stars singers James Taylor Fire and Rain and Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys as taciturn drag races who drive their soupedup 1955 Chevy across the country challenging locals to a drag race. The main characters are drifters. They come from nowhere and are headed east toward a destination that is murky at best. They are people whose reality begins and ends with their machines. Everyone talks about how good life can be  somewhere else  in New York Chicago the beaches of Florida and the coast of Mexico somewhere up the road apiece. Warren Oates a Monte Hellman regular turns in a truly outstanding performance as the driver of a Pontiac GTO who challenges Taylor and Wilson to a crosscountry race the prize being the ownership of the cars. GTO is a talkative fellow who concocts tall tales about his background to impress every hitchhiker he picks up one is a gay cowboy played by Harry Dean Stanton. He is a sad and perhaps selfdestructive individual but he is human and you can reach out to him and feel his pathos.First time actors Taylor and Wilson express little emotion and there is scant dialogue but they also seem right for their roles. Their total focus is on their car. Though the Chevy looks old and ugly it is as powerful as any car on the road and the driver and the mechanic treat it like their own flesh and blood constantly fine tuning to maintain its impeccable performance. They go from town to town just trying to survive by racing. In the words of author John Banville they have no past no foreseeable future only the steady pulse of a changeless present. Along the way they pick up a cherubic young roadie Laurie Bird who is willing to go wherever the ride takes her. After each of the boys has sex with her in motel rooms and in the car she becomes moody and resentful and fears that she is being used but has nowhere else to go. Though the main thrust of the plot is the race to Washington DC the focus seems to get lost along the way and the film becomes more of a character study of the lack of human connection than about racing.The film looks for the soul of America in the early 1970s and comes up empty. It was released in 1971 at a time when the hopes and dreams of the '60s counter culture had given way to the disillusion of Kent State and Altamonte the bombing of Cambodia and the media's cynical preemption of the Hippie movement.The movie is about everything and nothing. Everyone is biding their time waiting for life to turn out rather than creating the possibility. Though they live for the moment there is no joy only the gnawing reality of something missing. They are like many of us skimming along on the surface of life reminiscing about a goal that once seemed real but is now just out of reach. They look ahead to a blank future while ignoring the life around them what is in the present moment. TwoLane Blacktop is an exceptionally beautiful film a poetic description of a world without possibilities. It may also be the definitive statement of the anguish of the materialist paradigm that has begun to crumble and fall apart.".

	schema:headline " More Than a BMovie";
	schema:reviewBody "TwoLane Blacktop is not the piece of disposable drivein fare it appears to be  it has a quality that sticks with you a sense of sadness and disenchantment that approaches hardscrabble poetry. Monte Hellman has created a movie that succeeds almost entirely via tone. It's not the sort of movie that connects to us in the usual ways through melodramatic artifice or overt displays of emotion. The key to its success is that it never really connects with us at all  it remains abstract wrapped up in its own little arcane ritualistic world. Yet there's something familiar about this place too the sense of disconnectedness and longing. Despite the movie's fetishistic selfabsorbed quality there's a universality that is undeniable. We might not be that interested in the arcana of life as itinerant dragracers but we can relate to their need for a meaningful experience and the sadness of their ultimate failure to connect.Hellman stages the action in such a way as to deemphasize any normal sense of character and to pointup the relationship between the characters and their machines which is the real theme of the movie. These people have no identity away from their cars  the two main protagonists played by creepy singersongwriter James Taylor and lunky Beach Boy Dennis Wilson spend almost the entire movie talking about cars driving or working on their jalopy a soupedup '55 Chevy coupe for those of you keeping score. Taylor the driver is a crack dragracer his entire existence revolving around racing or setting up races or driving to the next race. The performance Taylor gives can only be described as detached yet this druggy cutoff quality is perfect for the character who strikes one as the kind of fanatic who can only be really alive when he's doing the one thing he loves. He seems barely aware of the movie's female lead a wandering hippiechick who provides a moment or two of distraction from the road the perpetual search for excitement but can't tear any of the men away from their machines for long not that she doesn't try. The movie is one big Kenneth Angerlike fetishistic male fantasy about cars their power and speed and the sense of identity one derives from possessing and controlling them.This makes the movie seem like a bummer but trust me when I say that it's not. It's an unconventional movie to be sure but it still provides some conventional Bmovie amusement along the way  primarily in the form of Warren Oates who gives a vivid fullyrealized performance as a midlifecrisis sufferer with a rather loose sense of the truth. This pathological liar in a bananayellow GTO is a marvelous caricature of the classic American jerk. Oates a brilliant sketcher of masculine bluster creates one of his most memorable sleazysympathetic characters a pitiful braggart who can't even fix his own carburetor when it springs a leak  the character's impotence being expressed in terms of automotive knowhow which is fitting given the film's gearhead ethic. Yet Hellman doesn't just laugh at Oates  he's broadminded enough to see what the impotent nitwit in the musclecar has in common with his superethical heroes namely this inexpressible yearning. These are not John Cassavettes heroes spraying their masculine angst all over the screen like palsy victims though. They're monosyllabic highway cavemen halfcivilized carfetishists for whom women are inexplicable unconquerable creatures and for whom life is one big escape from something they can't even put into words. This nonverbal semipoetic quality of the characters is sometimes a little hard to swallow but it's often funny too. It's like Kerouac if Kerouac had had a sense of humor.In Easy Rider the motorcycles were symbolic of rebellion the spirit of independence supposedly embodied by bikers but there's nothing especially rebellious about the characters in TwoLane Blacktop. Hellman's not trying to take an ideological stance like Dennis Hopper who saw his bikerfantasy as revolutionary  his movie is less '60s than '70s less hippieera trip than post'60s tranceout. It has more in common with Loving and Blume in Love than with Easy Rider the sense of America as this great disjointed place where no one has anything to believe in except the next experience the next empty affair or drugparty or dragrace. The carcrazies of TwoLane Blacktop are not martyrs like the bikers in Hopper's trippy opus they're lost souls like Nicholson's Robert Dupea from Five Easy Pieces. They're characters of a certain tragic dimension but the tragedy is rather nondescript.

	onyx:emotionText "TwoLane Blacktop is not the piece of disposable drivein fare it appears to be  it has a quality that sticks with you a sense of sadness and disenchantment that approaches hardscrabble poetry. Monte Hellman has created a movie that succeeds almost entirely via tone. It's not the sort of movie that connects to us in the usual ways through melodramatic artifice or overt displays of emotion. The key to its success is that it never really connects with us at all  it remains abstract wrapped up in its own little arcane ritualistic world. Yet there's something familiar about this place too the sense of disconnectedness and longing. Despite the movie's fetishistic selfabsorbed quality there's a universality that is undeniable. We might not be that interested in the arcana of life as itinerant dragracers but we can relate to their need for a meaningful experience and the sadness of their ultimate failure to connect.Hellman stages the action in such a way as to deemphasize any normal sense of character and to pointup the relationship between the characters and their machines which is the real theme of the movie. These people have no identity away from their cars  the two main protagonists played by creepy singersongwriter James Taylor and lunky Beach Boy Dennis Wilson spend almost the entire movie talking about cars driving or working on their jalopy a soupedup '55 Chevy coupe for those of you keeping score. Taylor the driver is a crack dragracer his entire existence revolving around racing or setting up races or driving to the next race. The performance Taylor gives can only be described as detached yet this druggy cutoff quality is perfect for the character who strikes one as the kind of fanatic who can only be really alive when he's doing the one thing he loves. He seems barely aware of the movie's female lead a wandering hippiechick who provides a moment or two of distraction from the road the perpetual search for excitement but can't tear any of the men away from their machines for long not that she doesn't try. The movie is one big Kenneth Angerlike fetishistic male fantasy about cars their power and speed and the sense of identity one derives from possessing and controlling them.This makes the movie seem like a bummer but trust me when I say that it's not. It's an unconventional movie to be sure but it still provides some conventional Bmovie amusement along the way  primarily in the form of Warren Oates who gives a vivid fullyrealized performance as a midlifecrisis sufferer with a rather loose sense of the truth. This pathological liar in a bananayellow GTO is a marvelous caricature of the classic American jerk. Oates a brilliant sketcher of masculine bluster creates one of his most memorable sleazysympathetic characters a pitiful braggart who can't even fix his own carburetor when it springs a leak  the character's impotence being expressed in terms of automotive knowhow which is fitting given the film's gearhead ethic. Yet Hellman doesn't just laugh at Oates  he's broadminded enough to see what the impotent nitwit in the musclecar has in common with his superethical heroes namely this inexpressible yearning. These are not John Cassavettes heroes spraying their masculine angst all over the screen like palsy victims though. They're monosyllabic highway cavemen halfcivilized carfetishists for whom women are inexplicable unconquerable creatures and for whom life is one big escape from something they can't even put into words. This nonverbal semipoetic quality of the characters is sometimes a little hard to swallow but it's often funny too. It's like Kerouac if Kerouac had had a sense of humor.In Easy Rider the motorcycles were symbolic of rebellion the spirit of independence supposedly embodied by bikers but there's nothing especially rebellious about the characters in TwoLane Blacktop. Hellman's not trying to take an ideological stance like Dennis Hopper who saw his bikerfantasy as revolutionary  his movie is less '60s than '70s less hippieera trip than post'60s tranceout. It has more in common with Loving and Blume in Love than with Easy Rider the sense of America as this great disjointed place where no one has anything to believe in except the next experience the next empty affair or drugparty or dragrace. The carcrazies of TwoLane Blacktop are not martyrs like the bikers in Hopper's trippy opus they're lost souls like Nicholson's Robert Dupea from Five Easy Pieces. They're characters of a certain tragic dimension but the tragedy is rather nondescript. There are no great flaming climaxes in TwoLane Blacktop nothing as trumpedup as the finale of Easy Rider but there is this portentousness this sense of doom hovering over the characters  and it's this sense of doom that keeps Hellman's movie from floating off into some romantic lala land.

	schema:reviewBody "As an admirer of Monte Hellman's superb 1960s westerns 'Ride In The Whirlwind' and 'The Shooting' I had been dying to see 'TwoLane Blacktop' for many years as most people who have seen it regard it as Hellman's best movie and one of the greatest road movies ever made. Impossible to find on video and rarely if ever screened on TV here in Australia I finally managed to get hold of it on DVD and boy does this movie REALLY live up to its reputation! I think if it had have been more easy to see over the last thirty years it would be spoken of in the same breath as 'Easy Rider'. Both movies are landmarks. Existential road movies that really capture a lost slice of Americana. Hellman like so many other talented directors got his first breaks from bgrade legend Roger Corman. But Hellman's unwillingness to compromise and a lot of bad luck sadly meant that he never crossed over into the mainstream like other Corman proteges like Coppola and Demme. Too bad because 'The Shooting' and 'TwoLane Blacktop' showed he had talent and originality to burn. Both movies feature the legendary character actor Warren Oates 'The Wild Bunch' 'Dillinger' 'Race With The Devil' 'Drum' 'Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia' and Oates fans MUST see this movie as his performance is simply superb. Oates plays G.T.O. a drifter and dreamer who challenges two young revheads played by James Taylor and The Beach Boys' Dennis Wilson to a cross country car race. The winner gets the other drivers pink slip and possibly the affections of The Girl played by the late Laurie Bird who only made two movies after this one and who tragically suicided in her mid twenties. Taylor Wilson and Bird all give low key almost nonperformances. None were actors before they filmed this but their minimalistic styles suit the material wonderfully. By contrast Oates is just dynamite and dominates every scene he appears in. I'd say this and Peckinpah's cult classic 'Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia' are his two most impressive performances. It's worth watching this movie just to see Oates but there's a lot more going for it. It is however an acquired taste and if you aren't a fan of 1970s movies you may find it hard going. Please persevere it's really worth it! Also keep an eye out for Harry Dean Stanton's unforgettable cameo as a lonely hitchhiker. Stanton had previously worked with Hellman in 'Ride In The Whirlwind' alongside Jack Nicholson and Cameron Mitchell and would go on to appear with Oates and Laurie Bird in Hellman's next movie the controversial 'Cockfighter' another difficult one to get hold of until now. 'TwoLane Blactop' is one of the best movies I've ever seen and I can't recommend it highly enough! An American classic. It's pure magic!".

The brilliant Warren Oates is the star of the show as 'G.T.O' the driver of a bright yellow 1970 Pontiac G.T.O who passes a 1955 Chevy driven by 'The Driver' musician James Taylor who is accompanied by 'The Mechanic' former Beach Boy Dennis Wilson and a hitchhiker they pick up 'The Girl' Laurie Bird.

TwoLane Blacktop is not just about the race between a 1955 Chevy and a 1970 Pontiac. And that's probably why the movie meanders seemingly aimlessly in places as if in a trance. It's not a racing movie. It doesn't try to be a tight gripping thriller. In that light the sometimes slow pacing becomes part of what defines the movie. It feels more like some sort of existential journey through 70's America. But the beauty and Hellman's talent is that he refuses the easy way out of obvious allegories the kind of which Jarmusch used in Dead Man. Things are pretty much open and left for interpretation. But as the two cars cross country on their way to Washington D.C. Hellman captures the zeitgeist of the times in a unique way. I don't know how this slice of Americana looks in the eyes of Americans but for a European like me it paints the country in the same mythic colours Sergio Leone's movies did. The difference being this is not a reconstruction of a time and era seen through the eyes of a fascinated European director but real locations and people. In any way TwoLane Blacktop is closer to Vanishing Point than Gone in 60 Seconds. A superb road movie on all counts and more than a road movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Easy Rider two bikers are in search of American as they travel from coast to coast. The lead biker even calls himself Captain America. In TwoLane Blacktop two car freaks one a mechanic the other a driver speed across the nation in search of what? Cars to race? Their trip turns into a crosscountry race between their 55 Chevy and a GTO. How the driver of the GTO played by Warren Oates got the car depends on which of his stories the viewer believes. The revelation at the end of the film may possibly be the truth.This film by existentialist director Monte Hellman who later helped produce Quentin Tarantino's seminal Reservoir Dogs is an important one. The dialog and acting are minimal only one of the leads is a professional actor Warren Oates. The others are two recording artists James Taylor of Fire and Rain fame and Dennis Wilson from The Beach Boys and a flower child Laurie Bird who tragically committed suicide in Art Garfunkel's apartment a few years later ironically Garfunkel had helped Paul Simon sing the hit I've gone to look for America. The only other professional actor in the movie that this viewer recognized was Harry Dean Stanton who played the homosexual Oklahoma hitchhiker. This gives the film a more realistic feel and adds to the minimalism of the script and direction. The abrupt ending is a bit disconcerting but after a few viewings it makes more sense.In Easy Rider the rock music was an integral part of the story. The soundtrack is one of the best ever. The music in TwoLane Blacktop serves as mere background kept so low that at times it's difficult to hear. There's a wild version of Hit the Road Jack by Jerry Lee Lewis who pumps the keyboard so fast that at times it sounds as if the keys are leaving the piano. The first rock song about racing Chuck Berry's Maybelline is also heard at one point. It's hard for the listener to discern if Berry wrote the song about a woman or about a car. Otherwise the music corresponds with the simplicity of the rest of the flick.The existential humor is easy to miss on the first viewing. GTO confesses to Mechanic and Driver that he is tired of picking up fantasies. Another part of the film has Driver asking Mechanic a question. Mechanic tells Driver to pull over and stop because it will take him a while to explain. When Driver stops it takes Mechanic only one sentence to give him his answer.The viewer needs to watch TwoLane Blacktop several times to get its full impact. The time is not wasted for the true believer.".

	schema:headline " Route 666";
	schema:reviewBody "Nostalgic of late 60s and early 70s American culture this film is hard to come to grips with. At face value it's nothing more than a poorly plotted road trip across the U.S. Southwest as two guys and a girl in a 1950's hotrod race a guy named G.T.O Warren Oates in his yellow muscle car.The film's concept is a little like that of the early 1960's TV series Route 66. But the approach here is totally different. Director Monte Hellman designed TwoLane Blacktop as if it were a docudrama. Dialogue is minimal and not canned camera work is unobtrusive with very long camera takes none of the actors wear makeup nonactors play bit parts there are minimal plot contrivances and so far as I could determine there are no indoor movie sets. As such the film reminds me of Woodstock 1970.That's both good and bad. Lack of acting experience renders James Taylor and Dennis Wilson more natural than what could be expected with trained actors. It's bad because neither Dennis Wilson nor James Taylor could act and their entertainment quotient is zilch. In performances the film thus bears a striking resemblance to Zabriskie Point 1970.For the above reasons a lot of viewers will not like this film. The plot such as it is is super slow and the performances are drab. And there are no special effects to function as distractions. So ...What you have in TwoLane Blacktop is a 1970's arthouse film. What it lacks in entertainment value the film makes up for with its heavyduty philosophical and existential themes. An economy of language wherein nothing in the film is explained the tacit praise of the prosaic and the almost stifling trust in the present moment all speak to the human heart as the voice of nihilistic romanticism. There is no freedom here no escape no change nor redemption. The landscape horizon never gets closer. It's the myth of freedom and the embrace of alienation. No matter how far you travel you never actually arrive. It's the journey that matters on the devil's highway. But that's life.".

	schema:reviewBody "A good friend of mine is an insanely obsessed carfreak. One day he turned on his TV and popped a DVD into the player and we watched Two Lane Blacktop. I'm not into cars at all but I was transfixed by this movie. When it was all over I didn't find it overly existential or pretentious or confusing or boring in the slightest. I saw it as a very simple yet compelling story Two men live for only one thing racing their car which has been stripped down to its barest essentials in order to give it maximum speed. Things like heaters and rear seats have been removed... steel has been replaced with fiberglass. And as they have done with their car they have stripped away all extraneous elements from their lives and from their very selves. They have no need for conversation or music or for love or anger or any other emotion for that matter. They're cold and dehumanized. As they make their way across the landscape they meet an older man who has lost his life and identity and is desperately searching for new ones. Most important they are joined by a girl who wants only one thing human contact. As I saw it the central point of the story is how she affects the men one of them more than the others. I believe this explains the notoriously ambiguous ending. It isn't a perfect film by any means. Laurie Bird's neophyte status is painfully obvious in some of her scenes. At times this film may be too subtle and understated for its own good. It seems that some of the most important and basic plot elements are left to the viewer to infer. Then again this may again be part of the stripped down theme that is so prevalent throughout. Whatever the case it's an incredibly unique and very haunting film. I can certainly understand that it isn't for everyone. Two Lane Blacktop is actually much like 2001 A Space Odyssey in that respect some will inevitably regard it as boring and pointless. Others will for lack of a less elitist and arrogant term get it. I heartily recommend that everyone sees it for themselves at least once and find out which group you belong to.".

	schema:reviewBody "TwoLane Blacktop 1971 is a cult road film starring James Taylor in his only film appearance Dennis Wilson of Beach Boys fame Warren Oates fresh from his career making appearance in Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch Harry Dean Stanton in a memorable cameo as a homosexual hitchhiker and Laurie Bird whose short life and career would be capped tragically by suicide in her boyfriend Art Garfunkel's apartment.In many respects TwoLane Blacktop holds up better than the much more celebrated Easy Rider released a year or two earlier. Whereas Easy Rider is seriously dated by drug glorification psychedelic imagery hair styles clothing fashions and heavyhanded antiestablishment politics Two Lane ties more deeply and less topically into the American Romantic tradition begun by Walt Whitman and reinvented in the 1950s by Jack Kerouac and the Beats. As in Kerouac's On the Road the journey across America that structures Two Lane is both a quest to grasp the huge American landscape and a thrust at freedom from the restraints of modern civilization as expressed through the car culture and youthful rebellion born in the 1950s and burgeoning in the 1960s. As director Monte Hellman suggests on the Criterion DVD release Two Lane Blacktop despite its official release date is the last movie of the 1960s.The souped up 1955 Chevy driven by Taylor and tended to by his mechanic sidekick Wilson is the film's central symbol for the Romantic notion of burning with a white hot flame. You can never go fast enough. Similarly travel on mythic Route 66 back from West to East is a reversalrenewal of the path followed in the founding of the country. Yet none of the principal characters actually make it back to Washington D. C. New York or Florida  the three east coast locations variously mentioned as geographical goals. Their journey and ours leads into the rural backroads heart of the country leaving us there and making the next step in the journey open and unknown.In spirit and vision Two Lane has much in common with Breathless the defining work of the French New Wave. Like Godard's Bogieinspired Michel Two Lane's main characters adopt arbitrary identities  in their case racing hustlers and wandering free spirits. Like Michel too they impose an arbitrary meaning on their world. While his takes the form of petty thievery and sexual adventure theirs is a cross country race for pink slips. Yet the race is abandoned and even forgotten by film's end. Only life in the moment has any meaning once an end is glimpsed the quest is abandoned in favor of some new impulse.The film shares much else with the French New Wave as well especially its rejection of big budget studio formulas for structuring stories. The film was shot on location in sequence as the actors were actually making the cross country journey that the film was fictionalizing. There was a deliberate use of spontaneous and accidental event e.g. a rainstorm that wasn't scripted. To keep the actors in the present only the most experienced one of them Warren Oates was allowed to see the script. No use was made of makeup set design special effects or other accoutrements of the Hollywood system. The actors were youthful and inexperienced other than Oates and the plot such as it is is riddled with deliberate aimlessness and disproportion ending anticlimactically and with little or nothing resolved.In most ways Two Lane Blacktop is really an antiroad movie and those who watch it thinking they will be rewarded by exciting car races and sexual adventure are in for a big disappointment. Ultimately the film isn't about car racing at all but about defining one's self in an existential void. It's about living absolutely in the present in the here and now  with the past irrelevant and the future unknown. More than anything this extreme and unapologetic romantic bent is what makes Two Lane Blacktop such a pure and unforgettable expression of the 1960s.".

They also meet a guy in a Pontiac GTO. He's a typical used car salesman type of guy everything he says is cocky BS.Anyhow they decide to race this guy across the country to Washington D.C. Not much racing is really involved they spend most of their time sitting in diners. Eventually the girl takes off with some guy on a motorcycle. The guys are slightly bummed. The race to D.C. just sort of fizzles out the movie gets so bored with itself that it can't possibly continue so it ends.".

The Road has long been a metaphor for exploring life in America. But here we get a series of clichs about emptiness and alienation surrounding and including the ciphers that are the three main characters and little else. Now the film apparently wants to use these existential poses and narrow focus to say something Deep about America or if not America at least about something. There are of course allusive films that do invite a deeper probing. The trouble here is that Hellman's style is simply too minimalist to reach beyond it's own cramped narrative to a broader social or cultural context that would provide the kind of meaning the movie's apparently reaching for. As a result the film ends ironically as a kind of character study of three empty characters and as a Rohrschach test for those intrigued by style over substance. Two Lane may be a cult film to many especially to the Warren Oates fan club and to those who confuse seriousness with results. But there's a reason Easy Rider still defines the time period while Two Lane has become grist for a What Does It Mean study group.

Withdrawn from circulation because it uses the Door's Moonlight Driveand you know how picky the Lizard King could be about commercial rights. Just ask his former band mates. His estate has taken Jim's last wishes to the letter. Only recently have they consented to allow the releasing of the film on DVD.They would have been doing us all a great favor if they had declined consent. Although I was hoping for the best I had a feeling this would turn out to be a turkey. But I never expected it to be quite such a Butterball.I think if I were teaching a class on how to make a pretentious movie I would no doubt point to this film. There's something pathetic in its attempt at the mythic including the names of its characters such as The Driver The Mechanic and The Girl. At one point The Driver refers to The Girl by her name Higgins and one can't help but wonder how he learned her name and why if she had a name it wasn't used throughout the script. It was another case of being jarred loose from the film but by that time I had been jarred so many times I was beginning to feel like last season's apricots.This is not a good example of a road movie. See Easy Rider Vanishing Point Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Anything but this.One star for location shooting in Santa Fe which hasn't changed much since the early seventies. Another star for using Moonlight Drive a personal favorite of mine. And a third and final star for some nice cinematography of the open road.Beware the myth.".

While I may not be one of those who proclaims it to be the greatest movie ever filmed it is certainly a fine piece of American cinema. I'm not sure I've ever seen a film quite like it. That's because there aren't many directors out there like Monte Hellman with the guts or patience to make something like TwoLane Blacktop. For starters the cast includes nonactors in three of the four main roles. I think all do a wonderful job and their lack of experience James Taylor being the best example actually worked in the movie's favor. The fourth actor Warren Oates gives another amazing performance. Next Hellman made a 102 minute movie that has about 15 minutes of dialogue. But you know what it doesn't need any more. Taylor as The Driver and Dennis Wilson as The Mechanic don't need to talk. Their car does all the talking for them. And when they do talk except for a rare poignant moment near the end of the film when The Driver shows a hint of humanity their conversations revolve around carburetors and such. Anyway Oates' character GTO does enough talking for everyone. Hellman also made a movie with so little action other than a few race scenes that some people look at it and see nothing. I don't know how many comments I've read that call TwoLane Blacktop boring or dull. I see a lot going on in the movie but I think it's either too subtle for some people or they don't have the patience to just go along with it. The movie can most likely be interpreted a number of ways but to me TwoLane Blacktop is the story of four people on a journey. For The Driver and The Mechanic they may have found what they're looking for in their car. The thrill of the next race and the challenge of the next tuneup are all that matters to them. As for GTO he's looking for his life. He spins wild tales hoping one will stick. And The Girl is looking for someone to take care of her. The Driver The Mechanic and GTO are nice enough but all are so into their own reality that they are incapable of giving The Girl what she needs. Finally I've read all the charges that TwoLane Blacktop has no ending. I'll argue that it ends the only way it could. Just because the movie's over it doesn't mean that any of the four characters have finished their quests. They started the movie looking for something and they end it the same way. I'll stop there. I just hope my ramblings aren't quite as incoherent as they seem. In the end I can easily see why this movie's not for everyone but for me TwoLane Blacktop works  and works well. It's an amazing experience that I'm glad I finally had . For what it's worth I'll give it a 810. That rating will most likely go up after a repeat viewing now that I know what to expect.".

The film is full of style and wit basically a comment on the culture of the time when men judged each other very much the way they judged their cars. I had heard of Monte Hellman from a friend and I'm glad I decided to rent this film. Hellman shoots for style while keeping his screen compositions simple. The film is very subversive and sneaks around like a prowling cat. I fell for the characters especially GTO but I never really understood the drifter played by Laurie Bird. She comes into the film unexpected and tries every way to get away and just when you think she's gone from the picture she reappears. I felt she was in the way. There is also a small performance from Harry Dean Stanton that is endearing. This is a treasure for independant film makers as the film was made for very low cost.

Unfortunately there's little or no substance to this film and its mostly a waste of time.I suppose it could be compared to Easy Rider but its only a superficial comparison. Both are road movies that reek of 60s excess but for a number of reasons Easy Rider succeeds where Two Lane Blacktop fails.Firstly this movie is roughly 90 minutes long. However there's only about 15 minutes of dialog at most. That means that for most of the film absolutely nothing is happening. Sure people sit in diners stand around fix or drive cars but that's about it. And unfortunately the novice acting skills of James Taylor and Dennis Wilson aren't enough to make up for this lack of anything occurring. I can't recall when I've seen a movie more badly in need of a plot.On the positive side however there are some lovely visuals in this movie. In fact if it were simply an American travelogue I'd probably enjoy it a lot more. But as it stands this movie is pretty much a nonevent.The ending is particularly weak. The first time I saw this movie was at an art house kind of theater and I literally thought the projector had broken so abrupt was the ending.

Only Warren Oates as G.T.O. supplies his usual charisma and mystery to the proceedings but it builds to nothing and accounts for little.

There are some interesting moments and minor characters that a David Lynch might appreciate but Hellman refuses to capitalize on them preferring to meander to an entropic arbitrary ending. Dated cold and not very involving.";

	schema:reviewBody "Two dragracers named The Driver James Taylor and The Mechanic Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson travel across America looking for quick money racing their soupedup '55 Chevy. They pick up a hitch hiker The Girl Laurie Bird who they both form a strange attraction to. Meanwhile a lonely and quite desperate man drives his Pontiac GTO played by Warren Oates and comes across the two and they agree a race to Washington D.C. for pink slips. While this is the overlying focus of the film TwoLane Blacktop is more of an existential odyssey across 1970's America following a group of misfit characters drifting through an increasingly alien landscape.Very much a mood piece TwoLane Blacktop can now be viewed as a key film of 1970's American filmmaking encompassing the feelings of both the young and the ageing. This is pure Americana  we see the beautiful desolation of Route 66 roadside diners dusty gas stations and empty onehorse towns. There is minimal dialogue but with frames and characters so beautifully empty there is no need. The landscape tells the story. The open road was the focus of many films of the late 1960's and early 70's many of them misconstrued as simply carporn. Films such as Easy Rider 1969 and Vanishing Point 1971 channelled feelings of anger and the longing for freedom that were brought on by events such as the Kent State massacre in 1970 causing a generation gap and the isolation of youth.Not to say there isn't carporn on show here  the '55 Chevy is rusty and ugly but the growl it gives out when revved is invigorating. The majority of the races and driving scenes are shot from the interior allowing us to hear every mechanical clank and gearchange. But the main focus is on the characters. The Driver and Mechanic say little but tell their story with their eyes. They live for their car and care for little else. Although the Driver clearly has feelings for the Girl he does little to truly act upon it and therefore causes her to experience loneliness and the feeling of being used. But the most fascinating is GTO played to perfection by the everreliable Oates. We see him at the start of the film telling the same story twice to one of the many hitch hikers he picks up. He acts out of desperation reaching out to anyone who will listen. It's a painful portrayal of a very human character.Not a second is wasted in the film. Director Monte Hellman captures every single sound and feeling out of the most mundane situations and we are therefore transported back to 1971 America. It is almost as if the film is about absolutely nothing and maybe that's the point. These characters seem to be speeding to an unknown goal that will always be out of reach. Maybe they know it and maybe they don't but as long as they get to drive they're happy. An outstanding piece of 70's cinema.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

I expected 'Motel Hell' to disappoint for that reason but much to my surprise I found it was an extremely enjoyable mixture of black humour and genuinely creepy scenes. One of the reasons the movie works so well is because of the excellent casting choice of Hollywood veteran Rory Calhoun in the lead role of eccentric farmer and Motel manager Vincent Smith.  Calhoun was best known for his Westerns though he made one of two genre movies in his long career including the very silly 'Night Of The Lepus' and the nutty 'Hell Comes To Frogtown'. 'Motel Hell' is quite different to those two and mostly played straight which makes it all the more effective. Calhoun is well supported by the less well known Nancy Parsons 'Porky's' as his equally unbalanced sister. I really liked 'Motel Hell' a lot and highly recommend it to viewers with a sick sense of humour. Fans of early Tobe Hooper movies or some of Garth Ennis' comics will especially appreciate it. This movie is a lot of fun! Dig in!".

	schema:reviewBody "Kevin Connor's Motel Hell is a tremendously fun and engaging horror comedy impossible not to love in my humble opinion. Right from the opening sequences the film sells itself as a lightheaded and blackly humorous gem that spoofs some of the genre's biggest classics without ever disrespecting them. The references towards milestones like Psycho and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are obvious but unlike many haters of Motel Hell claim this is certainly not a rip off! I don't think you can compare the clearly humorous premise of this film which handles about cultivating human beings to mix the meat with pork with dead serious stories like the above mentioned Psycho or TCM. Rory Calhoun usually a western star is terrifically cast as the traditional and likable Farmer Vincent who's a local demigod in his county thanks to his uniquely flavored homemade smoked ham recipe. Of course nobody knows that Vincent and his sister Ida are totally insane and extract their secret ingredients from nothing less than people who they plant in their garden. This simply is campy entertainment very tongueincheek fastpaced and with a couple of adorably gross makeup effects. Connor's directing is solid and he makes excellent use of the typically eerie redneck stereotypes such as the clumsy sheriff and the barbaric farmers. The chainsawbattle sequence during the finale is a real hoot. Highly recommended for horror fans who don't take themselves too seriously.".

	schema:headline " An underrated and fun horror comedy!";
	schema:reviewBody "The distinctive taste of Farmer Vincent's Rory Calhoun prime meats is renowned in the farmer's rural area. In fact people come from far and wide to sample his uniquely delicious meat treats. The only real question is why is there rarely anyone staying in his nearby motel and yet the No Vacancy' sign is usually on? Motel Hell' is a fun and somewhat graphic parody of films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' 1974 and The Last House on the Left' 1972. By sparingly using shock tactics and graphic effects Motel Hell' plays up the more satirical aspect and keeps the viewer interested and entertained. In fact the movie easily equals the number of shocking moments with a variety of funny and charming sequences which range from heckling televangelists to a hilarious sendup of the lives of swingers. Viewers of Motel Hell' can be treated to a chainsaw duel possible influence for Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2' a garden of humans being prepared for harvesting cannibalism and a particularly stomachchurning conversation about smoking dogs. This movie is without a doubt one of the most underrated movies of its era and while not being as effective or enjoyable as ReAnimator' 1985 and Evil Dead 2' 1987 it remains an intelligent gruesome and witty horrorcomedy. Unfortunately the movie tends to drag a little shortly before the final sequences which can be slightly offputting. However the highly enjoyable and eventful ten minutes more than make up for this brief lapse and round the film off almost perfectly. Rory Calhoun without a shadow of a doubt steals the show with his portrayal of the deranged yet surprisingly pleasant Vincent. Some adept scripting from Robert and StevenCharles Jaffe give his murderous character a somewhat pleasant and appealing personality. The viewer can only laugh at the Godfearing persona that Vincent possesses as he talks about the creative and artistic way he catches stray humans to mix in with his meat. Rory is brilliantly accompanied by Nancy Parsons in the role of his overweight and slightly dimwitted sister Ida. One could even question whether Ida is supposed to be a female and slightly more intelligent version of TCM's Leatherface. The rarely seen and beautiful actress Nina Axelrod is also delightful in her role as Terry a young woman who was caught in but survived one of Vincent's devious traps. Unfortunately the scripting for the character of Terry was rather poor and it becomes hard for the viewer to connect with her. However given the material she had to work with Nina put in an impressive performance and when required added greatly to the humorous aspect of the movie. One cannot also neglect to mention Paul Linke who plays Vincent's much younger brother Sheriff Bruce Smith. Linke's performance although the weakest of the main actors is still enjoyable and provides both a villain and a hero in one. Kevin Connor's direction was of a particularly high standard although it seemed basic during the opening portions of the movie. Connor managed to capture the devilish yet fun atmosphere of the script and worked in all of the clever references to other movies seamlessly. These references in addition to those already mentioned included a captivating comedic illustration of Night of the Living Dead' 1968 and Zombie Holocaust which was released in Italy earlier the same year. Motel Hell' is probably worth watching for horrorcomedy fans though do not expect another Evil Dead 2'. Thanks to some usually good scripting above average performances and some truly sidesplitting situations Motel Hell' succeeds at what it sets out to be  great fun for cheesy horror lovers! My rating for Motel Hell'  710.".

Director Kevin Connor got that part all figured out and thus MOTEL HELL can be regarded as a successful horrorcomedy mixture. It also manages to give a big nod to THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE by paying homage to it and making fun of it as opposed to what some people might think MOTEL HELL is not a TCMripoff. I even suspect Tobe Hooper might have found some inspiration in MOTEL HELL for his endbattle in TCM 2 between Dennis Hopper and Leatherface.The cinematography and cameramovements are surprisingly decent for this rather lowbudget flick as well as some makeup effects I loved it when the camera slowly travels through the dark livingroom only to reveal Nancy Parsons hiding behind the door holding a big knife at the end of the travelshot. It's best that you know nothing about the story but then again knowing that it's about a farmer running a hotel does say a lot doesn't it. Farmer Vincent Smith sure redefines the word agriculture. There isn't very much gore to admire but the idea alone is sick enough to satisfy any horrorfan. The story itself is fun and has a satisfying climax. I only had one problem with the motivations of Nina Axelrod's character. Why wasn't she more upset about her dead boyfriend? Why did she stay with the Smiths anyway? Didn't she have places to go or weren't there friends and family waiting for her? But I guarantee you'll soon forget those questions when she provides some welcome nudity.So MOTEL HELL has black humor demented farmers and a creepy motel. That makes up for a good movie I'd say.".

	schema:headline " This Early Slasher Film is Fun Enough I Guess";
	schema:reviewBody "Here's a nice bit of early slasher fun with all the usual trimmings psychotic hillbillies bizarre murders a clueless cop a hot blonde anduhmjerky? Farmer Vincent and his sister Ida run a motel on the outskirts of town famous for it's homemade meat fritters. What the unsuspecting townspeople don't know is that Vincent and Ida lure travelers and passersby into traps and they disappear as part of the garden where the victims are left to wait until good and ready to become Vincent's next batch of meat treats. One night Vincent takes out a motorcycle carrying a man and his girlfriend the man is relegated to the garden but Vincent takes a shine to the girl and with the help of his sister nurses her back to health. The girl Terry is frightened at first but begins to open up to the oddball backwoods duo. Problems arise when Vincent falls in love with Terry and hopes to introduce her to his secret meat recipes while Ida stews in jealousy of Vincent's shifting affections. The only person who can save Terry from these maniacs is Sheriff Bruce Smith Vincent's brother and an ignorant putz who probably shouldn't be left in charge of policing others. So yeah I guess she's pretty much doomed to become one of Farmer Vincent's fritters.MOTEL HELL is a cheap little throwaway horror film from the early '80s. The story is simple yet strange the characters are exaggerated and the story is just what you'd expect. The whole plot of planting his victims in his garden and turning them into fritters is pretty cool and the guttural noises screeched from the garden's inhabitants is probably the most stomachchurning aspect of the movie. Well that's not entirely true. Ida Nancy Parsons freaks me out. I guess it's a combination of her deepset eyes childish pigtails overalls and that nasal squealing voice. Add to that the fact that her character is a simpleminded fool with no qualms against murder and she just weirds me out from the first time we meet her. Farm Vincent on the other hand has the complete opposite effect. He reminds me way too much of Bob Barker. Seriouslyhe looks like him and sounds like him. Instead of promoting pet population control through spaying and neutering he eats them. Rory Calhoun is way too charming to be an effective villain. Farmer Vincent shouldn't be murdering people and serving them in jerky form he should be hosting his own children's show. It's all good until the final confrontation in which Vincent completely loses his mind but his final lines in the film are probably the absolute best. Nina Axelrod is hot as victim Terry but not much elseher character's not the sharpest knife in the shed and Paul Linke is the embarrassment that is Sheriff Smith. You know everything you need to know about the Sheriff when we first meet him. He speeds up Vincent's motel with sirens blaring and lights flashing lurches to a stop and puts on his policegame face topop in and say hello. He's not smart and he's not tough it's a miracle he's not dead in the first fifteen minutes.The movie's pretty predictable and follows a few of the usual horror movie conventions. If someone shows up and exhibits negative behavior e.g. sexual deviance drug use etc. chances are they're going to end up as part of Vincent's garden. What annoyed me was that the whole Farmer Vincent's fritters plot was put on the backburner for the majority of the movie so it could focus on Terry's involvement. I wasn't interested in a love triangle I wanted more cannibalism and horror! It's a fun movie regardless even if it does wander off track. I'm sure any horror fan will find something they like about this movie but I don't expect to find it on anyone's topten lists.".

	onyx:emotionText "Here's a nice bit of early slasher fun with all the usual trimmings psychotic hillbillies bizarre murders a clueless cop a hot blonde anduhmjerky? Farmer Vincent and his sister Ida run a motel on the outskirts of town famous for it's homemade meat fritters. What the unsuspecting townspeople don't know is that Vincent and Ida lure travelers and passersby into traps and they disappear as part of the garden where the victims are left to wait until good and ready to become Vincent's next batch of meat treats. One night Vincent takes out a motorcycle carrying a man and his girlfriend the man is relegated to the garden but Vincent takes a shine to the girl and with the help of his sister nurses her back to health. The girl Terry is frightened at first but begins to open up to the oddball backwoods duo. Problems arise when Vincent falls in love with Terry and hopes to introduce her to his secret meat recipes while Ida stews in jealousy of Vincent's shifting affections. The only person who can save Terry from these maniacs is Sheriff Bruce Smith Vincent's brother and an ignorant putz who probably shouldn't be left in charge of policing others. So yeah I guess she's pretty much doomed to become one of Farmer Vincent's fritters.MOTEL HELL is a cheap little throwaway horror film from the early '80s. The story is simple yet strange the characters are exaggerated and the story is just what you'd expect. The whole plot of planting his victims in his garden and turning them into fritters is pretty cool and the guttural noises screeched from the garden's inhabitants is probably the most stomachchurning aspect of the movie. Well that's not entirely true. Ida Nancy Parsons freaks me out. I guess it's a combination of her deepset eyes childish pigtails overalls and that nasal squealing voice. Add to that the fact that her character is a simpleminded fool with no qualms against murder and she just weirds me out from the first time we meet her. Farm Vincent on the other hand has the complete opposite effect. He reminds me way too much of Bob Barker. Seriouslyhe looks like him and sounds like him. Instead of promoting pet population control through spaying and neutering he eats them. Rory Calhoun is way too charming to be an effective villain. Farmer Vincent shouldn't be murdering people and serving them in jerky form he should be hosting his own children's show. It's all good until the final confrontation in which Vincent completely loses his mind but his final lines in the film are probably the absolute best. Nina Axelrod is hot as victim Terry but not much elseher character's not the sharpest knife in the shed and Paul Linke is the embarrassment that is Sheriff Smith. You know everything you need to know about the Sheriff when we first meet him. He speeds up Vincent's motel with sirens blaring and lights flashing lurches to a stop and puts on his policegame face topop in and say hello. He's not smart and he's not tough it's a miracle he's not dead in the first fifteen minutes.The movie's pretty predictable and follows a few of the usual horror movie conventions.

In that respect the movie won't disappoint. It's typical brain candy with sardonic comments and a nerdy hero.

The storyline starts off deceptively simply and slowly builds in complexity until a frenetic climax explodes all over the viewer.  It is virtually impossible to try and explain the plot to someone because it simply has too many twists and turns.This movie is an unusual one for Ms. Tripplehorne in that she plays a glamorous Grace KellyMarilyn Monroeesque movie star instead of her usual supporting actress role.  I thought it was a lovely change and she did a stunning job capturing the mannerisms and acting style of the era.  The little movie clip of her and Don Lucas in the preposterously titled 'A Kiss in the Dark' was so very bad Casablanca that I just had to laugh.The story progressed beautifully with little touches of absurdity in just the right places such as the poor unfortunate maid walking read 'running' the dogs across the manor grounds.  And because good comedy comes in threes we see her three times throughout the movie.But for me the real winner in this movie is Colin Firth's role as Peter the ubiquitous nephewinresidence.  His lines are delivered beautifully but it is his facial expressions and soft unspoken mimicry of Miranda Frayle that really clinch it.  His smartaleck remarks are tempered with just enough Britishness to keep them from being outright obnoxious.  It's lovely to see him in a role that must have been so much fun.On the whole I thought the movie was marvelous.  It's full of deliciously sketched characters masterfully crafted dialogue very effective camera work beautiful costumes and props and of course ridiculous coincidences that serve to drive the plot towards its inevitable conclusion.  A great movie to enjoy yourself and also to recommend to your mother or anyone else with discriminating taste.".

Sophie Thompson steals the dinner scene and just about every other one she is in. This is a fabulous literate comedy of manners with everyone spoton with their characters. Every time I watch it I find something clever witty and subtle that I missed the previous time. Just sit back and have fun watching all the stereotypes get skewered.".

Colin Firth one of my favorites was never better. Julie Andrews as always was wonderful. But the cast was uniformly good a perfect ensemble acting tour de force. My only quibble was Julie Andrews' atrocious costumes  good grief were they AWFUL  wrong colors wrong cuts wrong everything. At least finally in the last scene her outfit was attractive but all through the film I groaned every time Andrews entered the scene with another positively awful costume. Geez! In a major production such as this you would think they would have a designer who understood color and line. But everything else in the film was great. In fact Jeanne Tripplehorn appears at the end in one of the most beautiful outfits I have ever seen in film  a bright yellow pantsuit that is sublime. She looked fantastic throughout the film. William Baldwin truly looked like the most popular movie star in the world the character he played. And with Tripplehorn they were a smashing pair. Romance everywhere!".

It's set in England in the 1950ies where an English lord takes his bride a famous American actress home to mother Lady Marshwood great Julie Andrews. The trouble starts when it's discovered that the maid of the Lady is the sister of the actress and she discovers that the American actress is lying. There's even more trouble when the exlover of the actress flies to England to win her back. Sounds confusing? Not at all. It is great fun to watch Julie Andrews and Colin Firth as her posh nephew plotting together but always having a smile on their face and pretending that everything is good the way it is.

However the situation soon becomes even more complicated when Nigel plans to bring Miranda to meet his aristocratic family only for the family's maid Moxie Sophie Thompson to announce that Miranda is in fact her sister! Throw in Miranda's costar and former lover Don Lucas William Baldwin who is coming to England to try and stop the marriage and Colin Firth and Stephen Fry as respectively Nigel's cousin Peter and the family butler Crestwell and the stage is set for a fine comedy!I loved this film  it did remind me somewhat of another Noel Coward adaptation  Easy Virtue which like Relative Values also starred Colin Firth and which also featured the son of an uppercrust English family bringing his vivacious American girlfriend to meet his relatives but the films play out quite differently I loved easy Virtue too.All the cast were excellent  in particular Thompson Andrews and Firth. Stephen Fry was playing a role which could have been written for him and although he is one of the supporting rather than main cast members he certainly makes the most of his screen time. Baldwin is also very funny as the often drunk Lucas who throws a spanner in the works of Miranda's plan to transform herself from a starlet to a Lady of the Manor. And Moxie who is transformed from a maid into a wealthy family friend so that Miranda won't recognise her is the centre of one of the funniest scenes when Moxie gets drunk to try and overcome her fear at meeting her sister who she hasn't seen for some 20 years. Colin Firth is just adorable as Peter  it could have been a nothing role in the wrong actor's hands but Firth is perfect.The plot itself is rather daft  why didn't they just tell Miranda that her sister was working for the family rather than try and cover up the fact and surely Miranda would have recognised her own sister! but I think that it's just something that you need to go with accept and enjoy. Overall this was a very funny and hugely delightful film. At just under one and a half hours it never gets boring the cast is topnotch and I would certainly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Relative Values was never given a Broadway production during the lifetime of Noel Coward. It only made it there in 1986 thirteen years after Noel died. But in the original British production the star was the formidable Gladys Cooper. She's in the role of Duchess of Marchwood so Julie Andrews had some big shoes to fill.I'll have to say that Andrews did it good style and a British production of even a second line Noel Coward work is better than a lot that is around. What I found interesting that with his various trips across the pond Coward felt comfortable enough to put some American characters in his work.Andrews is the mother of Edward Atterton who is a well known jet setting playboy who always comes home to mother especially when things go spectacularly bad or good. Depending on your point of view he arrives home with American movie star Jeanne Tripplehorn in tow who is on the rebound from a breakup. They're going to be married a fact that does not please mother.Neither does it please William Baldwin who is an action film star of the era late Forties when the play was written. He's who Tripplehorn is on the rebound from and he wants her back. He knows full well that Tripplehorn would be bored to tears as the lady of the manor in training in the quiet English countryside.Add to all of that Sophia Thompson is personal maid to Andrews and she's Tripplehorn's long lost sister. It all comes to a head when Tripplehorn starts spouting off the invented studio biography where Thompson who has a fake status of her own for the occasion just explodes and these two have a cat fight to beat all.Observing all this are butler Stephen Fry and cousin Colin Firth who seems to be a permanent house guest. They get the lion's share of the Coward wit in the dialog. This is Coward who was the pet of the English society. But Coward's third voice in the film is that of Thompson. Coward came from some pretty humble background and she also might very well be modeled on Coward's good friend from adolescence Gertrude Lawrence who also came from most modest means.Relative Values was a pleasure to see because other than his really acclaimed work like Blithe Spirit or Private Lives too little of Coward is played today. We could certainly use some of his wit now. I often wonder what Coward would have made of some of the events of the last forty years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Noel Coward was probably Britain's most successful dramatist during the late twenties and thirties and became immensely popular during the war when his patriotic songs plays and film scripts helped to keep up national morale. In the fifties however his popularity waned his type of drawingroom comedies seemed increasingly dated artificial and mannered. Along with Terence Rattigan and N.C. Hunter he came to represent the sort of middleclass theatre that John Osborne and the other Angry Young Men were reacting against.Relative Values written in the early fifties is a typical Coward comedy of manners and social class. A young aristocrat Nigel Earl of Marshwood announces his engagement to a glamorous film star named Miranda Frayle. Nigel's imperious mother the dowager Countess is vehemently opposed to the marriage in her eyes it is simply not the done thing for aristocrats to marry members of the acting profession particularly if they come from humble social origins. Contrary to what has been stated elsewhere however she is not prejudiced against Miranda because she is American. Although Miranda sounds American she is actually British by birth. In any case it had long been acceptable for young American women if wealthy and from good families to marry into the British aristocracy. Winston Churchill for example was born in the 1870s to an American mother Jennie Jerome and the Churchills are an even grander family than the one shown in this film.Two further complications arise. First it turns out that Miranda is actually the longlost sister of the Countess's maid Moxie. Second Miranda has been followed to England by her former boyfriend Don Lucas another film star who still has hopes of rekindling their relationship. Lucas represents what was during this period a fairly common stereotype of Americans in Britain especially in the upperclass circles among which Coward moved. He is a rough diamond outwardly vulgar and lacking in social graces but inwardly fairly decent and goodhearted.He is in fact one of the few decent people in the play. The Countess for all her gracious manners and social polish is a crashing snob. Nigel is spoilt and selfish and Miranda is little better. Whereas Nigel and his mother are straightforward snobs Miranda is an inverted one who claims to have had a deprived povertystricken childhood in the East End of London much to Moxie's disgust as the family are actually from the respectably middleclass dormitory town of Sidcup. At this period in fact it was quite common for film stars not only to take a false name Miranda's real name is Freda Birch but also to invent a false lifestory for themselves Merle Oberon for example was actually born in Calcutta of AngloIndian descent but claimed all her life to be a native of Tasmania.Stephen Fry gives a nicely judged performance as the Earl's butler he speaks to his employer and the house guests with great formality and gravitas in an inchperfect upperclass accent but when speaking to his fellow servants reverts to his native Estuary English. Estuary English is the name given to the dialect of Kent where the film is set and Essex the counties immediately to the east of London. Julie Andrews is also good as the supercilious Countess but not all the other actors are as alert to the niceties of the British class system which is unfortunate as it is these niceties which are Coward's major preoccupation in this play. Neither Jeanne Tripplehorn as Miranda nor Sophie Thompson as Moxie for example seems credible as a native of Sidcup. Miranda sounds far too American with no hint of her English origins even though Britishborn Hollywood stars of this period such as Audrey Hepburn Deborah Kerr and Joan Collins normally kept their native accents. Moxie either speaks in an exaggerated fauxgenteel voice or else sounds exactly like the workingclass Cockney that she indignantly denies being.When I have seen Tripplehorn in the past I have always been surprised that such a glamorous actress should have spent so much of her career playing supporting roles in for example Basic Instinct or Sliding Doors. Here however she gets to play a leading role and I cannot really say that she makes the most of it. I was rather surprised to see Colin Firth one of Britain's major stars here playing a minor role as Nigel's cousin.The film has a rather dated feel to it this is the only one of Coward's plays to have been made into an Englishlanguage feature film since the sixties. Even when it was written this play represented an oldfashioned conservative kind of theatre and it was a rather odd choice to make it into a film some fifty years later. Like a lot of Coward's work it resists being updated to a later age so the filmmakers had no choice but to make it as a fifties period piece. The final result however is little more than an examination of outdated social conventions that noone really cares about any more. 510".

The story never really recovers from this astonishment because nothing more is made of this beyond some awkward comedy the movie star doesn't recognize her sister and once the maid reveals her true identity to the star the whole thing is shuffled aside and the movie becomes another of the kind of class comedy the Brits love so much.

	schema:reviewBody "Salaam Namaste is one of the lightest and boldest Hindi entertainers in recent years. It is on par with any wellmade Hollywood romcom. The film addresses two very controversial issues in India livein relationships and premarital pregnancy yet does not try to emphasise them or take them too seriously. It is brilliantly shot with great production values great cinematography light and beautiful songs and wellcast actors. The film is entirely shot in Australia and the various locations of Melbourne the sets and the beautiful landscapes are breathtaking and extremely pleasing to the eye. While it is a modern comedy it never forgets that it is actually a Hindi film and in the second half becomes loyal to its Bollywood standards. By the same token while it turns into a dramatic feature it never forgets to remain modern. The emotions of the film are reserved and not overly cheap. They are natural and consistently flavoured with great comedy.Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta are irreplaceable and their chemistry is fantastic. They are sensitive talented cool and modern actors who understand this foreign lifestyle. Saif's character is quite unsympathetic as he is portrayed as someone who does not want to take responsibility for his acts. Yet he displays the expected transformation into someone who finally understands his mistakes very well. Preity is quite the owner of the film though. Oozing charisma and sexappeal she is convincing charming and awfully attractive as the decisive moody and lively prankster Ambar. Her vivacity in the first half and her pain and hilarious hysterics in the second are excellently done. There are many memorable scenes in Salaam Namaste. First the kissing and love scenes between the leading actors are surprising and must be noted. I really liked the My Dil Goes Hmmm... song. The scenes when Nick and Ambar fight intensively are funny and wellacted. The scene when they meet at their friends' house and the subsequent Tu Jahaan song are moving. The entire birth scene is exciting and funny. But my favourite scene is the Ben and Jerry's Dark Belgian Chocolate ice cream one. This is one of the greatest acts of the film spontaneous and wholly entertaining. I recommend Salaam Namaste to everyone. It's not an extraordinary film but it's a spectacular and visually stunning romantic comedy for the entire family.".

But how are we going to have dance numbers when the heroine is pregnant?A Don't worry! Audience won't care. They come only to see the dance and songs. Nobody gives a damn even if she dances while giving birth to her baby.A I've got this gut feeling in last movie remember people loved the comedy. We have to have that in this movie too.S But its a serious movie. How can it have comedy?A Then arrange some part time TV actor. You know those anchors they can speak so much on the spot you don't even need to worry about writing dialogs for them.S Thats fine. How about the cast?A Lets see Preity is hot these day. See if we get dates from Preity else go for Rani. Male actor I don't think Shahrukh is that good after Swades. and Aamir just don't approach him he'll demand the goddamn script first.S Then how about Saif.A He'll do. Anything else?S We'll see that on the sets. Lets start working on it.".

I've an idea lets do a different kind of romantic movie.S What different?A How about if we make a modern day love story girl and boy both living outside India. That way we can also capture those NRI sentiments you know?S Whoa whoa. But that we have already seen in so many other movies lately. Need to add something more to it.A How about if the boy and the girl live together? S Livein relationships? Indian audience will never accept that.A Ha!

He makes you laugh more than a few times and he is brilliant. He is one of the few actors that have created a niche with the loverboy role and can actually pull it off. Preity Zinta does also an amazing job. She looks fresh and has updated her sexy status. She still has the same charm she had back with earlier roles which is fantastic I love her acting too its humorous and great fun to watch.Javed Jaffrey Abhishek Bachchan and Jugal Hansraj make up important but short appearances. I liked the way Abhishek narrated the story with each introduction of a new character the story paused and showed their history. It was very clever.Music is enjoyable  it has it all. A slow song a fast song a great title track a cheesy song...The end gets a bit dreary and tries hard to maintains the humour. There are times it works and times when it doesn't. Easier to understand when you see it.The director has done an excellent job I must admit Salaam Namaste is a great film with few flaws. The script music directing and acting are all fabulous. Siddharth Anand has proved himself in Indian Cinema and has made a fantastic very different film.Worth every minute.".

One could criticize that but on the other hand it's a hard film to dislike. The stars are wonderful together and Melbourne Australia is a major character the way New York often is. Living in Melbourne the main characters deal with certain issues that they might not face or would deal with differently had they stayed in India.

It tells the story of a girl and a guy who when they first talk don't like each other at all but with time they fall in love and move in together. It is set in Australia and the characters are Indian. The movie not only has a great story line but it also shows us a lot about the Indian culture. It has a few songs in it which are always fun. The movie has it all  i know that's cheesy  but it does! It is a great movie to have fun but it also has some really sad parts when you'll want to grab the tissues. It is amazing how many great movies there are out there but we don't realize it just because they aren't Hollywood. This kind of movie is great to have fun and it also teaches us a lot about another country's culture. I recommend everyone to watch it nobody will regret it... the acting is also pretty good it is harder to tell when you don't understand the language but it seemed decent. There are very funny lines and of course the occasional sad part. A great movie that everyone should be able to enjoy!".

Surprising again it is coming from country's No. 1 movie production factory. Debutant writerdirector Siddhartha Raj Anand tried to delve into a mature topic and somehow manages to hold interest till interval with his some witty smart oneliners and hilarious situations when the film is still finding its premise. He should be applauded for dealing with topic of sex before marriage without being pretentious. All that took care of metrobased multiplex and NRI audience. Lead characters are very similar to Hum Tum ones and supporting characters' introduction is very KHNH type. All supporting NRI characters are made buffoons. Guys are naughty and irresponsible and Girls are streetsmart today's woman. Oh please not again. Also when heroine cries there is a Ganpati idol in the foreground and a Alaap in the background score. Gimme a break ! Do new generation directors require all this ? Postinterval everything goes haywire when director gets into storytelling and tried to deal with too many themes and subplots without doing decent justice to even one of them. Thus you get to see extramarital relationship going sour pregnancy before marriage women liberation evolution of fatherhood in hero numerous forced situations to get couple back together and so many other done to death scenes and dialogs that film follows a very predictable path and ends at same common oftrepeated note. At one point film even goes to the territory of Kya Kehna. Worst of all is the climax based in an operation theater where giving birth situation is made a mockery and sequence is completely dedicated to gallery. Overall film could not rise above mediocre. Though performances are neat the subject requires a much younger couple and not the same repeated pair. At least Preity Zinta should be given some decent pregnancy costumes. Though Javed Jaffrey is a surprise packet keeping audience in splits and so is Arshad Warsi. Except first song rest all songs are forced. Now this is for the producers please pull up your socks before it is too late. Agreed that initial hype encouraging reviews and record no. of prints gets film terrific openings and it manages to cover itself under hit tag yet everyday is not Sunday. Better watch out !".

The scenes between Javed Jaffrey and his girlfriend. After a while it also got pretty irritating to hear words like Exactly and Sorry over and over again. The worst part of the movie was the ending. Abhishek Bacchan seemed totally unnecessary in the movie. I wonder what made him chose this role! The ending could have been a little more graceful and all the chaos in the hospital was totally unwanted and rather unpleasing to watch. Saif Arshad and Tania go a good job. Preity is also good but at times she does get pretty loud in the movie. I would give this movie a 5 out of 10... for acting credentials except Abhishek and Melbourne.".

Preity is also good but at times she does get pretty loud in the movie. I would give this movie a 5 out of 10... for acting credentials except Abhishek and Melbourne.";

And that's where the similarities end. That's the only way it gained 5 stars from me. I liked the way it addressed relationships especially in the 21st century. Somebody needs to send Preity Zinta a memo for her to stop accepting roles in which she portrays desperate women who have to con men to love them! I mean come on! A man doesn't need to have a degree in Neurosurgery before he realises that he is in love and Preity pretty please stop playing these tired stereotypes of women willing to try and give those men their love degrees! That said Salaam Namaste is a good looking film about good looking people living in a good looking country have good looking jobs and good looking lives until they meet and fall in love with each other. Then everything is not so good looking any more! Babes why wasn't Salaam Namaste something original again? Sorry? Exaaaactly! D It was mediocre yaar!

Everyone except for 'Debonair' of course. When are Hindi movie makers going to realise that every south Indian isn't a 'Madrasi' and to quit painting their white faces black to look authentic. His accent was that of a Tamilian a very fake one at that! I do believe any south Indian could pronounce the name Ambar without adding the H to it! even though he's a Malayali. I wonder why they don't cast a real south Indian for the role instead of a ham.Talking about hams. Abhishek Bacchan's role was a real big one. Robin Williams in the original Nine Months was simply awesome. I'm just so tired of watching movies that are outright copies of funnier and better taken movies. Hugh Grant may not have been as buff or as hot as Saif when Nine Months was taken but his character is so much more endearing more believable. And good lord!! he's most definitely a better actor. The worst of all was Javed Jaffry's role. It was like the absolute worst. He didn't sound at all convincing and was increbibly annoying.Preity Zinta needs to move on from this kind of crappy candy floss movie. She looks like she's stuck in a rut. It was really  and I MEAN it hard to watch the 'what's going on?' song. REALLY REALLY HARD.There are scenes in this movie that are a direct lift out of 'Friends'. Being a literal 'fan'atic of Friends. it makes me so mad to see the plagiarism and no credit at all given to the original. In the words of 'Nick'....this movie is nothing but 'CRAP'. I want my money back!!! I'm not going to watch another Hindi movie until they come up with SOMETHING original. Dude! Gimme a 'Madrasi' film anyday. At least they're original!".

It is a lighthearted predictable romantic comedy who's target audience would be 15yo to 40 yo women. It is not really a mens movie.The acting was excellent and I loved seeing Melbourne.The end birthing scene was over the top but overall a great movie".

I found so much of this movie to be funny sad or at least entertaining. I thought the writing felt honest and sharp and i found the acting to be superb because IT FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING REAL HUMAN BEINGS. Everyone else who commented seemed to have a problem with the performances but i thought they felt authentic. I think we could probably all agree that some people working in the fashion industry might on occasion behave in a way that is a little over dramatic. So when the characters in this film are portrayed behaving in an overly dramatic way as many of them are it makes complete sense to me. I thought this was a really unique I'm saying this because I haven't seen any other movie shot with only actors sitting infront of blue screens way to tell a story and I was really glad I picked it up. A fellow reviewer complained that Rage was plotless but it felt as ambiguous as something a teenager might put together but still had cohesive elements strong enough to leave you or at least me with a sense of what transpired off camera which I believe was the aim of the director. I mean so it is rather beyond the scope of possibility that some teenage black kid got to interview all of these people repeatedly and did so while they were not trying to be interviewed. But I think the statement that Rage shows how ugly and downright wrong it is to allow the production fianc and distribution of 'anything goes' cinema is a horrible and self indulgent criticism of a artistic work you didn't like. There are a lot of things down right wrong in this world creative expression typically isn't one of them. And also that isn't how you spell finance.".

Rage is onehundred boring minutes of uninteresting people talking directly into the camera and the only damn thing that changes occasionally is the color of the background! The thing they have in common is that they are all working for a fashion house in one way or another and they vent about all their jobrelated frustrations against a studentamateur blogger. One tiny little problem though  nobody is freaking interested in the rants of eccentric vainglorious naive and selfindulgent fashion snobs. The raised topics aren't the least bit controversial and none of the monologues are even remotely provocative. The only thing that Sally Potter accomplishes here is stating the obvious. The fashion industry is a tough and competitive the world's economy is in recession and all people are selfish bastards and too easily blinded by the idea of fame  glory. Big deal! So What! Who cares? Many interviews and monologues are implausible and preposterous. For example it's very ignorant to assume that everyone working for a supposedly acclaimed fashion company and only a few days prior to the launch of a new clothing line is prepared to free some time and talk to a student with a webcam. As a student I had to coordinate an HR initiative for a big company but I definitely never had the opportunity to have a chat with the general manager journalists or security personnel.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't post here often in fact this is my very first comment and wish it was a better film I felt I could say something about...Please if you feel differently explain it too me. This has been my first exposure to Sally Potters work.In Rage we see a host of characters involved in a fashion show being interviewed by and speaking with a student working on a school project. Throughout his seven days with the fashion designer the models the investor the marketing consultants the company owner the pizza delivery guy and others several deaths occur an investigation is launched and public opinion is formed and voiced. Stylistically we see see talking heads declaring their thoughts and describing their own and others' actions.In my view the film tries to be a bunch of things but fails at most of them miserably. First and foremost it lacks a plot. Stuff happens but there is no discernible character development with a couple of exceptions rounding up no new or challenging views on topics we should care about no discussion on why bad stuff happens to good people or why people end up as bad people. This is notable as films as Babel even Crash and TV fare as The West Wing have taught us that issues have more than one side. Rage fails at that for the most part focusing on illustrating that the fashion industry is bad the media industry is bad marketing folks anyways and that those poor kids in China and on the runway that suffer. The film seems to work through a laundry list of things you ought to get upset about had you not heard of them before and discussed them with your friends 10 years ago.Secondly I straight out blame lack of directing skills for a set of inconsistent seemingly badly enacted characters. Frank Buscemi Mona Carvell Dench and Miss Roth Wiest come across as at least as semicredible nonfarcical at times even multilayered or torn. Contrast this with Homer Oyelowo Merlin Abkarian and don't shoot me Minx Law  shallow monologues farcical as far as I could tell or plain out unbelievable and embarrassing. Either way I dare say could be fine. But please don't mix! Help me understand if the film tries to be funny or if we see an actor's most horrid performance to date. Ideally help me understand this without the help of a pamphlet as required reading.Thirdly try to maintain a shred of plausibility in the setup. A kid with a cell phone camera being asked by Otto to please not leak information again? Diamonds trying to strike a behindthescenes deal talking to said camera? Anita doing the same asking for anonymity? Cut that kid off throw him out sulk but do not do what we see on screen! It renders the story implausible as this asks the viewer to follow along with the cheaplooking declarative approach no matter what. This in turn allows the makers of the film to skirt the hard work of storytelling  creating a believable universe of topics characters and contexts.We saw the film as part of the Berlinale competition program. It did receive applause especially Jude Law and Dianne West but it also received applause when the words last day appeared on screen and several people possibly those more critical of what they saw left midfilm. We wondered if Tilda Swinton is too good a friend of Potter to not invite her to this festival.3 stars for Wiest Dench Buscemi and 1 laughhalf hour.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sally Potter takes chances. There are so many unique aspects of this film that reviewing it is difficult. The major aspects of the film include the very au courant 'rage' of blogging as a means of communication the 'rage' to stay young and in fashion that almost daily changing series of fads of what is in and what is out the 'rage' of focusing everyone's attention on celebrity antics including drugs and death the 'rage' to buy everything if you don't own it and it looks like it is going to be popular then buy it the 'rage' of climbing into the media world be it film fashion television searching for that promised 15 minutes of fame the 'rage' of PR minding the selling promotion of a product without concern of its value the 'rage' of creating new fragrances with a special name for fame and the 'rage' for maintaining a wealthy or famous class and a poor or service class. Potter manages to take us through all of these phases with brilliant writing fascinating character studies experimental lighting and photography and one of the best uses of color fields ever on film. The premise is simple yet strong. A blogger named Michelangelo follows the backstage proceedings of a New York Fashion Show we never see him we see only his daily blog entry and the images of the interviewees through his cellphone camera  the individuals all are part of the hyped fashion show cum ramp walk of fashionista Merlin Simon Abkarian who designed the clothes Miss Roth Dianne Wiest who owns the company Mona Carvell Judi Dench the fashion critic who writes for the media coverage Otto Jakob Cedergren who works managing PR Mr. White Bob Balaban who directs the show until he is replaced by the overeducated image builder Dwight Angel Patrick J. Adams Frank Steve Buscemi a hard nosed photographer who has spent better time on the war fronts in the Middle East taking 'meaningful pictures' financier Tiny Diamonds Eddie Izzard who buys everything he wants including his bodyguard Jed John Leguizamo models Minx Jude Law in drag and Lettuce Leaf Lily Cole pizza delivery boy transformed in to model Vijay Riz Ahmed and Anita de Los Angeles Adriana Barraza the seamstress who simply wants to remain invisible. Two deaths occur  one car accident and one shooting  and that brings in Detective Homer David Oyelowo who investigates while displaying his own brand of Shakespeare to the blogger's cellphone camera. All of this complex story happens in the form of interviews  each star is dressed in well designed clothes and each poses in front of various colored screens. The ending of the interview brings the whole experience together. Potter's immaculate and imaginative script gives each one of these gifted actors room to shine in a one person act. It just simply works and never for a moment does it become dull. Sally Potter gave us 'Orlando' 'Yes' 'The Man Who Cried' and 'The Tango Lesson'. She is one of the most imaginative and skilled writerdirector units in the business. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " predictable and superficial for a playlike movie";
	schema:reviewBody "well not the worst movie I have seen but certainly a disappointing one given the cast and the director. The movie had the structure and intimacy of a play which would have been alright if it had explored deeper into the characters' intentions and the meaning of their actions. As it were they were predictable and clichy the superficial billionaire the jealousy ridden transvestite the vulnerable baby faced model the over the top artiste designer the cold critic the body guard who had too much time to talk to the camera to be doing his job etc. The story is unclear on what really happens to the two models though we know we should mourn but over what? Suicide murder accident? We see repeated shots of the characters with clich gestures of sorrow but we cannot share in the tragedy as we don't know what happened. We are led to believe that the blogger has incited a mayhem of protest but would people young people we are told protest so vehemently against some stupid fashion's show? Which gets rerun after the first corpse is not even buried? I don't buy that. The format should have yielded amazing performances as in THINGS YOU CAN TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT HER by Rodrigo Garcia where the actors are stripped bare in front of a close up camera but in RAGE they chose to follow preset tracks giving little more than prefab personae and that flatness is what kills the movie. Save for Dame Dench who is always superb Dianne Weist's smile and voice as sweet as honey and Adriana Barraza who steals the movie as Anita de Los Angeles the only believable and truly sympathetic character in the story. I was disappointed by Buscemi and Leguizamo who can do better acting Buscemi is excellent as a grieving father in The Messenger and by Izzard whose straight acting does not convince me  I love his cross dressing comedy routines and he should stick to them. Law is well hidden under wigs and make up and though I was reminded of him his amazing eyes beautifully enhanced by make up mid movie I did not realize it was actually him. Still his Minx was just a caricature of a shallow diva who wants to grab and hold our attention nothing more. The vivid color backgrounds made for interesting optical tricks when complementary colors clashed and glowed almost hurt the eye but were insufficient to keep one interested. It's a pity that Potter's failed to go beyond color and costumes for I loved Orlando her aesthetic was formidable in that movie and Virginia Woolf's story well adapted to her eye for rich costume imagery.".

As it were they were predictable and clichy the superficial billionaire the jealousy ridden transvestite the vulnerable baby faced model the over the top artiste designer the cold critic the body guard who had too much time to talk to the camera to be doing his job etc. The story is unclear on what really happens to the two models though we know we should mourn but over what? Suicide murder accident? We see repeated shots of the characters with clich gestures of sorrow but we cannot share in the tragedy as we don't know what happened. We are led to believe that the blogger has incited a mayhem of protest but would people young people we are told protest so vehemently against some stupid fashion's show? Which gets rerun after the first corpse is not even buried? I don't buy that. The format should have yielded amazing performances as in THINGS YOU CAN TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT HER by Rodrigo Garcia where the actors are stripped bare in front of a close up camera but in RAGE they chose to follow preset tracks giving little more than prefab personae and that flatness is what kills the movie. Save for Dame Dench who is always superb Dianne Weist's smile and voice as sweet as honey and Adriana Barraza who steals the movie as Anita de Los Angeles the only believable and truly sympathetic character in the story. I was disappointed by Buscemi and Leguizamo who can do better acting Buscemi is excellent as a grieving father in The Messenger and by Izzard whose straight acting does not convince me  I love his cross dressing comedy routines and he should stick to them. Law is well hidden under wigs and make up and though I was reminded of him his amazing eyes beautifully enhanced by make up mid movie I did not realize it was actually him. Still his Minx was just a caricature of a shallow diva who wants to grab and hold our attention nothing more. The vivid color backgrounds made for interesting optical tricks when complementary colors clashed and glowed almost hurt the eye but were insufficient to keep one interested. It's a pity that Potter's failed to go beyond color and costumes for I loved Orlando her aesthetic was formidable in that movie and Virginia Woolf's story well adapted to her eye for rich costume imagery.";

The aesthetic result is quite good but nothing more than that. This is one of my favourite worst movies ever. This is a film experiment but it just doenst work.

	schema:reviewBody "So it's no secret that experimental filmmaking is a necessity of cinema and some experimental films succeed and others don't. Rage is one of those that doesn't quite succeed in its experimentation on narrative style. Rage is about a New York blogger named Michelangelo a character we never see or hear. Michelangelo is documenting a New York fashion show by interviewing various people behind the stage in front of various neon colored backgrounds. The entire film is just individual character interviews intertwined to create a story. There is no character interaction and no sets whatsoever. The entire film is done with actors sound effects and a blue screen. And believe it or not the film does actually end up telling a cohesive story just in the most inconvenient way possible.Simply put you can't tell a story like this. You just can't make this kind of narrative work without some extra flair or nuance to spice it up. You simply can't tell a unique enough story with just actors in front of a blue screen. The film for the most part kept my attention the whole way through but it is not something that I would watch repeatedly. It is good for one viewing and the most you can take out of that one viewing is that this is a narrative style that just doesn't work. This film could make an interesting contemporary stage play with a few tweaks but as a film it is missing key elements that make cinema what it is. I commend Sally Potter the director for coming up with new and inventive ways to tell a story through the film medium and I would never discourage her from continuing to expand her experimentation but I do hope she realized that this attempt was a failed one.Moving on from the narrative style I really can't complain about the story itself or the characters within it. That is really the tragedy of this film is how much potential its story and characters could have had if told in a more effective manner. The story takes unexpected twists throughout and grows surprisingly dark and captivating. Each character is very well designed but you have to take into consideration the fact that we only see a small part of each character's potential. Like I said before there is zero character interaction in this film unless you count the things said directly to our invisible narrator. It is difficult to fully judge a character's depth when you never see him or her interact with the other characters of the film. But for what we are given by these characters it is all very interesting. Each character has their own philosophy and outlook on life and the fashion industry and these personal values each one of them expresses drives the story home. A lot could have been done with what was laid out across the screen but the over experimental narrative style held it back significantly.And to add insult to injury the characters were played by excellent actors who I would have loved to see go further with their roles if the narrative had allowed for it. There are some very big names in this film and a variety of Alist faces. There is everyone from Steve Buscemi as the disgruntled photographer to the kind old Dianne Wiest who wants her perfume company to succeed but also wants to keep everyone happy. Jude Law goes the extra mile for this film and plays the transsexual runway model Minx. It is one of the most enticing yet disturbing roles in the whole film and Law does a great job. Judi Dench plays a painfully honest fashion critic who delivers one of the last and most enthralling speeches of the film. She ends the film on a particularly dark yet fascinating note and her performance is great for what she has to work with.I see this film getting torn up by critics and audience members alike but I feel it deserves much more credit than it has received. Obviously it is very flawed but it is not an outright horrible movie. The narrative style simply doesn't work and it definitely holds the film back a lot but apart from that the film delivers a lot of good things. The story while not perfect is undeniably interesting and so are the characters. The actors do a great job in their limiting roles and the only complaint I can make about them is that I just wanted more. Overall Rage is a failure in minimalist filmmaking. The film makes numerous references to Andy Warhol but I'm sure Warhol would have been disgusted by this film as its style almost ended up being a mockery of his own unintentionally of course. With a lot of tweaking and revising though Rage could be a great film or even stage play that would most definitely be worth watching.".

The actors brought with them a quality of fearlessly facing the camera through the role and also I give them credit for being very interesting on screen. The tone they set at the end is deserving of praise because it concludes the film effectively. On the whole Rage is ridiculous as it is at times a study of human nature it just uses a particular setting and perhaps that is what people are put off by.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film of contrasts. A good story let down by poor dialogue some great acting as well as some mediocre and good direction marred by irritating and indiscriminate motion blur filming.The film has the elements and sometimes the feel of a charming love story a modernday fairy tale. The gentleness and innocence of the two main characters is in sharp contrast to the world inhabited by the secondary characters where addiction to alcohol gambling desperation and suicide are the order of the day.Jude Law as Jeremy seems to have lost the plot. His halfhearted attempts at a Manchester accent are woeful. Why bother with the accent anyway? He is a coffee shop owner in NY and his origins have no bearing whatsoever on the storyline. However his natural charisma and his gentle demeanour do suit the role and he pairs well with Norah Jones as Elizabeth.As for the flaws is there ever total silence outside in the street in NY at night? And would customers really give their house keys to the person behind the counter in a coffee shop to be kept in a glass jar? And would customers ever be known not by name but by what they eat? And is there anyone in Manchester actually called Jeremy? As for Norah Jones although she is on screen for most of the film she does not have a lot to do or say  which is just as well really.

	onyx:emotionText "This is a film of contrasts. A good story let down by poor dialogue some great acting as well as some mediocre and good direction marred by irritating and indiscriminate motion blur filming.The film has the elements and sometimes the feel of a charming love story a modernday fairy tale. The gentleness and innocence of the two main characters is in sharp contrast to the world inhabited by the secondary characters where addiction to alcohol gambling desperation and suicide are the order of the day.Jude Law as Jeremy seems to have lost the plot. His halfhearted attempts at a Manchester accent are woeful. Why bother with the accent anyway? He is a coffee shop owner in NY and his origins have no bearing whatsoever on the storyline. However his natural charisma and his gentle demeanour do suit the role and he pairs well with Norah Jones as Elizabeth.As for the flaws is there ever total silence outside in the street in NY at night? And would customers really give their house keys to the person behind the counter in a coffee shop to be kept in a glass jar? And would customers ever be known not by name but by what they eat? And is there anyone in Manchester actually called Jeremy? As for Norah Jones although she is on screen for most of the film she does not have a lot to do or say  which is just as well really. She spends most of her time watching in silent doeeyed admiration as she is given a master class in acting by the real actors.The real actors here are David Strathairn and Rachel Weisz.

	schema:reviewBody "Wong Kar Wai the Hong Kong auteur has made his first movie all in English and set in the USAand built around Grammy Award singer Norah Jones. More coherent than many of Wong's efforts it's been accused of being a trifleor is it just that the plot seems silly now that it's all clear and in English? Like all Wong's work this is a film that's romantic sad and gorgeous to look at from first to last and full of strong catchy popbluescountry music Ry Couder did the score. The beautiful Ms. Jones's character variously known as Elizabeth Lizzie Beth or Betty turns up at a New York caf run by Jeremy Jude Law a guy from Manchester England drenched in lovelonging because her man has dumped her for somebody else. Jeremy has a jar full of keys from patrons each with a story and Lizzie gives him hers hoping her boyfriend will pick them up again. Jeremy has his own lost love Katya Cat Power she'll turn up later on just to say goodbye. Jeremy's keys stand for doors he himself doesn't want to close. Though Lizzie's boyfriend never turns up Jeremy and Lizzie begin to have late night chats and sugar orgies she eating a piece of blueberry pie with ice creampicking blueberry because that's the pie that's always left over at the end of the day.There's a fight in the caf and Jeremy plays around with a surveillance camera which he seems to use as a kind of diary. Soon he will be alone and Lissie will be away.This time instead of improvising as in the past which among other things contributed to his last film 2046 a kind of summation of his Chinese themes and characters taking five years to finish Wong made up his story with Norah in mind and then had it turned into a finished screenplay subject to plenty of revisions of course by crime novelist Lawrence Block. This one had a low budget and took just a couple of months to make. Shooting time that is. It really took a year to do the editing but Wong had that finished to everyone's surprise just in time for My Blueberry NIghts to be shown as the opener at Cannes last year.Like Wong's other films this one encapsulates several different stories. The second one comes when Lizzie decides to cross the street to revisit Jeremy by the longest way possible which turns out to be a trip to Memphis and Nevada and points in between thousands of miles and nearly a yeara time of selfdiscovery no doubt though she doesn't observably change and a period to avoid the inevitable romance with Jeremy. Landing in Memphis Lizzie works at two jobs saving up money to buy a car. At a bar she encounters the drama of the drunken cop Arnie Copeland David Strathairn and his estranged wife Sue Lynne Rachel Weisz. Both are fine acting their heads off in scenes heady with barroom dysfunction. For once an onscreen drunk admits to going to Alcoholics Anonymousand collecting a beginner's chip over and over and over. He throws the chips on the bar and they make a satisfying chink. But Arnie comes to a bad end though Sue Lynne despite rejecting him keeps his tab open as she lights out for the territory. Through all of this Lizzie constantly sends Jeremy a stream of postcards that are a kind of intimate diary and he desperately tries to track her down by phone and letter without success.Every young filmmaker dreams of making a road movie Wong Kar Wai has said. Though he's now fifty this is a kind of new beginning or felt like one to him. But he said this movie isn't really a road movie it's a vacation. And it's not about a journey but about distance. Maybe the trip across the street for Lizzie is all a dreamone by Sam Shepherd working with David Lynch. Sue Lynne gives Lizzie a generous donation for being Arnie's barmaid too and she lights out for Nevada. There she's working at a gambling dive where she meets a young woman named Leslie Nathalie Portman who's a pro and they wind up leaving town together. Eventually Lizzie ends up back at Jeremy's caf and he's waiting for her.Coming after As Tears Go By Days of Being Wild Chungking Express Ashes of Time Fallen Angels Happy Together In the Mood For Love and 2046 Wong's excursion into America is completely consistent and logical. Those who seem disappointed may miss the ellipses and madcap improv of the earlier films and may have failed to notice that they were full of pop novel gimmicks and romantic cuteness. Wong's sentimentality passes muster because of cryptic story lines poetic voiceovers hypnotic uses of music and adventurous camera workmostly by Christopher Doyle here replaced by the halfFrench and wholly brilliant Darius Khondji made infinitely rich by complex editing. My Blueberry Nights is full of crisscross angles fast overlaps closeups so shallow atmospheric Americana may go unnoticed till a lovely panorama flits by. Color is typically warm and dense. The effect is to make every frame a pleasure.Reciting Wong Kar Wai's list of features brings home how he singlehandedly made the Eighties and Nineties an exciting cinematic time from the first days when you had to go to a theater on the edge of Chinatown and then you watched badly subtitled Hong Kong prints found in esoteric video shops to the time when Tarantino's Miramax label Rolling Thunder distributed Chungking Express in a good print with clear titles and the secret was out.Maybe Wong never did anything better than Days of Being Wild the first film in which he became truly himself. But what does it matter? The quintessential stylist he cannot make a film that doesn't give rich aesthetic pleasure.US opening date April 18 2008.".

It is about human emotion growth hurtlongingfinding inner peace. Every emotion she brings to her songs Norah Jones and the rest of the cast bring to this movie. Every character represents another Life Lesson that Elizabeth Norah Jones character needs to meet to bring her to the peace she needs to find. Or at least an understanding of who she is that she can be happy with. Which makes the ending such a wonderful beginning.Jude Law is his usual charming English embracing persona. Rachel Weisz and Natalie Portman achieve so much with such small supporting roles. David Strathairn is perfectly cast and is just an incredible actor. The director did an incredible job of pacing the film to let each moment of reflection absorb into the audience. The photography was just as exquisite in its detail and subtle importance of meaning. Where this film really succeeds is in not falling into the Hollywood pitfalls of so many indie movies where the the film becomes brooding or cynical. Throughout her journey Elizabeth finds herself her best self. Like her music you will sometimes feel the melancholia she feels sometimes feel the hope and desire the longing for love or the want of confidence in one's self. But after all the reflections in the end you will be happy with the experience. The only thing missing from this film was a great Van Morrison song like in the Midnight or Someone like you to add to the atmosphere. I don't think i have seen any of Kar Wai Wong's the director films but I look forward to seeing them all now. Start to finish this movie is brilliant.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just got back from the Cannes film festival and I have to say that the negative reviews for this film are spot on. I think Kar Wai Wong is a fine director but he bit off more than he can chew with this film. The screenplay does not feel natural and while I love Nora Jones as a singer she's not an actress and it's painfully obvious when you see this film. The best performances in the movie belong to the more deserving supporting actors in the film mainly Rachel Weisz David Strathairn and Natalie Portman who bring more to the film in acting than it deserves. The film has two major problems going for it one is the script which does have one decent segment involving a cop David Strathairn and his wife Rachel Weisz but that's really a testament on how good both Weisz and Strathairn are as actors because they draw you into their character's lives and makes you feel for them but unfortunately the script derail their efforts in bringing more to their roles. Natalie Portman is great as well but she has even less of a story to work with and not a very convincing one at that. Poor Nora Jones is pretty but basically vapid in her role.

	onyx:emotionText "I just got back from the Cannes film festival and I have to say that the negative reviews for this film are spot on. I think Kar Wai Wong is a fine director but he bit off more than he can chew with this film. The screenplay does not feel natural and while I love Nora Jones as a singer she's not an actress and it's painfully obvious when you see this film. The best performances in the movie belong to the more deserving supporting actors in the film mainly Rachel Weisz David Strathairn and Natalie Portman who bring more to the film in acting than it deserves. The film has two major problems going for it one is the script which does have one decent segment involving a cop David Strathairn and his wife Rachel Weisz but that's really a testament on how good both Weisz and Strathairn are as actors because they draw you into their character's lives and makes you feel for them but unfortunately the script derail their efforts in bringing more to their roles. Natalie Portman is great as well but she has even less of a story to work with and not a very convincing one at that. Poor Nora Jones is pretty but basically vapid in her role. She tries but lacks the presence to pull the character off. She's supposed to be the viewer's anchor but just ends up more of a piece of scenery than a character.All and All a noble yet pretty bad effort by Kar Wai Wong";

It's one of those movies that has everything to be good. Never Amazing never something out of this world but good! Makes you feel good after wards! But because of the editing and the great shots this movie could have been far better than the average sweet smart movie.The main reason why it's just good is because of the lead actress which was Norah Jones. And I'm very sorry to say she didn't convince me at all. It even became annoying at some points! And since she is narrating some bits and appearing in most of the movie.. it kinda ruined it a bit for me. It's really hard to comprehend why she was given the part. But if you can forget about her acting.. I think the movie is really good.".

	schema:headline " Disappointing not just because of the script but because it fails to convey what it wants to convey";
	schema:reviewBody "It was a pleasant evening at the cinema but I cannot call this a good film. Several reviews have come up with many valid remarks such as  Norah Jones doesn't act very well but more on that later especially compared to her co stars  The script is not only clichd but very uneven also more on that  The dialogue is godawful and the accents aren't very well doneSPOILERSTHE IDEA. So about Norah Jones' character. It's bland completely flat yes. But I think in a way that's the point. The whole point of the film is that though she claims in the end to be someone different she's about the only thing constant in the film. There's also a snippet of dialogue referring to that as Jude Law says somewhere I think you've changed but maybe it's just me. And indeed he has thrown away his keys but she still wants her blueberry pie. WKW wrote the film around Norah Jones after hearing her songs and I think we should take this literally she is the eye of the storm. In the beginning she perceives herself as the storm then she sees she's the eye... In the end she doesn't change it's the world around her. Note also how very often she's just not the main target of the scene.This lack of actual change is a very good idea as we've come to get used to films where characters go through all these hefty changes and developments  as if people change ha! The first problem is it was WKW's only good idea. The second problem he doesn't pull it off.THE ACTING. Another problem is this is a tough one you actually want an actress who is able to portray someone who feels they are changing but who actually aren't! Someone who is the eye of the storm but without being completely absent. Unfortunately this is too much for Norah Jones who depicts an eye of the storm that is so nonexistent that one wouldn't know what there is that can or cannot change. I mean from zero to zero over zero that's not much.THE SCRIPT. But even so I've seen much worse than Jones. The one to take the blame is the lame and clichd script. Dialogue can be clich Tarantino makes it work. But this script! a It's next to nonexistent b It's unbalanced as you only get a road trip feeling once she's going to Vegas. This might be deliberate though as seeing her take the bus would actually give viewers the impression she's taking initiative but as WKW wants her to be the eye of the storm she cannot be shown to take deliberate action. Interesting and a real challenge for a script writer. Unfortunately no good solution is found for this. In any case the two stories Memphis  Vegas have too little movement to give a road movie feel but still seem to pass too quickly to really stick. Though Archie's a fantastic character. c It's... well I didn't think I was going to have to say this... a look at the west by an outsider.WKW and GREAT WEST. What I mean by c is that and I could be biased but there it is I have the impression that WKW took some classic American Movies images and tried to piece his Great West film together. But he doesn't get beyond clichs he doesn't seem to get what really drives the idea of road movies meeting people  their stories... it's all part of the Big Romantic Illusion of which he is no part seemingly. Now the turning insideout of the personischangedbythestuffshesees romantic idea is brilliant... but apparently they did not have what it takes to drive that point home. Maybe WKW had too much respect for the clichs of the West. Don't know but I can't shake the feeling that he rubs his film style against these ideas he doesn't fully grasp and tries to make his point which gets lost in the rubbing as at no point you get the impression that one injects the other with something fresh.Pity WKW has three films in my top 20. Where's the time of Fallen Angels when story and story telling were in complete osmosis.Per edit I'll add a general remark. I fear that WKW rubbing his film style against the story is a bit the consequence of him being too evolved as a filmmaker and he sticks to his screen language where in fact he should've let go. When WKW got stuck in his crisis whilst filming Ashes Of Time he chose to completely set the project aside and open himself up so anything that came. The result was Chunking Express and its brilliant side project Fallen Angels. Those were so brilliant because his perspective was open  you get the feeling that he lets the story dictate how to use the camera and at the same time lets the way he uses his camera determine how the story is told. But over the course of his career culminating in the Mood For Love2046 diptych he has sharpened that diamond to perfection where a certain way of filming fits a curtains story. Unfortunately this means that you're up a culdesac. He needs a new paradigm. And he didn't dodare that here. PS I had the same feeling with Lynch's Empire where I felt like Lynch was onto something new in terms of filmic language but just couldn't bring himself to completely abandon his old style.".

When real histories are written artists like this will be appreciated for what they begin giants compared to politicians who can only try to end things. His last four films were transformative. Now he tries something outside his realm of mastery.Like his main character he has decided to travel the US in search of love. Also like his main character he doesn't care about the story only the afterglow. Its the mood that matters. In his previous films he literally works without a script creating an obvious vacuum where the story would be.Here he simply adopts a story that is so vacuous it leaves a similar hole. With a lesser artist you would actually pay attention to the story and wonder about it. I suggest you simply ignore it providing it with no more semiotic weight than the doorknobs which are so carefully photographed.The idea here is simple he finds a woman who by herself evokes a mood. He's done this before and found creatures whose screen presence melts boundaries between stones allowing transparent slipperage. In this case its Norah Jones who does have a charm. His key image is of her drunk asleep on a diner counter with crumbs of delicious pastry on her full lips. The way he's chosen to carry her image is through her songs which contain a deceptive tension of confident tentativeness. This is a woman who is intensely unsettled and so is settled in herself. Jude Law plays a sort of urban domestic who prepares and waits simply waits and draws her back.In between the crumbs and the kiss are adventures with two women played by Rachel Weisz and Natalie Portman. They are placed as outer bounds on two sides so that our character's stone can slip home. One is remorsefully constrained by neediness the other guiltily unconstrained. Both lose men but not our heroine.Christopher Doyle is not present on this and its obvious that it is part of the risk Wong is taking new country new language new mode for moodiness new crew altogether. Different sorts of lingering and saturation. Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many different ways to talk about love. There are some a director should stay away from. Love is strong it's a powerful feeling extreme hard to seize. My Blueberry Nights is nothing of the kind. It's slow as hell dull and shallow. The dialogs are pointless. A blueberry pie contains a romance. Yes it does. That's how you find yourself watching Norah Jones and Jude Law falling in love around a delicious blueberry pie with some ice cream on top of it. That very pie Jude cooks everyday in his restaurant for customers who don't want it. But thank god! Norah comes and wants it. Such a romantic landscape. And there are some very exciting moments where you can see the pie mixing up with the ice cream in a sensual way far more attractive an than Jude and Norah since the two new buddies don't really have anything to talk about.Everything is said. There's nothing better than a blueberry pie to reveal a romance keys maybe?. But blueberry pies also make romances much more complicated than they're ought to be separating dumb lovers from each other keeping them away from their true feelings. No love is not only a blueberry pie. The movie certainly tries to depict the complexity of love. Love and cheating or love and death. These are quite depressing ways to show the hidden intensity of love. Love exists deep inside you but sometimes you're just not aware of it until some unpleasant or terrible event happens and takes away from you the object of your love. Then you start worshiping something you never concretely had missing a person you never treated as you wish you had your heart starts burning for a lost cause and this cause is love. I don't think you need to eat blueberry pies every night and cross half the U.S. by yourself to realize that. The actors are not good either. Norah Jones is dreadful unbearable as she doesn't know what acting means as she displays the same unchanging look on her face in every single scene. Jude Law looks like he doesn't know what to do with his shallow character. He has no life outside his restaurant and the place appears more of a prison than of a socalled secret garden. The only one who's remarkable is Rachel Weisz. Natalie Portman is refreshing as a spoiled girl with a nonexistent father left to herself the queen of poker lost in the desert on her way to Vegas. Oh and Cat Power stealing a kiss from Jude...!If you want to take a nap I highly recommend My Blueberry Nights or maybe just blueberries... If you expect to see CINEMA then stay home it's winter time after all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whether people love Wong Kawai's movies for the subtleties they worship or hate them for the same subtleties that they consider to be pretentious pseudo art one thing they have to agree on is the aesthetic excellence of these movies. My blueberry nights retains all the mesmerizing visual appeal and enchanting mood but is unWongKawai in being quite mainstream and accessible.Perhaps not grand enough to be described as an Odyssey type of movie MBN does have a distinct road movie flavour. There are three stories. Elizabeth Norah Jones broken hearted finds a patient listener caf owner Jeremy Jude Law and pours out her heart to him night after night after the caf closes over blueberry pies that he is never able to sell. She then disappears as abruptly as she came sends him postcards that are sort of a continuation of their nightly conversation which however has become onewaytraffic because try has he does he can't track her down. Still as abruptly she comes back one night into his life again when they find out how much the mean to each other. Curtain.The debut of singer Norah Jones is well managed. Wisely avoiding overtaxing her unproven acting ability she has been cast in a role where her girlnextdoor look carried a lot effectively. In a large part of the movie the two stories during her journey across the US she plays a bystanderobserver type of role. But she should be given credit for capably if not brilliantly portraying the metamorphosis of the girl who left lost and broken hearted and returns a changed person confident and ready to embrace love again. There is good chemistry with naturally lovable Jude Law.It is however the other two stories that snatch the limelight. David Strathairn is a simple small town cop driven to the brink of breakdown by an unfaithful wife played by Rachel Weisz. Both appear in a persona that you have likely not seen before nothing unusual as these are professional actors who are expected to be able to delivery any role assigned to them. But if you have seen Strathairn in Good night and good luck you know how good he is at doing this when you see him in MBN. It is also a treat to see Weisz playing slut and a remorseful one to make it even more interesting. But the best is yet to come particularly for Natalie Portman fans. The gambler rebellious daughter who deep down loves her father is not a particularly novel character but she does it really well with a maturity that is quite endearing.At the end of the day this is Wong Kawai to the bones every frame is an exquisite colour scheme dreamy languid music or at times complete silence and all the rest of it. But it is also a Wong Kawai that is todate most accessible to the general nonarthouse audience. I thoroughly enjoyed it and did not for a single moment doze off as I did during his other movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wong Kar Wai first American film is an interesting try by this great director but something gets lost in the translation in terms of narrative and story telling that makes this film a noble and failed attempt by him. The story really does not hold much water in the way it's presented and the narrative feels a bit awkward and unfinished in what's going on right in front of you not to mention the horrible lines of dialog that comes out of the mouths of most of the characters. Nora Jones does give an interesting first performance and she is quite good but she is blown off the screen by her seasoned co stars who give much more potent performances than the script allows. The best of these performances goes to Rachel Weisz and David Straitharn who gives much more complexity to their underwritten characters than they should have and if they both had a real script to work with their story would have been a great movie in itself but the script holds them back like a anchor and you can see that they are trying to keep a straight face while saying some of the lame dialog from the script. Jude Law is really not in the movie much at all and Natalie Portman is the worst served by all of this because despite her up hill battle to give a good performance with how unfocused the script is she does not have much of a story to work with.I feel bad for Wong Kar Wai he could have made a much better film than this especially with the great talent he had working for him but the script is what killed this film and no amount of great talent could have saved it.".

	schema:reviewBody "In one word predictable. I'm sorry I really did want to like this. After all the Chinese Director  Wong Kar Wai  is famous in the world of independent World Cinema and this has been his long awaited first English language film. And of course the cast is both extremely beautiful and undeniably talented  just not at working opposite each other.It has to be said when Jude Law is good he's mind blowing but when he's bad he's unwatchable. Unfortunately these days more often then not I cringe when he comes on the screen. It's such a shame especially as he's so nice to look at but rather then growing as an actor he seems to be becoming a caricature of himself. I mean his character Jeremy is supposed to be a Mancuniann in New York  but he can't even pull that off believably! I was curious to see what Norah Jones would be like on the big screen. My verdict stick to the singing. The first half an hour was painfully forced and not helped by Law's dry performance. It did get marginally better as Elizabeth Jones' character leaves Jeremy's blueberry pies behind and goes on a selfdiscovering journey across America though this might be more due to a wonderful performance by her costars.David Strathairn especially deserves recognition. His portrayal of alcoholic cop Arnie is superb. Unable to accept that his marriage to Sue Lynne Rachel Weisz is over he befriends Elizabeth when she takes on two waitressing jobs in his local bar and dinner. An argument with devastating results ensues and we see Weisz at her best  ruthless and sexy yet vulnerable. Natalie Portman's performance as a crazy gambling addict is equally great although her acting opposite Jones never felt comfortable.Finally Wai is renowned for his creative cinematography and at least in that respect My Bluberry Nights didn't disappoint. Maybe if you watched this with the volume set on mute you'd see this as the masterpiece it's trying to be. But while tension can enhance a film I felt like this was just full of confusion. Artistic indie flick or traditional Hollywood blockbuster? Well neither really just a lot of unnerving insecurity.The Fan Carpet  www.thefancarpet.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Wong KarWai's first English language film. Nora Jones stars as Elizabeth a young woman who walks into Jude Laws Cafe after her boyfriend dumps her. After several nights there eating blueberry pie she heads off on the road where she meets a cop in Memphis and a gambler in Nevada.A decidedly uneven mix of a movie that doesn't add up to much. KarWai's beautiful camera work produces some great images but his some time use of slow motion is over used to the point you'll want to hit the fast forward so you see something at normal speed. How the film is shot also produces an overly cramped sense. Much of the Jude Law sequence seems to have been shot through the windows of the caf and from one angle. The Memphis sequence is like that as well.The story about relationships rarely springs to life in more than in fits and starts. Its all moments not a whole film. I have no idea why Elizabeth goes traveling other than as an excuse to meet the people we meet. It fragments the film and takes us away from the most interesting thing in the film the chats with Jude Law.The cast is good with the up and down Natalie Portman in up mode as a gambler who meets Norah Jones fair at the start but gets better as it goes in Nevada and travels around with her. Rachel Weisz as the wife of the Memphis cop is far from English herself as a woman with a thick southern accent.The joy of the film is the music. This has a stunning soundtrack that drives the film when the writing lets everything else drift. I kept going just to hear the music.The weakest of Kar Wai's films I've seen. There is a good movie in here but it needs to be remade.I'd love to see the Jude Law bits in a different context".

	schema:headline " All about unfinished business";
	schema:reviewBody "It is a delightful story with beautiful cinematography. But compared with previous works of WKW My Blueberry Nights does not touch me as much. Elizabeth the main character never got too involved with the people she met in her soulsearching journey. At best she was just a companion and observer without evoking any transformation of others. Nonetheless there is something special in each character that make the story interesting. Jeremy and Lynn are particularly intriguing to me.Lynn said she did not hate Arnie a husband she deserted a while ago. All she wanted was him letting her go. She turned to one guy after the other. After Arnie's death she decided to leave Memphis where she felt suffocated for living in a small town. I simply couldn't help asking why she did not leave for a place she liked before Arnie's death? Why did she allow herself to be tangled with her husband and torture him as if he had ruined her life? What prevented her from doing what she wants? It seemed that she just knew what she did not want  Arnie. But what did she want? Is there a purpose served by the enmeshment between them? It seems to me that Lynn has an unaccomplished life goal of her own. She wanted to fly but failed. Instead of facing up to her own problem and looking for the ways to fly she not only put the blame on Arnie but also aimlessly played the role of an untamable wife as set up for her by Arnie's neediness and possessiveness. For Lynn Arnie is responsible for her unhappiness so Arnie should be hated and punished for dragging her down. And so she is apathetic to Arnie's suffering. Not until Arnie died did she realize all the problems were actually lying within her. It was she who did not dare to make a choice for herself but followed the path paved for her by others. It was she denying herself a life she wanted. When she cried over Arnie at the site of the car crash was she also crying for her failure to recognize her avoidance of selfdetermination? Jeremy has the typical personality that most male characters have in Wong Kar Wai's movies that is stubbornly persistent sentimental sensitive observant empathetic but selfabsorbed sometimesas well as reticent. Personally speaking Jeremy is even more lovable because he enjoys eating desserts! He kept all the keys dropped by his restaurant customers because he did not want to decide for them who can or cannot enter their lives. He said by keeping the keys he left the door open for the key owners. Philosophical as it sounds how much is this actually the projection of his wish on those who gave up their keys? Doesn't it make sense that giving up the key already means a final decision of ending a relationship? Yet he believed that some customers might return to take back the keys. I think he believed so just as much as he wished Katya his previous lover to pick up his key and come back to him. She did come back eventually  only to say goodbye however.

As a WKW's fan bitterness soared up to my chest once I heard the harmonica version of Yumeji's theme  score from In the Mood for Love  being played in the background for the scene where the two of them were watching the tape which evidenced the betrayal of Elizabeth's boyfriend. It is the best part of the whole story because it shows how a subtle empathetic act beautifully brings upon a big impact on two people. Liz was inspired to work on her unfinished business by hitting the road so as to get ready for new love while Jeremy was so moved by Liz's genuineness towards love that he opened his heart again.".

	onyx:emotionText "It is a delightful story with beautiful cinematography. But compared with previous works of WKW My Blueberry Nights does not touch me as much. Elizabeth the main character never got too involved with the people she met in her soulsearching journey. At best she was just a companion and observer without evoking any transformation of others. Nonetheless there is something special in each character that make the story interesting. Jeremy and Lynn are particularly intriguing to me.Lynn said she did not hate Arnie a husband she deserted a while ago. All she wanted was him letting her go. She turned to one guy after the other. After Arnie's death she decided to leave Memphis where she felt suffocated for living in a small town. I simply couldn't help asking why she did not leave for a place she liked before Arnie's death? Why did she allow herself to be tangled with her husband and torture him as if he had ruined her life? What prevented her from doing what she wants? It seemed that she just knew what she did not want  Arnie. But what did she want? Is there a purpose served by the enmeshment between them? It seems to me that Lynn has an unaccomplished life goal of her own. She wanted to fly but failed. Instead of facing up to her own problem and looking for the ways to fly she not only put the blame on Arnie but also aimlessly played the role of an untamable wife as set up for her by Arnie's neediness and possessiveness. For Lynn Arnie is responsible for her unhappiness so Arnie should be hated and punished for dragging her down. And so she is apathetic to Arnie's suffering. Not until Arnie died did she realize all the problems were actually lying within her. It was she who did not dare to make a choice for herself but followed the path paved for her by others. It was she denying herself a life she wanted. When she cried over Arnie at the site of the car crash was she also crying for her failure to recognize her avoidance of selfdetermination? Jeremy has the typical personality that most male characters have in Wong Kar Wai's movies that is stubbornly persistent sentimental sensitive observant empathetic but selfabsorbed sometimesas well as reticent. Personally speaking Jeremy is even more lovable because he enjoys eating desserts! He kept all the keys dropped by his restaurant customers because he did not want to decide for them who can or cannot enter their lives. He said by keeping the keys he left the door open for the key owners. Philosophical as it sounds how much is this actually the projection of his wish on those who gave up their keys? Doesn't it make sense that giving up the key already means a final decision of ending a relationship? Yet he believed that some customers might return to take back the keys. I think he believed so just as much as he wished Katya his previous lover to pick up his key and come back to him. She did come back eventually  only to say goodbye however. After that Jeremy got rid of all those keys and changed his restaurant for a new look. This clearly shows that Jeremy finally put an end to his unfinished business and opened a new door for himself.

	schema:reviewBody "I liked this movie. Imagine a teenager named John the typical guy who goes to the last year of high school and doesn't quite know what to do with his life. Then one day he finds a beautiful woman lying on the floor in a field who apparently is on the run for something she did and takes her to his room. It's a boarding school he might get kicked out but he doesn't care he just wants to help her. The look on his face when the woman first wakes up and the teenager walks towards her is the first sign of a magical performance by Lukas Hass it's a look that combines the excitement of having this woman in his bed and the curiosity of wanting to know what she might have done.The woman is called Patty Vare played by the wonderful Winona Ryder in the kind of role she knows by heart but never forgets to add new elements to. Here besides appearing to be somewhere other than the real world she fell off a horse before John found her and doesn't remember much she masters the 'look' that seductive look only she can achieve and makes anyone go crazy to the point that they would do anything for her. Well at least that's the effect it had on John in the movieAnd on me of course.But don't get things wrong. I personally don't think Boys is a romantic movie even if it was writerdirector Stacy Cochran's intention. I would call it some kind of an 'age analysis'. Yes there are romance related moments that make you smile because Winona is an expert on the subject but this time her character Patty is an expert too on men. So the study the film tries to make is what can happen when a woman of Patty's experience meets a kid like John in an extreme situation.That's why Cochran shows us flashbacks of what happened to Patty before meeting John they're necessary for us to know the kind of woman she is. On the other hand we don't know anything about John but the fact that he has a bad relationship with his father a respectable Chris Cooper. But we don't need to know because we realize when he is with Patty when we hear what he says and see what he does.There's a scene in the town fair where Patty and John are together in the merrygoround. The final moment of that scene explains why I liked this movie and those are the scenes in the movie that work. Not the police subplot led by a convincing John C. Reilly not John's relationship with his friends at school although some scenes are good to watch more of Hass' perfect work not even the conflict with his father.There's another scene really worth paying attention too a chat in a table where a beautiful light from the window makes Patty seem so vulnerable. Luckily for us this is a movie where we have the final world about whether we believe the characters or not and about the inconclusive and farfetched ending. Yes it may not honor reality itself but Boys honors its title and I liked that. I liked this movie.".

This is really one of those movies that keeps on giving. I have seen it about four times over the years and each time I have caught another subtle detail that made me realize how well this was made. I would not however recommend this movie to anyone who must see high action to enjoy a movie. There is quite a bit of dialogue and you won't hear much noise in the background. And I must comment on the soundtrack lighting and clothing of this movie which really add to the mood. The main characters in this movie both want to escape from their current situations and I found myself wanting to escape with them. You should definitely catch this one.".

In a weird sort of way it has a bit of the Love Story appeal. There is just something about it that can't be explained. A lot of the appeal has to do with winona ryder she has never looked more magnetic...trust me. She actually does a very good acting job with this in fact she probably saves the movie with her appeal and acting skills. There are certain scenes in this flick that will just float you away...like the one where the two main characters make love in the woods behind the carnival...classic. The first fifteen minutes are very interesting also. To sum up a rambling review just let me say this is one for are searching for something poetic and different in a movie. This is one for the fans of beautiful sensitive people falling leaves and cobblestone paths.".

	schema:reviewBody "This flawed film came out of nowhere the other night. We don't know if it ever was released commercially but it appears to have gone straight to video. As much as we wanted it to be better Boys suffers from a screen play that doesn't fully expand on its characters and leaves us wishing and waiting for more.Stacy Cochran who adapted the short story by James Salter sets her story in what appears to be a prep school in New England. This is a school for privileged kids sent by their families to get an education. By having attended this institution will probably ensure the rich boys access to prestige colleges and universities later on.Into this quiet background another darker story happens involving the rich careless and perhaps promiscuous Patty Vare who has had a terrible experience when a baseball player takes her on a night ride that is leading to sex when the car plunges into a river. Patty who is questioned by the police is seen riding her horse as the memory of the previous night comes haunting her memory. In attempting a jump over a fence she and the horse fall and she is hurt.Enter John Baker a student from the school who is alerted by another student about the young woman he has found in a field nearby. John decides to take her into his dorm against house rules. They end up going away ending in the county fair in a night that ends up in a romantic note but Patty. realizing she wants not to implicate John disappears. John's parents come to the school and they are helpless to put any sense into his head. That morning Patty and John meet again in the police station. It's clear they have found one another and no one will separate them.The two main roles Patty and John are given excellent readings by Winona Ryder and Lukas Haas. Both show great chemistry in their scenes together. Unfortunately other characters don't fare that well. There is Fenton who helps Patty escape whose presence is never justified well. As played by James LeGros he is an enigma. His girlfriend Jilly is acted by Catherine Keener in a role where she is totally wasted. Chris Cooper and Jessica Harper play John's angry parents.The film is not a total failure because of our interest in Patty and John. Perhaps with another director and a better screen play a better film would have resulted although Ms. Cochran and her cinematographer Robert Elswith give the production a lovely sheen with the local color of the country in autumn the county fair seen from a distance and the staid prep school.".

There is one scene that might be the best example the scene in which Jonh wakes up near the fair you can almost feel the coolness of that autumn morning and can imagine how he feels realizing the girl isn't there anymore and he is all alone once more. This movie in a way is about how people sometimes just do not want everybody to know everything about them. The girl keeps it a secret what happened to her the boy does not tell anyone about the girl he found.

The romance between her and Lukas Haas is unbelievable and awkward and there's zero chemistry the scenes in the dormitory are boring I just can't name any redeeming features except for the beautiful Maryland scenery. And there's a scene where there's all this Spanish being spoken and NO subtitles. Ridiculous. I know some people enjoyed this movie and I respect that but if you decided to see this thinking it'd be another Winona classic forget it. Oh and as for the mystery of What's up with Patty? well by the time we find out I really didn't care anymore. Sorry Winona you CAN and HAVE done MUCH better than this. 1.5 stars for the scenery.

The guys in it are kinda goodlooking and pretty funny if you're willing. And I have to say I love the picture of Winona Ryder on the movie cover she has a certain look to her that's just mysterious and attractive. I heard that the script of this movie changed and after Winona heard about that she didn't like it and wanted to refuse to be in it so she must've been very unwilling to this movie during filming.. you can kind of tell if you pay close attention too. I wouldn't recommend renting it or buying it cuz it comes on tv all the time and if your bored enough I'm sure you'll enjoy it.".

A great film should be owned  added to the person's Movie Library. I think this film probably 1 day will become a classic.

Boys  the title has wandered in from some gay porno flick shopping list  is for all intents and purposes a bad movie and even nice film critics have been mean to it. But if this is a failure this is not your average failure. Oh no. It has moments and an interesting borderline cultish cast. Skeet Ulrich is almost forgotten but in his fleeting appearances he has a dysfunctional neediness luminous sex appeal a scary attraction  you see that also in As Good As It Gets where he robs and beats up Greg Kinnear. There's something dangerous  and expendable  about Skeet. We may think of John C. Reilly in PT Anderson's Magnolia and see that same homely touching appeal on idle here in his Maryland State Police role. This was probably the only time the mercurial offbeat Lucas Haas was conventionally cute enough to match up with a pretty  at times quite beautiful  girl like Winona. And her dazed outofit quality  she's clearly a young lady who makes nothing but wrong choices in men  contributes to the curiously touching moments the two have in the amusement park when the high school boy briefly but intensely falls for the 25yearold and proposes marriage and eternal loyalty and they kiss sweetly and the rest of the world disappears. That's the high point. Now there's nothing more tedious than the boys in the opening segment nattering at each other threatening to rat on each other but curious to get in on any trouble that's going to come downbut the way they behave and look in this movie is completely natural and believable. Like most real schoolboys they're likely to bore each other to death before they'll ever enter into some sort of Lord of the Flies adventure. Chris Cooper  what is he doing here? He's playing an archetypal father the one we don't see in Dead Poets Society the flipside of his twisted military dad in American Beauty. James LeGros and Catherine Keener complete the surprising cast. Using a classic college campus  St. Johns Annapolis  for a fancy prep school works and heightens the posh effect. The movie doesn't altogether work otherwise. It's energy is sluggish it has no drive.. But you come back to it looking for something that didn't come together but might have because some choice ingredients were there. And won't come this way again.. Check out Haas in Johns dated the same year with David Arquette for another good offbeat role a wilder quirkier one that also seems to fit him like a soft old glove. He's never had the role he deserves but what an actor. James Salter whose story this is based on is a very fine writer. The music isn't inappropriate it's just obtrusively loud the way schoolboys would play it if they weren't being properly supervised.".

These are two completely separate films. Do you know why? What originally began as a film about some soulful and youthful teens trying to get to the ultimate dance party has now transformed into this clich morality tale that demonstrates the power of friendship and the strength of humility. WHAT! Is that why I wanted to watch this film? I apologize but one of the few reasons that I liked House Party was because they followed the K.I.S.S. method for those unfamiliar it is the Keep It Simple Stupid method of filmmaking. In the original becoming a lyricist a ladies man and having the best party in town was the root of the film. While there was a romantic side to the story it fell second nature to the growing hiphop scene. It was a dance film first developed character story second. Honestly that is what I enjoyed about the film. While I didn't think House Party was the greatest release of the century it did have this genuine feel about it. In fact after watching this poorly crafted sequel I have a bit more respect for the original. Where was the dancing? Where was the creativity? Where was the same Kid  Play that I remembered from the first House Party? They were nowhere to be found in this trashy sequel.Robin Harris. We all remember him as Pop from the original film but what we do not realize about this humorous comedian is that he subsequently changed the image of the House Party series. In the original he was this father trying to steer his son into a path of academia instead of rap and parties in the sequel he plays a spirit who annoyingly hounds Kid throughout the film with flashbacks from the original. Due to his death he brings nothing new to the table yet this entire sequel seems to be focused around those few short words that he used in the first film. I don't mean to be rude but I never felt that the father was such a big element in the original. I thought that Kid trying to challenge authority to attempt to find himself was the underlying meaning of the original while in this one it is Kid repressing his true self in hopes to make his dead father happy. Where did the lightness of the original go? I watched House Party 2 thinking that there is a limit that the writers could go without making Kid seem totally whipped by his father's words but we never hit that limit. Where anywhere in this film was Kid trying to find his rap roots? I needed to see a young man still interested in becoming the lyricist that he once desired to be? Why did he have to grow up so fast? In fact the rap sidestory to this film seems to be the negative element. We have gone from loving the genre to completely disrespecting it in one film. Ah the power of the sequel.Martin Lawrence was again completely annoying to the point in which I completely tuned him out whenever he spoke. He brought nothing to the story and nothing to the main characters. Lawrence was nothing more than a familiar face for the audience to relate to. In fact it is that dedication to familiar faces from the original that hurt this sequel. When the ultimate PAJAMA JAM finally does occur one hour into this short film we are hit with an barrage of repetitive scenes of aged rappers and comedians from the original who do nothing but repeat their lines actions and emotions from the first. While many may enjoy these familiar faces I felt as if it were a cheap trick used to make me feel more comfortable about the film. If these minor characters had done more than just repeat their lines than maybe I would have bought into the trick but instead all I saw were cheap repetitive motions used by writers to fill time. I used the word repetitive several times in this paragraph because it demonstrated the annoying repetitive nature of this film and completed my point about using that element as a cheap trick. I hope it worked.In most television series especially the cheapened kind we sometimes hear a laugh track or a sound machine used to create some zany or wacky sound that lightens the mood and creates the viable laugh point. In House Party 2 I do believe that the sound guy was extremely drunk or possibly working his first day in the booth. There were more sound effects in this film than in a Bobby McFerrin music video. Was this a child's movie or another urban comedy? Neither Kid nor Play could do anything in this film without a zip zim or a whoosh or a ding dong noise happening somewhere in the background. This was a fresh element to the sequel which direly needed to be taken away. There is a chase scene near the end of the film which felt like PeeWee Herman choreographed it with all the unsettling sounds that were happening. After the first twenty minutes of this it because increasingly annoying to the point of insanity.Overall this sequel soils the original. The themes were sporadic i.e. in one instance we are talking about the oppression of the African American while in the other the directors seem to be building ageold stereotypes the characters continued towards their bland downward spiral those annoying randomly placed racist police officers were back and the dominating father element seemed too serious for the overall theme of this film. I hope this film wasn't an indication of the path of colleges in the future? House Party 3 don't fail me now!Grade  out of ".

After the first twenty minutes of this it because increasingly annoying to the point of insanity.Overall this sequel soils the original. The themes were sporadic i.e. in one instance we are talking about the oppression of the African American while in the other the directors seem to be building ageold stereotypes the characters continued towards their bland downward spiral those annoying randomly placed racist police officers were back and the dominating father element seemed too serious for the overall theme of this film. I hope this film wasn't an indication of the path of colleges in the future? House Party 3 don't fail me now!Grade  out of ";

I am please to say the first two House Parties are not one of them. The best part about this movie is its blackness the people are so down home its funny. Kid and Play are all right but Martin Lawerence is superb as Bilal loud abrasive and full of expletives suggesting maternal incest. Also great are Full Force playing the goons the ad lib rap in Plays record shop is not to be missed. Its a shame they become friends at the end. These goons become the Keystone cops of Blackness and of course those racist cops. This movie is so 91 it hurts. We have all the record companies named after BBD songs fruity shirts and flat tops everywhere. This is a time too where fluro was in and there was no commercial gangsta rap. This movie if nothing else is splittingly funny even the fat dude having sex and then chasing everyone with a gun going Goddamn peep show mf's. This movie is slammin and is what rap is all about. Its a shame that they had to ruin it in 1994 with Immature Where are they now? and half ass acting.".

No because that's a phase that people grow out of when they are removed from the artificial environment of a university and have to spend their time dealing with the real world.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is both ordinary and extraordinary. I have to confess I almost passed on it after reading a review on this site where the reviewer named Kat Dennings as his favorite actress. I couldn't imagine that. I was a fan of 2 broke girls in the beginning but drifted away from it because I felt it continued to go in a more and more ridiculous direction. I also saw Kat in the Thor movies and felt there wasn't ever going to be anything special about her.I was wrong. This movie touched me in so many ways I hardly know where to start. Having dealt with addictions and a major depressive order I feel I'm qualified to comment further. I was captivated by the story which on its own unfortunately is a common and ordinary one these days. There is a lot to grasp and the pace is neither quick or slow somehow they got it just right and that in itself is huge. The movie is honest and unapologetic and Kat nailed it. At times I related personally and at others I was reminded of someone in my life. I was totally captivated. The fact that this story is based on a true story was secondary for me.What made this movie extraordinary for me was that they never really tried to offer a solution. They never tried to preach. Anybody who has ever sought recovery knows it is a very personal and heartwrenching journey that can't be done alone. This movie somehow captured that. I expected right from the start to see Kat come out as that brassy bold woman we all know and love or not but that wasn't the case. She portrayed perfectly a troubled girl who battled her demons and never felt quite like she was winning. She somehow made me feel like I was seeing something private and I wasn't supposed to be there at all. The supporting cast was great as well. there were noticeable issues in personality changes in a couple of the characters but nothing major. The story forgives itself. This is a must see movie. If for no other reasons than to give your heart a gift. Thank you for this.".

After the movie my troupe along with the parents that attended were given a packet of questions for the movie with questions asking about how we liked the movie and if we had done any of the stuff in the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "If you are expecting an intense Hollywood drama about a young woman's struggle with depression addiction selfinjury and suicide then don't watch this movie. This is not a Hollywood movie but the story of how Renee Yohe fell to rock bottom and more importantly how five friends supported her through her five days of detox. In fact it was independently produced and picked up by Sony for film distribution purposes.After those five days she entered detox and as a way to pay for her treatment and recovery her story was wrote by Jamie Tworkowski a friend who had stayed with her during those five days. They sold shirts on Myspace that funded her treatment. That publishing of the story and creation of the Myspace page led to millions of people discovering the origination and sharing their own stories.I would like to share is that this is not a religious movie though there are scenes in this movie that portray forms of Christianity. Those scenes are important to the lives of Renee Yohe and Jamie Tworkowski because they play a part not only in the original story but in their personal lives as well. I have been a supporter of the organization for quite some time now and although some individuals in the organization have religious beliefs the organization does not push people towards religion but rather provide a gap between awareness and recovery. A large portion of their funds are donated to recovery programs.The last thing that I would like to say as another user commented to say it was this is not a drug propaganda movie nor any other type of propaganda. It reflects the beliefs of the organization that treatment and recovery are very real and possible options and that hope is real.This is part of a girl's life and story that has changed the life of so many other people.".

Often times you find directors often cutting the film so often its like staring into a strobe light on full blast. This film is not afraid to do long cuts and as a result draws you into the film as if you are experiencing it yourself. Kat Dennings plays an amazing performance that has you feeling as if you are apart of everything and going through the same experiences as she is.The visual effects in this movie are also noteworthy. It brings you back to your childhood where every static thing becomes a reality moving breathing a lifehood of its own.If you have never watched this movie owe it to yourself and give it a go.

	schema:headline " The ambiguity and subtleties within every character's actions have been replaced with spoonfed notions of right and wrong.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a testament to the power of Straw Dogs' story Sam Peckinpah's adaptation of Gordon Williams' novel that the 2011 remake is still entertaining despite its numerous shortcomings in both complexity and artistry to its predecessor. Director Rod Lurie's retelling trades conflicted characters and intricate ideals of bravery and cowardice with plaindealing motives and basic revenge Peckinpah's flair for operatic visuals is sadly absent. So too is the contemplative nature of the whole affair  the ambiguity and subtleties within every character's actions have been replaced with spoonfed notions of right and wrong. It's impossible to avoid comparison to the original film and doing so would be a disservice to the discerning viewer. Those that loved Peckinpah's creation will likely find little value in Lurie's version but for those who haven't seen it the remake does offer a humble taste of the brilliance you're missing out on.Screenwriter David Sumner James Marsden and his wife Amy Kate Bosworth move to her old hometown of Blackwater Mississippi with the hopes of peace and quiet so he can write his newest script. When Amy's former boyfriend Charlie Alexander Skarsgard and his buddies Bic Drew Powell Chris Billy Lush and Norman Rhys Coiro are hired to repair the Sumners' garage the bullying of David and unwelcome advances toward Amy begin. As the taunts and threats steadily escalate to a horrific act of violence David must take a stand and defend his new home with an equal force of savagery.Everything questionable objectionable and controversial about the original Straw Dogs has been finely filtered out leaving a straightforward simple revenge story. None of the artistic violence symbolic editing or jarring music remains. This update goes so far as to spell out the significance of the title as well as adding the line maybe you should wear a bra which drastically dumbs down the purpose of Amy's appearance. If it weren't for the fact that the target audience is likely to have no knowledge of the 1971 version's existence this level of defining dulling and allaying disputatious content would be insulting.

	onyx:emotionText "It's a testament to the power of Straw Dogs' story Sam Peckinpah's adaptation of Gordon Williams' novel that the 2011 remake is still entertaining despite its numerous shortcomings in both complexity and artistry to its predecessor. Director Rod Lurie's retelling trades conflicted characters and intricate ideals of bravery and cowardice with plaindealing motives and basic revenge Peckinpah's flair for operatic visuals is sadly absent. So too is the contemplative nature of the whole affair  the ambiguity and subtleties within every character's actions have been replaced with spoonfed notions of right and wrong. It's impossible to avoid comparison to the original film and doing so would be a disservice to the discerning viewer. Those that loved Peckinpah's creation will likely find little value in Lurie's version but for those who haven't seen it the remake does offer a humble taste of the brilliance you're missing out on.Screenwriter David Sumner James Marsden and his wife Amy Kate Bosworth move to her old hometown of Blackwater Mississippi with the hopes of peace and quiet so he can write his newest script. When Amy's former boyfriend Charlie Alexander Skarsgard and his buddies Bic Drew Powell Chris Billy Lush and Norman Rhys Coiro are hired to repair the Sumners' garage the bullying of David and unwelcome advances toward Amy begin. As the taunts and threats steadily escalate to a horrific act of violence David must take a stand and defend his new home with an equal force of savagery.Everything questionable objectionable and controversial about the original Straw Dogs has been finely filtered out leaving a straightforward simple revenge story. None of the artistic violence symbolic editing or jarring music remains. This update goes so far as to spell out the significance of the title as well as adding the line maybe you should wear a bra which drastically dumbs down the purpose of Amy's appearance. If it weren't for the fact that the target audience is likely to have no knowledge of the 1971 version's existence this level of defining dulling and allaying disputatious content would be insulting. Extra references to the predominant themes such as the inclusion of research on Stalingrad further add to the intellectual affront.Minor details have changed but the basic ideas are still present.

If you have seen Sam Peckinpah's classic 1971 original with Dustin Hoffman and Susan George it is impossible to watch this remake without comparing the two films. Because of that these comments will include some comparative notes. After all it's been 40 years and most people watching this new version have never seen the original.Director Rod Lurie follows the Peckinpah version pretty closely with the obvious changes being a move from the English countryside to the deep south Mississippi and the main characters are now a screenwriter and actress instead of mathematical whiz and ... well whatever Susan George's character was in the original. Those are the obvious changes but not the most significant. I really missed the subtlety and psychological trickery delivered by Peckinpah especially in the relationship between David and Amy.Lurie chooses to take advantage of the physical screen presence of Alexander Skarsgard True Blood as Charlie the local stud and Amy's ex. Charlie's past exploits on the football field and his creepy leadership skills with his posse of thugs provide the yin of physical strength to the yang of David's intelligence. It's interesting to note that this version spells out SunTzu's description of straw dogs while Peckinpah left his audience to fend for themselves. But of course what this boils down to is just how far can a civilized person be pushed ... and how far is the bully willing to go? James Woods is a welcome and terrifying addition to the new version. Since it is based in the small town south high school football must play a role. Woods is the former high school coach who is now a violent drunk and still leader of his former players. He is a sadistic type who picks on Jeremy Niles Dominic Purcell the slowwitted brother of Daniel Walton Goggins and constantly accuses him of inappropriate behavior with his 15 year old cheerleader daughter.James Marsden Hairspray and Kate Bosworth Remember the Titans play David and Amy. They come back to Amy's childhood home so she can rest and David can have some peace and quiet while writing his screenplay on the Battle of Stalingrad. Well we couldn't really have him writing a romcom could we? From Day One the peace and quiet is clearly missing and Lynyrd Skynyrd wins out over Bach in the battle of radio volume. Tension builds and David is tested daily over what it means to be a man ... tested by the local hicks and doubted by his lovely wife.Things turn from bad to worse when the locals invite David to go hunting with them. What happens with Charlie and Amy during this time changes everything. This sequence was the key to the controversy of the original and what caused it to be banned in many cities and countries. Lurie chooses to handle it in a very straightforward manner  plus times and mores have changed quite a bit in the last 40 years.For me the Peckinpah original remains a classic film with brilliant psychological undertones which left me feeling very uncomfortable and questioning what I might do in this situation. Lurie's new version offered little of that but does work fine as a straightforward suspenseful thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "I expected this movie to be yet another terrible remake and turn it off after 15 minutes. But know know what? This was actually a good remake.While the movie is very similar to the original they did make some small changes here and there mainly in the characters background and their motivation  which might help explain some things that seemed a bit odd in the original for example why would a beautiful blonde marry a geek. Others may claim the writer ruined some ideas.It's hard and unfair to compare the actors' performance to Dustin Hoffman and David Warner in the original but I have to say that all the cast actually did a decent job. James Woods was excellent as a southern redneck and Kate Bosworth was surprisingly good too. I'm not familiar with any of the other actors who were all decent in their roles.The ending had some small changes too  again made in order for the characters to have a better motivation. Still I prefer the ending of the original which I recall was more intense and more surreal made to show a man protecting his castle.All in all this remake is much better than many of the recent remakes I've seen or chose to skip. Was this remake necessary? Probably not.510 Worth watching".

This was actually a good remake.While the movie is very similar to the original they did make some small changes here and there mainly in the characters background and their motivation  which might help explain some things that seemed a bit odd in the original for example why would a beautiful blonde marry a geek.

David whose pacifism is put to supreme test attempts to protect a dimwitted man Dominic Purcell who is suspected of disappearance and molesting a young girl Willa Holland  his house is put under siege by the incensed villagers  but David defends the mansion with ferocity .New but inferior version version about one of the most controversial violencethemed pictures of its day  dealing with a known plot  as a young American and his wife come to rural little town and face increasingly vicious local harassment. The film a remake of the controversially violent 1971 movie is considered fairly faithful to Sam Peckinpah's original though the location has been moved from Cornwall England to the U.S. Mississippi Gulf Coast and the hero's profession has been changed from an intellectual mathematician to screenwriter . The title comes from the Chinese philosopher Laotzu who wrote Heaven and earth are not humane and regard the people as straw dogs  Straw dogs were used as ceremonial objects for religious sacrifices in ancient China. The picture is as violent as the first version  in fact because of its graphic portrayal of violence and two brutal rapes the British Board of Film Censors banned the film from being released on video from 1984 until 2002.

	schema:reviewBody "THE PLOT A screenplay writer named David Sumner and his wife Amy move to a small Mississippi town to temporarily live in a fieldstone house that Amy grew up in. Her parents are dead and the property has been left unoccupied for a number of years. David and Amy go there to help repair the damages that were done to Amy's family barn due to Hurricane Katrina.Upon arriving there Amy runs into her exboyfriend from high school Charlie Venner who still clearly has feelings for Amy and is prepared to do anything to get her back. David does not pick up on this sadly and hires Charlie and his friends to come over to their place and help fix the roof of the barn that was damaged.Soon tensions begin to build between the couple and Charlie and his friends.THE CHARACTERS David Sumner  He is a pacifist and overall a nice man who doesn't like conflict and is very passive aggressive. While in Mississippi he is working on his newest screenplay and hopes staying in a rural area will help leave him undisturbed. When conflict rises between Amy and Charlie he tries very hard to be a diplomat.Amy Sumner  An excheerleader at the local high school left for California and has had a little success on a TV show.Charlie and his friends  Typical exhigh school jocks who can't seem to get over the past. They all at different times act very condescending towards David and Amy.Tom Heddon  The excoach of the local high school football team. Heddon is the leader of the group of Charlie and his friends who all once played football for him. He has a very bad temper. James Woods plays this role and he steals the show in my view. His performance is amazing. He is down right scary in this movie and made me more uncomfortable then any of the other characters. It's really no wonder Charlie and his friends are so messed up and have trouble getting over the past because they all look up to Heddon and he is just as guilty of holding onto the past and treating life like it's one big football game.MY THOUGHTSFor the most part I am not a fan of the remakes but I enjoyed this one. Mostly because I was able to relate to it since it's set in modern times in the United States of America. I'm also from the South and I know all about how down here some people try to force hunting high school football and church on you. And yet still sin like Satan. I also am aware how certain men cannot let go of their high school years.HOW THIS FILM COMPARES TO THE ORIGINAL What makes this film different then the original film is the main character David was not the hero in Sam Peckinpath's film. He was according to Peckinpah the bad guy of the movie. In the remake David is just a good man who is sadly caught between a rock and a hard place and is just trying to survive. Overall the remake took out the controversy and gave us a thriller of good vs. evil.WHO I THINK WILL ENJOY THIS FILM I think this is more of an adult film. People in their latetwenties and up will enjoy it. I also think people who have ever been bullied or made to feel like outsiders will enjoy this film as well. I also think mature adult couples will like it since facing conflict and standing up for your wife sometimes is all apart of having one.WHO I THINK WILL NOT ENJOY THIS FILM I think some of the testosteronefilled males in the teenage and college crowd and the young women who love them as well as the adult children will have trouble getting into this movie because they will be looking for violence but in this film the violence builds up. It doesn't just show violence and gore for the sake of it. There's no CGI no loud music no fast car chase scenes. Just a classic fishoutof water story.I think some people who don't like violence in movies should stay away from this one. I think some Christians won't like the movie due to the violence too andor some traditional Southerners and the people who love them as well as former or current popular high school kids because it portrays them all in a very negative light. It will show a side to them that they will not like and will not be able to handle.For the most part movies where high school football is the topic the characters are presented as cool people but this film shows how many outsiders view them and like I typed some former or current popular kids will have trouble dealing with that knowing not everyone liked or likes them and sees them as crazy and violent fanatics.FINAL THOUGHTS I think the pacing was wonderful. Not too fast not too slow. I enjoyed the instrumental soundtrack. It has a beautiful yet chilling sound to it which sums up some parts of the South in my view.In this film I don't think the lesson was just another stand up to the bullies movie. I think the lesson was learning how to accept those that are different from you.".

	schema:headline " Impefect Remake Of Peckinpah's Nightmarish ClassicBut I've Seen Much Worse";
	schema:reviewBody "It would appear that in the 21st century everything old is new again. And perhaps nowhere is that more true than in Hollywood. Whether it is in remakes or sequels Hollywood has this way of repeating itself. As a result it seems most unsettling that one of the films from the past that should be remade for a 21st century audience would be a film that when released near the end of 1971 caused extreme uproar because of its explicit violence and sexual material. The film in question is director Sam Peckinpah's controversial shocker STRAW DOGS which remains alongside Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE among the most hotly debated films of its time or any time in history. For whatever reason though Hollywood thought it needed an updating and so former film critic turned directorscreenwriter Rod Lurie stepped into the shoes of Bloody Sam to do it.Following both the film's original source material Gordon M. Williams' 1969 novel The Siege Of Trencher's Farm and the 1971 screenplay written by David Zelag Goodman and Peckinpah this particular version was moved from the original's setting on the Cornwall coast of England to a backwater town somewhere along the MississippiLouisiana border. James Marsden takes on the role of David Sumner played by Dustin Hoffman in 1971 who has come to this small Southern town with his wife Amy Kate Bosworth taking over for Susan George to work on a movie screenplay based on the 1943 battle of Stalingrad. And as it so happens his seeming demure nature puts the redneck boys down there in the position of superiority over him first when Bosworth's pet cat is found strangled in the closet then to make matters even more sinister when Bosworth is raped by her former boyfriend Alexander Skarsgard and another man Rhys Coiro.Marsden however comes to his senses when he takes in the local mental invalid Dominic Purcell who has unintentionally strangled the daughter Willa Holland of the town's exfootball coach James Woods. Woods Coiro and Skarsgard show up on Marsden's property and brutally demand that Purcell be handed over to them but Marsden knowing fully well what will happen to him Purcell and Bosworth does no such thing. The end result is ultraviolent mayhem in the film's last twenty minutes.Lurie who made two of the best films of the year 2000 DETERRENCE THE CONTENDER likely set himself up for a fall in trying to tone down the most objectionable parts of the Peckinpah original that made it in the eyes of some a fascist work of art the rape scene which is a bit too quickly done and a bit too aimed to show Bosworth as a feminist though she is every bit as traumatized as George was in the original and unwisely discounting the idea posited by Peckinpah and based on the works of noted anthropologist Robert Ardrey that Man's penchant for brutality and violence far from the common notion that they would go to any means to protect their property is ingrained in him from the start. The other thing that is objectionable about this new version of STRAW DOGS is that unlike the English village where Peckinpah sees the seemingly primitive villagers as every bit the match for Hoffman the ones in this small Southern town are the unfortunate stereotypical inbred rednecks especially Woods who normally a solid actor is allowed by Lurie to overact outrageously. And the siege though fairly well staged is nevertheless so hyperviolent that the audience becomes a tad bit detached instead of really being forced to confront their inner demons as Hoffman's character and to a great extent Peckinpah himself did in the original film. Whereas Peckinpah was deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking and not just a bloodandguts expert Lurie makes the mistake of trying to wrap everything up in a neat albeit very bloody package.Nevertheless despite these flaws that keep Lurie's film from reaching the nightmarish heights of Peckinpah's the 2011 STRAW DOGS features solid enough performances from Marsden and Bosworth who are able to capture the psychological torment that their characters feel. They are still in the shadow of what Hoffman and George did in 1971 but they are able to bring a certain kind of resolve and emotional gravitas to the situation that Lurie doesn't always provide in his direction or script. Larry Groupe's score though distractingly loud at times this in contrast to the subtlety of the original film's excellent Jerry Fielding score also works in those moments where it's supposed to. The end result is like many remakes rather imperfect. Still there have been far worse remakes that Hollywood has done and will yet do.".

	onyx:emotionText "It would appear that in the 21st century everything old is new again. And perhaps nowhere is that more true than in Hollywood. Whether it is in remakes or sequels Hollywood has this way of repeating itself. As a result it seems most unsettling that one of the films from the past that should be remade for a 21st century audience would be a film that when released near the end of 1971 caused extreme uproar because of its explicit violence and sexual material. The film in question is director Sam Peckinpah's controversial shocker STRAW DOGS which remains alongside Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE among the most hotly debated films of its time or any time in history. For whatever reason though Hollywood thought it needed an updating and so former film critic turned directorscreenwriter Rod Lurie stepped into the shoes of Bloody Sam to do it.Following both the film's original source material Gordon M. Williams' 1969 novel The Siege Of Trencher's Farm and the 1971 screenplay written by David Zelag Goodman and Peckinpah this particular version was moved from the original's setting on the Cornwall coast of England to a backwater town somewhere along the MississippiLouisiana border. James Marsden takes on the role of David Sumner played by Dustin Hoffman in 1971 who has come to this small Southern town with his wife Amy Kate Bosworth taking over for Susan George to work on a movie screenplay based on the 1943 battle of Stalingrad. And as it so happens his seeming demure nature puts the redneck boys down there in the position of superiority over him first when Bosworth's pet cat is found strangled in the closet then to make matters even more sinister when Bosworth is raped by her former boyfriend Alexander Skarsgard and another man Rhys Coiro.Marsden however comes to his senses when he takes in the local mental invalid Dominic Purcell who has unintentionally strangled the daughter Willa Holland of the town's exfootball coach James Woods.

But once I read the casting and saw the trailer I became excited for the remake. I was not let down. Straw Dogs is one of the most intense films I've seen in years.Straw Dogs 2011 did right what so many other remakes do wrong. It didn't alter the story drastically or disrespect the original's legacy. The director simply rebooted and modernized the tale for a new generation. Everything that shocked you and every scene you loved in the original is still in the remake. The change of setting actually benefited the film and gave it a little more realism in terms of violence and social dysfunction.The violence is high and the rape scene is disturbing. But the acting was top notch by everyone involved. James Marsden did a great job playing the weak timid and quiet intellectual who eventually turns into the strong violent and manly protector. His performance was very Hoffman essque but he still made the role his own. I think a lot of girls came to the film solely for Alexander Skarsgard true blood fans and they were generally disturbed by his turn as a heel. There were a lot of gasps during a particular bear trap scene. Bosworth Woods and Purcell were all perfect in their roles as well.Straw Dogs is as raw interesting and powerful as it's original. A film that deals with aggression manhood and human connections pushed to the extremes. There are many subtleties in the performances and some great metaphorical images. A great thriller that literally intensifies until it's satisfying climax. Best film I've seen in months.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a warm up for this picture I watched the Peckinpah version just last week having seen it during it's initial release back in 1971 and one other time a couple of years ago. I'm generally predisposed to original films and not their sequels so my antenna was up for this picture figuring that I would likely be disappointed on one hand while realizing that films made today make the most of a grittier and more intense style when it comes to themes of violence and revenge. I'm going to go out on a limb and take the minority view here so far as I found the picture to be a worthy remake and a compelling story in it's own right.I think if you've seen the original the comparisons will be inevitable and virtually impossible to ignore given a screenplay that utilizes much of the very same dialog. Moving the story from the English countryside to the deep South was an interesting decision setting up an expectation of redneck hostility against the refined sensibilities of the Sumners James Marsden and Kate Bosworth. Reprising the Dustin Hoffman role as David Sumner I think Marsden did a fairly credible job knowing that he'd be compared to an actor who's established himself as one of the modern day legends.Regarding Rod Lurie's reworking of the screenplay I think there were a couple of points to consider that distinguish the story versus Peckinpah. The first has to do with the hunting trip. When Hoffman's character killed a fowl in the earlier picture he conveyed a sense of disgust at the idea of killing a defenseless bird further adding to the image of his character with no backbone. When Marsden brings down the deer I had a somewhat different impression. It looked to me that this was a moment when his character realized that he was capable of killing an inkling that the mayhem soon to follow would not be an entirely foreign concept.Another more compelling treatment of the rewrite had to do with Amy Sumner. Peckinpah created a distinct ambiguity in the rape scene with his original screenplay. Susan George was torn between revulsion and horror against her assailants and a questionable identification with her one time boyfriend Charlie. One could almost say that she went along with Charlie in a convoluted payback for her husband's weakness as a man. I didn't get the same sense with the way Bosworth handled the scene. She was entirely repulsed and humiliated violated in a way that left her totally defeated and helpless. It gave more credibility to the way she would seek her revenge when Charlie Alexander Skarsgard and Norman Rhys Coiro square off against each other during the home invasion.Let's face it though the real reason to see this picture if you know anything about the 1971 version is the finale when David Sumner decides to cut loose and defend his wife and property. For some reason I found it surprising that the rowdy hillbillies led by Coach Heddon James Woods would be dispatched in the exact same manner in the very same chronology as executed by Hoffman's character. I have to say the nail gun on Chris was an effective improvement over a length of wire. Scalding the coach and having him shoot himself in the foot seemed a lot more painful this time around when it was James Woods on the receiving end. This time though the old bear trap maneuver was distinctively more graphic and satisfying not to mention bloody. Poor Charlie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original 1971 Straw Dogs is one of my favorite films of all time. Rod Lurie's update of Straw Dogs is a major improvement in several ways.The most obvious being Kate Bosworth's character Amy. No longer is Amy a one dimensional evil back stabbing temptress. Amy can still be a petulant child but she is no longer driven by spite. This is an important distinction and prevents her character from becoming one of them betraying David earning the audiences anger and losing their understanding. Amy still relaxes about mid way thru the rape not because she is excited but because she is disgusted with Charlie and with herself. Let me be clear she doesn't blame herself for the rape! she's disgusted that she could ever have desired Charlie in the first place. Charlie realizes he has completely deluded himself and lost Amy in the worst way imaginable. Amy no longer sees Charlie as a human being never mind her old high school flame. It is with this realization that Charlie DOES stop being human and turn his back on Amy....high school..homecoming king..all his past accomplishments and also his future. Amy's cries for help fall on deaf ears. Kate Bosworth exhibits a depth here I didn't know she had. Her character of Amy though flawed and STILL not as well developed as David and Charlie is quite an accomplishment. You have no doubt where her emotions lie during some pretty raw complex scenes. Alexander Skarsgard is equally if not more impressive. His performance of Charlie is nothing short of revelatory. Charlie is an ubervillian not only did he rape David's wife he set up David to be killed! AND IT WAS PREPLANNED! This is a bad guy! Yet Skarsgard is able to bring layers to the character that make you feel sorry for Charlie no pun intended! His constant struggle to get out from underneath the shadow that has haunted him since high school. The shadow that James Woods' Coach represents. The shadow that Amy and David have evaded. The shadow that engulfs him the shadow that makes him HATE them Amy  David. In the middle of these two is of course our hero antihero? David Sumner. The center piece the force around which the others gravitate. Without a strong performance here the movie falls apart. James Marsden has always been capable in the XMen movies but whereas in the comics Cyclops is THE leader in the movies Marsden just kind of fades into the background giving up the lead to Wolverine. His performance here makes me want to believe its more than just a oneoff. From slapping the hundred dollar bill on the bar he has no idea he's insulting them to shooting the deer in the forest tragic? to the end scene I got them all is that a smile on his face? this is an Oscar worthy performance. A multilayered performance to his character that just wasn't there in the original. Which brings us to Rod Lurie. First thing I realized when I started watching his 2011 version of Straw Dogs is Mr. Lurie knows the original AND is a huge fan. This is not a remake nor an homage so much as a realization of the potential of the original material. Peckinpah's Straw Dogs has always been a flawed masterpiece by those who love it myself included. Dustin Hoffman is at his peak Susan George gives the performance of her career. David Warner God himself would never be better. The build up to the climax is unbearable. But there are problems. Amy's former friends are interchangeable. The two leads themselves are hard to emphasize with. Amy isn't just childish she's vain opportunistic and she stabs David in the back to save her own skin we won't go into the rape is enjoyable misogynist fantasy here. Davis IS a coward he ran from the states not because he was avoiding the war but because he wants to avoid the CONFLICT over the war. Not exactly admirable. Throughout the movie David and Amy's snipes at each other are made out of spite and escalate accordingly. Unlikeable characters. And they are the two leads! I can't tell you the names of Charlie's friends in the original but I can tell you they're names after one viewing of the remake. This is where Rod Lurie shines. He has filled the movie out in ways few people would realize. For instance no longer is David a mathematician above Amy's head now he's a writer she's an actor. They are on equal ground. this is a significant change in establishing their relationship. In Lurie's version David is no longer the failed father figure to Amy's ingnue. David even worked as the writer on Amy's TV show in the new version! Amy and David have a confidence both in themselves and as a couple not on display in the original. Something Charlie clearly lacks. He's still there. Lost in the past. And here again Mr. Lurie is able to fill this in by putting the story in the gulf coast. Not only have the local boys lost their youth and their football dreams they have lost their self respect and their future....there is no work! Mr. Lurie drives this home by having David !?! talk of the economy and of course when he has Miss Bosworth say They don't need sympathy they need jobs. Some other nice touches on Mr. Lurie's part that add exceptional resonance to the characters having James Woods Character Coach drive most of the reprehensible action. He's still coaching the boys! How humiliating! A point driven home even further when he has Norman say You're the quarterback at the exact moment Charlie realizes he is nothing but a follower and always will be. Strong Stuff. This isn't a remake a reimagining or a reboot. It is as Peckinpah would say Just damn good film making.".

First thing I realized when I started watching his 2011 version of Straw Dogs is Mr. Lurie knows the original AND is a huge fan. This is not a remake nor an homage so much as a realization of the potential of the original material. Peckinpah's Straw Dogs has always been a flawed masterpiece by those who love it myself included. Dustin Hoffman is at his peak Susan George gives the performance of her career. David Warner God himself would never be better. The build up to the climax is unbearable. But there are problems. Amy's former friends are interchangeable. The two leads themselves are hard to emphasize with. Amy isn't just childish she's vain opportunistic and she stabs David in the back to save her own skin we won't go into the rape is enjoyable misogynist fantasy here. Davis IS a coward he ran from the states not because he was avoiding the war but because he wants to avoid the CONFLICT over the war. Not exactly admirable. Throughout the movie David and Amy's snipes at each other are made out of spite and escalate accordingly. Unlikeable characters. And they are the two leads! I can't tell you the names of Charlie's friends in the original but I can tell you they're names after one viewing of the remake. This is where Rod Lurie shines. He has filled the movie out in ways few people would realize. For instance no longer is David a mathematician above Amy's head now he's a writer she's an actor. They are on equal ground. this is a significant change in establishing their relationship. In Lurie's version David is no longer the failed father figure to Amy's ingnue. David even worked as the writer on Amy's TV show in the new version! Amy and David have a confidence both in themselves and as a couple not on display in the original. Something Charlie clearly lacks. He's still there. Lost in the past. And here again Mr. Lurie is able to fill this in by putting the story in the gulf coast. Not only have the local boys lost their youth and their football dreams they have lost their self respect and their future....there is no work! Mr. Lurie drives this home by having David !?! talk of the economy and of course when he has Miss Bosworth say They don't need sympathy they need jobs. Some other nice touches on Mr. Lurie's part that add exceptional resonance to the characters having James Woods Character Coach drive most of the reprehensible action. He's still coaching the boys! How humiliating! A point driven home even further when he has Norman say You're the quarterback at the exact moment Charlie realizes he is nothing but a follower and always will be. Strong Stuff. This isn't a remake a reimagining or a reboot. It is as Peckinpah would say Just damn good film making.";

	schema:reviewBody "I caught a screening of STRAW DOGS last week. Rod Lurie directed a tight film that kicks major ass.Firstly Lurie has assembled a dynamite cast James Marsden Kate Bosworth Alexander Skarsgard James Woods and even Walton Goggins who is absolute nitroglycerin in FX's Justified has a small role. The fact that Lurie was able to attract this cast speaks volumes for his reputation. Is this an awardworthy film? No. Is it a good time at the movies? Hell yes! A Hollywood screenwriter Marsden and his wife Bosworth are moving into a home in his wife's small rural hometown so he can write his new script Stalingrad in peace and tranquility. She had a small role in a TV show he once wrote but we get the impression she's washed up now she's one of the many Straw Dogs in the film a.k.a people who peaked to early but are now hollow and easily knockedaround and broken. Marsden is fantastic in the film. In fact he's never been better. He exhudes kindness and decency. He plays the soft city boy with a heart. The happy couple settle into their countryside mansion in the middle of a very isolated forest. In town they run into Bosworth's old flame Skarsgard. Skarsgard is everything that Marsden is not  tall rugged manly and dangerous. The quintessential bad boy that all girls are attracted to in their teens but eventually grow out of... or do they? There are two themes running through the film. The first and I'm not too sure I agree with this is that a man can only be a man if he resorts to violence in order to defend his wife. Lurie also straddles a dangerous line in the film by presenting us with a wife who is a provoker. Marsden kindly hires Bosworth's exboyfriend to fix the roof of the barn... and then Bosworth proceeds to jog around the forest in skimpy clothing no bra barefoot. She then complains to her husband that her former flame and his crew of roofers are eyeraping her. Marsden ever so kindly and he could've been an ass but wasn't suggests that maybe she should consider wearing a bra next time. Bosworth is obfuscated by this suggestion. So what does she do? Goes upstairs opens the bedroom window and proceeds to strip in front of Skarsgard and his crew. It's an ambivalent tough scene that says a lot about feminism power struggles in couples and highlights that actresses in real life and on film are a loopy bunch. Bosworth shines in this film. Playing both beautiful sexy and aloof. A tough combo but she pulls it off admirably. Therein lies the second theme of the film Do women want the stable dependable goodguy or do they have deep subconscious yearnings for a bad boy? So far the film is great. Fun setup and it's fun to see Marsden create his writing workspace   chalkboard with scenes and notes in a lovely dream office etc. Marsden is once again great in the film despite his thankless role  the pussyfied husband who must grow a brass coated set of testicles by the end of the film so his Southern Wife can finally respect him... and he eventually does in a realistic believable fashion to boot. I won't go into spoiler territory. There are a few nifty surprises and great performances all around. The siegelike ending is gangbusters. Violent and very unLurielike. Marsden rises to the occasion and all the plot strands come together. Woods is great as a drunken highschool football coach who doesn't want his teenage daughter flirting with the local developmentally delayed man Dominic Purcell. This is a remake of the Pekinpah classic that is famous for it's ambivalent rape scene. Therefore I'm not spoiling anything by saying that  Yes there is a fairly graphic rape. Yes Bosworth is ambivalent in the scene. Does she fight off her rapist as hard as she could during the rape? Nope. Does she kinda like it? Sure seemed like that to me which will surely infuriate the feminists out there. There's also an incredibly satisfying final kill that involves a bear trap.Straw Dogs is a good solid movie with great crowdcheering moments.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just got back from seeing THE ROAD.I had been very impressed by the novel and was concerned about how it would be adapted. The tone of the novel is almost unremittingly bleak and a 100 faithful adaptation would be very difficult to watch.I'm happy to report that the film is very good indeed. It solves the problem of being unendurably depressing by concentrating on the emotional impact of the unspecified Armageddon rather than the day to day fight for food shelter and so on. So while at times it remains very upsetting it is shot through with hope rather than despair. I always felt the end of the novel was somewhat out of kilter with the rest of it but in the film it seems quite appropriate.I think the film is more about the collapse of civility rather than civilization for a film that shows the last remnants of mankind struggling to eke out an existence it is remarkably concerned with relationships. That's probably why the exact cause of the catastrophe is left blank the film isn't really about the end of the world so much as the end of society. It's an interesting companion piece to NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in which an ageing man sees nothing but horror in the modern world. In THE ROAD a man convinces himself for the sake of his son that humanity will abide even in the face of appalling conditions.".

It solves the problem of being unendurably depressing by concentrating on the emotional impact of the unspecified Armageddon rather than the day to day fight for food shelter and so on. So while at times it remains very upsetting it is shot through with hope rather than despair. I always felt the end of the novel was somewhat out of kilter with the rest of it but in the film it seems quite appropriate.I think the film is more about the collapse of civility rather than civilization for a film that shows the last remnants of mankind struggling to eke out an existence it is remarkably concerned with relationships. That's probably why the exact cause of the catastrophe is left blank the film isn't really about the end of the world so much as the end of society. It's an interesting companion piece to NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in which an ageing man sees nothing but horror in the modern world. In THE ROAD a man convinces himself for the sake of his son that humanity will abide even in the face of appalling conditions.";

There's the nervous feeling one gets when watching the theatrical trailer though  will it be this super actionpacked spectacle will those images that open the trailer with THE END OF THE WORLD IS NEAR! stick around and will Charlize Theron actually be in the movie that much? As it turns out if you liked the book very much and worried about how its uberbleak and incredibly dark and especially gray landscapes would appear it provides that perfectly. And if you haven't read the book... it still works as a movie as a simplebutnot story of a father and son survival drama and clinging on to their humanity first and then a postapocalypse thriller far second.To describe the plot is not impossible but sort of unnecessary. All you need to know going in if you're part of notreadbook camp is that a father and son after becoming on their own after the mother of the house exits are traveling together across a true postapocalypse landscape to a coast. We never are given a fully clear explanation as to why or how the apocalypse happened. This is more than fine because John Hillcoat's film centers on the father and son called in the credits simply Father and Son played by Viggo Mortensen and Kodi SmitMcPhee there doesn't need to be anything really specific. At least this will be fine for most people who may be by now tired of the usual viral or religious or damn 2012type explanations. We're given hints though to be sure that there may have been mutations or some kind of earthbound phenomenon earthquakes happen a couple of times and past this we like the travelers are left to our own devices.How it happened isn't as fascinating and visually compelling anyway than how it looks. The Road provides us many scenes and vistas that are precisely grim and desolate and terrible. Some of these are full of visual details like big cityscape shots and others like when the Father and Son are on the ramp of a highway is intimate and hard this setting also provides one of the most touching moments as Mortensen's character finally 'lets go' of two important details from the deceased mother of his son. And other times Hillcoat lets us just take in the grayness of everything just as one could take in the sight of masses of flies in his film the Proposition. It's against this backdrop of rain and sludge and grime and decay that imbues this intense bond between the father and son so greatly and the complexity that comes with not just staying alive but retaining humanity and dignity and doing right and wrong by the people they encounter.This may not be news to people who read the book. I still having read it two years ago which sadly seems like long ago in usually remembering specific images of a book can't get the descriptions of scenes out of my head or the stark manner of how characters talked and dread and existential horror was relayed. But again the film not only respects this but gives it further life. Dialog scenes in the movie save for a couple of the flashback scenes with Charlize Theron's Mother character are never obtrusive to the storytelling which is a rightful concern to have with an adaptation of the book. And more importantly the acting and chemistry between the two leads is incredible. Mortensen is a given to be an actor embedded in his character so much so that when he takes off his shirt we see his bony torso as being really that and watching him is magnetic. Yet it's also crucial to see how good the kid SmitMcPhee is too especially when it comes time for scenes where the boy has to deal with his father's growing desperation or the electrifying showdown with a thief.To be sure a couple of walkon roles by Guy Pearce as another fellow traveler and especially Robert Duvall as a 90 year old man as his character says provide some needed space and Hillcoat has a couple of very wise flashbackdream bits with The Man and his wife namely a very small brilliant moment at a piano but it's the all on the two main character to lead the film and it's on them that it delivers so strongly. As long as you know that this is a film centered not on big action sequences though there are a couple and not on big special effects though there's that too and it's more akin to a lifeordeathandwhatelse story not unlike Grave of the Fireflies you'll know what you're getting with the Road. It is very depressing on the whole and not exactly what I would recommend as a 'firstdate' movie  unless you're so hot for Mortensen andor Cormac McCarthy you don't care either way. However it's good depressing and equally the best adaptation of the book possible while a tremendous original vision for the casual moviegoer.".

I can't imagine the bleak postapocalyptic world being portrayed any more realistically. I can't imagine the general feeling of sadness desperation hopelessness terror and pain being captured more accurately. If that was the goal the people involved in the making of this movie did their job magnificently. Having said that it isn't for everyone. I saw this movie alone because I had a feeling my wife wouldn't be into it. It's tough to watch. However in the midst of this recession brought on by greed and materialism I think it's a movie that everyone of age SHOULD see in order to put things back into perspective if only for a day. I had a lump in my throat through most of the movie and was desperate to get home and hug my two boys through most of it as well. I also felt like downsizing our entire life in terms of the unnecessary stuff we have. I imagined how many homeless people wander the streets right now with that feeling of hopelessness and desperation. What more could I ask from a Saturday afternoon at the theater? It's this kind of movie that helps maintain a degree of integrity in the film industry among the inaneness that surrounds it.".

Thru it trudge The Man Viggo Mortenson and The Boy Kodi SmitMcPhee slowly and painfully making their way to the coast where maybe things will be marginally better. Who can say?

In flashbacks to an achingly lost former life we see The Wife Charlize Theron.And really once you've named the names you've pretty well covered the movie.

Humans are apparently the only animals to survive the unnamed global disaster so they represent the sole remaining rapidly dwindling source of protein.

It is difficult to imagine 2 more disparate films in terms of tone and atmosphere. But both are extremely effective at making their respective worlds seem completely real.The movie is unremittingly grim and completely believable. It doesn't pull its punches or sell out. It will haunt you. It's unlikely that anyone else will ever make another movie that treats the end of the world so realistically so if you want to see the standard against which all others will be compared this is your chance.Stay away if you're depressed or prone to it and avoid razor blades for 12 hours afterward.".

Not only does the story accurately exhibit the polar opposite aspects of a post apocalyptic existence but the cinematography used during the flashbacks of a life full of color and hope many take for granted is excellently positioned with the dark dismal and often terrifying reality that is the Road.

	schema:reviewBody "It's not as good as the book. seems to be one of the most common sentences in discussions about movies. I have certainly uttered it many times. I try to judge a film on it's own merits as a separate art form but cannot help the comparison especially when elements that I love in a book are sacrificed in the translation to the screen especially if I felt the changes were made in service of some 2 hour time limit. I can only remember one time that I thought a movie improved on a book The Godfather and the Godfather Part 2. There are certainly many times I felt that a mediocre book served as the basis for a mediocre movie The DaVinci Code. Cormac McCarthy's works have generally translated well to the screen especially No Country for Old Men. The Road was one of the most wonderful books that I can remember  to create a sense of hope against an overwhelmingly dismal postapocalyptic backdrop is no small feat. As I read it I found myself sympathizing with the fears and frustrations for the man and at the same time completely drawn into the innocence and wisdom of the boy. I could not put the book down  I had to know the ending of this story.As I sat watching the movie I was right back in the book. John Hillcoat and Joe Penhall's collaboration made for a marvelous adaptation of this compelling story. Viggo Mortensen and Kodi SmitMcPhee were outstanding. The film editing and art direction in this picture really contribute to the overall postapocalyptic feel. The use of color in the otherwise gray backdrop was pure filmmaking genius. I was dragged to the height and depths of emotions and felt every anguish and small triumph experienced by the onscreen duo. In the end I experienced both the triumph and the uncertainty of the human condition. And felt that I had seen a movie that was as good as the book.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. The most recent adaptation of a Cormac McCarthy novel brought us the fantastic No Country for Old Men Coen Bros.. McCarthy's postapocalyptic The Road did not seem to set up well as filmed entertainment. Director John Hillcoat proves otherwise.Make no mistake. This film is as bleak and filled with despair as any you have ever seen. This is not the SFX of fluff like 2012. This is the humanistic side of desperation and survival in a world where what little has survived seems grotesque and evil.It is a phenomenal movie from a technical aspect yet a higher rating seems off the mark as so very few movie goers will find the entertainment value of such an achievement. While viewing one can't help but weigh the everpresent option of suicide. What would we do in this situation? Do you continue to carry the fire or do you ask what's the point and hit the eject trigger? If you thought Charlize Theron was unappealing in Monster you will find her absolutely intolerable here. Her beauty is overridden by her angst and unwillingness to continue the fight for her survival. Is she the rational one or totally selfish? Really good question.The vast majority of the film is Viggo Mortensen and Kodi SmitMcPhee on their quest for the coast ... their ultimate goal for survival. The gray and lifeless landscape would and doessuck the hope and soul right out of most. Viggo keeps trudging while teaching his young more sensitive son who by the way is a dead ringer for Charlize were she a 12 year old boy. The grayness of the film is so intense that the dreamflashback sequences couldn't help but make me wonder if life were black and white would dreams be vivid and colorful? Fans of No Country for Old Men will catch a glimpse of Garret Dillahunt as the hillbilly gang member who stumbles upon the Father and Son  Dillahunt was Tommy Lee Jones' entertaining deputy. Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce also have brief but welcome supporting roles. Duvall actually does quite a bit with his limited lines.While it seems odd to release this one at Thanksgiving  it's not in the tradition of massappeal holiday fare it is a must see for any true film lover or literature addict.

	schema:reviewBody "I really have got to get used to reviewing adaptations of books because they come out all the time. But reviewing them is so much different it almost doesn't seem fair. A movie like Watchmen would have seemed completely different had I not read the book. It just changes the playing field completely and usually not in a good way. However it's not going away anytime soon.Let me start by saying how I came across the book The Road by Cormac McCarthy. It was about two years ago this time and I was talking to my dorm parent about Children of Men a movie that was so clearly well made and excellent but I was left frustrated with it. Without giving too much away Children of Men left me with no closure because the entire purpose of the movie seemed to be finding the cure and the movie ends before they find it. In other words it left too much unsaid and for that storyline alone I gave it a 410. My dorm parent mentioned that if I didn't like Children of Men I probably wouldn't like The Road because it gives you absolutely no information about what happened it just tells you a story of a father and a son traveling in a postapocalyptic world. Intrigued and being a fan of Cormac McCarthy I bought the book at the airport and on my way home for Thanksgiving read the entire book. I really couldn't have imagined reading it any other way. Because the book has no chapters and because it is so engaging you have to read it in one sitting.A movie was inevitable from such a great story especially hot off of No Country For Old Men's success. And the road haha to this movie's release has been long and slow. It got delayed a whole year which made me apprehensive as to how good a film it was. So as I entered the movie theater last night almost two years to the date since I read the book I was nervous. Would this be another I Am Legend? Or would this capture the greatness of the book?The plot of the film and the movie are the same a father and a son are some of the last remaining people on earth after an unexplained tragedy has happened. The two are just trying to survive by heading south. Along the way they encounter many problems but the heart of the story is in the relationship between the two characters and the plot is minimal.Director John Hillcoat's last film The Proposition was an attempt to revive the dead genre of the Western. And it was brilliant in so many ways but I especially liked how the setting was displayed in the film. You can taste the nasty feeling of 1850 Australia in The Proposition. And that's why he's a great fit for The Road because he brings us into a setting very well. And in The Road he does this again maybe not as well but considering he has no source material other than the novel he does a very good job at conveying this dead world. I enjoyed seeing all of the eclectic images of destruction he brought to this film. Images from the Yellowstone fire Mount Saint Helens and Hurricane Katrina were compiled together to create this world as well as some decent special effects. My favorite image from the film is when the go on an overpass. The overpass stuck with me.The acting of the two leads is superb. Viggo Mortensen continues to impress me as a fantastic actor. When I was reading the book I imagined him as Djimon Hounsou but Mortensen encompasses the character extremely well. Newcomer Kodi SmitMcPhee is just as good and together they carry the entire film on their shoulders and they do it effortlessly. My only complaint with the film is that because there is no driving plot my guess is it could become tedious and hard to follow if you didn't read the book. Overall the fear and the relationship moved the story enough to keep me interested but I can see how a lack of structure could be tedious to some. The tone and art direction are spot on the acting is excellent the story is a perfect adaptation of the book but it isn't a groundbreaking film. The Road is as good as adaptations get one of the best I have ever seen. It wasn't a whiteknuckle film the way No Country was nor was it nearly as well directed. But it's a riveting and engaging film and it's a fantastic story of two characters. In the end that's enough of a reason for it to be a great movie. As for my expectations it blew me away. Despite a delay and a bad trailer The Road is an impressive film. My Rating 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite a trailer that was cut to bring in disaster film audiences Bobby was safe from my wrath because it appeared his brother and he let Hillcoat's vision stick creating one of the best films of the year thus far. Please do not take the preview as gospel because it does a terrible job marketing the movie. This is an independent production with very dark tonesone scene with a basement full of people held captive thin and missing limbs as food storage for the monsters living above is just one exampleas well as a riveting story dealing with life death family and sacrifice. The make of a father is tested when the world is at an end. If it is between putting a bullet into the head of your child rather than allow him to be eaten one must come to grips with mortality and pride. If the world around you is disappearing burning becoming a land of criminals is it good enough to just survive? When you get away from whatever trouble is in your backyard is it enough when you just have to continue running with a new test awaiting you? There is no safe haven no piece of earth hidden from the horrors that have taken over  to live is to run.Don't be surprised when the big names you heard were in the film don't appear until late or show up for very brief stints when they do. Some are seen only in flashbacks others are blips on the radar as The Man and his Son journey day by day to live for the next. The Road is all about Viggo and young Kodi SmitMcPhee who is greatmany are hailing him as a revelation but I think time will tell on that one as they come across allies as well as their share of villains too. Small roles notwithstanding both Garret Dillahunt as a hick trucker looking for red meat of any kind and Robert Duvall as an old vagabond trying to mind his own business in the wasteland are outstanding. Especially Duvall who I'll admit has been phoning in some performances of late with too much gravitas. His Old Mancan you sense a theme with the character namesis subtle and real wrinkles and crags making up his face dirt and grime coating it all. Hillcoat knows how to let an environment consume his viewers leaving nothing to be pretty for pretty's sake. Like his Australian western of two years ago the lack of showers and clean running water is noticeable throughout.There aren't any explosions or big time battles between good and evil all those shots of news footage used in the trailer as though our central family watched them on television do not exist. One day a husband and his pregnant wife were enjoying their lives when disaster struck. It doesn't matter what the cause was or where it started all we need to be aware of is that the destruction was all encompassing worldwide and unstoppable. The morality of letting a child be born into a life of fear and death becomes an early theme the birth of SmitMcPhee's character a question mark in his first days. Going through so much for that son Mortensen lives for nothing else his own life expendable as long as when he goes he knows the boy has a chance. What chance that is no one knows. The next day could bring the discovery of a hidden bunker full of nonperishables it could bring a loner vagrant passing by while they sleep to steal all they have accumulated or it could mean seeing the enemy over the hills on the verge of discovering them causing their lives' worth to be left in favor of a rapid getaway. The real beauty of the film is how it never lulls or takes a shortcut. You will be on the edge of your seat for the duration waiting to see when the moment will come that they can't get away.A story of hope it is also one of hardship and sacrifice. Some risk everything for another some risk themselves in order to survive. When the choice becomes finding a man to eat or take from an unsuspecting child sometimes you have to do the lesser of two evils no matter how much of your soul it takes with it. Mortensen embodies these sentiments but so do others along the way. I must mention Michael K. Williams as The Thief a man so lost on his own journey of survival that he just can't help himself. You know that he is a man of honor and kindness that had no choice but then you must think of the fact that he did he could have allowed himself to die rather than take from innocents. But that's the rub no one is innocent not even The Boy as evidenced when SmitMcPhee yells at his father to say that he also must face what's going on each day. Viggo isn't shielding him from the terrors around every corner just because he is young doesn't mean he hasn't grown up quick it's all he could do to stay sane and move along with all the pains of his past and knowledge of those still to come. It's a tough watch but well worth the time and effort to see a true masterpiece of tone and humanitythe good parts and the bad.".

Maybe some kind of depth.What did I get? A couple of whiny crybabies who never should've survived the doomsday even to begin with. I got a movie that masquerades as deep and even convinces some people it is. And it's looooooooooong and by failures that disengage you from the characters also boring.Since it was postapocalyptic it delivered on the bleak but to the point of disbelief. And it had Deliverancestyle cannibals complete with trucker hats. Why? Because it's a cheap way to make people dislike the villains. No these aren't savage people who've resorted to cannibalism in Hollywood's opinion that's pretty much what everyone with a southern accent is like already. So they're just hicks with a big diesel truck who eat people. But Hollywood wasn't content with just ripping on poor white folks as THE black guy in the movie is a thief whose dialog sounds positively antebellum. Our hero is a whiny man child who plays the piano and couldn't run his own household.The main characters have random unexplained motivations. Charlize Theron walks out because she has to the kid goes chasing down a boy he maybe sees because he has to and characters frequently do things for no apparent reason with no rational motivation. And Viggo intent on living lets Charlize go running off to die why? Uh... because he has to?Why shoot someone who's obviously a fellow traveler and not a cannibal? No reason. Why run away from a sealed hidden bunker that's escaped detection for 10 years? No reason. Why always take the main roads and make yourself a target? No reason.Why do the main characters being chased by NASCAR cannibals decide to light a bonfire everywhere they stop? With the sun and stars and moon obscured by bleak clouds 247 what would possess them to light a huge highly visible fire every night? When they stumble on the cannibal captives do they release the victims so as to make cover for their own escape or possibly stop the cannibals? Nope. They seal 'em back up in the basement and hang around outside to listen to them being eaten.The kid falls over more than a bimbo in a horror flick and has to be carried more than the luggage does which looks a lot like Princess Vespa's luggage from Spaceballs. Despite an abundance of water everyone's forgotten how to bathe groom or clothe themselves. Why? Meanwhile Viggo goes swimming like it's a Bond film. The film says it's gotten so cold out yet the characters repeatedly expose themselves to hypothermia via swimming. Why again? Does the movie make any sense? Sure if you're pretentious and can lie to yourself. Do the characters' motivations make any sense. No.Why did they spend years in the cabin rather than go south to begin with? Not explained. Why does Charlize wander off to die? Because. Despite the lack of fuel there seems to be forests of it standing around  did humans just forget how the steam engine works? Apparently.The visuals are suitably bleak but grow tiresome and obnoxious. There's just no point. For all the weak attempts at moralizing random things it's as pretentious as the Matrix sequels but there's no enjoyment to be had here.The nonspecific doomsday isn't a big hangup. It just sets the stage for the morality play. But there isn't one to be found here. It really is a dull plodding slow pointless film. The numerous bonehead moves the characters make  almost all due to bad writing  separate the audience from the characters and rather quickly and thus there's no reason to care. There's only hope that the next scene offers something of interest in the setting. Even with a lot of use of fastforward it still drags.You'd be better off watching The Postman Mad Max or A Boy And His Dog. Waterworld is gills and shoulders above this pretentious turkey. Heck even Robot Holocaust and Defcon 4 were better than The Road.Or better yet go read Orson Scott Card's The Folk of the Fringe for a good postapocalyptic journeypilgrimage book.".

Even with a lot of use of fastforward it still drags.You'd be better off watching The Postman Mad Max or A Boy And His Dog. Waterworld is gills and shoulders above this pretentious turkey. Heck even Robot Holocaust and Defcon 4 were better than The Road.Or better yet go read Orson Scott Card's The Folk of the Fringe for a good postapocalyptic journeypilgrimage book.";

The characters seemed more believable in the film than in the novel. This is probably due to the medium but Viggio Mortenson did a fabulous job as the Protagonist the unnamed father and his son was also great. They both were tremendous and brought a lot of character development and engagement to an otherwise totally bleak story.I loved Robert Duvall's turn as the grizzled survivor. It was a supporting role sure to win an Oscar nomination. I think this will win more than its share of Oscar nominations for Viggio at the very least.Great film go check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS GALORE I've just finished watching the road and I'm more than a little disappointed. Leaving aside the fingerpointing rewrite ending what I missed most were the little things the small exchanges between the man and the boy the coke can sequence being the most obvious. In the novel one of the most poignant lines comes from the boy as he tries to share the can with the man who initially refuses to partake. The boy says something along the lines of 'It's because I won't ever get to drink another one isn't it?' In that one sentence McCarthy sums up that gap between what the man knows he has lost and what the boy has never experienced but is slowly coming to realise once existed a better 'road'less world.I also lament the omission of those little examples of the mans resourcefulness examples of how this terrifying new world has shaped and honed his senses from the finding of the morels the apples the residual oil his whittling of bullets from wood his jerryrigging the gas burner so they can take it on the road his pennydrop moment which leads to the discovery of the flare gun. Even the nagging feeling that leads to his discovering the hidden trove of food and supplies was brushed over a barely noticeable 'Wait what was that I just stepped on?' moment. We never know what the man did in his previous life before this tragedy struck but from the novel we get the feeling or at least I do that he's probably a welleducated white collar guy who's had to step up to the plate in order to ensure his and his families survival.I can't go without mentioning the thief sequence. In the novel the thief didn't spare the boy he came upon their things offpage. In the film he's portrayed much more sympathetically and one is almost compelled to side against the man after all the thief didn't kill or try to eat the boy like almost everyone else we've encountered so far he might be a 'good guy' surely the punishment meted out to him was too harsh.This theme is further hammered home in the ending where it's made clear to us that the dog and the rest of them are the same group who were heard above while the man and the boy were in the bunker  shelter. Indeed the second boy is the same boy glimpsed early in the proceedings though the window of a dilapidated building. If only the man had listened to the boy on those two occasions and trusted that the others might be 'good guys' then maybe he wouldn't have had to die and ultimately fail his son. None of this is in the novel McCarthys theme is much more subtle than that it's closer to 'what are the implications of maintaining your sense of morality when everyone else around you has forsaken theirs'. In the end the mans love for his son is such that he can't bring himself to kill him even though he knows that his son will most likely suffer a shockingly brutal death but such is his love he can't bring himself to do it. He's fated to be the ultimate good guy no matter the cost.In closing as much as I hate to be one of those people I must recommend the novel over the movie. If this film made you stop and think even just a little bit and you've not read the novel then you really should.".

I found that try as I might I just couldn't seem to care for either of them or what happened to them. But the worst of it is that it has more holes than a colander! Indulge me while I list but a fewHow on earth does the boy manage to look so healthy and perfect when all they have to live on is a couple of locusts a week? His skin would be sallow his teeth would be brown his hair lank etc etc.How come the height marks on the door in Viggo's childhood home are still there 40 years later? Has no one ever decorated the place since?How do they manage to find a bomb shelter unlocked and barely concealed which just happens to be stock full of food and nice clean bedding when there have been gangs of violent men on the prowl for years taking every last crumb?Why on Earth do they leave the aforementioned well stocked bomb shelter heading right out into the danger they believe they hear outside instead of battening down the hatches and staying in the comfort and plentiful food? Absolutely crazy!How on earth when they suddenly binge on all the goodies do they not vomit it straight back up? After all they are presumably suffering from moderate to severe starvation! But how on Earth have they survived that long on practically nothing? The boy was born when the apocalypse had already started and is about 8 or 9 years old!When the boy catches an infection and gets a fever how does he just recover from it? He would be badly malnourished and could well die of such an illness. At the very least he would be seriously ill for a long time.The whole thing is just a series of badly thought through lazy vignettes and set pieces on which to hang some semiprofound clotheared metaphysics and fatherson bonding survival through love blah di blah. And that ending is just cheese city! Not only is it absurdly 'convenient' that at the very moment his dad dies the only decent people in the entire film suddenly turn up as if by magic to rescue him. But the final shot virtually has the bloody dog smiling! It's like some happy families Kodak moment.Deary me! I just couldn't wait for it to end!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Road a story about a journey undertaken by a father and his 11 year old son on a post apocalyptic Earth. It seems that everything living has died due to some catastrophe except for some unfortunate human beings who wander the land and cities in search of the last can of coke or anything else that will pass for food. Even humans will do. Our two protagonists are making their way to the coast why? No one knows or seems to care to tell the audience. Dad and the annoying little brat who looks far too healthy to pass for an undernourished lad sleep in abandoned cars and houses while they try to steer clear from fellow human survivors. This strategy oddly fails to work at all as they seem to be running into those fellow humans with almost clockwork precision. This despite the fact that almost everyone on the planet died. Between these scenes where they go to some place and then get scared away from it the boy asks the father questions like Are we the good guys daddy? at which point the father explains that they are ad nauseam. And that's basically it. That is really all that will be repeated throughout the entirety of the film. No deeper thoughts on the meaning of life no interesting philosophies no mentionable plot turns just this same vacuous scene over and over again until they make it to the coast. The father dies and the kid is taken in by a surviving family who very conveniently wandered by at that very moment. The End.I really don't know but shouldn't there be some entertainment value to a film? Some sense of momentum or an interesting point to make. Maybe I've seen too many films in my life but when the credits finally rolled I spontaneously burst out in laughter at the silliness and pointlessness of it all. 4 out of 10 for the fine cinematography and acting by Viggo Mortensen.".

So what type of apocalypse was it? It looks that even the screenplay author lacked the idea of how to reasonably explain it. A meteorite collision? Some enormous fire?

I know there's always some kind of agreement between the makers of any scifi movie and the audience We create the world and you have to take it the way it is. But how much crap can we swallow at the time? In short another teary movie about nothing. A complete waste of time considering how entertaining or thoughtprovoking it is.

	schema:reviewBody "By Zach Copeland The Road Takes Fresh Approach to PostApocalyptic Genre Ever since God flooded out the entire human race in the early pages of Genesis literature has abounded with stories of the apocalypse. For generation after generation from The Book of Revelations to The Stand we have obsessed over the end of the world how it will come to pass and what if anything we can do to stop it. Now that humankind has reached a point where the End could conceivably happen in an afternoon our glimpses into this theoretical future are all the more intriguing. And they've never been more important.The Road directed by John Hillcoat The Proposition and based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy No Country For Old Men is a dark poignant story of a father and son journeying through a postapocalyptic wasteland withstanding harsh weather malnutrition and under the constant threat of marauders thieves and cannibals. Their goal is simple to carry on.Those looking to sink their teeth into mindless disasterporn not that there's anything wrong with that can get their fix elsewhere. The Road is a smaller more penetrating film that draws strength from its intimacy and its ability to do so much with so little.Viggo Mortensen gives an emotional tour de force as the embattled father look for him on the red carpet come March. Watching children act is oftentimes painful for me but I thought Kodi SmitMcPhee was impressive and genuine as the son and takes on the task of being in literally every scene with rare fearlessness. Charlize Theron Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce give small but highly memorable performances Duvall in particular whose portrayal of a withered old man journeying all alone will haunt you.The desolate environment in which the story takes place is itself a character foreign yet eerily familiar and so perfectly conceptualized that it matches  heck surpasses the standard of realism set by films such as 28 Days Later and Children of Men. Shot throughout four states including at the site of the Mount St. Helens eruption Hillcoat and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe The Others The Sea Inside paint a backdrop that is altogether beautiful and devastating.They say that every generation since the dawn of man has feared the End and while this may be true not every generation has seen what our modern technology is capable of. The Road is a dark looking glass into our future and what it is likely to become if our primal nature is left unchecked.Early in the film the son looks at his father and asks him We're the good guys right? The father's response is in the affirmative but as their situation become increasingly desperate that sense of morality we think to be ingrained is put to the test. Hillcoat does a masterful job of portraying human beings as what we are and always have been. He holds up a mirror to the world and hypnotizes you with it.As far as postapocalyptic movies go The Road is handsdown one of the best ever made. Despite its raw gritty facade which will understandably be a turnoff for many theatergoers the story underneath has a sense of serenity that everyone can relate to.The Road opens everywhere on November 25.

The father's response is in the affirmative but as their situation become increasingly desperate that sense of morality we think to be ingrained is put to the test. Hillcoat does a masterful job of portraying human beings as what we are and always have been. He holds up a mirror to the world and hypnotizes you with it.As far as postapocalyptic movies go The Road is handsdown one of the best ever made. Despite its raw gritty facade which will understandably be a turnoff for many theatergoers the story underneath has a sense of serenity that everyone can relate to.The Road opens everywhere on November 25.

Anna Kavan's Ice  where the world is smothered in ice  and some early Ballard are in this category. So is The Road book and film.The Road is basically ridiculous. Neutron Bombing? Nuclear Winter? Giant Asteroid hit? Plague? Humanity eaten by Giant Mutant Pink Ants? The author doesn't tell us because he simply hasn't thought it through. Unlike most regular hard sf apocalypse writers who usually work our their premises carefully You can pick out the sheer silliness of it all yourself but I just put out a few pointers 99 of the population has died in 10 years but they don't have clothes to wear or a decent tent.Only two rounds of ammo? Just so the author can set up a fake dilemma.Farming Humans for Cannibalism? If you have food to feed humans you would eat it yourself rather than loose calories.Leaving the bunker  the height of stupidity. Wait out and try to rebuild. And one presumes that the people who set it up would have a stocked it with weapons and ammo b medical supplies. So when the Dolt we can't really call him a Man gets shot with an arrow he should have had antibiotics etc so he wouldn't die.Medical supplies ditto the Ship. Question  why does he swim back  are there no life rafts or lifeboats left on the Ship? You could carry a lot more supplies safely.Maddened brigands and bandits this comes to the heart of the matter even bandits are likely to negotiate first. They can't afford wounds loss of members and may even want to recruit more people into their gang. Safety in numbers.It's just ridiculous that there is no government at all surviving or people banding together for skill sharing and mutual defence.Why would the nuclear family with the dog accept a lone boy into their group? Unless he had skills that were useful he's just a worthless mouth to feed? If you have read anything about people surviving in adversity without having a rosetinted view of humanity The Road is hokum.".

	schema:headline " OK so we reached the ocean...now what?";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a very dark gloomy and depressing film in which you wished in just one scene that the darn sun would shine. I spent a lot of my time squinting at the screen trying to make sense of what was going on. The story centers around two characters. Viggo Mortenson as the Father and Kodi SmitMcPhee as the Son who are forced into survival in a Earth now destroyed by man's greed and global warming has killed most life except for as it is explained in the film two different types of peoples....The good people and the bad ones which do nothing but resort to cannibalism. After we see flash backs of the Mother telling the father that he needs to see to it that he gets their son to the sea in the South because she has no more of a desire to go on living and in a very moving scene we see The Father pleading with her to just spend one more night with him before she walks off and dies. She does not and walks off into the darkness. The rest of the film has the Father and Son fighting their way through burned out cities and across a barren landscape in which it rains almost every day. They fight for survival from what appears to be rednecks who eat human flesh and keep warm humans locked up in basements to be eaten later. The Father Manages to escape death several times and save his son with nothing more than his wits and a pistol with only 2 rounds in which only 1 is ever used.They finally do reach the sea which was the point that was pressed throughout the film but nothing happens once they are there. The last 20 minutes The Son spends on the beach watching The Father die. Before his death he tells The Son to keep going south. After The Fathers death The Son finds a good family while on the beach which included a man woman little boy girl and a dog. So was this the meaning for The Father to get his little boy to the ocean? To find a nice family living on the beach? This all seemed too simple an ending for a story that was pretty complex about survival in a world in which survival was everything. But as with all Hollywood films the ending had to be happy seeing how gloomy it was up to that point. It just seemed too good an ending....".

The only possible explanation is that such reviews were written by staff of the film studio or highly depressed viewers who felt less depressed after watching this lemon.Let's be objective here. The acting was crap out of touch with the story and terribly contrived. The score was bad. The images were poorly shot using bad angles and closeup views of what should have been filmed from a distance to give the audience a feel for the desolation.The story itself is totally unrealistic. For example1 An armed group has one of theirs shot and don't even go after the father and son despite the fact that it's daylight they carry rifles the father is slowed down by having to carry his son the group is obviously starving and out there on a hunting mission. This could never happen in real life.2 The house where the human herd is held by cannibals is left unwatched. Since the keepers feel starved enough to eat human flesh one would think that their prisoners constitute their most precious item. So why would they leave them alone for someone to find and possibly help to escape? Simply unbelievable.3 Father and son find a stash of canned food which happens to be still good for consumption after... 11 years according to the story. Has anyone seen a can of food left in a damp place like a cellar after ten years? Well the author of the book obviously hasn't. I'm surprised that father and son lasted more than a few hours after eating the stuff.4 The old man played by Duvall is nearly blind can barely get off the ground by himself can't obviously run and has managed to survive despite roaming baddies cannibals etc? Come on what are the odds of that possibly happening?5 Father and son travel that long road without ever running into a trap not even once? Say you're an armed group starving and out there looking for prey wouldn't the first thing coming to mind be to set a trap for some isolated travelers?6 You're in charge of a young boy and living in a dangerous environment. Would you look for an isolated place to weather the storm surviving on roots and hiding from predators or would you undertake a senseless trip to the ocean in freezing conditions?I can appreciate some comments that claim a good adaptation from the book but... a good adaptation of a crappy and unrealistic story doesn't make a good film now does it?In keeping an objective and unemotional outlook which should be the most important guideline for anyone writing a review I simply cannot understand why anyone would recommend watching that film or even find anything good to say about it. Granted the subject matter is interesting I won't argue that but it could have been handled much better in both the book and the film.I must agree with all those who branded it a pure waste of time they are absolutely right. This is a bad film on all accounts. As to those who mentioned possible Oscar nominations or spoke of the best film of its year I'm sorry to say that they're completely off the mark as much as someone claiming that McDonald's deserves 5 stars on the Michelin guide.My advice if someone suggests taking you to watch the road run!".

At the snack counter a poster proclaimed One of the most uplifting and optimistic movies of the year!After watching that movie we concluded that the poster reviewer either was completely high wandered into the wrong theater by mistake or thinks that Schindler's List was a wacky comedy. The Road has to be one of the most depressing pointless excruciating movies you could ever see. It will make you want to go home and stick your head in the oven.The first 7 hours of the movie contain an endless slog through a desolate landscape bereft of plant and animal life. Only bugs and humans remain somehow. Everything else on Earth has been burnt or smashed by some unacknowledged Doomsday Event. The director leaves it up to the audience to somehow figure out what kind of reasonable scientific explanation could account for anyone surviving for any amount of time after all the oxygenproducing plant life plus everything else in the food chain between bugs and people bit the dust. Apparently it happens through the magic of Dole Pineapple Chunks the search for which takes up another 4 hours of movie.Once you get inured to this laugh riot you eventually start to disassociate from the main characters. The Boy in the book is supposed to be 6 or 7. In the movie though he looks to be about 10 or 11 but seems to still act 6 or 7. He comes across as a total feeb and you start to wonder how a kid born on the cusp of a complete apocalypse manages to have such poor coping skills. The Kid was supposed to have been running into dead bodies and cannibals practically every day of his life so you'd think he'd be over it after 910 years but no he manages to seem traumatized at every instance.Dad doesn't help things out much as he spends his days talking to the kid like he's three and tucking him in and carrying him around every chance he gets. I'm sure that'll help grow hair on his chest Dad! It's nice to see that no matter how shitty the world gets there's always a parent willing to overshelter their kid from the reality of their situation.Dad also seems to make poor survival decisions. The poorest decision comes when the two find a friggin' BOMB SHELTER FILLED WITH FOOD AND WARM BEDS but after a couple days they need to abandon it because they heard somebody walking around up top. Apparently this is the only bomb shelter in existence that didn't come with a lock on the hatch and everyone knows how easy it is for a starving bum to breach a cement bunker with a steel trap door on it. It's much easier to pile a bunch of crap in an old push wagon and hit the road again to defend it in the open air against every marauder and sneak thief that walks by while you slowly die from exposure.But one can't point fingers at such glaring plot holes because This Is Such A Serious AwardWinning Oscar Contender! You can tell this movie is an Oscar contender because the kid cries real tears and there are at least a couple scenes where the audience gets treated to a rear view of Viggo's naked ass and nutsack. Everyone knows that if Viggo is letting you see his junk he's very much into his role and you should respect his process by taking his nuts very seriously like he does.There's a scene somewhere in the middle where The Mom Charlize Theron decides to end it by walking out into the freezing winter in her sleep shirt to die in the woods because she can't take it anymore. By the end of the movie you'll be wishing you'd walked out in the middle too.There was one very uplifting part to our experience though After leaving the theater my husband found a five dollar bill on the ground. That cheered us up immensely. There is life after this movie!".

There is no real plot or storyline unlikeable undeveloped characters and the story left nothing to ponder except if you were starving and the world was essentially just over would you start munching on the other survivors or kill yourself?

One might make the argument that this movie is not about the actual science of the apocalypse but rather that it's about human nature and human relationships unfortunately there are only two characters in the movie and it's pretty basic a father is caring for his crybaby son. I believe the author's inability to explain the world in which his boring characters live in can be attributed to lack or creativity or laziness. There was no creativity or even anything remotely resembling beauty in this tale. The cannibals were called the bad guys and the noncannibals were the good guys Hope was called the fire and the main characters were papa and son. And the ending was just embarrassing.".

The brief glimpses I'd seen from via clips and trailers had cinematography that leapt out and grabbed me and I was puzzled as to why it didn't do better at both the box office and award ceremonies . After seeing the film in full it's perhaps understandable why THE ROAD didn't do better . Australian director John Hillcoat has crafted an impressive but utterly bleak and depressing movie where mankind is headed for extinction and considering a large amount of survivors have resorted to cannibalism one can't help thinking the human race won't be missed . Make no mistake this isn't the comic book capers of MAD MAX  nor is it feelgood post apocalypse cinema along the lines of the more successful THE BOOK OF ELI  or the wish fulfillment cosy catastrophe 1970s BBC drama SURVIVORS . This is nihilistic speculative fiction that American cinema ignores similar in tone to John Christopher Apart from the unrelentingly depressing tone some people might be put off by the lack of explanation to the story . The inciting incident of the apocalypse is never explained but it's easy to join up the dots that it was either caused by a Supervolcano or an asteroid strike leading to a nuclear winter effect . Why are people kept in a cellar ? You know why even though you don't like to think about . Sadly there's not enough explanation in other areas such as why is the father so bent on trekking across a desolate landscape to the Ocean ? And whatever his motives why has it taken him several years to come up with this plan ? As with most type of stories in this genre it's never explained what the protagonists have done to survive in this time frame lasting several years . Obviously the bad guys survived by eating other people but what the father  mother and son survive on during this time ? Everything starts collapsing from a logic point of view when you start dissecting the story Viggo Mortensen is the actor equivalent of cinematographer Roger Deakins . He's always impressive but since making his big breakthrough in LORD OF THE RINGS award ceremonies constantly ignore him . THE ROAD is the type of film that is carried by its lead actor and this film sees Mortensen give his all time best performance that was criminally overlooked at the Oscars but again you can perhaps understand why nominations for Best Actor  Best Supporting Actor and Best Cinematography weren't seriously considered . Oscar awards are usually given out to triumph of the human spirit feelgood type movies and THE ROAD is on a one way track to the extinction of our speciesAnd that's the fundamental problem with THE ROAD . It's not so much a problem because it is truly memorable  contains superb technical aspects and it's a film that makes its audience think . Unfortunately you'll be left thinking how lucky we are to live in a world of civilization and how quickly this might all fall apart . I was totally compelled and involved in this movie but I'm in no hurry to watch it again .

Thirdly the idea in writing intrigued me enough to watch this film. Now that that's out of the way I'll explain my notso good rating...The Road is about the journey taken by a father and his son who are heading south towards the sea after the fallout of an undisclosed event. This journey obviously proves to be somewhat perilous but this peril is dampened quite significantly by the father's blind tendency to overlook the fact that his son is a sappy whiny annoying brat that needs a significant amount of toughening up in order to survive the ordeals of life in the bleak wilderness that is the landscape of The Road. At one point the father even admits he's trying to pass on this very knowledge but he never teaches this to his brat and the brat is constantly crying whimpering and wanting to make friends with every grimy individual that pops up that doesn't want to eat them being that foods in short supply!This pretty much sums up the majority of this movie which has few flickers of light to provide a balance that I felt was lacking from The Road resulting in a thoroughly depressing movie which made me cheer towards the end yes at the sad bit  the kid deserved it!. And this just before a convenient family moment which seemed rather out of place. Considering the boy's father had been ramming home the message not to trust just anyone this was just ridiculous!So to sum up I would give The Road a chance. Watch ittake in the lovely cinematography the fine direction and excellent performances from everyone but the brat and decide for yourself. Just don't watch it if you suffer from depression. Or you're having a bad day. Or if you like nice Hollywood endings. The Road seems to try and aim for this ultimately but after all the warnings imparted within I found it rather hard to swallow!".

But when the queen delivers a twin Cardinal Richelieu sees the second son as a potential for revolution and has him sent off to Spain to be raised in secret to ensure a peaceful future for France. Alas keeping the secret means sending Constance lover of D'Artagnan off to a convent. D'Artagnan hears of this and rallies the Musketeers in a bid to rescue her. Unfortunately Richelieu outsmarts the Musketeers and banishes them forever. Richelieu enlists D'Artagnan to look after and protect the young prince. Meanwhile de Rochefort learns of the twins and Richelieu's plans and kidnaps the twin raising him in secret. Many years later with Richelieu dead and the young prince crowned King Louis XIV Rochefort launches his plan.

As a sequel to Fairbanks' earlier THE THREE MUSKETEERS 1921 it more than surpasses its predecessor in lavish production values good acting  nonstop action.Now 46 Fairbanks seems none the worse for wear and his muscular athleticism is still called upon to win the girl beat the foe  thrill the audience. Fairbanks had a natural spontaneity  authentic joie de vivre both in his private life and in his screen persona which audiences of the 1920's found absolutely irresistible. He was unique  unforgettable  utterly irreplaceable.Fairbanks is supported once again by a fine cast lovely Marguerite De La Motte as the faithful Constance Dorothy Revier as the treacherous Milady de Winter William Bakewell in the dual role of the two princes Lon Poff as the sinister Father Joseph. That's the excellent character actress Vera Lewis in the tiny role of the Royal Midwife.The Three Musketeers themselves are rather more finely delineated than in the previous film. Lon Bary as Athos Tiny Sandford as Porthos  Gino Corrado as Aramis all give good account of themselves throughout the flurry  turmoil of the lively plot.Special mention must be made of British actor Nigel de Brulier once again playing the rapacious Cardinal Richelieu. Even though the character disappears half way into the film de Brulier still manages to invest the Churchman with more than just villainy. He helps the viewer to glimpse the real person behind the facade and to understand some of the reasons for his tyrannical behavior.One of the versions in which this film is available has all the title cards removed  a rousing narrative read by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. substituted in their place.The opening credits state that the film's narrative was based on the story by Elton Thomas a pseudonym for Fairbanks which was in turn based on Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers'  Twenty Years After.' This is true but all of the Man in the Iron Mask elements actually came from Dumas' novel Ten Years Later or The Vicomte de Bragelonne' 184850. Thus the events in the latter half of THE IRON MASK take place 30 years after the events in THE THREE MUSKETEERS.The first film is set in 1625 the second film starts in 1638. Since important plot elements are not handled in THE THREE MUSKETEERS  for instance Milady's evil behavior towards Constance  they are somewhat incongruously left dangling for 13 years until the beginning of THE IRON MASK. And some of the most fascinating elements of the later books  such as the Musketeers' clash with Milady's malevolent son  the machinations of Richelieu's successor the wily Cardinal Mazarin  are completely ignored altogether.But this is a mere quibble and should not detract from the immense enjoyment of a very fine film. It might be helpful to note in passing a few historical dates which deal directly with the plot Louis XIV born September 15 1638.Cardinal Richelieu dies December 4 1642.Louis XIII dies May 14 1643.Louis XIV is crowned King in 1654 after attaining maturity.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE IRON MASK United Artists 1929 directed by Allan Dwan based on The Man in the Iron Mask by Alexander Dumas a sequel to Dumas's THE THREE MUSKETEERS United Artists 1921 both starring Douglas Fairbanks as D'Artagnan and Marguerite De La Motte as Constance is a worthy farewell to Fairbanks making his final silent screen adventure.Those familiar with the plot which was remade several times on screen and television including THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK United Artists 1939 with Louis Hayward and or the most recent and satisfactory 1998 featuring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jeremy Irons will find the story here not much different but only shorter in its basic format as is with its title. The story begins with King Louis XIII of France Rolfe Sedan receiving the news of the birth of his son the future heir to the throne. The only problem is that the heir also has a twin. Since there cannot be two heirs this news must be kept in utmost secrecy and anyone involved must be put away forever. Constance Beaucieux Marguerite De La Motte D'Artagnan's Douglas Fairbanks beloved who was the midwife during the birth is immediately put away in the Convent of Martes by orders of Count De Rochefort Ullrich Haupt. Unaware of the secret D'Artagnan tries to rescue Constance from being held prisoner against her will but arrives too late. She has been stabbed by Milady De Winter Dorothy Revier after discovering the secret mark on her shoulder the brand of a common criminal. Before Constance dies in D'Artagnan's arms she utters her final words to him the other one ... The death of Constance leaves D'Artagnan feeling empty and bitter. D'Artagnan who has been reunited with his colleagues The Three Musketeers later saves them from being executed by orders of the Cardinal Richelieu Nigel De Brulier. After D'Artagnan rescues Richelieu from De Rochefort's men the Musketeers are pardoned but find they must part company once more when D'Artagnan is appointed as guardian to the newborn infant and sent to Spain while the actual heir to the throne remains in France. Some twenty years later the evil twin brother William Bakewell a spoiled young man eventually learns his true identity and of his twin brother holding the throne in France from the villainous De Rochefort. The evil twin plots to take over the throne by having his brother abducted and banishing him by having him locked in a dungeon with his face sealed in an iron mask for all eternity and being given food from the guards from under the door and with strict orders for him not to ever have any visitors. While taking control of the throne the evil twin meets with his mother Queen Anne Belle Bennett who immediately realizes what's happening. It is then up to the D'Artagnan and his musketeers now older men to reunite and save the day.Featured in the supporting cast are Stanley Sanford as Porthos Leon Bary as Athos Gino Corrado as Aramis Vera Lewis as Madame Peronne and Gordon Thorpe playing the boy prince and his evil twin.A satisfactory version that becomes a bit slow going at times due to a couple of flashbacks but then picks up speed again with a memorable swashbuckling conclusion. THE IRON MASK was first introduced as part of the 12week series on public television's THE SILENT YEARS 1975 hosted by Lillian Gish. Because this was Fairbanks' final silent adventure released the final year of the silent era 1929 THE IRON MASK became the film chosen as the closing chapter to this series. Accompanied with an original piano score by William J. Perry from the Paul Killiam collection and running at the length of about 87 minutes THE IRON MASK also consisted of color tinted scenes. Reportedly distributed theatrically with talking sequences sound effects and an original musical score which may still exist today THE IRON MASK was later reissued in 1952 through Odyssey Pictures eliminating the original title cards replaced with narration by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and accompanied by a new orchestral score. Available with the excellent Perry piano score on video cassette through Blackhawk Films in the 1980s current video copies distributed in the 1990s present THE IRON MASK with its 1952 72 minute reissue format the version which formerly aired on American Movie Classics from 19971998. Although the difference being the length and clearer picture quality with the narration giving a better outlook and understanding to the storyline silent film buffs would prefer to see THE IRON MASK restored to its original silent format. Thanks to KINO video it's own copy has been restored with sound prologue with Doug Fairbanks himself as well as an orchestral score by Carl Davis. HOLA! ".

Constance Beaucieux Marguerite De La Motte D'Artagnan's Douglas Fairbanks beloved who was the midwife during the birth is immediately put away in the Convent of Martes by orders of Count De Rochefort Ullrich Haupt. Unaware of the secret D'Artagnan tries to rescue Constance from being held prisoner against her will but arrives too late. She has been stabbed by Milady De Winter Dorothy Revier after discovering the secret mark on her shoulder the brand of a common criminal. Before Constance dies in D'Artagnan's arms she utters her final words to him the other one ... The death of Constance leaves D'Artagnan feeling empty and bitter. D'Artagnan who has been reunited with his colleagues The Three Musketeers later saves them from being executed by orders of the Cardinal Richelieu Nigel De Brulier. After D'Artagnan rescues Richelieu from De Rochefort's men the Musketeers are pardoned but find they must part company once more when D'Artagnan is appointed as guardian to the newborn infant and sent to Spain while the actual heir to the throne remains in France. Some twenty years later the evil twin brother William Bakewell a spoiled young man eventually learns his true identity and of his twin brother holding the throne in France from the villainous De Rochefort. The evil twin plots to take over the throne by having his brother abducted and banishing him by having him locked in a dungeon with his face sealed in an iron mask for all eternity and being given food from the guards from under the door and with strict orders for him not to ever have any visitors. While taking control of the throne the evil twin meets with his mother Queen Anne Belle Bennett who immediately realizes what's happening. It is then up to the D'Artagnan and his musketeers now older men to reunite and save the day.Featured in the supporting cast are Stanley Sanford as Porthos Leon Bary as Athos Gino Corrado as Aramis Vera Lewis as Madame Peronne and Gordon Thorpe playing the boy prince and his evil twin.A satisfactory version that becomes a bit slow going at times due to a couple of flashbacks but then picks up speed again with a memorable swashbuckling conclusion. THE IRON MASK was first introduced as part of the 12week series on public television's THE SILENT YEARS 1975 hosted by Lillian Gish. Because this was Fairbanks' final silent adventure released the final year of the silent era 1929 THE IRON MASK became the film chosen as the closing chapter to this series. Accompanied with an original piano score by William J. Perry from the Paul Killiam collection and running at the length of about 87 minutes THE IRON MASK also consisted of color tinted scenes. Reportedly distributed theatrically with talking sequences sound effects and an original musical score which may still exist today THE IRON MASK was later reissued in 1952 through Odyssey Pictures eliminating the original title cards replaced with narration by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and accompanied by a new orchestral score. Available with the excellent Perry piano score on video cassette through Blackhawk Films in the 1980s current video copies distributed in the 1990s present THE IRON MASK with its 1952 72 minute reissue format the version which formerly aired on American Movie Classics from 19971998. Although the difference being the length and clearer picture quality with the narration giving a better outlook and understanding to the storyline silent film buffs would prefer to see THE IRON MASK restored to its original silent format. Thanks to KINO video it's own copy has been restored with sound prologue with Doug Fairbanks himself as well as an orchestral score by Carl Davis. HOLA! ";

	schema:reviewBody "In Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's extraordinary 1980 documentary about the silent era Hollywood the final sequence of The Iron Mask is described as Fairbanks' farewell to the silent film.  And it is.Generally this is an inferior film to the amazing 1921 Three Musketeers. Allan Dwan is not the visual stylist that Fred Niblo is and so The Iron Mask becomes much more of a straightforward action film.  But as such it is splendid.  I think we tend to forget what a good actor Fairbanks was.  His emotional journey here is quite powerful as he faces the death of his lady and of his friends  and he ages convincingly as well.Most of the cast is different to the Three Musketeers but Margueritte de la Motte returns as Constance and the unforgettable Nigel de Brulier again plays Richilieu with extreme venom.Fairbanks has an athletic field day as well.  There seem to be a number of versions of this film around.  The one I saw ran 95 minutes and had tinted sequences.  I've seen some advertised as having talking sequences and others with narration by Douglas Fairbanks Jr  the one i saw had neither of these.It was probably the last large scale silent feature made in Hollywood. And that is what gives those gorgeous last minutes such power.  The silent era was truly the golden years of Hollywood and Fairbanks was its king  in this film he sadly abdicates.".

Dumas' trilogy The Three Musketeers Twenty Years After and The Vicomte de Bragelonne have been reincarnated as animated characters French Legionnaires secret agents troubadours and even Texas Rangers!A Modern Musketeer ...D'Artagnan was perfect casting for an excessively energetic Douglas Fairbanks in A Modern Musketeer 1917. The film offered a glimpse of the young swordsman as a fantasy sequence within a modern story. It also served as a seed of inspiration when Fairbanks launched into the final decade of his silent film career with a series of costume dramas including The Three Musketeers 1921. The art direction production design and originality of these films which include Robin Hood 1923 The Thief of Bagdad 1924 and The Gaucho 1928 remains unsurpassed today. As his finale to the silent era Fairbanks returned to Dumas and D'Artagnan's further adventures in The Iron Mask 1929. Along with Fairbanks returning from the 1921 film were Marguerite De La Motte as Constance Nigel De Brulier as Cardinal Richelieu a character he played four times Lon Poff as Father Joseph Charles Stevens as Planchet D'Artagnan's servant Leon Bary as Athos and screenwriter Lotta Woods. Fairbanks also gave a nod to the coming of sound by including a Vitaphone soundondisk synchronized musical score which included a spoken prologue and bridge between the end of the Musketeers and Twenty Years After. In 1929 the film was released with both sound and silent versions as was often the case.It is sometimes more difficult for Kings to return  Than to make an exit.This was the last and final time Fairbanks would buckle his swash and the culmination of a lifetime playing humorous and highspirited action heroes. For it's sheer brilliance of concept its fluid movement from one scene to the next with the continuous flow of narrative the initial introduction of characters and setup of the story in this film is unequaled. The film begins with the entrance of King Louis XIII at St. Germain as he anxiously awaits the birth of an heir. The quality of set design thousands of costumed extras used monumental production scale and painstaking detail of craftsmanship could never be undertaken today. From the palace the action moves to D'Artagnan beckoning Constance from the street below her window. She must hurry to the waiting Queen's coach and in a sequence of almost balletic beauty she and D'Artagnan hurry from place to place in search of a moment's privacy and a kiss. At fortyfive Fairbanks shows every bit of the athletic grace seen in earlier films as he and De La Motte glide over a garden wall and back again. Fairbanks gives his character just the right amount of boyish mischief to balance a flawless performance. D'Artagnon literally rides into the next scene as he jumps from the coach to the aid of his fellow musketeers. They challenge the Cardinal's Guards then seamlessly move into a wonderful display of humorous camaraderie as the four link arms in a tugofwar between the much larger Porthos Stanley J. Stanford and D'Artagnan that ends as they pull a cartload of barrels into a tavern. Only Fairbanks could transform something as simple as catching a tossed breadroll into a captivating display of skill. The Musketeers are left to pass the time as the action returns to the palace and Louis presenting his newborn son to the cheering sea of humanity below and that ain't cgi!. And then of course there is  the other one  As in all Fairbanks' films the swordplay is spectacular this time using Belgian fencing master Fred Cavens as coach and consultant. Overall production was supervised by Maurice Leloir  the acknowledged authority on the period depicted. With The Iron Mask  Fairbanks offers a combination of action romance and humor showcasing the skills that he developed over years as he literally defined the genre. It's hard to imagine having a better time at any movie.".

	schema:headline " First version based on Alexandre Dumas' classic yarn of intrigue at the 17th century French court";
	schema:reviewBody "Early silent swashbuckling with talking sequences  starred by a master swordsman  Douglas Fairbanks defending the French king from a scheme involving substitution by a lookalike . This is an epic retelling about the durable Alexandre Dumas's novel and is set in 17th century French court . In St Germain  on fifth of September  1638  public excitement ran high in anticipation of an important event  there was born the royal heir . As twins brothers the same actor playing a double role  separated at birth one become in Louis XIV of France and the other is banished . The latter returns and unjustly imprisons his brother  being forced to wear an iron mask that hides his identity . Both of whom are sons of the Queen mother Anna of Austria . Later on  the real king is jailed by his tyrannical brother in an isolated castle and is hidden his identity wearing the iron mask but his existence threatens the reigning . But there is a friendship that is born of God  it is not altered by time  nor affected by circumstance  it endures to the grave and beyond . Four musketeers whose friendship has become a legend to stir the hearts of men and shouting One for all and all for one. Straightforward as well as gallant D'Artagnan and the three musketeers scheme a plan to free him clashing against a malicious Richelieu  the Louis XIV's favorite and his hoodlum Rochefort . As the kidnapped king is eventually rescued by the musketeers and takes place a royal vengeance . It's an excellent rendition from the immortal novel with quite budget and spectacular action . The picture contains rousing scenes  intrigue  derringdo  exciting swordplay  romantic adventure  mayhem  a lot of fun and is pretty entertaining . It's a silent movie with two brief speeches by Douglas Fairbanks at the beginning and intermission . In this film the Four Musketeers  Athos Porthos Aramis and D'Artagnan  all sleep together in one bed with the French phrase 'Un Pour Tous Tous Pour Un'  One For All All For One inscribed on the headboard. This entire production was under the supervision of Maurice Leloir  member of the Society of French Artists  illustrator of the Three Musketeers  the acknowledged authority on the period depicted . Marvelous casting with a magnificent Douglas Fairbanks as a valiant swashbuckler . Charming Douglas Fairbanks steals the show when he bounds and leaps  flies and run  in addition he is the screenwriter of this rollicking adventure . Fairbanks executes athletic feats  moving swordplay and spectacular acrobatics similarly he demonstrated in other classics such as The Mark of Zorro 1920 Robin Hood 1922 Three musketeers  Don Q Son of Zorro  The gaucho  The iron mask  The Taming of the Shrew  Don Juan  Mr Robinson  among others . Douglas performed most of the stunts in his films himself. He was an excellent athlete and used his physical abilities to his best advantage. Douglas was king of Hollywood by that time and he formed his own production company  during a Liberty Bond tour with Charles Chaplin he fell in love with Mary Pickford with whom he Chaplin and Griffith had formed United Artists in 1919. Lush production design is well reflected on the luxurious interiors and exteriors . The motion picture was lavishly produced and well realized by Allan Dwan .The realization is fairly exciting  thanks largely to filmmaker Allan Dwan's fair play and achieving a masterly style by skillful lighting .This classy story is subsequently remade several versions  for both TV and the big screen . Firstly this mute rendition 1929  after that  The man in the iron mask by James Whale1939 with Louis Hayward  Alan Hale and Joan Bennet  The Fifth Musketeer1979 by Ken Annakin with Beau Bridges  Rex Harrison  Silvia Kristel  Ursula Andress  Iron mask1997 by William Richert with Timothy Bottoms  Edward Albert  James Gammon  Dana Barron  Meg Foster and finally The man in the iron mask 1998  a big production by Randall Wallace with Leonardo DiCaprio  Gerard Depardieu  John Malkovich  Jeremy Irons . And TV adaptation of the classy Iron mask 1977 by Mike Newell with Richard Chamberlain  Jenny Agutter  Ian Holm  Ralph Richardson .".

	onyx:emotionText "Early silent swashbuckling with talking sequences  starred by a master swordsman  Douglas Fairbanks defending the French king from a scheme involving substitution by a lookalike . This is an epic retelling about the durable Alexandre Dumas's novel and is set in 17th century French court . In St Germain  on fifth of September  1638  public excitement ran high in anticipation of an important event  there was born the royal heir . As twins brothers the same actor playing a double role  separated at birth one become in Louis XIV of France and the other is banished . The latter returns and unjustly imprisons his brother  being forced to wear an iron mask that hides his identity . Both of whom are sons of the Queen mother Anna of Austria . Later on  the real king is jailed by his tyrannical brother in an isolated castle and is hidden his identity wearing the iron mask but his existence threatens the reigning . But there is a friendship that is born of God  it is not altered by time  nor affected by circumstance  it endures to the grave and beyond . Four musketeers whose friendship has become a legend to stir the hearts of men and shouting One for all and all for one. Straightforward as well as gallant D'Artagnan and the three musketeers scheme a plan to free him clashing against a malicious Richelieu  the Louis XIV's favorite and his hoodlum Rochefort . As the kidnapped king is eventually rescued by the musketeers and takes place a royal vengeance . It's an excellent rendition from the immortal novel with quite budget and spectacular action . The picture contains rousing scenes  intrigue  derringdo  exciting swordplay  romantic adventure  mayhem  a lot of fun and is pretty entertaining . It's a silent movie with two brief speeches by Douglas Fairbanks at the beginning and intermission . In this film the Four Musketeers  Athos Porthos Aramis and D'Artagnan  all sleep together in one bed with the French phrase 'Un Pour Tous Tous Pour Un'  One For All All For One inscribed on the headboard. This entire production was under the supervision of Maurice Leloir  member of the Society of French Artists  illustrator of the Three Musketeers  the acknowledged authority on the period depicted . Marvelous casting with a magnificent Douglas Fairbanks as a valiant swashbuckler . Charming Douglas Fairbanks steals the show when he bounds and leaps  flies and run  in addition he is the screenwriter of this rollicking adventure . Fairbanks executes athletic feats  moving swordplay and spectacular acrobatics similarly he demonstrated in other classics such as The Mark of Zorro 1920 Robin Hood 1922 Three musketeers  Don Q Son of Zorro  The gaucho  The iron mask  The Taming of the Shrew  Don Juan  Mr Robinson  among others . Douglas performed most of the stunts in his films himself. He was an excellent athlete and used his physical abilities to his best advantage. Douglas was king of Hollywood by that time and he formed his own production company  during a Liberty Bond tour with Charles Chaplin he fell in love with Mary Pickford with whom he Chaplin and Griffith had formed United Artists in 1919. Lush production design is well reflected on the luxurious interiors and exteriors . The motion picture was lavishly produced and well realized by Allan Dwan .The realization is fairly exciting  thanks largely to filmmaker Allan Dwan's fair play and achieving a masterly style by skillful lighting .This classy story is subsequently remade several versions  for both TV and the big screen . Firstly this mute rendition 1929  after that  The man in the iron mask by James Whale1939 with Louis Hayward  Alan Hale and Joan Bennet  The Fifth Musketeer1979 by Ken Annakin with Beau Bridges  Rex Harrison  Silvia Kristel  Ursula Andress  Iron mask1997 by William Richert with Timothy Bottoms  Edward Albert  James Gammon  Dana Barron  Meg Foster and finally The man in the iron mask 1998  a big production by Randall Wallace with Leonardo DiCaprio  Gerard Depardieu  John Malkovich  Jeremy Irons . And TV adaptation of the classy Iron mask 1977 by Mike Newell with Richard Chamberlain  Jenny Agutter  Ian Holm  Ralph Richardson .";

	schema:headline " Wonderful! Especially the rerelease with Jr's narration";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me begin by stating that I am reviewing the 1952 rerelease version with Douglas Fairbanks Jr's narration written I might add by Richard Llewellyn of How Green Was My Valley fame. Fairbanks the younger's delivery of Llewellyn's words is shear poetry! I know this version has been cut and usually I prefer films as they were originally intended but in this case I'll make an exception since DFJ's narration really makes the film for me. Still it would be nice to see how the original talkie bits sounded in the elder Fairbank's voice. I might have to catch the restored original too. Aside from the joy of listening to DFJ's beautiful voice bring his father's work to life for me I must say I really enjoyed the picture itself. I've seen both the 1939 version with Louis Hayward and the 1977 version with Richard Chamberlain and while both of those are very good this one might be the best of the three. Thanks to Fairbanks Sr. of course it probably has the best action sequences but the over all acting is also quite wonderful. I must say I was especially impressed with William Blakewell in the duel role of the twins Nigel De Brulier as Richelieu and Ullrich Haupt as the villain De Rochefort. This was Fairbanks' final silent film and his acting here is at its best. He makes a perfect D'Artagnan! The sets and costumes are also magnificent here! Fairbanks pretty much wrote the script tooeven though he disguised that fact somewhat by using his middle names in the credits. The credits read story by Elton Thomas Fairbanks' full birth name was Douglas Elton Thomas Ullman. Maybe he figured that having his name in the credits as both star and producer was enough. And although the storyline varies in many important ways in the Haywood version 10 years later in other ways it follows Fairbanks' ending quite closely. It's been years since I saw the 1977 version but I think its plot is not as close. I do remember it had some marvelous acting in it but considering it starred Richard Chamberlain Sir Ralph Richardson Louis Jourdan and Patrick McGoohan how could it not? Anyway back to the 1929 versionI've seen more than my share of Three Musketeers films and this is one of the best!".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the best versions of The Man in the Iron Mask and one of Douglas Fairbanks' best films too. Detailswise The Iron Mask might deviate from the book but the spirit of the story still remains and in a much better way than most of the versions that followed it. It does feel rushed at times and William Bakewell does do much better as the good twin than the evil twin as the good twin he is sincere but as the evil twin he does overegg the pudding too much. The sets and costumes are beautiful with the attention to detail authentic while the photography is equally effective like the shadowy effects in the prison scenes that are most atmospheric. Carl Davis' score fits the action very well and sounds sweeping in an appropriate way. The film is written in a snappy way the story is as fun energetic exciting and tense as the story of The Man in the Iron Mask is the ending is genuinely movingand not just mildly this is emotional stuff and the action is rousing and leaves you at the edge of your seat biting your nails and cheering for the heroes. Douglas Fairbanks is an as ever lively presence with stunts and athletic moves that are the envy of anybody regardless of their age but brings also pathos to his performance as well. In support everybody is very good but Nigel De Brulier is broadly venomous Margarite De LaMotte will leave you really identifying with Constance and rooting for her and Ulrich Haupt is a sinister Rochefort but with somewhat a charm of his own. All in all well worth looking out for Fairbanks' touted farewell to silent swashbucklers is an excellent film. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " This review is for the Silent version where sound and narration were later added...a definite mistake when seen today.";
	schema:reviewBody "The version of IRON MASK that I saw is a silent film with the intertitle cards removed and dialognarration by Douglas Fairbanks as well as incidental sounds and music added laterduring the sound era. He did despite rumors have a very nice voice and was perfect for the role of narrator. I would have much preferred to see the movie in its original form as viewing it this way was a bit odd. It was like watching a silent and having someone talk throughoutacting out some of the parts and describing the action. Many of the descriptions such as the dice are kind as D'Artagnon wins at playing dice are completely unnecessary and detract from the film.This sort of reissuing of a silent with narration and sound is not unheard of as Chaplin did this with THE GOLD RUSH. About 20 years after its initial silent release Chaplin rereleased it with his narration and a musical score he wrote himself. Many complained about this as a bastardization of the original but I actually like both versions about equallythey are indeed classics. I assume Chaplin got this idea in part from the rerelease of IRON MASK.The film begins with some irrelevant scenes where the four Musketeers get into trouble and have fun. When the actual important part of the story begins Louis XIII is excited because his wife just had a son! He is thrilled to have an heir. But unexpectedly shortly after the baby's birth the Queen gives birth to another boyan identical twin! Cardinal Richelieu and his sidekick begin their schemingand their rival Rochefort finds out their plans. Richelieu's plan is to have the other child raised as a commoner along the Spanish frontierwhy exactly he's doing this is unknown. It's interesting that in this version Rochefort is a scoundrel much like Richelieu is in later onesas in later versions such as the Louis Hayward and Richard Chamberlain films Rochefort was a good guy and worked with the Musketeers for France's best interests and Richelieu was a scheming jerk. Here the roles are reversed and the entire story is changed. Instead of removing a bad king Louis XIV and substituting a good twin brother the plan of Rochefort is to get rid of the good one and install the more malleable and evil one in his place.Years have passed and Rochefort has gotten a hold of the twinturning him evil and selfish. On the other hand the Prince has grown into a decent guy and able rulerdue in part to the able tutelage by D'Artagnon. Rochefort plans to have the evil twin substituted in place of good King Louis XIV. Who will win this battle of wits? Watch it for yourself and see.Like most of Fairbanks' other silents this one in which he starred was a highbudget filmwith great sets and costumes. Considering he was the biggest swashbuckling star of the era this isn't surprising and it looks great. While the story is a bit jumbled as well as hurried in the process it's a pretty good moviethough I strongly recommend you try to find the original version if you canFairbanks just talks too much in this one and you lose some of the beauty of this wellacted film.".

Mind you it works rather well  and for 5.95 who's complaining? Fans are more likely to complain that the three musketeers have so little to do in this version  but that's the way it was written by Dumas himself! And that's one reason The Iron Mask has never been even half as popular with readers as The Three Musketeers. In fact in my childhood days I always thought D'Artagnan was a somewhat flawed hero. He spends a whole book fighting Cardinal Richelieu and his hired thugs but at the end of the book what does he do but join them! However the lead character of The Iron Mask is actually not D'Artagnan but Richelieu here so charismatically played by Nigel De Brulier reprising his role from the 1921 Three Musketeers. The villain the man in the mask himself is brilliantly played by William Bakewell who differentiates between the two princes most adroitly. They certainly look alike but Bakewell always ensures the audience knows who is who  even if the characters on the screen do not! Produced on a grand budget and atmospherically photographed by Henry Sharp on sets designed by William Cameron Menzies The Iron Mask rates as absolutely mustsee entertainment!".

	schema:reviewBody "Eightyfive years after it was made The Iron Mask retains its luster its magnetism and it's delightful storytelling. Despite its veering from the plot of Dumas' great novel The Iron Mask is a highly entertaining adventure in its own right. Of course with Douglas Fairbanks as the D'Artagnan character the film has an advantage right out of the gate. It has less overthetop action than in earlier Fairbanks swashbucklers and Fairbanks's acrobatics are more subdued than in his earlier actioners. But at age 46 he could still bound and leap and climb and buckle a swash better than the best men half his age better in fact than almost any man of any age. And what an actor! Just his smile could make his audience joyful. His tenderness his sincerity and his depth were irresistible convincing capturing every emotion he wished to convey. Although this was his last silent film it contained a brief sound introduction to Part 1 and another to Part 2 both with shots of Fairbanks narrating in a stirring proud voice. A few elements of the film are dated most notably the shots of the evil royal twin who emoted in the hammiest sense. Little items like that do not detract from the appeal of The Iron Mask. This was the first time I'd watched it. I will watch it again.".

A few elements of the film are dated most notably the shots of the evil royal twin who emoted in the hammiest sense. Little items like that do not detract from the appeal of The Iron Mask. This was the first time I'd watched it. I will watch it again.";

I like to think of this rather than The Private Life Of Don Juan as his real farewell picture.Actually a bit of The Three Musketeers plot is brought in to set the stage for the twin sons of Louis XIII who threatened a dynastic crisis for the Bourbons in France. Rocheford the villain who dies in The Three Musketeers lives here in the person of Ulrich Haupt who takes over the raising of the second born twin in obscurity in the Pyrenees over the Spanish border. Rocheford works on the kid but being abandoned by his parents will work on you psychologically no matter what the circumstances.When the time is right Haupt strikes and substitutes one twin for the other both played by William Bakewell. It's bad karma to kill royalty outright so Haupt devises this iron mask to imprison the real Louis XIV so no one knows who he is and thinks him a mad man. Of course the plot is foiled and Fairbanks repeating the role of D'Artagnan does the foiling together with his musketeer companions of days gone by as they ride one last time for the honor of France.The version I saw eschewed subtitles and had a narration supplied by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. who did the dialog with proper lan and reverence for his father. It makes for marvelous viewing and hearing.The Iron Mask has to be considered one of Douglas Fairbanks best films and holds remarkably well for today's audience.".

You see the bad guy in the beginning but there wasn't much character development which made the villain very generic which also made it obvious how the story is going to end. Kato's role was generic as well like he was a typical Asian foreigner who does all the hard work but no play. Now I understand why Nicolas Cage turned down the role of the villain and same with Stephen Chow as Kato...lame. Besides the cheesy characters the fight scenes were done in slow motion which made it seem fake and derivative of the Matrix Seth Rogen green hornet was annoyingly loud most of the time I didn't really understand what Jay Chou Kato was saying sometimes because of his heavy accent which also made his acting kind of wooden and Cameron Diaz felt like she was there just for star power for some reason. Even the action scenes especially towards the end was very boring believe it or not I actually fell asleep during the middle of an action scene my brother tapped me on my shoulder to wake me up. There was nothing in this movie that was really interesting other than maybe the black beauty green hornet's car and maybe his hornet gun and that's about it. And what was up with the 3 D? The glasses made the movie too dark and did nothing to the experience I am getting really sick of 3D.".

	schema:headline " Stupidly Dumb!";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't know why I went to see this but I wish I could get my money back. Wow this movie was really irritating me. First of all being of an Asian descent myself I expected Jay Chou's character Kato to be somewhat represented fairly with respect to Bruce Lee but most of the scenes have him doing all the hard work and not getting any action from the ladies. There was a brief scene with Cameron Diaz but nothing happened. I find that kind of odd because Kato seems to be more of the superhero than Seth Rogen's character Britt Reid as The Green Hornet and aren't superheroes suppose to get the ladies? There wasn't even a romance other than a brief flirtation in the office. No offense to Jay Chou fans but his Asian accent wasn't very flattering either because his role is of a stereotypical Asian martial arts expert that drives Seth Rogen's character Britt Reid around as a chauffeur. And I understand that's how the story goes with the characters but I find that kind of ironic because Bruce Lee tried to avoid the Asian stereotype with the heavy accent. Besides the stereotypical Asian accent the fight scenes with Kato were interesting and pretty to look at but the fancy special effects also made the martial arts seem a little fake. Instead of the real thing like Jackie Chan's or Jet Li's fight scenes I felt like I was watching a video game of a player going through the motion. And I understand the fight was stylized to be funny but it felt more campy than funny like all that was missing were those big letters that said POW!. I also found Seth Rogen as The Green Hornet awkward to watch with his overacting obnoxious personality which wasn't very likable throughout the movie and I understand he was trying to be funny too but there wasn't anything really all that humorous despite some funny moments. Overall the film felt lazily produced and I agree with critics like Ebert there wasn't a well structured plot. It's as if Rogen wrote the story to fit his type of characters that he portrays in every movie which also kind of ruins it for the followers of the comic and I understand it's just an adaptation but still even a big time star like Cameron Diaz's role seemed to be in the movie just for her name only. And Christoph Waltz's portrayal of the villain wasn't very inspiring either kind of a waste of his talent not like Inglourious Basterds. Also I question the morals of the story. I'm not sure what Rogen and Goldberg were thinking when they were developing the script considering The Green Hornet TV show in the 60's wouldn't have been popular without Bruce Lee. One of the themes about the movie was inequality between The Green Hornet and Kato and when the movie ended the two decided to be equal but it didn't seem like it. It felt like Kato is always going to be in the background doing all the hard work without getting any credit which is kind of a slap in the face to Bruce Lee because like I mentioned he did not want to be portrayed as a stereotypical Asian man. That's one reason he left the U.S. for Hong Kong to pursue his passion for cinema. One last thing the 3D glasses made the movie too dark it felt like a first shooter game and did nothing to the experience.".

I also found Seth Rogen as The Green Hornet awkward to watch with his overacting obnoxious personality which wasn't very likable throughout the movie and I understand he was trying to be funny too but there wasn't anything really all that humorous despite some funny moments. Overall the film felt lazily produced and I agree with critics like Ebert there wasn't a well structured plot. It's as if Rogen wrote the story to fit his type of characters that he portrays in every movie which also kind of ruins it for the followers of the comic and I understand it's just an adaptation but still even a big time star like Cameron Diaz's role seemed to be in the movie just for her name only. And Christoph Waltz's portrayal of the villain wasn't very inspiring either kind of a waste of his talent not like Inglourious Basterds. Also I question the morals of the story. I'm not sure what Rogen and Goldberg were thinking when they were developing the script considering The Green Hornet TV show in the 60's wouldn't have been popular without Bruce Lee. One of the themes about the movie was inequality between The Green Hornet and Kato and when the movie ended the two decided to be equal but it didn't seem like it. It felt like Kato is always going to be in the background doing all the hard work without getting any credit which is kind of a slap in the face to Bruce Lee because like I mentioned he did not want to be portrayed as a stereotypical Asian man. That's one reason he left the U.S. for Hong Kong to pursue his passion for cinema. One last thing the 3D glasses made the movie too dark it felt like a first shooter game and did nothing to the experience.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Green Hornet is a wanna be superhero movie trying to be original by following the scheme of Seth Rogan's character Britt Reid to become a superhero that is perceived as a criminal to the public. The problem is that Britt Reid doesn't even deserve to be a superhero because his coffee maker Kato Jay Chou is the one with super powers. The only things Britt Reid can do is be very obnoxious and use his money and power of the press to sensationalize his character while giving no credit to Kato. The origin of this story comes from The Green Hornet's debut in 1936 on the radio. The character was created by George W. Trendle and Frank Striker and has taken a journey through various mediums in time including a comic book and television series in the mid 1900s. However its newest medium in 3D fails to capture the spark that lit the character's way to fame. The lackluster film begins with showing the bad relationship that Britt had with his father James Reid Tom Wilkinson when he was a kid. This scene is followed by a very special cameo appearance of James Franco while establishing the ego of the character of criminal Benjamin Chudnofsky Cristoph Waltz Inglourious Bastards and his aspiration to rake over the streets. Chudnofsky later changes his name to Bloodnofsky in order to sound scarier in his pursuit to take down Britt's alter ego The Green Hornet which forms after his father dies from an allergic reaction to a bee sting. As Britt's alter ego begins to take over the street solely because of Kato who does not receive any recognition and their car The Black Beauty a secret about Britt's father unfolds along with a love triangle between Britt Kato and Britt's new secretary Lenore Case Cameron DiazThe most memorable scene in the film is James Franco's cameo of the criminal mastermind of the city. He receives a little less than five minutes of screen time with Cristoph Waltz's character Chudnofsky who work together to create a scene with great acting and a subtle comedic undertone. After this scene it is an uphill battle for the characters of Kato and Chudnofsky to salvage the remains of the film. Kato does this with his skill and gadget repertoire while Chudnofsky strives to boost his ego with decent oneliners.The problems with the film do not necessarily stem from the subject because the film really could have been a decent superhero movie. Instead the two biggest problems fall into the categories of casting and entertainment. Seth Rogan is actually a very funny guy and a decent actor when he is cast in the right film as a supporting character The Forty Year Old Virgin Funny People but when the spotlight is on him in a film outside his genre repertoire bad things happen. Rogan is completely out of his element with the role of Britt Reid and is not able to do anything about it. He is not a likable character at all and is completely overshadowed by Kato. The film should have been saved from its entertainment factor but fails on this account as well because the film is downright boring. Boring is the word of the day when it comes to The Green Hornet which should have abused the 3D medium with The Black Beauty and Kato's heightened senses. However a better name suited for the film is one spoke of by Britt himself when he talks about his alter ego being named the Green Bee exemplifying a boring undertone that would help keep you away from theaters and waiting for DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm getting sick of people who are angry with those of us who love the Green Hornet and want to defend the character from this piece of crap movie. Nobody knows him anyway is what I hear a lot but apparently enough people in Hollywood knew of him and thought enough of the name to use it as a way to sell tickets instead of just creating a new character. It is understandable that most people don't know very much about the Green Hornet. He was created by George W. Trendle who also created the 'Lone Ranger' during the hayday of radio dramas. Britt Reid is actually a distant relative of John Reid a.k.a. the Lone Ranger. Both were ahead of their time insomuch as the heroes worked with sidekicks very unusual for their time period. The Lone Ranger with an Indian back in the old west and when the Green Hornet premiered in the 1940's it was unheard of for an oriental sidekick. In the old west everyone thought the Lone Ranger was bad because he wore a mask. The Green Hornet purposely wanted people to think he was bad. Neither Tonto or Kato was written or intended to be subservient. Kato was Britt Reids assistant as part of his cover. The Green Hornet is supposed to be a crimeboss that's why he sits in the back of the car NOT because he just wants Kato to drive him around! Both men bring much to the partnership and both are excellent fighters just in different styles. Kato with martial arts and Britt with 'street fighting' abilities. They are also closer than brothers! Van Williams and Bruce Lee understood this very well and it came across in their screen time together. Even watching the old TV show now there is no hint of Kato being a 'lesser' person to Britt Reid.OK history lesson over now on to this complete piece of trash. I actually have no problem with the initial portrayal of Britt Reid as a louse who parties all the time. The problem is he NEVER grows up! If he had some redeeming qualities it might have been better. Perhaps a real talent for journalism which he had in the radio  TV shows a 'buddy' relationship with Kato or even the lovable rich rogue somewhat like Bruce Wayne. Seth Rogan has turned the Green Hornet into nothing more than a reject from animal house. Why after being nothing but a jerk to everyone would Rogan's character all of a sudden want to fight crime!?!?!? I don't know when we went from partners being friends to hating each other but working well together but it's stupid. I don't even particularly care for the guy playing Kato. He's a capable enough actor but he's no where near as cool as Bruce Lee but that aside there is absolutely no reason for him to like much less work with Britt. We're supposed to believe that both of these guys hated Britt's dad so much that they are willing to work together even though there is really nothing to even suggest they are more than rich guyassistant. Lenore Case was not the 'mastermind' behind the Green Hornet. She knew his identity and was able to help cover for him and help him in his guise as Britt Reid. She was a necessary part of the team and actually had a crush on Britt but not the all controlling figure that we are supposed to believe she is in this movie.The bad guy with a problem of not being scary enough was great for about 10 minutes. It created some pretty funny dialogue but went on for a hour and a half too long. This guy wasn't even worth Kato's time much less the Green Hornet. He could have been caught by T.J.Hooker. Why do we need a superhero if the bad guy is not REEEEAAALLY bad! I am not naming the other actors because I'm sure that by being in a movie with Seth Rogan is punishment enough. I wouldn't want my name associated with this movie either.If you've read this far I will say there are some things I liked. The homage' to the TV series in costuming and design of the Black Beauty as well as the switch in the garage were a nice touch. There is even a great 30 sec. scene at the end with the old theme and logo popping up that doesn't last long enough but it was nice to see. Sadly this movie had so much promise. There are a lot of possibilities for this character and Rogan didn't seem to like any of them. If you're going to make a movie about a doofass who becomes a superhero fine but why do you have to take established characters and destroy them. Please do yourself a favor seek out the old series with Van Williams  Bruce Lee. It's a much better use of your time.".

And surprisingly enough it managed to do so in a good enough way. But there were also aspects of the movie that were less than successful.First of all Seth Rogen playing Britt ReidThe Green Hornet. No no no. I know he was involved in directing and writing the movie and all but he is not chiseled out for an action role of this caliber. I do admire his spirit and enthusiasm but he is more suited for comedy movies. Seeing him in this role didn't go well with me. He did bring along some comedy but it didn't work so well in this particular movie.And the scene at the beginning where Britt Reid was bringing home a woman and they went through the garage and sat in all the cars showing them off for the audience actually in highspeed capture what was up with that? Already at that point the movie started to falter and crash.Jay Chou playing Kato certainly had HUGE shoes to fill out after the original role was played by Bruce Lee. And actually Chou did a decent enough job with good acting and wellchoreographed actionfighting sequences. So hats off to him for that.However the most memorable person in the movie was Christoph Waltz playing Chudnofsky. He was fantastic as a villain and worked his role very well and very convincingly. Plus there was also a good sense of humor to his role and it worked well.The story told in the movie was fastpaced captivating and interesting enough to keep you enthralled throughout the entire feature length.For an action movie then The Green Hornet is actually quite good. But for a followup to the legacy of the TV series the movie is a mediocre attempt with good intentions. Had they cast someone else for Britt Reid it would have worked much better. Now I am not saying that Seth Rogen is a bad actor he was just illsuited for this role. The Green Hornet is good entertainment if you are in for an evening of action corny oneliners and a trip down memory lane.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a sucker for hero type movies and I thought The Green Hornet was great. I'm not sure what some people are saying about it but I think movie goers nowadays with all this technology expect movies to fly off the screen at you. Give movies the credit they deserve and see it for what it is  a piece of entertainment.Seth Rogan's character was of a spoiled son who was trying to get attention from his father so his character being mean to Kato was not a surprise since he never had any siblings before. Anyone who knows human nature would agree.I think the storyline was able to be followed the dialogue was funny and the action was great. The movie industry isn't like it used to be since all these kids have so much electronics they don't know what to do with themselves anymore so it becomes a challenge to produce movies that everyone is going to like. Instead of putting down a movie so quickly look at all of its points.I enjoyed the movie and recommend it to anyone who wants to go and see something good  but see it in 2D. You'll like it better.".

I'm not sure what some people are saying about it but I think movie goers nowadays with all this technology expect movies to fly off the screen at you. Give movies the credit they deserve and see it for what it is  a piece of entertainment.Seth Rogan's character was of a spoiled son who was trying to get attention from his father so his character being mean to Kato was not a surprise since he never had any siblings before.

	schema:reviewBody "I've been keeping my expectations low for this film and I'm glad that I did. I was a big fan of the 60's television show but I didn't watch any episodes until the mid 90's so I've been waiting almost 15 years for a film adaptation on the Green Hornet.The film is campy the story is corny the villain is wasted and Seth Rogen wrote the script. Based on the plot and the dialogs it's not a well made movie but it doesn't try to be. This movie could have been written more seriously and be on the same map as a Christopher Nolan's Batman film but instead it went on the road to be a comedic film with a lot of explosions. Some stuff didn't work other stuff was clever  visually entertaining.The stuff that I admired the most are the homage to the original television show. There were some criticism to the 60's show about how the Kato character was just a sidekick butler manservant an aid or a chauffeur to the Green Hornet. Bruce Lee didn't have much dialogs and he didn't have much screen time. It was during the 60's and just having an AsianAmerican to be an everyday character on a show was a big deal so I never saw that as an insult. In this movie they make a HUGE deal about that subject as Seth Rogen  Jay Chou are constantly arguing about Kato's role throughout the whole film.Other homage to the television show is a drawn image of Bruce Lee Al Hirt's theme Flight of the Bumblebee tune and there's even a scenario from my favorite episode that has been written into the movie. The Black Beauty is also a very awesome car! The funny thing is that in the TV show the Black Beauty was a brand new  very recent 1966 Imperial Crown sedan. In the movie it's the exact same vehicle but it's now a classical vintage car.I saw the 3D version and there were very few sequences where the 3D effects was worth the extra price of admission. I recommend saving your money and watch the 2D version instead.To finally sum everything up the movie isn't good but it brought back my love for the characters inside the Green Hornet world. The film is visually entertaining for what it is. I hope there's a sequel but that somebody else will write its screenplay.".

It is also a bromance with Cameron Diaz as Lenore Case a love interest who helps us get over the homoerotic subtext.Geeks know the Green Hornet franchise well radio show from 1936 to 1952 TV show in 1966 by the producers of the campy Batman TV series while Green Hornet's greatest asset was emerging martial arts star Bruce Lee. Writers Rogen and Evan Goldberg renew that 60's camp but with it seeming out of date as if the parodic part of the genre cycle had long ago been played out and not welcome anymore. Of course you could argue that Despicable Me Kick Ass Megamind and Iron Man 2 last year took to parody but each one of those is more successful at marrying the satire to the action than Green Hornet.The personality of the film is splitit's either satire or action Hornet or Kato. The film is a bit away from the accepted concepts of this subgenre except in Chudnofsky Christoph Waltz the arch villain whose ironic reactions are an adept amalgam of menace and insouciance.As he did in Inglorious Basterds Waltz commands the screen with his charming menace. Actually he is equaled in the opening sequence the best scene of the movie when he faces off James Franco in a cameo two hoods pissing about their territory. Franco is quite good as a semiclueless drug lord.Britt has daddy issues specifically making something of his life while newspaper owner dad. Jack Reid Tom Wilkinson is a hero to the city. With dad's death Britt decides to fight crime as the Green Hornet while letting everyone think he is a criminal as in the original versions.The gadgets are Bondworthy and Kato has the Bruce Lee charisma it's just Rogen who seems out of placenot believable as a hero from beginning to end of the film. He can be amusing as a mankid but the geeks will never accept him as their hero.The Green Hornet has lost its buzz.".

	schema:headline " Seth Rogan surprisingly good as The Green Hornet.";
	schema:reviewBody "When I heard that Seth Rogan was going to play the Green Hornet I had my doubts. He often portrays the same character the loserstonernice guy. I used to like the comic book and TV series and I probably watched it because my dad played the trumpet and he liked to play the Flight Of The Bumble Bee theme song trying to emulate Al Hirt. Not now Kato was one of my early quotable phrases. Green Hornet was less popular than Superman and Batman but had the better sidekick with Bruce Lee's portrayal of Kato.And with the spate of movies that have been based on comic books the expectations were high. So many blockbusters have been superherobased and I was wondering if this movie was made only because it was one of the few left that hadn't already been made into a movie and the producers were hoping to jump on the bandwagon. So with that I eagerly anticipated seeing this movie.The movie opens with a gripping and yet goofy storyline. Christoph Waltz plays the criminal mastermind Chudnofsky a man obsessed with being scary and quickly establishes himself as the evil villain. Amid the violence is dialog that makes you laugh aloud. It won't be the last time.Rogan plays Britt Reid the overindulged party animal son of a wealthy newspaper owner. He and his father have had a tough relationship with Reid never living up to his father's impossibly high standards. After his father dies he discovers Kato Jay Chou who while devoted to the elder Reid also was treated poorly. As Britt discovers that Kato is a genius with cars and gadgets they unwittingly become a pair of crime fighters. It's a nice back story that sets the stage well for the sometimes rivaled relationship. They also compete for the attention of the secretary Lenore Cameron Diaz a role that is way underdeveloped. I'm not sure about this choice for the role and even though I enjoy Diaz it probably was time for a younger and fresher face to have been cast.Unlike the earlier incarnations D.A. Scanlon David Harbour and the Green Hornet are not close allies. As the story unfolds we get to see some of those great cars and gadgets. But it is the fight sequences that really sizzle. I saw the 2D version of this movie and when it is released it will be a 3D version and the fight sequences will no doubt benefit by being viewed in 3D but even in 2D they were awesome. The car chases and some other scenes will also likely be fun to watch in 3D but I'm not sure that this movie really needed the extra special effects in order to become a classic.Throughout the movie I was surprised by how often there were laughoutloud moments as well as some great oneliners usually by Rogan. Of course there is the climactic chase scene and shoot out with some new and interesting ways in order to make it fresh. You won't be saying I've seen THAT before  believe me. The only problem I had was that the premise for the final car chase is a bit flimsy and breaks the movie magic for me. Spoiler Alert I mean really a hidden tape recorder that records on a flash drive but you have to go back to the office to upload it? Wouldn't you build mobile communications into the car if you took the time to install a fax machine? But I'm willing to suspend reality and forgive breaks from older story lines when it comes to the movies and just let myself get wrapped up in the spectacle unfolding on the screen. Green Hornet is funny actionpacked wellacted and gadgetfilled to make this one of my favorite superhero movies. I'll probably see it again in 3D just for fun. Rated PG13 for violence and sexual references. Keep the 10 and under kids home. Opens Jan 14 2011. 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into this movie having read reviews talking about how the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. And they were Absolutely correct but i couldn't care less. The Green Hornet is so horribly acted and over the top that it easily fits into the category of SO BAD ITS GOOD For fans of slapstick classics such as Flash Gordon or anything by Mel Brooks this movie is a MUST SEE. There are at least 3 or 4 scenes sprinkled throughout the movie that are meant to be completely sincere and serious. They utterly and gloriously fail. Seth Rogan couldn't decide if he wanted to do Iron Man or Pineapple Express so he just said To hell with it and did both. As i said before he totally failed to produce any kind of real connection with the characters or make any sense with the story misfit characters are sporadically flung into the mixture and cheesy unoriginal dialogue runs rampit through the film but this movie is not what it seems to be. It succeeds because of how HORRIBLY it fails. Toss in easily the funniest fight scene ever captured on film and best usage of Coolio's Gangsters Paradise in cinema and you've got comedic GOLD. Please go into this movie with absolutely NO expectations and i promise that you will leave satisfied.".

	schema:headline " Not groundbreaking but an entertaining superhero movie nonetheless";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite some impeding flaws The Green Hornet not only delivers as an action film but goes one better by providing comedy and is an enjoyable movie overall. Comparing it to other superhero movies is an invalid way to assess the quality of the film it's a more lighthearted take on the genre without becoming a fully fledged comedy allowing it to fall into a class of its own.Superhero movies usually consist of the main characters either having superhuman powers or just money and initiative. This film falls into the latter category and is unique in the sense that they're heroes who pose as villains in order to fight real villains but the concept doesn't advance any further than that. The idea isn't revolutionary but good enough to be entertaining and in a sense unique.The wealthy and immature newspaper publisher Britt Reid teams up with his butler Kato to form a crime fighting duo who begin by cruising the street to find criminals to beat up. Kato is essentially both the brains and the brawn doing most of the fighting creating their equipment and filling their cars with ejector seats explosives and guns. Britt on the other hand is rather incompetent but still arrogantly considers himself to be just as valuable to the duo and provides most of the humour. Both of the main characters are likable and the contrast between their actual superhero ability is often amusing. The plot eventually evolves enough to end in a standoff between the duo and the main villain after some not very surprising plot twists.The action sequences contain fighting with and without guns the majority of it being Kato jumping in slow motion and kicking people in the face. The balance between the two different types of fighting is excellent too many gunfights would ruin the notsoserious nature of the movie. The action scenes aren't repetitive and keep things fresh with varied environments Kato's ability to identify danger weapons glow red while Kato surveys the situation in slow motion martial arts expertise and creative use of their Chrysler turned killing machine.Superhero movie buffs might consider the film to be 'lame' or say that Seth Rogen wasn't fit to play the role of a superhero but it's supposed to be more light hearted than other movies of the genre. Most heroes intend to help society with their superhuman powers or avenge the death of a loved one etc. whereas the Hornet duo fight crime because they're bored. Those expecting a deeper storyline will be disappointed but this film accomplishes what it's supposed to. It doesn't take itself too seriously and despite a few issues it's an entertaining movie overall and definitely something to look into if you're willing to appreciate it.".

The Green Hornet starts off promising in a scene with James Franco and the great Christoph Waltz from Inglorious Basterds 2009 the last film he was in And boy what a bad choice! But The Green Hornet goes downhill real fast after that. Seth Rogan who I like and is a crack up in most movies he is in single handed kills this movie! I like Superheros to be a bit humorous but not incredibly annoying! It seems the director of this turkey had no control over Rogan Playing Britt Reid alias The Green Hornet goes crazy yelling in scene after scene obviously improvising most of his lines. This might have worked for Pineapple Express but totally ruins this movie. I was rooting for Kato to kick the Rogan characters ass at any moment or hoping one of the bad guys would shoot him. I think Seth Rogan would have been a better choice as the villain in this movie and Waltz as The Green Hornet or a George Clooney friggin Brad Pitt or someone like that. The rest of the cast sucks too An aging Cameron Diaz has nothing to do in this flick Edward James Olmos looked like he was about to climb out of the screen and hitch a ride home the Chinese guy who plays Kato mumbles his lines throughout the movie. Shame on these Hollywood bozos! The Writers Director and Seth Rogan for destroying a cool comic book and the original sixties TV series that starred Van Williams and the great Bruce Lee. And if Bruce Lee were alive today I think he would have gave Seth Rogan and his Follywood buddies a good ol' Karate kick to the balls! P.S. the 3D sucked too".

	schema:reviewBody "The people who gave this movie a 1 are morons. The first two reviews here on the IMDb that I read savaging this film said that the movie didn't even have a DC Comics logo at the beginning. Gee Einstein could that be because The Green Hornet is NOT a DC Comics character? It was first devised for a radio show that started before DC Comics even existed. If there was a DC Comics version of The Green Hornet it was clearly licensed from whoever owned rights to the concept. The second review I read said that the only thing good in the movie was Kato played by John Cho. YOU IDIOT! Kato was played by Jay Chou not John Cho! John Cho is Harold in Harold and Kumar Professor Hawking. If you people reading this are undecided about this filmand you choose to align yourself with people who just fling stupidity like that around be my guest. But you'll be on the outs with rightthinking people who were able to accept this film as a fun time.Now I will grant that Seth Rogen can get a little overbearing at times much like Vince Vaughn. But he rolls that tendency nicely into his character since he was one of the screenwriters. You buy him totally as a selfish lovably annoying okay for some people not so lovably cad who needs to grow up.By the end of the film his character has gone through a lot learned a lot and grown up quite a bit. Your main character can't improve if he starts off perfect! You people know nothing about screen writing.The direction by Michel Gondry is impeccable. About the only complaint I might have is the rapidfire action can be confusing and overwhelming at times. But I feel this is a fault of all action movies of current vintage and not to be laid at the feet of Michel Gondry. I don't think anyone can or would find a complaint with the special effects which are amazing. The 3D was well utilized and thrilling and not too obtrusive. It is this type of slick Hollywood action spectacle not an insult in my book...necessarily that Imax 3D does so well.Even my friend a selfavowed Seth Rogen hater said she found this movie to be entertaining thrilling and well worth the admission price. She even thought that Seth Rogen was good in this film both as an actor and a writer.This film certainly did not have the serious tone of Batman Begins nor was it as wacked out as something like Mystery Men. But I thought it did strike a nice balance between nonstop thrills and wellconstructed laughs. Probably the best superhero flick since Iron Man.".

	schema:reviewBody "What or who is the The Green Hornet? A masked vigilante who fights crime at night alongside his trustful sidekick Kato. This superhero comes from a radio show and a comic book series. He is a something of a grandfather to Batman. Sounds like serious movie right? Well it isn't. It's an action comedy starring Seth Rogen. Some may not like this comedian but I have thoroughly enjoyed Pineapple express. I enjoy his style he seems realistic and I love how excited he gets in moviesespecially this onewhen he is about to do something crazy because that's how I would be like. Jay Chou shows that maybe he has some comedic timing that he is very good at martial arts and looks good in slowmotion. He also shows that as an actor he is very wooden. He's got the same expression on his face the whole movie but he isn't that bad actor to downgrade the movie I actually think he was like that on purpose. Christoph Waltz is the best thing in this movie. Every scene with him is hilarious. He plays the main villain a gangster who is being told from various people that he is not scary anymore so he tries to establish himself as a scary mob boss again. Christoph Waltz excellently plays the very goofy villain I think that it's not the lines it's the guy what's funny he makes it funny. If it would be different actor I think the scenes wouldn't be as funny. The always funny and always beautiful Cameron Diaz doesn't really get much screen time here which is a huge pity. She plays Lenore Case Britt Reid's new secretary who is unknowingly the mastermind behind the crime fighting duo. There are great cameos by Edward Furlong and a recent Seth Rogen costar James Franco. Franco's cameo is just brilliant.The action scenes are great fun to watch it's nice how they mixed the comedy into them but they aren't that original but what the hell I will always pay to see cars blowing up and crashing into each other.I have not seen this in 3D and I think it wouldn't bring anything new maybe some action scenes would look cool but that would be it nothing more. Although it would be worth the money seeing Cameron Diaz in 3D.Overall this is very enjoyable fun action movie with some great oneliners from Rogen. Go and watch it the year 2011 couldn't have started any better than with this movie.".

Hell yeah!First The Green Hornet is about this one guy named Britt Reid Rogen who is the son of the boss of a large company that runs newspapers. One day while Britt is still having fun with his girls his dad's name James Reid rolls on TV with the years 1948  2010. He's dead in the age of 62. Britt becomes the leader and meets Kato Chou his father's assistant who's talented in martial arts making coffee but not in swimming. Together they fight crime in several unexpected and silly ways against Chudnofsky aka Bloodnofsky Waltz.The trailer with Jay Chou speaking English cool cars Britt knocking himself out and others is quite interesting. Especially when it's in 3D. The pictures themselves look exciting and with idiotic Britt Reid it seems like it's not a bad movie.The action. Yes you will definitely enjoy this movie. Britt's fighting will give laughs that will make you howl like wolves and Kato's martial arts skills will leave audiences breathless. It's definitely going to make this movie likable and I'm sure you'll love the action scenes with the explosions. Oh yes and blood.The comedy. I know it seldom appears but when it appears it's going to make you laugh your head off. Such as Chudnofsky being said not scary and later scaring whoever said it. Or because Britt knocked himself out with his Gas Gun.The 3D. This was weak. There were no eyepopping effects just depths because as I sometimes take off my glasses to compare the movie in 2D and 3D. 3D works perfectly fine without the glasses not blurry at all very inconspicuous. So I recommend 2D better.Overall The Green Hornet is not a bad movie. It's not a waste of time and it's possibly a good way to start out the 2011 movie season.Thank you for reading and hope this review is useful.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is important to recall history when you look at this movie and understand why the script is designed the way it is. The basis of this is actually the old time radio series not a comic book like other movie series in this genre. Because of this the script is trying to update the 1940's to 2011. In some ways it does so successfully. My take on the lead characters development The Green Hornet  Seth Rogan the writers here decide to make him into Seth Rogan. That way the script can exploit his comedy and sprinkle his usual comedy into the script. So the Hornet is an airhead trying to do comedy. Is this successful  pretty much. He is no where near the radio hero.Kato  Bruce Lee created an interesting image in their 2 year ABC series. Most of that is scrapped here. What we get instead is a more traditional Kato. While he is still a major martial arts fighter he is more of a techno geek and without him the Hornet is a dreeb. This works too and allows the technological leap from the radio dramas to 2011.The brains there is Cameron Diaz as Seth's secretary. Her character makes perfect sense in this context. Kato is too busy to be the brains. The Hornet is too stupid to be the brains. Diaz makes the script work  I readily accept a 39 year old Diaz playing a 36 year old. She pulls off this support role perfectly.The film is kind of like the radio series on steroids action wise. The first half is dominated by Rogan's comedy and even Kato sneaks in some punchlines. The films two villains the nasty drug lord and the corrupt politician are pretty much traditional types of crooks the Hornet deals with. The film even manages to pull off the fact that these guys aren't considered good guys.It is strange but about 23rds of the way through the movie Rogan actually has a flashback episode that clears up the plot line malaise that the viewer feels in about 5 minutes. Once you see this revealing sequence you get along with the movie a little better. This sequence is like a flashback on steroids to explain the Hornets father's death.This is a pleasant mixture of comedy and action which should please Rogan fans and it is pretty successful at bringing fresh life into some characters which date back many years as the last time it was done was in the 1960's and it was not real successful then as only Bruce Lee is remembered from the TV series.".

The same gloomy colors the same snow everywhere the same slow motion of people dozing in winter like bears. The same sad realism in all the scenes including the car chases the same end. And also  and this is the most amazing of it all in my opinion  the same feeling of light you experience at the end despite the end which can hardly be called happy.This film also has a winning mixture of criminal plot and love triangle. Remember Heat?. A young girl is waiting for her lover in the snowy Yalta and he comes one night too late because of the storm  and in this one night she meets a young musician who offers her to spend the night in his apartment. Mind you this is a Soviet film  there are no sex scenes at all in the movie but the simplest gestures become erotic as they are real as we all have been in those situations of late teens who just discover each other. Her lover is an underworld tycoon who manages to plan some more of his dark affairs to mislead the KGB trail and to entertain the girl  he saw for everything but the musician. Clever rich attractive charming when needed although extremely cruel when needed as well brilliantly educated erudite  he can do nothing against a young boy who has nothing but a pure heart and a love this heart can generate. And as usual in the love triangles it does not end well for the involved sides  for some lethally for some with awful soul scars...The movie is slow and viscous  but this is its charm. The music of Grebenschikov and the XVIIcentury piece of Gorod Zolotoi of course became a real Russian classic the historical jumps to the times of Paul I look like an original move of Sergei Solovyov and not like a ridiculous trial to look educated. The guest appearance of Victor Tsoi seems welltimed as well. And finally Sergei Bugayev the musician has a winning role in itself a martyr against his will  but to play the parts of Alika and Krymov it took all the talent of Tatyana Drubich and Stanislav Govorukhin and they deliver the performances which will never be forgotten.A good test of movies' quality is watching it again 1012 years after its release. I watched it recently and it became worse  the colors of the Soviet film faded and the voices became muter. Technicalities. But as for the movie itself I dreamt of it at night. This was an epochal movie for the 80ies but one that remains as a monument even in the XXI century.".

It's really simple but yet it doesn't truly explain why people like this film. Overall I think it became popular because it came at the right time rather than anything else.

However there is a stunning piece of live concert footage playing in the background during the end credits.The film IS quite decent although the plot is rather confusing. Personally however I spent the entire movie waiting for Tsoy to appear as he was credited as if he was in the main cast. In fact his first appearance is AFTER the dramatic finale... And has little if anything to do with the plot. This may have something to do with the fact that besides his brilliant music career he got an actor of the year award for the film 'Igla' The Needle.Basically his casting is a scam  to get a star into the cast to draw young audiences.

Pistone is trying to infiltrate his way into a mob family in order to gather evidence against them. He assumes the identity of Donnie Brasco and slowly but surely earns the love and trust of an oldpro hitman named Lefty Ruggiero Pacino. As the months go by Pistone's marriage begins to fall apart as he is away from his wife Heche pretty much all the time. The line between his real life and his undercover life blurs together and he finds himself dangerously close to being seduced by the violent Mob lifestyle.Donnie Brasco is an extraordinary film in many ways. As already mentioned the performances are noteperfect. But there's so much more to it than that. The late 70s period details are impeccably captured the dialogue is extraordinarily raw and realistic the moral dilemma facing Depp is achingly agonisingly conveyed. It's such a powerful picture completely involving that by the end you find yourself wrapped up in Pistone's predicament asking yourself what decisions you would make in the same circumstances. Very few movies genuinely inspire you to debate the whats whys and wherefores of the main character and his actions... but with Donnie Brasco that's just what you'll find yourself doing.".

Whether it is a biopic about Ed Wood a dark fairy tale about a man with scissors instead of hands a movie about the greatest lover the world has ever known or a adventurous story about pirates Depp's performance alone makes it worth seeing. Here he plays FBIagent Joe Pistone who goes undercover using the name Donnie Brasco. He becomes a wiseguy with the help of Lefty Al Pacino who is sort of a loser wiseguy who desperately needs to be a mentor because most of his mafia family members look down on him. Donnie comes as a gift from heaven and it does not take long before Lefty trusts Donnie completely. The problem for FBIagent Donnie is that he's starting to like Lefty as well.The movie is a gangster movie but has its focus on the relationship between Lefty and Donnie and sometimes on other relationships. Donnie or Joe is married to Maggie Anne Heche who he hardly sees. He can not exactly tell her what he is doing and sometimes stays away for a couple of weeks. She pretends she is a widow to deal with it. We also learn about the relationships in the mafia family including new boss Sonny Michael Madsen.The fact that this movie is more about the people and their relationships than about the events is a good thing. Sure movies like 'Goodfellas' are terrific but to see something a little different from time to time is nice as well. If you make a movie about people and their emotions you need to have some good performers to make the scenes believable. I already mentioned Depp but of course we have Pacino here as well. His Lefty is a memorable character and it is Pacino who makes sure that happens but the fact that Depp is as good and especially believable as heavyweight Pacino says something. Of course we have Madsen who was probably the only right actor for the macho mobster Sonny.Director Mike Newell seems to be a strange choice for this sometimes very violent and bloody story since he directed the terrific but sweet 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. Fortunately it turns out he is the right man for this material probably because its real subject is not gangsters but like I said before the relationships between the characters. 'Donnie Brasco' has enough to offer for people who like the gangstergenre but even if you are normally not a big fan there is still a chance you might like it.".

As time passes Donnie gets tighter and tighter into the mob rising up when boss Sonny Black gets bumped up.  While Donnie puts his life at risk his real life crumbles as he never sees his wife or children.  As he moves upwards his friend Lefty is bypassed time and time again.  As Donnie gets deeper the FBI start to worry and want to extract him  something that cannot be done without exposing himself and condemning Lefty to death.Now that Pirates of the Caribean has made him a bankable star as well as a good actor I decided to dig out some of my old Depp videos and watch them. I have been a Depp fan since the mid90's when I saw Arizona Dream Ed Wood and Don Juan all in a period of 6 months I realised then that this was not only a very talented guy but also one who seemed happy to do whatever interested him rather than whatever was going to make money.  This film is in a well known and fairly reliable genre  the Italian American gangster movie but has the strength that it is an engaging true story.  The plot follows Joe as he gets in deeper is suspected gets involved in battles between bosses and eventually starts to lose himself and forget what side he is actually on.  Even though this is a true story it still basically goes where we expect mob films to go but it manages to rise above the clichs by having some very good characters and emotional themes.The whole gangster thing works and is gripping but it is the relationship dynamics between Joe and Lefty that made it more interesting.  The element of going native' when undercover has been done plenty of times but it is the combination of this being fact and Depp's great performance that makes it work well here we feel for Joe a great deal.  On the flipside the film also allows us to feel for the mob or at least one of them.  The majority of the mobsters are the usual stereotypes but Lefty is written with a great deal of sympathy  he is a middleman taking the risks doing the dirt but always passed over and having to beg money to keep his bosses happy. These are tragic characters and the film is not the slightly glamorous gangster lifestyle that Pacino has experienced in his Godfather roles.  These two characters are well written and it is their subplots that makes the film better than the central plot which itself is also very good.Depp is good and his performance is solid even if it doesn't really rank up their with his best  he lacks his usual flair but he gives the material it's dues.  Pacino is of course wonderful.  His character is a far cry from his Godfather work and he manages to bring such pathos to Lefty that it is impossible not to feel for him.  The support cast may not have as much in the way of character but they all do well in their roles.  Madsen Kirby Ivanek Heche Miano and others all give good support but it is Pacino and Depp's film  which is a good thing.Overall the fact that this is a true story makes it more interesting but while I was watching it I wasn't really thinking about it and was just enjoying the gangster film itself.  The basic story is a well worn one but is still delivery well by Newell who was a very unusual choice for director but it is the emotion threads involving Joe and Lefty that make the film much more than just another gangster film.".

	schema:headline " Al Pacino's Best Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Yes I am going to make the bold claim that this is his best work. Are you talking about the same Al Pacino that did Scarface Heat AND the Godfather movies you ask. Yes yes and let me explain myself. First of all I want to add that I LOVE Pacino's work. He has such a commanding presence on screen and nobody in cinematic history can scream as well as him though Gene Hackman is damn good. He can scare the hell out of you with just one crazed look in his eye and he never gives a flat performance well except in Revolution.Having said that I think Pacino is incredible in this flick because his character is so understated. While his work often consists of playing flamboyant overthetop and almost cartoonish figuresespecially in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate this film is a change of pace for him. Sure he's still playing a mobster but he's not as psychotic as usual and for once you get to see the inner struggles of a crook who deep down has a heart of gold despite all of the murders. Pacino is perfect as Lefty an aging crimical who wants out of the mob lifestyle but doesn't know how to do it. Though you see the fast and fun world of mobsters in flicks like Goodfellas this film gives you a sense that the mob life isn't that glamorous. Along with Pacino's acting Johnny Depp is delectable as Joe Pistone Donnie Brasco because you can see his inner torment as well. He knows that he's been assigned to infiltrate the New York mob scene but he develops such a close bond with Lefty that it's almost hard to bring him down. A very real human relationship permeates between the two that is very moving. I like how the characters are always joking about being a wise guy as it provides some light chuckles and it also shows that in order to live this lifestyle you've gotta talk tough and act tough as if I would know what that's like.The supporting cast is particularly noteworthy. Bruno Kirby plays a great weasel Anne Heche is wonderful as Pistone's neurotic wife you can understand her suffering what with being married to an FBI special agent and Michael Madsen is reliable once again as a mobster honestly does this guy do anything besides gangster or scifi flicks?. Every time I watch this movie I am breathless afterwards. The acting is wonderful the music is superb and frankly I can't believe this stuff actually happened. Then again I haven't read the book so I don't know how much of it is true.Overall this movie gets 10 out of 10. I'm shocked it doesn't get more recognition especially with such prolific actors as Pacino and Depp leading the way. This is a different kind of mob movie as it shows a more somber side to this way of life and I recommend it unequivocally.".

It turns out Donnie is the undercover name for Joe Pistone Depp a FBI agent investigating the Mafia. He makes a connection with Lefty Pacino which while his initial integration into the group seems to lack conviction soon builds up a watchable fatherson relationship. Criticisms of the film  such as the forced nature of Pistone's behaviour becoming absorbed into the Mafia mindset  are largely irrelevant as this is a based on a true story outing.Engrossing and eminently watchable with firstrate lead performances and able backup from Michael Madsen this is an overlooked and extremely worthwhile film. The only complaint? Depp's first scenes wearing the most fakelooking moustache in the history of the movies. But it detracts little from what is a highly skilled picture. So Fergeddaboudid!".

It isn't really a well known film and I didn't remember it coming out in the cinema. So there I saw it in my local video rental store near the bottom shelf and just one copy. I rented it and I watched it. And I have to say it is one of the finest movies I had ever seen. It has drama comedy sadness and violence and continues to entertain the viewer until the opening of the end credits.The beauty of the film is that although Pacino plays a member of the mob you end up with sympathy with him due to his loyalty to Donnie Depp. Pacino plays Lefty well. The movie is very funny in parts and sad in others. Lefty is a very funny character and is hard not to like. Michael Madsen is my favourite actor and although you don't see enough of Sonny Black in contrast to his importance in the book what you do see of him is enjoyable. Although the film ends differently to that in the book it shows the workings of the mafia well. A splendid overlooked movie with a great cast and an atmosphere that drags you in. Yet you have to read the brilliant book to get the full story.".

It tells the story of FBI agent Joe Pistone Johnny Depp who in the late 1970s was hired to infiltrate the mafia. So he got acquainted with hitman Benjamin Lefty Ruggiero Al Pacino. But lo and behold Joe got too much into the mafia lifestyle to the point where it dominated his life and kept him from his family. And no one ended up with a very good reward at the end.Both Depp and Pacino are about as intense as we expect them to be with good support from Michael Madsen Bruno Kirby James Russo Anne Heche and Zeljko Ivanek. With his hair all greased back Depp looks like the ultimate mafioso. I should identify that there are two scenes that will probably make your skin crawl the leg scene and what they do to the Japanese waiter.But don't get me wrong. This is a really good movie. It's certainly a less glamorized view of mafia life than most of Al Pacino's movies and Johnny Depp was certainly showing the same flair for acting that he has brought to the screen for the past 16 years. Very well done.".

During the five years undercover Pistone who used the alias of Donnie Brasco was responsible for about 200 federal indictments because of the work he did. It took a terrible strain on him and his family as the film so aptly demonstrates.It must have been like old home week for Johnny Depp who made his acting bones playing a youthful undercover cop in the television series 21 Jump Street. But the difference between Officer Tom Hanson going undercover for a couple of weeks at some high school and agent Pistone living and working with the wise guys for five years afraid of being found out is the difference between Donald Duck and Donald Trump.Depp's performance as PistoneBrasco is conveyed as much by body language and closeups as with dialog. He'd like very much to return to his wife and three daughters and live a normal life but the demands of the job make it impossible. According to Wikipedia's article on Pistone he was uniquely qualified for his undercover assignment having lived and grown up among wise guys in New Jersey. He was familiar with all the Mafia culture and could blend in easily. The strain shows on him in his scenes with wife Anne Heche only someone with a real gift for acting could make those scenes so real.Depp is matched by Al Pacino as the luckless Lefty Ruggiero.

Yet he's also a family man with a lot of problems as is Depp. Even though the man is in fact evil Pacino does make him a likable sort. It's why Depp is dreading the day he's out from undercover because it means certain death for a man who's grown to be his friend. Except when the crew that Depp and Pacino are part of do ambush a rival group before in fact they do it to them Donnie Brasco is a fairly non violent film for a gangster story. Donnie Brasco emphasizes character development and a good script as opposed to bloody mayhem.I think you'll like the story about a man who turned a friend into the biggest mutt in the history of the Mafia.".

	schema:reviewBody "First rate mafia drama connects on a deeper level than most. Its cinematography may not have the moody noirish atmosphere that makes The Godfather so appealing but despite its slick Hollywood look it seems to attain such penetrating truth this perhaps has a little to do with its being based on a book by the real life main character. The central situation of the aging mafia man taking under his confidence and vouching for an undercover FBI agent and that a bond forms between the two men is a great one. The performances are absolutely superb. Particularly the two men who the story centres on Joe Pistone a.k.a Donnie Brasco Johnny Depp going for realism in this role is incredible. It begins and ends with a closeup of his eyes  this movie would be nothing without him and mafia man Lefty Pacino who gives us one of his finest characterisations  best bit his closeup after Donnie is asked to shake hands by a certain character on a certain boat. The vividness of the characters in this movie seems to owe a great deal to the superb screenplay again credit to the reallife source material. Recurring catchphrases make it easy for us to get to know characters and wonderful little touches give the story such a resonance and make it ring true like Lefty's smoking inside the car when driving with Brasco and accusing Brasco of trying to kill him with the draft when he opens a window to let some smoke out and the portrait of Lefty the opposite of how we imagine a mafia veteran as a vulnerable often emotional man.Deserves at least four stars. Recommended to anyone except obviously kids for a few scenes unsuitable to them.".

It is a sad movie however.  No matter how you look at it these things actually happened. Those men really did die.  The true story that Donnie Brasco is based on makes the movie have more depth and obviously more reality.  This movie also does a very good job of portraying the 70's the time period in which the actual events took place.  It is an exciting dangerous and wild movie but very downbeat.  Once you're in the mob it's very hard to get out.".

He has the skin of a modelnot a single facial flaw?! He doesn't even have crow's feet or visible pores! Devoid of the leathery skin so characteristic of the true gangsters whose excessive use of alcohol no doubt contributes to the premature dehydration of their skin and whose deeds weigh heavily enough on their conscience to cause deeply furrowed brows Depp looks as though he has spent his life at a health spa drinking mineral water! Really too much! When I watched the documentary included on the DVD I found that sure enough the true Joe Pistone actually looks as though he could possibly be a gangster. That was how he succeeded in feigning fraternity with Lefty for six years. Johnnie Depp? Don't think so. Totally implausible. Invraisemblable. A major casting flaw in an otherwise excellent film.The story is a genuine tragedy no doubt. And Al Pacino did a wonderful job as alwaysthough I did note that in a couple of scenes he was empirically distinguishable from Rickie Roma in GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS. I guess that's okay though since Roma was corrupt in his own sort of way. In other scenes I saw the protag from SCENT OF A WOMAN. I guess that makes sense too however since Lefty was aging and full of regrets as well.Definitely worth seeing and very thoughtprovoking but it takes a real effort to suspend disbelief when it comes to Depp's role. Again not a criticism of his acting but of the casting andor makeup crew. I am confident that his image could have been roughed up but for some inscrutable reason this was not done.".

After you see it once you definitely notice the annoying dialogue to make you think it could happen at any second when nothing was further from the truth.The treatment of Donnie by Lefty seemed insincere when he was clearly aware of the great potential of his newest ward. I thought there would have been more teasing and chiding than outright insulting insipid remarks. This detracted from the reality of how many people back east act towards each other.The transformation of Agent Pistone to Donnie Brasco was very well done.

But there's a couple problems with this type of tale .1  You find yourself comparing it with other true life mob tales like GOODFELLAS 2  Almost all of the audience tension should revolve around the cop coming close to getting his cover blown It's interesting to note that the production of this film was held back due to the success of GOODFELLAS . Good idea because despite its own merits DONNIE BRASCO would have been viewed as a poor relation to the classic Scorsese mob flick . But even so you do find yourself comparing the two movies of which this one is the lesser . It's mainly due to the fact that GOODFELLAS opens with a sickening execution and never lets up on the shocks while DONNIE BRASCO pulls its feet very slowly . There's a lot of bad language but that's mainly due to their being a large number of talkative scenes with very little action until the second half of the movie with many of the talky scenes revolving around Donnie's home lifeAs for  the undercover cop is going to get his cover blown  subplot I was reminded of other movies like the classic WHITE HEAT and the little known Brit thriller ID and again this movie pales slightly in comparison with Donnie having to come up with a smart move to keep his identity secret only one time . Of course being a true story I shouldn't criticise too much since the producers were probably aware of this and didn't want to embellish the integrity of the facts I did give this seven out of ten which means the positives outweigh the negatives. This is the type of movie that is almost entirely carried by the cast . Pacino once again plays a gangster but he's not some psychotic mafia don here he's more of a middle ranking gangster who loses his status to a young turk and plays his character in a far more subtle manner than what we're used to . Johnny Depp is convincing enough  He should since the movie revolves around Donnie  and Michael Madsen is very good  again his playing is far more subtle than what might be expected . The violent scenes despite taking a long time to come are as brutal and as memorable as anything you'd see in a Scorsese movie All in all DONNIE BRASCO is worthy of your time but if it'd been about twenty minutes shorter with most of the edited out scenes having involved Donnie's domestic friction this might have actually have been a classic true life gangster film".

Al Pacino gives a far more credible performance as one of the tough guys. Indeed he should have played Brasco. In Stalag 17 the informant was the soldier who everyone trusted. Why?

An FBI undercover agent named Pistone infiltrates the mob and finds himself identifying more with the mafia life to the expense of his regular one . Using the name Donnie Brasco Johnny Depp  he befriends a 'made' mafioso Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero it is an amalgam of the real Lefty played by Al Pacino and the real Sonny Black Napolitano performed by Michael Madsen . Brasco becomes tight as the group goes about collecting cash for 'the bosses' . A deep dilemma is afforded to Donnie who knows if he walks away from the mobster family  Lefty will be the one killed . Brasco is married and has three children but he is away for months at a time eventually leading to his wife Anna Heche asking for a divorce . The mission forces him to virtually leave his family  living among the wise guys  as he turns more and more part of the Mob group. Excellent and topoftherange mobster movie contains topnotch performances  pretentious familiar drama  thrills  fastpaced  action  being richly narrated and including an emotive final . Although also packs strong scenes  violence and profanities  as the word 'fuck' is used 185 times . Fresh and intelligent screenplay by Paul Attanasio based on real N.Y.C's Italian Mafia families  including interesting characterizations taken from Joseph Pistone's memoir . Johnny Depp's sensational performance  he met with the actual Joseph D. Pistone a number of times to gain knowledge and expertise for the role  he also took gun firing lessons from the FBI . Topdrawer acting by Al Pacino as a lowlevel hoodlum who becomes Depp his protg . Secondary cast is frankly excellent as Michael Madsen  Zeljko Ivanek  Robert Miano  James Russo  Zack Grenier  and brief interventions by then unknown Paul Giamatti  Tim Blake Nelson and almost extra Gretchen Moll . Special mention to Bruno Kirby as Nicky  when the project was in its first stages Joe Pesci was the first and main choice for Nicky  but after the release of Goodfellas the idea gradually faded .

	schema:headline " Very Intense  Brutal Crime Story With Pacino The Main Attraction";
	schema:reviewBody "Al Pacino is riveting as usual in the colead role of Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggerio. To me he was the highlight of this gangster movie. He played a bad guy but one the viewer could sympathize with and sad to say  that's just plain wrong. Lefty murdered something like 26 people and brags about it several times in the film......and we're supposed to feel sorry for him? WellPacino is so good actor he pulls it off Johnny Depp meanwhile was okay but I just never felt he was right for this part. He's a great actor and maybe I'm just used to him playing strange roles instead of an undercover cop. In other words his character wasn't convincing to me. Having said that. however I thought he and Pacino's characters played off each other very well. The relationship between the two was outstanding to watch develop. It also contributed largely to the depressing ending as Lefty finds out Donnie's true identity.This is frightening film for several reasons mainly the tension of seeing if undercover agent Donnie BrascoJoe Pistone will succeed or be brutally exposed and killed by a ruthless band of gangsters led by the ultraviolent Johnny Black. Michael Madsen plays the latter. Is there an actor who plays so many brutal characters effectively as Madsen? The story is shocking in parts for its violence i.e. the Asian restaurant scene and is extremely profane throughout so be warned if that is an issue with you.This is not a film that will leave a good taste with you especially with the downer of an ending.....but hey that's life. It's also about 15 minutes too long. We had the stereotypical copmarriage woes soap opera parts too which could have been eliminated. Also the character of the head FBI guy Mr. Pistone dealt with was ludicrous. Leave it to Hollywood to make someone of governmentalpolice authority one of the most unlikable guys in the film.Still if you like Pacino Depp and the like you should be entertained my this basedonatrue story film.".

The film's matteroffact approach to life in the mob keeps emotions in tow with little stretching required of the players and provides a sort of business as usual backdrop for the real crux of the story the waxing relationship between Depp and Pacino and the waning relationship between Depp and Heche. The result is moderately captivating 2 hour film with respectable marks from critics and public which should make a worthwhile small screen diversion for crime buffs. B".

Johnny Depp as the undercover FBI agent Donnie BrascoJoe Pistone and Michael Madsen Sonny Black also turned in fine performances as well. And while Anne Heche Maggie Pistone was definitely cute I thought the movie could have used a bit more finetuning in the relationship between her and Johnny Depp. Perhaps if they had shown some happier moments between the two prior to him taking the undercover assignment it would have added some depth to her character. As it was all we get to see is a strained relationship from the very start. Likewise it seems the film ends a little too soon and it could have been drawn out a bit more. All things considered this was a passable movie and fans of Al Pacino or Johnny Depp probably won't be too disappointed.".

But what it doesn't have is the passion that Scorcese put into that masterpiece and the biggest problem with the film is Pacino.He isn't terrible it's just that he appears to be doing nothing more than parody and if he says 'forget about it' once he must say it literally 7080 times. And that's just him.There is one scene where Depp is discussing with of all people Paul Giamatti and Tim BlakeNelson the different ways of saying 'forget about it' and what it connotes to and it's a wonder that they keep straight faces throughout.Thank goodness for Madsen who is clearly the best thing in the film and again this is lazy casting. But thank heavens this was the time in his career when he actually put in a good performance and whenever he's on screen the film comes alive.Pistone is portrayed as a selfish individual yes he gets in too deep but there's no reason to act like a child every time you interact with the real world.So all in all it's not terrible it's just nowhere near as good as it thinks it is hence why you never really see it quoted like the film it's trying to be.It's been forgot about.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Closely Watched Trains are those that are carrying supplies to the German army in and through occupied Czechoslovakia during World War II. That is why they are closely watchedso that they run on time. But they are also closely watched by the people of Czechoslovakia especially dispatcher Hubicka Josef Somr and his trainee Milos Hrma Vaclav Neckar for another reason which will become apparent as the movie ends.Not that Milos and Hubicka are especially diligent workers. On the contrary. What Hubicka is especially adept at is seduction of females while Milos is distracted by his worries about becoming a man. He has what must be seen as a problem demanding comic relief if you will. He has trouble pleasing his girl friend because of premature ejaculation. He is so consumed by this embarrassing failure that he seeks quietus in the warm bath of a bordello. Meanwhile Hubicka is able to please the pretty young telegraphist Virginia Svata Jitka Zelenohorska by playing a kind of strip poker with her and rubber stamping her pretty legs and butt much to her delight and to the consternation of her mother when she finds out. The German Councilor Zednicek Vlastimil Brodsky who tolerates no hankypanky when it comes to keeping the trains moving conducts an investigation and comes to the conclusion that Hubicka is guilty of misuse and abuse of the great German language because he stamped German words onto Virginia's body! This is the tone of the film wryly ironic irreverent and mildly comedic employing in a sense a kind of offcenter theater of the absurd treatment. Director Jiri Menzel who appears briefly in the film as Dr. Brabec who diagnoses Milos's affliction spun this off from a novel by Bohumil Hrabal but it could easily have come from a novel by Jaroslav Hasek who wrote the celebrated Czech classic The Good Soldier Svejk so alike in treatment and tone are they and so very characteristic of the Czech national mindset visavis all the horrors of the European wars. Menzel concentrates on the petty affairs of daytoday peasant life sex the raising of pigeons and geese the boredom of bureaucratic jobs as he works toward the culminating scene in which the heroics seem almost lighthearted and to come about more from happenstance than from careful planning.Some of the scenes in the movie are absolutely unique in the world of cinema and suggest a kind of cinematic genius. The creepy goosestuffing for foie gras pate scene in which Milos seeks help with his problem from an older woman is riotousor would be riotous if we were not so amazed as what she is doing while talking to him and what it LOOKS like she might be doing! The scene in which Stationmaster Lanska is torn between the prospect of seducing a voluptuous woman and the chance that he might miss supper reminded me of a little boy at play with his mother calling him home for dinner. The final scene in which it looks like Menzel may have employed a wind machine is just so perfectly presented combining as it does the stark realism of the war and a delicious but soon to be mixed personal triumph of the resistance.This is one of the classic films of all time. But prepare to put aside ordinary viewing habits and to concentrate with an alert mind. The subtleties of Menzel's little masterpiece will be obscured by inattention preconceptions and faulty expectations. Or at least that is what they'll tell you at film school. See this Oscar winner Best Foreign Film 1967 for Jiri Menzel who survived oppression and censorship by the Soviets and is still making movies.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	schema:reviewBody "This film adds a quirky resonance to the history of NeoFreudian interpretation of human sexual psychology in film that rivals Bertolucci's The Conformist. Gorgeously filmed in black and white each frame by frame echoes of a past when life was still mired in concealment and innocence. The story centers around a train station in a Czech German occupied small town and an apprentice train watcher Milos Hrma who is confused about his place in the world. He is a young man and is approaching an instance in his life when sexuality is flourishing all around him and yet he can not comprehend it. Scattered throughout the film are leitmotifs that represent sex the train blowing steam a horse with a woman riding it a skinless rabbit being fondled by a woman cook etc. He is under the tutelage of a train dispatcher who seems a zealot when it comes to seducing women. Although he notices that the train dispatcher is a sex fiend he does little to elicit help from him. The general thought of the males is that a young man should be bestowed with the foreknowledge and insight at birth. Thus his inability to perform when his girlfriend Masa is in bed during a bombing causes him great existential crisis and leads to his attempted suicide. In fact the war was subliminally to blame for his impotence. This isn't a political film but uses subtle innuendos to trace the history of a young man into adulthood. Scattered throughout the film are affable characters such as a pigeon loving crap covered Train master a noble aristocratic woman a benign slightly insane photographer uncle of Masa and a Nazi ideologue who refuses to believe that the Reich is in ruins. The sexual metaphors are spread in gusty humorous episodes such as when the train dispatcher 'stamps' a girl's buttocks in a moment of ecstasy. In the finale the boy is finally cured of his 'impotence' by a big bang I won't give it away you'll have to see this delightful film.".

It makes Hitchcock's train going into the tunnel shot from 'North By Northwest' look like the work of a rank amateur.Ostensibly 'Closely Watched Trains' is the story of Trainee Milos Hrma Vclav Neckr starting his job at the local train station during the Nazi occupation of what was then Czechoslovakia only I guess it wasn't because it was officially absorbed by the Reich. Throughout most of the film the war complete with what the local Nazi functionary describes as beautiful tactical withdrawals is a long way off and Milos has more important matters to attend to. Specifically he's trying to lose his virginity and deal with another problem common to young men everywhere one which the local doctor advises him to solve by thinking about football during critical moments.Made in 1966 when some Czechs were clearly already looking ahead to 1968's Prague Spring the film slyly uses the Nazis as a standin for the Soviets. As proof of this and the Hollywood establishment's antiCommunist bent in the late 60s 'Closely Watched Trains' won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 1968. It is however imminently deserving of the win on its own merits.History lessons aside 'Closely Watched Trains' is beautifully shot well acted and absurdly hilarious while still tasting of tragedy.

Milos the main character here is not unlike the pigeons kept by the stationmaster and his wife he is caged repressed and manages with not some degree of awkwardness to finally break free of his fetters... just in time for World War Two to literally come thundering down the tracks at him. Everything flies that has wings the seduced girl says at one point. In the end Milos finds his manhood in the ultimate release.";

It established the reputation of film director Jiri Menzel and is considered to be one of the very best Czech films ever made. However embracing the possibility that this may ruin my status as a reviewer for ever I believe its undeserved reputation significantly underestimates Czech cinema.The film has a dreamlike quality which emphasises the bumbling sexual innocence of the main character the Railway Despatcher's ApprenticeMilo and which gives the unexpected dramatic ending real force.However it is only then that the grim reality of the Nazi dominated world in which the film is set is really acknowledged. Milo is also an apprentice in the important matter of life and on one level this is a coming of age film. However the visual sexual innuendo now seems very obvious and clichd. None of its cardboard characters are really developed and Closely Observed Trains seems very much like a slow paced version of a British Carry On film. Like them it feels very dated. My partner was so bored she walked out half way through it. If you want to see a really good Czech film check out the short but superbMost".

It's the simple story of a young worker at a train station during World War II when the Nazis are spreading like disease throughout Europe. Trains carrying Nazi officials and soldiers pass by the train station on a regular basis. While this is bad it isn't the biggest problem. The kid's budding sexuality has begun to boil over and he desperately searches for answers as to why he is turned on by seemingly mundane nonsexual things a goose being stuffed for dinner a train whistle blowing etc.. He plays sidekick to an older station worker who has no problem with the ladies at all. The famous scene in which he stamps a young female coworker's bare buns is both funny and hypnotically erotic. I won't give away the ending but while it certainly is something of a downer there's an uplifting element to it as well as our hero finally gets his priorities straight and truly becomes a man.

The scene is utterly strange but entirely sensual it's also completely at odds with what the general population finds sexy. And yet it's among the sexiest things I've ever encounteredright up there with Barbara Stanwyck fondling Henry Fonda's head in The Lady Eve.I also remember that this isn't just about sexual awakening. The subtext of political subversion clearly transforms the film from a European version of Porky's or American Pie. Could it all be an allegory? Could the boy be the new Czechoslovakia? Could he as an individual who once he achieves his goal dies from his newfound maturity represent this Eastern Bloc nation? Could the older workers at the station reflect the country's history? Probably but I wouldn't count on it. And frankly it doesn't matter if they do. The film works well enough without allegory and the subplot of political subversion lends an element of seriousness to an otherwise humorous movie. In other words it's not all comedy and that's as it should be. Closely Watched Trains is a great movie and one you should seek out. It's the type of foreign film that connoisseurs and laypeople alike will enjoy. It's like My Life as a Dog or All About My Mothera crowd pleaser without being facile.".

	schema:reviewBody "Note to American viewers Closely Watched Trains 1966 is one of them fereign films. It has subtitles and is in black and white actually a strength as it is superb film stock. The setting is Germanoccupied Czechoslovakia during WWII. The setting and the use of the Czech resistance movement to the German occupation as a plot element may confuse Americans many of who believe that Czechoslovakia was an Axis country or have never given the subject any thought. But just prior to the start of the war Britain and France sold out Czechoslovakia. They backed out of their treaties and allowed Hitler to break up the country establishing the German Protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia and annexing the Sudentenland which had a significant German population. Also useful in understanding the film was a revisionist trend by European countries in the 1960's to rehabilitate their images suppressing any record of cooperationassistance to Germany while proclaiming their resistance to the Nazi agenda. The film is a product of this trend which is why the resistance elements seem rather tenuously inserted into the story.The film revolves around young Milos Hrma Vaclav Neckar who follows his father's example and goes to work for the railroad becoming an apprentice dispatcher at a rural station. The impressionable Milos becomes fascinated with Hubicka a veteran train dispatcher who devotes most of his energy to various onthejob seductions. The second act involves Hubicka's ongoing conflict with their superior the pigeonraising and feather covered stationmaster. But Watched Trains is really Milos' coming of age story complete with the requisite line is the first time you have been with a woman? Milos' first time proves a disaster and leads to an unsuccessful suicide attempt. Meanwhile it turns out that Hubicka has more on his mind than girls. He is a member of the Czech resistance and is planning to destroy a German munitions train when it passes near the station. Unfortunately for Milos Hubicka's recreational activities are reported to the authorities and he must attend an investigatory hearing inside the station scheduled for the same time that the ammunition train is expected. For Milos who has finally demonstrated his manhood in bed the question is whether he can now demonstrate it my climbing the signal tower and dropping an explosive device onto the train as it passes beneath. The film goes out with a bang and one is left to decide on the relative merits of the two methods young men have of proving their manhood. I forgot to mention that the film is actually a comedy. And for that matter the resistance movement stuff is pretty much an irrelevant side story to the coming of age theme. And the female characters are all a little too good.As tends to happen with good little movies the plot has very little to do with what the movie is about and nothing to do with the effect it had on me. And as tends to happen with them fereign films there are allegorical elements. The characters are seen from Milos' innocent point of view a nontraditional hero who is neither heroic nor particularly intelligent. But he does fall in love and that reshapes his destiny.All in all a very entertaining production. Especially good is Jitka Zelenohorsk as a female telegraph operator who becomes the object of Hubicka's playful attentions.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Every shot is beautifully framed even that not usually considered so take as an example the attempted suicide of our main character filmed expertly enough to draw comparison to a credit sequence shot of a pigeon captured in mid flight. The acting too is flawless a fantastic performance from leading man Vaclav Neckar is backed up with a solid supporting and most importantly realistic cast.

Young Milo Hrma is in love with the conductor Ma but is unable to perform sexually in his first time the somewhat perverted dispatcher Hubika tries to help him while also ending up in a sexual scandal and a plot by the partisans is set in motion to attack the trains.This Czechoslovakian film stands apart from others in that it is a serious war film but has the feel of the silly spynoir films from the Cold War Era as well as a strange more sexually charged but still naive style of comedy. There is not much emphasis on the comedy aspect the catch being that it comes naturally from the situations presented some situations actually are rather funny with Vclav Neck portraying well the naive and frustrated Milo. Sometimes it tries too hard or maybe too little to make the comedy come naturally making it not work well however when not funny it is still often amusing to watch more so when you consider its sexual aspect in a time it was probably a scandal in most places for it to be shown this blatantly.The movie is at times slow a trademark of European dramas but at only 93 minutes there is too little time to actually be boring. The talks in regard to the raging war are also convincing and very well done.The ending is excellent and one of the reasons I liked this so much. No spoilers here but it was both unexpected and satisfying. A pity this isn't very known today.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film Watch the train Dutch title tells the story of Milos a young pointsman in Czlechoslovakia during the German occupation in the Second World War. The film combines a mild humor with a sketch of the Nazi's cruelty and stupidity. Milos starts to work in the railway station of his local village. He is hardly fullgrown and his personality is still fragile. His basic preoccupation and a source of selfdoubt is the opposite sex. His sexual performance becomes an existential problem for him and even induces a suicide attempt after an unsuccessful intercourse with his girlfriend a train guard. Eventually the niece of a colleague helps him to overcome his fears. As such the narrative is rather thin. The real charm of the film is in the detail int the little events that accompany this main story. The stationmaster who suffers under his dominant wife. The frivolous colleague of Milos. The apathetic German soldiers who find comfort in a railway wagon filled with nurses. The photographer who bursts into a gale of laughter after his house is demolished by an air raid. And the crooked regional inspector who is a dedicated but stupid and insensible supporter of Hitler and the army of occupation. In the wake of his successful intercourse which proves his manhood Milos sabotages and destroys a train filled with ammunition. Unfortunately this second success in his young life leads at the same time to his own destruction. On a higher level I don't know what to think of this narrative. It is not an invitation to reflect. Neither is it a tale of heroism or a portrayal of existential emptiness. The events just unfold as if by accident and could just as well have taken a different turn. It brings some reminiscences of the Russian film Ballad of a Soldier which in my opinion is a better appeal to our emotions. Both films probably simply mean to sketch the waste of promising lives as a result of the stupidity of war. It is probably this aspect of the possibilities for a happy future which shows their Bolshevist background.".

	schema:reviewBody "The explanation for the title of Jiri Menzel's film is that it was apparently derived from a military designation employed by the Germans who ran the railways in occupied Czechoslovakia and would probably have indicated that the highest level of security was to be observed for the whole length of the railway system over which a train so designated had to pass.'Closely Observed Trains'  its title in Britain is probably the better translation  sounds like the rambling memoir of some harmlessly eccentric trainbuff Gauge numbers timetables wheel configurations  that sort of thing!  In fact as we are finally shocked to realize it describes precisely the munitions train which the Czech Resistance successfully target at the film's conclusion. The title is deeply ironic therefore since the seemingly innocent observance of ordinary life that goes on in and around the country Station where the film is set hides the seething secret of the meek and powerless which is that since their natural desire for life and happiness has been thwarted they must encompass a more violent and final solution to their problems. With his death the unhappy young trainee Vclav becomes not a hero! but the authentic representative of his desparate fellow countrymen whose virility has become a mere joke  a land whose history has been stopped by occupation and which therefore has no posterity.It is one might say a land 'without issue' as obituary notices would put it. This adds a curious twist to the bottomstamping scene It reveals behind the charming buffoonery a society where even relations between the sexes must have an official bureaucratic imprimatur  where indeed the pillars of society are themselves so perverted as to take their only sexual pleasure in feasting their elderly eyes on a young woman's as it were officially sanctioned nether regions. The more one thinks about it  as the blast blows Vclav's hat back down the platform and simultaneously forces us back into the film we have just seen through the shocking force of such an unexpected denoument  the more the German Occupation's stamps of approval must appear as a form of evirated official rape. Of the land as of the girl of course.The explosion of the sabotaged munitions train wakes us from our comfortable and patronising sojourn in a NeverNever Land where charming and harmless buffoons exist merely for our own amusement just as its repercussions signal the eventual destruction and extirpation from Czechoslovakia of just such patronising Nazi superiority. The film alerts us to the fact that the gentlest contempt is as cruel and destructive as the most brutal jackbooted hate A collaborationist gesture is satirized and the inky soul of bureaucracy is exposed.The most decent and honest person in the film apart from the young Conductress who appears to be a Resistance agent is Vclav largely because of what is conventionally seen as the tragedy of his doomed lovelife He is untainted by the conforming adult world around him  a tormented innocent like Christ and similarly destined to be mankind's saviour through suffering.Perhaps his cap rolling down the Station platform before the blast represents the crown of thorns that every Czech had to pick up before the new Rome of Hitler's Germany could be defeated? Certainly this is not a sunny film. It is a film that demonstrates the necessity for the performance of the sternest duty To suffer and to die if necessary for one's country. And by reading us this lesson without any of the rhetorical and false heroics of the conventional actionmovie Jiri Menzel refuses to excuse his audience from enlisting for such hard service by definition a conquered people have no heroes so that they have no alternative but to struggle in small ways accumulating the stature of a Nation organically. This is after all the only possible repudiation of the Nazi ideology of the Ubermensch.Truly 'the meek shall inherit the earth.'".

Everyone winks and looks the other way. As a matter of fact even thought the young man gets a really prestigious job he doubts his own manhood because he can't perform one time and actually tries suicide. This is such an overthetop movie and so unlike anything I've ever seen I became fascinated with this. The images of the little station and the culture that revolves around it the cinematography is outstanding. I especially enjoyed the office Casenova who remained unflappable in every circumstances even when he is accused of misuse of government property for using official stamps as he spanks the young woman he works with. It's a great moment of humor. See this movie. You won't forget it.".

So apart from watching our hero overcome his control problem we also watch him and his colleagues as they sabotage Nazi trains as resistance fighters. What a bizarre combination. There is good acting the actors reminded me of those in the movies by De Sicajust everyday folks as opposed to people who looked and acted like actors. This is the movie's strength. It's greatest weakness is that it spends too much time on nookie and not enough on a real plot.

A clue to the shallowness of this critique of Scorsese could be found in the fact that the author actually thought Age of Innocence was just a studio assignmentwhich Scorsese agreed to do reluctantly. In fact Scorsese obsessed over Wharton's novel for a decade  after his pal Jay Cocks gave it to him. Everyone of Scorseses  critics should watch this heartfelt tender and utterly bloodless film. I really hope he finally gets around to doing his longplanned feature film about his parents courtshipand his own boyhood in little Italy.

He has always had difficulty holding onto a job as he is quite outspoken being warned on several occasions by the public prosecutor that he risks charges if he does not temper his writings. The bulk of the film deals with his involvement in the case of Captain Alfred Dreyfus who was falsely convicted of giving secret military information to the Germans and sentenced to life imprisonment on Devils Island. Antisemitism played an important role in the reallife case but is hardly mentioned in the film. Even after the military found definitive evidence that Dreyfus was innocent the army decided to cover it up rather than face the scandal of having arbitrarily convicted the wrong man.

However sadly and in some ways shamefully this film has been ridiculed for being dated today it's ways and means a little obsolete and it's style rather unusual. That is downright unjust! The style which is portrayed in this remarkable seventy year old film is quite conventional. The dialogue is perhaps overwritten but the powerful story is there and the story line is enhanced by intelligent dialogue to say the least as well as first rate performances by an excellent cast preferably Paul Muni giving possibly his best performance as Emile Zola and supported well by Joseph Schildkraut as Dreyfus. Not to mention the film is technically excellent. Editing costuming lighting  without doubt and all the production values stand up beautifully even several decades later.Sure it's a fictionalized version of the life of the great French writer Emile Zola however great fiction can make a great film and that is the case with The Life of Emile Zola. One may forget that this film was released in 1937 when antiSemitism was again sweeping the continent of Europe and for that very reason the word Jew is never mentioned and we are only given a short visual reference. To avoid lawsuits from their descendants only Major Dort and Major Esterhazy names were specifically identified. Others are referred to as the Chief of Staff the Minister of War etc. Also Dreyfus was not freed and restored to rank in 1902 the year of Zola's death but in 1906 after being found guilty again in an 1899 retrial. These historical errors can be forgiven because it's the films message which stands and given the current climate the movie's message is all the more important.The shifting focus of this film doesn't make it a frustrating experience for modern viewers. In fact the film flows quite nicely struggling writer gets in trouble for his book then the film follows Zola's success as he becomes a powerful force in society. Eventually we get to 1894 where many claim the film to zoom away from its subject where the film begins to focus on Dreyfus. With that being said if you sit down to watch The Life of Emile Zola don't skip the first third of the movie because it's every bit as moving and powerful as the dramatic court scene most notably in the unforgettable selfdefense scene in which Muni delivers an outstanding performance.Unfortunately had Muni not won the previous year for another biopic The Story of Louis Pasteur he would have received the Oscar for his portrayal of Zola. Muni was not only nominated for an Oscar for this role but also received awards from many critics groups. Today many dismiss the significant talent of Muni one of films first devoted actors however one cannot deny he had a great deal with elevating the art of film acting.".

	schema:headline " Still one of the best Hollywood docudramas";
	schema:reviewBody "Handsomely mounted in the Warner Brothers style of the 30's and topped off with a stirring Max Steiner score The Life of Emile Zola  remains a passionately engrossing experience.  Refreshingly the film admits upfront right after the opening titles that it's a fictionalization something that isn't done nearly as often it should be in today's purportedly true story docudramas.  These days this disclaimer is often buried in the fine print at the very end of the credits after nearly everyone has left the theater.  Even so Zola remains remarkably true to the facts.  It skips lightly over the author's early years in the first 20 minutes and then soars to gripping dramatic heights in the outrageous libel trial that Zola underwent after he published his celebrated J'Accuse which condemned the hypocrisy and corruption of the military establishment as it falsely accused highranking Captain Alfred Dreyfus of treason and then attempted a massive coverup when it realized it had made a mistake.  The movie has been criticized for underplaying the antisemitic aspects of the Dreyfus prosecution but it's implied quite neatly in the scene where the camera pans down Dreyfus's resume to his religion while one of his superiors marvels how someone like that could became an officer.  The film does indulge in some pretty fancy compression towards the end.  It implies that Dreyfus was reinstated in the Army right after returning from Devil's Island and on the same day as Zola's tragic accidental death.  However according to the Encyclopedia Britannica the real facts are even more disturbing and incredible.  In 1899 after his return Dreyfus was retried and found guilty again by a court tribunal!  However he was pardoned by the President.  He was finally cleared of all charges and reinstated in the service in 1906 four years after Zola's death in 1902.  Interesting sidelight  Zola and his devoted wife had no children but he did carry on a 14year affair with one of his housemaids that produced 2 children.  I guess there's no way the Warner Brothers were going to complicate the image of their hero as a saintly crusader for truth and justice by including this spicy little domestic tidbit.".

	onyx:emotionText "Handsomely mounted in the Warner Brothers style of the 30's and topped off with a stirring Max Steiner score The Life of Emile Zola  remains a passionately engrossing experience.  Refreshingly the film admits upfront right after the opening titles that it's a fictionalization something that isn't done nearly as often it should be in today's purportedly true story docudramas.  These days this disclaimer is often buried in the fine print at the very end of the credits after nearly everyone has left the theater.  Even so Zola remains remarkably true to the facts.  It skips lightly over the author's early years in the first 20 minutes and then soars to gripping dramatic heights in the outrageous libel trial that Zola underwent after he published his celebrated J'Accuse which condemned the hypocrisy and corruption of the military establishment as it falsely accused highranking Captain Alfred Dreyfus of treason and then attempted a massive coverup when it realized it had made a mistake.  The movie has been criticized for underplaying the antisemitic aspects of the Dreyfus prosecution but it's implied quite neatly in the scene where the camera pans down Dreyfus's resume to his religion while one of his superiors marvels how someone like that could became an officer.  The film does indulge in some pretty fancy compression towards the end.  It implies that Dreyfus was reinstated in the Army right after returning from Devil's Island and on the same day as Zola's tragic accidental death.  However according to the Encyclopedia Britannica the real facts are even more disturbing and incredible.  In 1899 after his return Dreyfus was retried and found guilty again by a court tribunal!  However he was pardoned by the President.  He was finally cleared of all charges and reinstated in the service in 1906 four years after Zola's death in 1902.  Interesting sidelight  Zola and his devoted wife had no children but he did carry on a 14year affair with one of his housemaids that produced 2 children.  I guess there's no way the Warner Brothers were going to complicate the image of their hero as a saintly crusader for truth and justice by including this spicy little domestic tidbit.";

	schema:reviewBody "Such occasions are not unlike great arias in operas the stage lights softly dim and follow spot brightens as all cast characters and audience lean forward to focus on the delivery.Such a moment occurs in The Life of Emile Zola as Paul Muni as Zola steps to the platform to deliver his courtroom defense speech.  Against all the odds of a jeering mob and negative press he proceeds to offer a seven minute oration.The scene is a setup for Muni and the camera editing and staging are all designed for the actor to deliver his thespian goods.  He doesn't disappoint.Two other cinematic courtroom speeches are comparable Alec Guiness as Benjamin Disraeli in The Mudlark 1950 enjoyed the rare opportunity of having his six minute uninterrupted speech done in a single slow tracking shot and Gary Cooper as Howard Roark in The Fountainhead 1949 held a courtroom breathless for over five minutes defending his act of poetic if not Randianjudicial justice.In Muni's case his defense scene turned out to be a highpoint of an intriguing acting career.  From Yiddish theater to worldwide stardomwith fewer that two dozen films to his creditMuni constantly enthralled some while leaving others doubtful.What's undeniable about Muni is that he achieved stardom on his own power. He was able to convince a goodly number of people both peers and public alike that he was indeed not just a good but great actor.While some held a sneaking suspicion that he was a wee bit of a poseur having never formally studied his craft it really doesn't matter.  Muni didn't win his lucrative acting contractsor his Academy Award honorsfor nothing.  Personally I enjoy his general work being more partial to roles more close to his own than those of his elders.  In latter cases I felt he often tended to go a bit overthetop with stereotypical mannerisms.As Zola though his earnestness and determination proves convincing and the film itself is peopled with a powerhouse cadre of Warner Bros. character players.  To the film's credit a preenactment inscription admits to the intermingling of fiction with fact for dramatic purposes.  This also relieves the production of accusations of historical inaccuracy.All in all The Life of Emile Zola is  a most engrossing biopic of a courageous literary giant who placed the pursuit of justice above the receiving of worldly accolades.".

One of the key issues of the Dreyfus affair antisemitism is never even brought up.  The only reference to Dreyfus' Judaism is a passing glimpse on his personnel papers.

That's because the final portion centers on the last years of Zola's life and his attempt to gain Dreyfus his release from prison. Dreyfus had been sent to Devil's Islandconvicted of sending French military secrets to foreign powers. Amazingly when the true perpetrator was learned the highest officers in the military decided NOT to punish the man responsible and keep Dreyfus in prison so they wouldn't lose face for convicting the wrong man!! I really enjoyed The Life of Emile Zola though could see that a very important part of the story is missing. I am NOT talking about the film taking a few artistic libertiesI certainly expected that. Instead I am talking about a deliberate effort by the studio to misrepresent a major part of the story to make it more palatable to the general public. You see about 34 of the movie concerns Zola and the Dreyfus Affairyet it really makes no real effort to talk about the heart of why Dreyfus was convicted for a crime he clearly did not commitbecause he was a convenient scapegoat because he was Jewish. The film BRIEFLY mentions he was Jewish but completely downplays this anglemostly because I assume they were afraid antisemites in the US and abroad might find this unacceptable. Sadly it makes this exceptional film just a bit less exceptional.What I liked about the film was the overall quality of the picture. It was well written acted and just screams quality. Plus compared to many other biopics of the era this one is a little more accurateas the facts of the story are essentially true though rearranged and interpreted for dramatic effect. Still I find it hard to believe it won the Oscar for Best Picturethough I must concede that Paul Muni was exceptional. If I could have picked I would have given the nod to either Lost Horizon or A Star is Born.".

	schema:headline " A WellCrafted Worthwhile Memorial to Zola";
	schema:reviewBody "This wellcrafted film is a worthwhile memorial to mile Zola one of the finest writers of his era and one who deserves to be betterknown today outside of his own country. It seems likely that Zola a naturalistic writer who always used lifelike genuine characters who had both strengths and weaknesses would probably have been satisfied with the way he is portrayed by Paul Muni and by the screenplay. Zola is shown not as a flawless hero or as a largerthanlife icon but as a real person with a talent for writing who was willing to struggle both to establish himself and to remain true to his principles.The movie makes a good selection of events from Zola's life looking both at his earlier years when he was struggling to establish himself and at his later years when as a respected member of society he had to fight his own reluctance to remain true to his ideals. The supporting cast have smaller parts but they generally do quite well. Vladimir Sokoloff has a couple of nice scenes as Czanne and his interactions with Muni are quite helpful in defining the main character especially as he changes once attaining personal success. Joseph Schildkraut makes good use of his scenes as Dreyfus.Zola's lifetime was also an interesting and often tumultuous period in France's own history and the movie provides at least a small taste of that.There was for example even more to the Dreyfus situation than is shown here but it and other historical events are shown mainly as they involved Zola himself  otherwise to do justice to the events in themselves the movie would have had to be several times as long. There's plenty here as it is to make it worthwhile both as a good drama and as a believable portrait of Zola.".

Zola is shown not as a flawless hero or as a largerthanlife icon but as a real person with a talent for writing who was willing to struggle both to establish himself and to remain true to his principles.The movie makes a good selection of events from Zola's life looking both at his earlier years when he was struggling to establish himself and at his later years when as a respected member of society he had to fight his own reluctance to remain true to his ideals. The supporting cast have smaller parts but they generally do quite well. Vladimir Sokoloff has a couple of nice scenes as Czanne and his interactions with Muni are quite helpful in defining the main character especially as he changes once attaining personal success. Joseph Schildkraut makes good use of his scenes as Dreyfus.Zola's lifetime was also an interesting and often tumultuous period in France's own history and the movie provides at least a small taste of that.There was for example even more to the Dreyfus situation than is shown here but it and other historical events are shown mainly as they involved Zola himself  otherwise to do justice to the events in themselves the movie would have had to be several times as long. There's plenty here as it is to make it worthwhile both as a good drama and as a believable portrait of Zola.";

	schema:reviewBody "In a lucrative and highly successful career that saw him play everyone from Spanish savior Juarez to a cutthroat gangster in Scarface character chameleon Paul Muni became French novelist Emile Zola in The Life of Emile Zola 1937. This is perhaps the most legitimate and faithful  certainly the most serious and stirring  biographical film to emerge from a major Hollywood studio and so quite unlike anything that had ever been seen on the screen until that time. Warner spared no expense in retelling Zola's early and lingering success as an author and tragic death in a house fire. Embarking in idyllic 1862's Paris with Zola's initial fame the film delves compassionately into the morbid curiosity and infamous trial known as the Dreyfus Affair. Encouraged by confidant and contemporary painter Paul Cezanne Vladamir Sokoloff to dispel his own comfortable success and to stand up for truth and justice Zola decides to take on the case of Capt. Alfred Dreyfus Joseph Schildkraut a war hero unjustly accused of disclosing military secrets and imprisoned on Devil's Island. There are so many powerful and haunting moments in this bio that it's hard to pinpoint exactly where its greatness derives. But it is perhaps best exemplified by the dynamic interactions between Zola and Cezanne. These lead into the beautifully realized and justly celebrated court room summation that once seen is not to be forgotten.There are times when the most courageous thing is to be cowardly exclaims Zola...indeed. The quiet rectitude of The Life of Emile Zola is a distinct pleasure for classic cinema fans  neither embellished or flag waving but just as emotionally satisfying and twice as likely to be championed well into the next century. The film's definite slant toward critiquing antiSemitism is now a time capsule foreshadowing the growing angst of nations and Nazi terror that was to engulf Europe and cast the world into its second great war. However William Dieterle's direction is timeless with slick panache that makes all his points but never heavyhanded or without style befitting a classic biography. The score by luminary composer Max Steiner is striking and poignant. In short The Life of Emile Zola is befitting of the Oscar for Best Picture and very much a relic from Hollywood's golden age worthy of considerable and repeated reexamination. Warner Home Video's DVD is a reason to stand up and cheer. While there are age related artifacts present throughout and some scenes suffer from considerable grain the overall image quality is solid sharp and beautifully contrasted. The gray scale has been impeccably rendered with deep rich blacks and for the most part solid clean whites. Certain brief sections appear to have been duped in from second or third generation elements but keeping in mind that the film is 70 plus year old such lapses should easily be forgiven. The audio is mono but has been presented at an adequate listening level. A slight hiss is detected occasionally. Save a complete and costly digital restoration no more could have been expected by the good people at Warners on this transfer. It is head and shoulders above anything the film has looked like in years. Extras include a rare audio only recording of Muni doing Zola on radio a dramatic and a cartoon short subject. The one disappointment here is that no time was taken to do a featurette on the making of this classic film. Regardless it comes highly recommended by this reviewer.".

It is monumental in its towering pathos of justice which actually reduces Zola to a mere second character while the central character is the awesome Dreyfus affair with its character assassination by intentional gross injustice. It was the greatest judicial scandal in the 19th century and perhaps in history and it is very well presented in the film especially by minor details as the scenes from Devil's Island when Dreyfus fettered to his bed for security tries to read Zola's book under his bed and finds it infested with insects and when his release is illustrated by his incredulousness walking out of his cell again and again and returning in to walk out once again.The first quarter of the film is the weakest and least historically correct Nana was far from Zola's first literary success and actually only a minor novel compared to Gervaise and Germinal for instance which are not even mentioned. The last three quarters of the film are all about the Dreyfus affair crowned with Zola's glowing articles and speeches in court splendidly delivered by Paul Muni well aware of what opportunity he had here to excel himself in acting and making more than the best of it.All other actors are excellent as well and startlingly convincing every one of them from Esterhazy and the generals to the ladies and wives while Czanne alone is a little shadowy.It's a tremendous film I saw it as a child 55 years ago and have never forgotten it and at last I found an opportunity to see it again and it was exactly equally impressing and moving. William Dieterle made many excellent films he was German and worked with Murnau Max Reinhardt Marlene Dietrich codirector with Reinhardt in the glorious Midsummer Night's Dream and finalized his career in Hollywood with unsurpassed gems like Love Letters and Portrait of Jennie with Jennifer Jones. They are very different from his great biopics of the 30s of which this Dreyfus film is the towering masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Life of Emile Zola tells a compelling story but it has a title that is not exactly accurate. This is not a story of the life of Emile Franois Zola the 19th century writer who railed against the injustices in his native France in books like Nana and Germinal. Actually it is the specific story of the trial and injustice done to Alfred Dreyfuss the blameless officer of the French army who spent 4 years confined to Devil's Island on trumped up charges of treason. Zola's part in his trial is small at best.In all honesty this is probably best. Zola played here in an Oscar nominated performance by Paul Muni was a figure whose writing was filled with fire and energy but displaying the writing process on screen is a bit difficult not to mention dull. Zola speaks of his philosophies and then we see the lineup of his books which is meaningless if you haven't read them we see eager patrons buying up copies while others rail against Zola for spreading slander against France.Most of this takes place in the film's opening as we meet the young Zola a poor Frenchman shivering in the cold while his blood boils over the injustices from a cruel and indifferent government more interested in its image then in its citizens. He shares a drafty attic with his lifelong friend the postimpressionist painter Paul Czanne Vladimir Sokoloff. Their friendship is hardly explored and is probably more interesting than any other aspect of his life.Zola's story takes a backseat once Dreyfus is arrested on a charge of treason. A letter is intercepted and suspicions run that an unidentified officer in the French Army is a spy. The top brass run down the list of possible suspects and only draw Dreyfus' name because he is easy to accuse the film very quickly and quietly points out the fact that he was chosen as a scapegoat because he was Jewish. Dreyfus is arrested run through a kangaroo court stripped of rank and given a life sentence on Devil's Island off the coast of French Guyana in South America.Zola's role in the trial is meager at beast. We see the trial being conducted in the which judge continually silences the defense and keeps them from presenting key evidence that would prove Dreyfus to be innocent. Emile Zola's role in the trial it to sit by in the courtroom until it is his turn to give the closing statement.The story of The Dreyfus affair is far more interesting than anything we learn about Emile Zola. Paul Muni occupies the title role and he does a fine job but his interpretation of Zola is mainly just a man of good faith and common sense who spoke softly and ran for his pen when a mood struck him. His performance is nearly identical to that one he played a year earlier in The Story of Louis Pasteur. We don't really get to know the innerman so much as just the red letter details of his life. We do get the information that he was initially uninterested in speaking on Dreyfus' behalf but there is hardly any real reason. As for Dreyfus we never get to know him either. We see him unjustly arrested tried convicted and jailed. A few times we see him in his cell but there is never a sense of who the man was outside of his circumstances.Still the movie is compelling in its portrait of how the French government was able to hide facts silence witnesses and overlook evidence. This may or may not be factual but it makes for an interesting story. It is possible that the story was written with the current world situation in mind. At the outbreak of World War II with the Nazis bulldozing all over Europe the story of injustice and government corruption couldn't have been timelier".

	schema:reviewBody "You really have to like these Warner Brothers biographical movies from the 1930s. They're in black and white true and they may gloss events and invent speeches a little differently from the way you and I might but they're  well  they're EDUCATIONAL. You can learn basic historical facts from them. This isn't an achievement to be taken lightly not in a country in which 28 of voters believe Saddam Hussein was behind the 911 attacks or in which a substantial number of students think Watergate took place before 1900.I don't mean that the Warners' biopics were academic studies.

	schema:reviewBody "The title for this review is quote I read from Charles DeGaulle discussing the responsibilities he felt in the role that fate thrust upon him. DeGaulle was a military man who stepped up to the plate when his country's fortunes were at their darkest. A whole lot of other more important army figures could have done what he did but no one stepped to the plate like that courageous if sometimes exasperating junior brigadier general.Another guy who stepped to the plate for France was not a military man in fact it was the army he took on. The Life of Emile Zola is the story about that man brought beautifully to life by Paul Muni who was a modern writer who first fought to write life as he saw it and not through some romantic gauze as was popular in the first half of the 19th century. His writings led to a lot of social reform in France.Yet half the film is dedicated to Zola's last struggle taking up the cause of wrongly convicted Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Joseph Schildkraut won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar of 1937 who when treason was discovered was singled out because he was a Jew as the fall guy.Although Hollywood tends to overdramatize in many cases this is one where they are telling the absolute truth. I find it hard to fathom myself that even after proof was brought to the French Army's attention that another was in fact the guilty party they persisted in promoting the fiction about Dreyfus's guilt. AntiSemitism certainly ran deep in many quarters of French society the military being only one of them. Keeping faith with prejudice was more important than getting at the truth and getting justice for a wrongly accused man.Muni's address to the court during the libel suit trial the army brought against him is classic. Though many feel his style of acting is outmoded I for one miss that. I can't think of a player today who could move the audience as Muni did in that address. He was nominated for Best Actor but he had won that award the previous year for The Story of Louis Pasteur and in 1937 was beaten by Spencer Tracy for Captains Courageous.However The Life of Emile Zola won for Best Picture of 1937 and also won for Best adapted Screenplay. I can't think of better praise to give the film than to say that if Emile Zola could have been interviewed he'd have given the film an enthusiastic rave.France like a lot of countries has had people come to their leadership in an hour of need. In the 15th century it was a peasant girl whom we know as Joan of Arc. During the occupation by the Nazis France's honor was preserved by Charles DeGaulle. And at a time when corruption and prejudice poisoned the French society it wasn't a peasant saint or a military leader but a man of learning and letters who would not give up until truth and justice won out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kudos to the patience of Paul Muni who spent hours and hours in the makeup room each day to look the part of Zola. Muni was the one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and I wonder how many people today other than classic movie buffs  know anything about it. He was a giant in the business for at least a decade. He could have won the Academy Award for this performance which would have given him two in a row as he won it for playing Louis Pasteur the year before. My own opinion is that while he tended to overact a bit I still think he was one of the great actors of the Golden Age. Whatever part he played you were riveted to the screen watching him.Unlike the Pasteur role I thought this story smacked of a little too much of what we've seen in the last 60 years going overboard to make a Liberal hero. Even in 1937 Hollywood couldn't suppress its disdain for police or for the military here making it a point to tell us how corrupt those organizations are. Filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated. In that regard this film is way ahead of its day since we've seen this bigtime since the 1960s.However it must be noted the facts support this story. It also does not in any way diminish Zola's accomplishments as a social reformer getting rid of certain evils. Good for him! I wish they had spent more time showing that than concentrating on one trial.".

Zola wrote an open letter to the French President to which the media attached the headline J'accuse! I accuse!. For this Zola would be charged with libel and in the course of his defense he would attempt to expose to the world the truth behind the conviction of Dreyfus. The aspects of antiSemitism in the case are barely acknowledged in the film.While I was impressed with the both performances and the production values particularly for the period of the film I did find something lacking. Perhaps its simply the fact that there have been so many great court room dramas produced subsequently.Paul Muni gives a powerful and effective performance though his style may appear dated to some. Over the course of the film Zola's appearance changes considerably and Muni does an impressive job of virtually disappearing into the role. Muni had one the Oscar in the previous year for another biographical role in The Story of Louis Pasteur and would be nominated another 4 times as well including for this role.".

But simply as a film ZOLA is a superb example of how Hollywood can occasionally reach a height of inspiration. The script is extremely literate the plot is compelling and the performers are topnotch especially Muni who was robbed by the Academy. His handling of the character through several stages of life and the wide range of emotions called for was a praiseworthy effort.Some may say that the film loses focus when the Dreyfus affair takes over the plot thread from the narration of Zola's life as a writer. I see it rather as the summation of Zola's life. He has struggled from obscurity to wealth and fame by exposing the social ills of his time in his controversial novels and articles. But as Cezanne subtly points out Zola has gotten rich and fat and that only leads to a dulling of talent. The Dreyfus affair is Zola's chance to prove that what he has written he also truly believes himself. His defense of Dreyfus is the capstone of his work.This is one of the earliest films to tackle the sensitive topic of how much the government is willing to do to cover up its own faults. As such it is valuable viewing for thinking people today. It's a shame that the studio wasn't bold enough to tackle what was really the central issue of the trial Dreyfus's identity as a French Jew and the rampant antiSemitism of Parisian society which continues today.When you watch ZOLA keep in mind that to the 1937 audience the Dreyfus trial was as recent an event as the assassination of Martin Luther King is to us today. It looks like an antique costume drama here in 2007 but in its day it was still hot enough news that the studio had to leave some names out of the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Life of Emile Zola is a good if rather bland and simplistic film biography of the famous author with a great performance by Paul Muni. It gives the basic facts about Zola's life even as it omits many of the social issues he confronted and fictionalizes other aspects of his life.The strongest part of the film is Paul Muni's performance. He succeeds in embodying Zola both as a young man and an older established author bringing a genuine sense of passion to the role.

Although the film makes us feel for Dreyfus and his family it fails to deal with antiSemitism in a meaningful way. The film only twice hints at the role of Dreyfus's ethnicity  religion in the case once when we see the word Jew written on his personnel file the second time when an effigy of Dreyfus is shown as a Jewish stereotype. Given what was going on in Europe in 1937 it would have been topical for the film to examine those issues.Also the film fictionalizes of a number of things particularly towards the end. It gives the impression that Dreyfus was immediately exonerated after being freed when that actually happened several years later. Furthermore when Zola dies the film depicts a nation uniformly in mourning when actually many of Zola's enemies publicly rejoiced.In the end The Life of Emile Zola is a good classic style biopic that may seem dated and simplistic to modern tastes.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Life of Emile Zola is a good if rather bland and simplistic film biography of the famous author with a great performance by Paul Muni. It gives the basic facts about Zola's life even as it omits many of the social issues he confronted and fictionalizes other aspects of his life.The strongest part of the film is Paul Muni's performance. He succeeds in embodying Zola both as a young man and an older established author bringing a genuine sense of passion to the role.

	schema:reviewBody "Living with his vegan girlfriend Morgan Spurlock decides to try and eat McDonalds for every meal for a month. At the same time he reduces the amount of exercise and walking to match that of the 'average' American to make for a fair experiment. After an initial bit of sickness he gets to enjoy the food and eats it three times per day. However after a week or two his doctors begin to notice significant increases in body fat cholesterol and blood pressure. Interspersed with this are interviews with experts on the nutritional value marketing and impact of McDonalds and fast food generally.Several years ago I read the book Fast Food Nation and basically that ended my interest in the main fast food outlets and saw my consumption of processed foods drop quite a bit. I did not become a born again Christian and still eat rubbish food and am no role model for healthy living! However what I have notice in the press and in the audiences for this film is a rather smug 'look at them' attitude as if this has no impact in Europe and Americans are some sort of freak show and nothing to do with us. This film may focus on McDonalds because it is the world leader in fast food which is high in saturated fats but if all you take from this film is pleasure at seeing McDonalds taking a kicking then you are missing the point. The film was challenging to me and I hope it was to many viewers  but I have not eaten in McDonalds or Burger King since 2001 and a bad bout of food poisoning in early 2003 ended my ability to enjoy KFC. So why did I find it challenging? Well because like many others I eat too many saturated fats and regardless of where they come from oven foods ready meals or fast food I need to cut them down. Spurlock sends this message in a really entertaining way while also having good digs at McDonalds.His relaxed style is refreshing and allows the facts to speak for themselves. He clearly doesn't like fast food as a concept but he is no Michael Moore and is only slightly biased. He is certainly a lot more interesting than his vegan girlfriend who is one of those overbearing selfrighteous types who look down their nose at anything. His good humour makes the film but it is the documentary rather than the gimmick that kept me watching. The facts on obesity do speak for themselves and they are frightening and all the more so when you actually sit and think about what you eat  sweets colas ready meals crisps processed foods whether it is salt saturated fats or sugar any of these foods spells trouble if they are not part of a balanced diet. My only fear of this film is that many viewers will look at McDonalds and say 'they are to blame lets get them' and simply ignore that it is very easy to eat an unhealthy diet  go to any supermarket and you'll find 'easy' food served up quickly but without the things your body needs. I was challenged because I can easily veg out for several days and be too tired to cook decent food and this reminded me why I need to  hopefully many viewers will take that challenge and not just turn from one fatty diet McDonalds to another ready meals.I personally didn't find the film as funny nor as shocking as many commentators have said it was but it was still consistently entertaining and interesting true not the most scientific of experiments but that is not the point. True very few people eat McDonalds every day but many many people do eat foods high in saturated fats everyday even if they are not all happy meals and in this way maybe Spurlock's experiment wasn't so farfetched and lets be honest like their own lobbyist said  McDonalds are part of the problem. That the film has had an impact is undeniable  the super size option has been removed and how many salads did you see in McDonalds this time last year? It may seem unfair and I can understand why McDonalds has been quick to counter it and call it unfair and in a way it is unfair  why should they carry the whole blame for an overwhelming surge in unhealthy eating but I suppose that's what you get for being the market leaders!Overall this was a very entertaining film that mixes its gimmick well with humour but also a good core of a documentary with interesting talking heads who don't rant or rave but simply look to the figures in most cases. However I would say this if you only see this film to sneer at those visibly unhealthy or to tear a strip off McDonalds then you are missing the bigger point  it is easy to eat unhealthy cheap food no matter what brand it is  eating it every day and having a poor diet is a major problem and if nothing else this should challenge all of us to look at our own habits and not just point and laugh at others.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fast food is good. I freely admit to running through fast food drivethrus Wendy's Taco Bell and McDonald's being my top 3 often sometimes several times a week. And I'm not the only one. I'm also one of the many millions of people in the country who are uh...not thin. Think there's a connection?In Super Size Me a documentary from talented debut filmmaker Morgan Spurlock that manages to be both entertaining and horrifying he attempts to draw a parallel between the fast food culture we live in and the rampant and everincreasing rate of obesity in America. To do this he launched into a little science experiment. A 33 yearold New Yorker in excellent health he would eat nothing but McDonald's for an entire month to gauge the effects on his body. Breakfast lunch and dinner at McDonald's and whenever they asked him to supersize he would have to accept. Before starting he consulted three doctors a cardiologist a gastroenterologist and a general practitioner all of whom said this experiment obviously wouldn't be GOOD for him but that the damages would be minimal. Instead the results were pretty shocking. Spurlock gained almost 30 pounds over 10 in the first week saw his cholesterol skyrocket and experienced frequent nausea chest pains mood swings and loss of sex drive.During this month he also drove around the country interviewing several different people on the topic including a Big Mac enthusiast who has eaten over 19000 Big Macs. His research on our fast food culture definitely yields some interesting information especially when he interviews a group of 1stgraders and more of them can identify Ronald McDonald than Jesus or George Washington. Super Size Me isn't perfect. It's a little repetitive and has a certain thinness to it no pun intended! that prevents it from being one of the truly great comedic documentaries of recent years like American Movie or Bowling For Columbine. But even if it falls short of greatness it's an entertaining and thoughtprovoking film especially if you're uh...not thin.Spurlock is a witty and engaging host sort of like Michael Moore but not as much of a windbag and I also liked his girlfriend a vegan chef! who looks on his experiment with a mixture of amusement horror and dismay. Just like we do.".

	onyx:emotionText "Fast food is good. I freely admit to running through fast food drivethrus Wendy's Taco Bell and McDonald's being my top 3 often sometimes several times a week. And I'm not the only one. I'm also one of the many millions of people in the country who are uh...not thin. Think there's a connection?In Super Size Me a documentary from talented debut filmmaker Morgan Spurlock that manages to be both entertaining and horrifying he attempts to draw a parallel between the fast food culture we live in and the rampant and everincreasing rate of obesity in America. To do this he launched into a little science experiment. A 33 yearold New Yorker in excellent health he would eat nothing but McDonald's for an entire month to gauge the effects on his body. Breakfast lunch and dinner at McDonald's and whenever they asked him to supersize he would have to accept. Before starting he consulted three doctors a cardiologist a gastroenterologist and a general practitioner all of whom said this experiment obviously wouldn't be GOOD for him but that the damages would be minimal. Instead the results were pretty shocking. Spurlock gained almost 30 pounds over 10 in the first week saw his cholesterol skyrocket and experienced frequent nausea chest pains mood swings and loss of sex drive.During this month he also drove around the country interviewing several different people on the topic including a Big Mac enthusiast who has eaten over 19000 Big Macs. His research on our fast food culture definitely yields some interesting information especially when he interviews a group of 1stgraders and more of them can identify Ronald McDonald than Jesus or George Washington. Super Size Me isn't perfect. It's a little repetitive and has a certain thinness to it no pun intended! that prevents it from being one of the truly great comedic documentaries of recent years like American Movie or Bowling For Columbine. But even if it falls short of greatness it's an entertaining and thoughtprovoking film especially if you're uh...not thin.Spurlock is a witty and engaging host sort of like Michael Moore but not as much of a windbag and I also liked his girlfriend a vegan chef! who looks on his experiment with a mixture of amusement horror and dismay. Just like we do.";

It is very terrifying what the fast food industry has done to this country. I'm not trying to bad rap them they're a business. That's what they do they try to make money. Do I agree with all the law suits going on with people blaming McDonald's and Burger King for making them fat? No nobody is shoving the food down their throats. But there are so many people out there that are heavy users of fast food and this documentary shows what the damaging effects can be of eating fast food. I gave up fast food and have not had any for over a year now and my health has boosted up majorly.

	schema:reviewBody "Supersize Me is an original humorous disgusting shocking and  overall  scary film. Spurlock takes us on a whirlwind tour of the downfall of American health through poor nutrition padding a lot of information with anecdotal footage of his own foray into a McDonald'sonly diet.What amuses me about the negative reviews for this film at IMDb is how the majority of the naysayers focus on exactly one thing Spurlock's 30day McDonalds binge. Heck you could pick that much out of the trailer and write a slanted review based solely on the imperfections of that particular plot device as an overall impact study and call it a day. I wouldn't be a bit surprised to find out that's what's happening either. Certainly anyone who's watched the political BS pour in to commentary for Michael Moore's documentaries knows how it's done. However if you actually take the time to watch the film you'll see something quite different emerge a pattern of childhood indoctrination poor nutrition inadequate exercise and skyrocketing obesity rates that's sweeping this nation like a plague. Spurlock's selfafflicted experiment is as I've mentioned a continuity device that unifies the broad range of the film within a single case study. In the total scope of what's addressed in this film it's a relatively small part and many decry it as unrealistic. But Spurlock never claimed it was entirely realistic! He says as much in the film he ate as much McDonalds in a month as nutritionists recommend one eat in 8 years or more. However the problem is a lot of Americans are eating as much fast food in a year as he ate in a month. What is the net effect going to be after five years? After 10? Spurlock further restricts himself to an AVERAGE amount of walking exercise typical for our national population. The problems he exhibits after 3 weeks on this diet are NOT unique they are the ones that people around the country are exhibiting in spades weight gain fatty liver depression inactivity. It cannot be overemphasized that this condition is widespread. Those arguing personal responsibility have to answer the question of how it is that suddenly over the last 30 years so many people have chosen a life of sickness and selfdestructive addiction over one of health and common sense. The effect of massmedia indoctrination is an obvious factor and the film addresses it well. Spurlock also takes us behind the scenes at school lunchrooms and gymnasiums around the country where we find out a little bit of what's been happening to the kids of America. Is the french fry truly the only vegetable we can afford to serve to school kids aside from the dubious catsup? How children could be expected to show personal responsibility above and beyond that exhibited by their likelyobese parents in such an environment of brand franchising 2ndrate meal programs and cutbacks in PErecess time is a matter that I invite all fastfood apologists at IMDb to explore.For pure entertainment value I have to deduct points for an uneven pace especially near the end and insufficient exposition from some of the people in the film. Still Supersize Me stands as an indictment of the prepackaged food industry its marketing hype and its congressional lobbyists. It also serves as a warning to Americans trapped in demanding lowactivity jobs which leave little time for lunch or exercise don't eat the fries!810".

	schema:reviewBody "This documentary film by Morgan Spurlock asks the intriguing and topical question What would happen to a normal 33yearold man in perfect health who stands six feet two and weighs 185 pounds if he ate nothing but McDonald's fast food for thirty days?Well it is not recorded that he shrunk. In fact Spurlock forsaking his vegan girlfriend's healthy cuisine gained about 25 pounds and saw his cholesterol level shoot up to dangerous levels as he huffed and puffed his way three times a day through myriad Big Macs and fillet o' fish sandwiches milk shakes sodas fries and other notsodelicate items from the menu of the world's largest purveyor of fast food. He had hired three doctors and a registered dietician to check his vital signs and give him a thorough physical exam prior to this experiment in notsofine dining. Before the gorging was done all three doctors and the dietician advised him in the most uncertain terms for the sake of his health to stop eating the sugarladen fatsmeared nearly fiberfree diet. But Spurlock trooper that he is amid the McTingles and the McPukes hung in there until the very end. I can report that he survived the experience. Whether the viewer will is another matter. If you yourself God help you are seriously overweight you might want to pass on this excruciatingly detailed misadventure under the Golden Arches. All that fat slapping against those waddling thighs Spurlock mercifully fuzzed out the faces of his subjects allowing us only body shots all that jiggling flesh under those XXXL garments might be too uncomfortably close to home for some sensitive viewers.But was this a fair test of the harmful consequences of eating Happy Meals and being super sized? After all Spurlock eschewed exercise during the experiment and of course nobody ? actually eats every meal at McDonald's as Spurlock did. Furthermore he actually doubled his normal caloric intake from about 2500 calories a day to about 5000. Regardless I think we can say that his experience was indicative.The real question to be asked here and Spurlock asks it is whether McDonald's or as some have dubbed thee whether McDeath's can be or should be held responsible for the epidemic of obesity that is sweeping the country. Spurlock implies that McDonald's should be held responsible at least for its advertising aimed at children. I agree with this. But I also think that adults ought to know what they are doing. If they choose to chow down at a place that loves to super size and under nourish them perhaps they themselves should be held responsible for the consequences. However some people feel that the advertising has been so insidious for so long and the food so addictive to susceptible individuals that McDonald's ought to be taken to court just as the tobacco companies have been.For more information on the epidemic its consequences and what can be done about it I refer the interested reader to The Hungry Gene The Science of Fat and the Future of Thin by Ellen Ruppel Shell Fat Land How Americans Became the Fastest People in the World by Eric Critser and Fast Food Nation The Dark Side of the AllAmerican Meal by Eric Schlosser. Schlosser appears in one of the bonus features being interviewed by Spurlock. This interview is one of the highlights of the DVD. Schlosser is articulate candid and very wellinformed.Spurlock of course is a performer as well as a film maker. His directorial style owes something to that of Michael Moore and his playful oncamera muggings remind me of Ian Wright of PBS's Globe Trekker series.See this as an introduction to this most serious threat to the nation's health especially as it affects children. Morgan Spurlock is to be commended for bringing the reality of the epidemic to the attention of the general public.By the way McTingles are those highflying scary feelings you get after rapidly injecting massive amounts of pure sugar and caffeine into your system usually by gulping your way through a 64ounce McColaand to think when I was a kid CocaCola came in sixounce bottles. How ever did we survive? McPukes are selfexplanatory.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. My daughter and I have been anxiously awaiting the release of this film since first reading about it months ago. Director and lab rat Morgan Spurlock takes on a fast food exclusive diet for 30 days and fills us in on the painful steps and sickening conclusion. Many have attacked Spurlock for picking on McDonalds or for not selecting the healthiest thing possible at every meal. These people are missing the point. He explains in the movie that McDonalds is the selection because they so dominate the fast food scene in the world and especially in Manhattan where he lives. He also explains his meal selection by showing that most McDonalds orders include burgers and fries. Personally I wondered more about his numerous milk shakes and parfaits. These seem to be the items that were a bit extreme. For the most part Spurlock does an excellent job proving that we eat too much fast food that it is very harmful to our bodies and that there is evil at work conditioning kids that fast food is real food. The most frightening part of the story was the school cafeteria segment showing how kids eat when parents are not around and when school administrators pay no attention. This is the crux of our problems. The Georgetown professor compared it to the early candy cigarettes that condition kids that cigarettes create happiness. The same can be said for fast food and its happy meals and playgrounds. I did not agree too much with the doctor's comparison of Spurlock to Nic Cage in Leaving Las Vegas. Cage's character was trying to commit suicide while Spurlock was running an experiment and even considered quitting when the doctors were begging him to. Overall a nice documentary without the total disregard for decency and the truth shown by Michael Moore in most of his films. I believe this should be required viewing for all junior high and high school students as well as all expecting parents. This could be an educational tool to convince people to put a little more effort into their health.".

Enlightening and informative it uncovers the fast food industry's conspiracy that it's not about the people they serve but its about the money we give them. They manufacture and process foods so that we HAVE to have more. You just can't eat one chip isn't just good marketing  they really put stuff in the food even in our meat to make it more addictive! The food industry in general is just another selfseeking money making machine no better than the big companies that outsource their manufacturing to inhumane sweatshops in third world countries. They exploit the poor to feed their gluttonous and materialistic appetites.It took a lot of courage to go through with this experiment risking your own body for a greater cause. This film will hopefully help change the way the fast food industry thinks and operates exposing the conspiracy. If nothing else Super Size Me will inspire you to eat right exercise and possibly become a vegan. At the least you'll be motivated to eat better.Though the film is a bit slow at times considering the content it's definitely worth seeing. As a result of watching this movie I don't want to eat fast food EVER AGAIN!!!! We need more films and books like this one.Anyone who cares about what goes on in the world should see this film. I highly recommend it.".

As a result of watching this movie I don't want to eat fast food EVER AGAIN!!!! We need more films and books like this one.Anyone who cares about what goes on in the world should see this film. I highly recommend it.";

That Americans eat too much fast food  too much of any kind of food  and eschew exercise is hardly news.  But a fullscale documentary examining sloth by the bucketfull focusing on one major commercial phenomenon hasn't been done before.Spurlock decided to eat at McDonald's and only McDonald's for a full month. That's three meals a day with no other food source.  Before launching on what actually was a deathdefying trip literally since for variety he consumed Mickey D's food in Texas L.A. and a lot of other places he had a full baseline workup with a cardiologist a gastroenterologist and an internist who gets more screen time than his medical colleagueshe gravitates between being supportive and alarmist the latter increasingly the right response to Spurlock's bizarre quest.Spurlock also has a nutritionistdietician and a physical trainer to keep tabs on him.  The only specialty missing in retrospective one who might have been useful was a psychiatrist.  His girlfriend a vegan chef no less looks forward to the month with a mixture of humor and alarm.Supersize Me has lots of scientific information on the nature of fast food and its impact on an America that eats out more than it dines at home a change from a past where mom or a wife faithfully prepared most meals. Nutritionists decry the change in our culture educators point out the impact of fast food in school cafeterias on kids' health a former Surgeon General gravely decries the menace and the usual persononthestreet suspects shock viewers by their bumbling inability to define such terms as calories.  A food industry spokesman is blithely unaware that he is being set up to look like an ass. And of course there are multiple shots of Spurlock vainly connecting with polite drones at McDonald's HQ seeking an interview which never comes. Does this all sound familiar?Spurlock's monthlong consumption of McDonald's products gets old fast although he and the director try to add some novelty like showing him vomiting after downing a supersized meal.  Periodic visits to get his bloods and body checked reveal the insidious impact of a bizarre diet. His puzzled internist tells us several times he's never before seen a liver compromised by a high fat diet.The problem though is that Spurlock is like those laboratory rats who develop arcane tumors after consuming the equivalent of something that no human could ingest in ten lifetimes. His peregrination from one Mc D's to another becomes boring as his health is clearly threatened and he stubbornly refuses medical advice to give it up.The best part of Supersize Me is the wellpresented information on schools and fast foods and how a few are resisting the commercial tide that aims junk at kids from kindergarten through high school.  Even inmates we're told can be well fed at no greater cost than the fatladen diets these essentially sedentary wards of the state have shoveled at them.Technically this is a wellfilmed documentary with creative use of multiple images and graphs.I hope Spurlock has more ideas for documentaries.  He's had a lot of time to think about itan epilogue informs us it took him almost a year to regain his former fitness and health thanks partially to his vegan lover's detoxification diet.Oh and McDonald's is phasing out supersized meals a minor withdrawal in a serious public health war.710.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard about Morgan Spurlock's 2004 documentary Super Size Me I was pretty jaded because common sense would dictate that if one eats fast food they are going to have weight and health issues. Indeed this is what happened to Spurlock however the magnitude of the health deterioration was astounding.Presented in a sometimes humorous format Super Size Me is an experiment conducted by Spurlock in which he would only eat McDonald's food three times a day with the caveats that he would have to eat everything off the menu at least once and that he would limit his exercise to the amount of exercise the average American gets per day. Therefore if he is nearing his walking limit for the day measured by a pedometer he wears he would have to grab a cab or find another way to get from A to B without walking. Predictably he gains a lot of weight though the rapidness of the weight gain is alarming  at first 10 pounds in one week but it is his actual health tests that are the most frightening. By the end of the second week his doctors who originally approved his experiment with some reservation naturally were practically begging him to stop. Other than the experiment itself Super Size Me is peppered with facts about the fast food industry and various interviews with industry insiders.I definitely found the film enjoyable and somewhat informative though having read Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation a lot of the information was old news but there was something missing that is hard to grasp perhaps the film needed a little more substance and cold hard facts instead of watching him constantly eat. However it is my understanding that the supplemental materials on the DVD are extremely informative and even include an interview with Schlosser so perhaps more insight could be found there. Spurlock is a great presenter however because he is just a regular guy who has a great amount of charm and good camera presence. He was entertaining and likable enough to really illicit concern when his health was so obviously starting to become effected. Ironically his girlfriend and now wife is a vegan chef so it was mildly humorous to watch her preparing a detox menu for him using the most apropos vegetables to clean out his system.The aim for most documentaries is to present a thesis and then not only prove it but provide supporting evidence. Though the thesis of Super Size Me was kind of a foregone conclusion Spurlock manages to provide us with supporting evidence that doesn't make the entire film one big Well duh! which is what I kind of expected going into the film. If you have seen or plan to see this movie and are interested in the subject matter I would highly recommend reading Schlosser's Fast Food Nation to gain even more insight on the business of fast food. It's a very interesting read and would make a good companion piece to this documentary. 610 Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "Morgan Spurlock's documentary Super Size Me is an eyeopening look at the world of fast food and the McDonald's company in particular. Through the use of humor and statistics some frightening we discover how the fast food industry has ingrained itself into the American psyche and has contributed to the everincreasing rate of obesity in our nation. The most shocking aspect of this film was seeing the effect this has on our most valuable asset today's children.Until I watched this movie I did not realize how many public schools have allowed commercial fast food restaurants to infiltrate their school lunch programs. When offered fast food for lunch every single day accompanied by the vending machines filled with candy chips and soft drinks America's children are hardpressed to find a piece of fresh fruit or a true vegetable on their lunch trays unless they bring one from home. Parents who send their children to school without a packed lunch need to view this film in order to educate themselves about what their children are REALLY being served at lunchtime. Parents trust that the schools will feed their children well and that trust is being betrayed on a daily basis. What adult would want to eat lunch at the same fast food restaurant every single day? What adult would think that is healthy? Yet that is exactly what we are doing to the children by allowing the commercial restaurants to provide the school lunches.At the same time the children's Physical Education courses and recess  i.e. exercise time  have been dramatically slashed. Some kids get less than 20 minutes away from their desks each day. By contrast when I attended grade school in the 1980's we had P.E. class every day for a full hour plus three recess periods of 20 minutes each less if we misbehaved. That's 2 full hours of exercise time during the school day! And it was a very important 2 hours it was time to burn off our naturally abundant childhood energy to strengthen muscles to forge friendships with children who don't live near us to learn the rules of new sports and games and to build social skills like good sportsmanship teambuilding anger management and leadership. I pity today's grade schooler who gets no time at all outside of the classroom to pursue these allimportant activities. As any parent knows a child needs vitamins minerals fresh air and lots and lots of exercise. Because so many of today's children receive none of these it is no wonder that so many are overweight and prone to illness. Children who grow sluggish and sleepy from their fatladen fast food meals are often labeled lazy by their parents and teachers. Meanwhile other children are anxious and restless for exercise but they are given drugs instead of recess to help them sit still. These children need our help! Thanks Morgan. Your movie is both a wakeup call and a call for action.Kelly Stuart DietFacts.com Webmaster".

	schema:reviewBody "The startling conclusion of this documentary is that if you stuff yourself with nothing but junk food and take no exercise for 30 days you'll get fat and your body chemistry will be so banged up that on paper you'll look more like a flashlight battery than a human being..Spurlock must be an interesting guy. The first time he tries to eat a super sized meal at McDonald's he pukes out of the car window. I thought the air remained tangy throughout the rest of the movie.He drives himself and his crew around the country seeming to enjoy being on camera winking and smirking at it as he eats. But soon enough the diet begins to get to him. He's just not the same energetic guy he used to be. He complains of headaches of a gassy feeling of depression. His girl friend tells us he no longer has the sexual energy he used to have. She has to get on top. It isn't that Spurlock can't have erections anymore. Oh they're there alright  and solid too. But somehow he's just not the same guy he used to be. By this time I was laughing so hard to was a little difficult to follow the on screen spiel.The PR people at McDonald's get a few minutes of screen time trying to explain that people should be free to make choices. They make asses of themselves of course. Kids are shown as limp airheads who gobble down junk foods at school lunches and afterwards can recognize Ronald McDonald but not Jesus.Everything looks pretty bad for McDonald's. But the movie is a fraud to an extent that only its makers can determine. What is a calorie he asks a dozen or more people. Nobody knows. A dozen people who are asked what a calorie is  from prepubescents to mature adults  do not have any idea what a calorie is. He must have asked two thousand people to identify a calorie before finding twelve who were dumb enough to have no idea.There was one talking head that I listened to with real interest a man whose identity I now forget but who was on screen for a minute or two. He observes that smoking was once epidemic and that now smokers are being hectored constantly. How long he wonders before we begin to hector the large people among us? It's a question with some point. It's corollary is Why do we hate people whom we define as weaker than ourselves? Why do some of us enjoy humiliating and punishing others who are defenseless? Why do we buy supermarket tabloids and gloat over pictures of celebrities now grown old or fat? I have a feeling the answer lies deep in human nature and if anyone ever looks into it it will taste worse than prune yogurt. I also found the statistics kind of enlightening. God we collectively put away a lot of sugar and salt! But one of the nutritionists had me puzzled saying the most of the sugar Spurlock had put away was refined implying that this is the worst kind. I'm no nutritionist but I'd thought that all starches  as complex as pasta or as simple as raw sugar  were broken down into monosaccharides in the gut before being absorbed. What I mean is that the body can't tell organic Tupelo honey from a Moon Pie as far as its sugar content is concerned.I may be wrong on this point but it really doesn't matter in context because Spurlock's movie is rather obviously so wrong on so many others. I hope nobody is going to call this an experiment. Let's call it a stunt which is what it is. An engaging one but a trick nonetheless. So Spurlock feels depressed after so many days of McDonald's. You want me to feel depressed? Tell me that I will be applauded by an audience of alfalfa sprout mavens at Sundance make a million dollars and become famous if only I can truthfully say that I feel depressed. I guarantee you that at the end of a few days I'll be on the brink of tears. As insurance I can even manage to dig up a girl friend who will testify that although I have erections with the dimensions of Sequoia trees and the tensile strength of titanium they are somehow I don't know just not the same as they used to be.Sometimes I wish Michael Moore had never made any successful movies.

	onyx:emotionText "The startling conclusion of this documentary is that if you stuff yourself with nothing but junk food and take no exercise for 30 days you'll get fat and your body chemistry will be so banged up that on paper you'll look more like a flashlight battery than a human being..Spurlock must be an interesting guy. The first time he tries to eat a super sized meal at McDonald's he pukes out of the car window. I thought the air remained tangy throughout the rest of the movie.He drives himself and his crew around the country seeming to enjoy being on camera winking and smirking at it as he eats. But soon enough the diet begins to get to him. He's just not the same energetic guy he used to be. He complains of headaches of a gassy feeling of depression. His girl friend tells us he no longer has the sexual energy he used to have. She has to get on top. It isn't that Spurlock can't have erections anymore. Oh they're there alright  and solid too. But somehow he's just not the same guy he used to be. By this time I was laughing so hard to was a little difficult to follow the on screen spiel.The PR people at McDonald's get a few minutes of screen time trying to explain that people should be free to make choices. They make asses of themselves of course. Kids are shown as limp airheads who gobble down junk foods at school lunches and afterwards can recognize Ronald McDonald but not Jesus.Everything looks pretty bad for McDonald's. But the movie is a fraud to an extent that only its makers can determine. What is a calorie he asks a dozen or more people. Nobody knows. A dozen people who are asked what a calorie is  from prepubescents to mature adults  do not have any idea what a calorie is. He must have asked two thousand people to identify a calorie before finding twelve who were dumb enough to have no idea.There was one talking head that I listened to with real interest a man whose identity I now forget but who was on screen for a minute or two. He observes that smoking was once epidemic and that now smokers are being hectored constantly. How long he wonders before we begin to hector the large people among us? It's a question with some point. It's corollary is Why do we hate people whom we define as weaker than ourselves? Why do some of us enjoy humiliating and punishing others who are defenseless? Why do we buy supermarket tabloids and gloat over pictures of celebrities now grown old or fat? I have a feeling the answer lies deep in human nature and if anyone ever looks into it it will taste worse than prune yogurt. I also found the statistics kind of enlightening.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a landmark documentary I think every American should see Supersize me is an incredible chronicle of fast food and junk food in general in America. Morgan Spurlock is the documentation who is behind all of this. I knew McDonalds was bad for you but I did not realize this bad but aside from the McDonalds aspect of the film there is a lot of good information in here on how ingrained unhealthy food is in this country the film is quite incredible. I knew that lobbyists and the like controlled much of the law making process. But I never knew how ingrained they were. The film is centered around an experiment by Morgan Spurlock. What he did was spend a month doing no exercising and eat McDonalds for the entire month. The rule he had was he has to eat everything on the menu and every time he was asked if he wanted it supersized he had to say yes. He enlisted the help of a number of different doctors to look at his progress. Also in the film are various facts about the food industry in America and various interviews ranging from health food advocates to lobbyists for various restaurants and stores. Not only is the documentary very informative it is well produced. And in a time when obesity is an increasing crisis this movie is so important it shows the problems that are out there and how it sadly seems like these restaurants and stores want us to get fat and sadly after watching this movie you have to wonder if that's the case. A lot of people that are critical of this movie say that it is inaccurate. I disagree. I know a lot of people that are or were like him I was. There was a time when I did little or no exercise and I ate a lot of fast or unhealthy food food that was from McDonalds or other bad food. A lot of America is like this and this is a problem that needs to be corrected. There are stories in this film about people that were like him too. There are other facts about fast food that I can identify with but I will not give it away as I do not want to spoil the film for anyone. Also a lot of people say why is it that he did not cover Taco Bell Burger King and other similar fast food restaurants. He said in later interviews that all fast food is as unhealthy as McDonalds. The reason it is so critical of McDonalds is because it is the largest and most recognizable fast food chain in the world. And in America the food is the most unhealthy compared to food served in other McDonalds restaurants around the world and I know this from experience as well haven eaten at McDonalds' in Germany and what can I say? The food was actually good! What a surprise. McDonalds has by far the largest profit of any fast food chain so the largest fast food company is definitely the most important. Even if you disagree with what the movie is trying to say it is an interesting movie to watch.".

Do you think that in Europe there aren't any McDonald's? Boy you're wrong there are so many of them that this way of eating is presented as the easiest. McDonald's is like a plague to a modern man. And not only McDonald. I was surprised when I heard so many names of this stores in America  like Burger King and all those others. I personally don't eat this junk food and I was in McDonald's eating for maybe three times in my life. How many Americans can say that? Do they even count?I don't blame those people for going on those places because todays way of living is fast and you have to adopt but what I don't understand is why people are going there when they aren't on work? And also these people take their children there and then when they are all fat they say that this is natural. What is natural in not taking care of yourself? It is time for all people around the world to open their eyes because tomorrow it could be too late and that is the purpose of this movie. Morgan Spurlock is brilliant and this movie should be watched by every man who feeds himself in unhealthy way.

If we do away with fast foods entirely which won't happen. people will still get obese  unhealthy by going to the supermarket! I think this problem got it's roots in 1954 when McDonald's started out.

	schema:reviewBody "Help! Help! The mean old corporations are stuffing me full of food! Save me government! Save me from myself!  That's the message of this movie so it's sure to be a big hit with the fascist proponents of socialism that run amok at events like Sundance. No wonder it was such a hit Will this flick be anything more than a joke to clear thinking individuals? Doubtful!The events of this movie seem highly suspicious. He claims to have gained 25 pounds in 30 days. To those who are not informed the human body must have a surplus of 3500 calories to gain a pound of fat. This means he must have had a surplus of over 2900 calories per day. According to the McDonald's website a Big Mac  the universal yardstick of unhealthful food  contains 600 calories. To get that surplus you'd have to eat 4.8 extra Big Macs! Remember this is a SURPLUS it means you have to eat that in addition to the normal amount of calories you'd have to eat in a day which would likely be somewhere between 22002500 for him! This means the guy's daily caloric intake would have to be over 5000 calories a day! The movie doesn't give the impression that his goal was to consume as much food as possible in 30 days. Instead his goal is show how McDonald's used some sort of mind control to force him to eat what he did. When asked if he wanted it Supersized he was a victim and had absolutely no power to say no. He wants to show how easily others can fall into this evil corporate trap! I hate to say it but this seems to be a film on par with a Micheal Moore ahem documentary where inconvenient facts are ignored and convenient ones are fabricated on the fly. Gullible people who buy into his conclusion will not care about little details like facts but anyone with an open mind will probably enjoy the ride like a B horror movie and feel smugly superior to those who actually bought it.I'll save you a few bucks and explain why Americans have a problem with obesity. Unlike other cultures we have quick access to great tasting cheap food Kidney Pie? Not here!. The American economy is the most modern in the world meaning we've outsourced laborintense tasks to machines. From cubicles to robotics in factories to remote controls our modern life has reduced the amount of physical work we need to do. Healthful and far cheaper foods are still plentiful but millions do not have the willpower to forsake short term convenience for their long term health so when combined with a lifestyle that requires less physical output we gain weight.Duh  not a difficult concept! Those who choose to be fit can still do so and those who choose short term gratification will become a pile of lard.BTW if society ever degenerates to the point where people can successfully sue food corporations for their own dumb choices will that mean corporations in the fitness industry will be able to sue their customers for their successes? Think about it if you acquire great health from Gold's Gym shouldn't Gold's have a right to some of the wealth you will accumulate because of your improved health? You'll live longer meaning you can work longer and you'll need less of that expensive health care! Surely if a corporation can be at fault for making you obese then a corporation can be at fault for making you healthy! If they are going to be financially responsible for obesity then they should gain from giving people health! Of course that will never happen because this obesity nonsense if rooted in the anticapitalist movement.

	onyx:emotionText "Help! Help! The mean old corporations are stuffing me full of food! Save me government! Save me from myself!  That's the message of this movie so it's sure to be a big hit with the fascist proponents of socialism that run amok at events like Sundance. No wonder it was such a hit Will this flick be anything more than a joke to clear thinking individuals? Doubtful!The events of this movie seem highly suspicious. He claims to have gained 25 pounds in 30 days. To those who are not informed the human body must have a surplus of 3500 calories to gain a pound of fat. This means he must have had a surplus of over 2900 calories per day. According to the McDonald's website a Big Mac  the universal yardstick of unhealthful food  contains 600 calories. To get that surplus you'd have to eat 4.8 extra Big Macs! Remember this is a SURPLUS it means you have to eat that in addition to the normal amount of calories you'd have to eat in a day which would likely be somewhere between 22002500 for him! This means the guy's daily caloric intake would have to be over 5000 calories a day! The movie doesn't give the impression that his goal was to consume as much food as possible in 30 days. Instead his goal is show how McDonald's used some sort of mind control to force him to eat what he did. When asked if he wanted it Supersized he was a victim and had absolutely no power to say no. He wants to show how easily others can fall into this evil corporate trap! I hate to say it but this seems to be a film on par with a Micheal Moore ahem documentary where inconvenient facts are ignored and convenient ones are fabricated on the fly. Gullible people who buy into his conclusion will not care about little details like facts but anyone with an open mind will probably enjoy the ride like a B horror movie and feel smugly superior to those who actually bought it.I'll save you a few bucks and explain why Americans have a problem with obesity. Unlike other cultures we have quick access to great tasting cheap food Kidney Pie? Not here!. The American economy is the most modern in the world meaning we've outsourced laborintense tasks to machines. From cubicles to robotics in factories to remote controls our modern life has reduced the amount of physical work we need to do. Healthful and far cheaper foods are still plentiful but millions do not have the willpower to forsake short term convenience for their long term health so when combined with a lifestyle that requires less physical output we gain weight.Duh  not a difficult concept!

	schema:reviewBody "The latest statistics say that two out of every three Americans are overweight and about one out of every three of those persons overweight is obese. Morgan Spurlock an MTV alumnus decides to eat three meals a day at McDonald's for thirty days to see how it will affect him. He must eat every item on the menu at least once during the thirty days and he must super size anything he orders when suggested to by employees. A lot of people are criticizing Spurlock for setting up a situation where the predetermined outcome is maximized by his decidedly biased decisions. He doesn't exercise and he limits his incidental walking to a mile per day. This may be partially true but Spurlock wisely chooses a humorous approach to his topic because the reality is few people really want to discuss or listen to how overweight they are and why.Taking a more serious preachy tone would wear down audience interest quickly. Besides the film isn't just about what happens to Spurlock after eating at McDonald's for thirty days the results of which far exceed his three medical consultants' worst expectations. The film also attacks corporate America in general in the way it tailors its advertising to influence the most vulnerable Americans children. From kids that know Ronald McDonald better than Jesus and George Washington to school lunch programs that mercilessly serve junk food to the nation's children Spurlock illustrates how we are our own worst enemies. As in any good documentary type film there are always incidental moments that reveal more truth about its subjects than the filmmaker could script. One such moment is a conversation with an obese fourteen year old girl and the Subway advertisement guy. In between each humorous episode or interview Spurlock serves us some facts and statistics about our love affair with and ignorance about fast food in small portions along with a side order of humor. He doesn't let us off the hook as he repeatedly demonstrates that personal responsibility must play a role in our lives when it comes to nutrition just like it does in anything else we do. Spurlock stops short of a Michael Moore in your face approach and is successful on his own terms in persuading the audience to take heed about fast food without being heavyhanded. McDonald's scaled back its super size menu shortly after the film's release although corporate bigwigs claimed it had nothing to do with this film.  of 4 stars.".

	schema:headline " Much Better Than I Was Expecting";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard that Beautiful Creatures the novel was going to be adapted into a movie I was hesitant to see it due to the fact that the trailers were absolutely horrible. I'm just glad that the movie focused on a lot more than a supernatural romance because that's only one of many interesting and complicated plot lines. Despite the fact that the LA Times and the NY Times gave the flick great reviews a bunch of lesserknown critics were much harsher on it. After reading some of these reviews I was shocked to see how biased and silly some of the comments were. It was clear that these were people that walked in to the theater expecting Twilight and were too selfconscious about praising a teen movie to say that it wasn't. Twilight is all about the romance. Beautiful Creatures has a big Romeo and Juliet thing going on but at the same time there's mysteries prophesies hypocrisy Southern politics Civil War history religion death evil forces and all sorts of madness making for quite an interesting story with some very witty and sarcastic dialogue to put a cherry on top. Other people that read the book were likewise upset because they thought it strayed too much from the source material. The only MAJOR change made was about 34 of the way through the movie and the end result was still the same as the book. The reason why the writer did this was for the sake of TIME. If he hadn't made that change the movie would have dragged on for three hours as oppose to rapping itself up nicely at two.I thought the acting was good as well and Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert had nice chemistry as Ethan and Lena. Of course Jeremy Irons Emma Thompson and Viola Davis gave great performances but that comes as no surprise. Emmy Rossum as the wicked siren Ridley was fabulous and Thomas Mann was hilarious as Link. I especially loved Thompson's twisted charactershe played a crazy Republican fundamentalist named Mrs. Lincoln who gets possessed by Sarafine Duchannes the most powerful Dark Caster alive. As Sarafine her performance was definitely Dark bridging on psychotic. Not what I was expecting but I liked it. However I thought some of the other actors like the girls that played the Barbie cheerleaders were horrible. There is a way to portray phony people and there is a way to pull off a satire while still keeping it believable. Besides plot and acting I loved the costumes and set. They were very beautifully done and really captured the gorgeous yet creepy atmosphere of the story. In addition the effects were coolnothing to die over but they served their purpose. Lastly I thought the soundtrack was awesome and very different. The mix of classical blues country and alternative music worked great with the film.Overall I think the movie is an 8 out of 10. It's not amazing but it is entertaining interesting and something I recommend seeing.".

	onyx:emotionText "When I first heard that Beautiful Creatures the novel was going to be adapted into a movie I was hesitant to see it due to the fact that the trailers were absolutely horrible. I'm just glad that the movie focused on a lot more than a supernatural romance because that's only one of many interesting and complicated plot lines. Despite the fact that the LA Times and the NY Times gave the flick great reviews a bunch of lesserknown critics were much harsher on it. After reading some of these reviews I was shocked to see how biased and silly some of the comments were. It was clear that these were people that walked in to the theater expecting Twilight and were too selfconscious about praising a teen movie to say that it wasn't. Twilight is all about the romance. Beautiful Creatures has a big Romeo and Juliet thing going on but at the same time there's mysteries prophesies hypocrisy Southern politics Civil War history religion death evil forces and all sorts of madness making for quite an interesting story with some very witty and sarcastic dialogue to put a cherry on top. Other people that read the book were likewise upset because they thought it strayed too much from the source material. The only MAJOR change made was about 34 of the way through the movie and the end result was still the same as the book. The reason why the writer did this was for the sake of TIME. If he hadn't made that change the movie would have dragged on for three hours as oppose to rapping itself up nicely at two.I thought the acting was good as well and Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert had nice chemistry as Ethan and Lena. Of course Jeremy Irons Emma Thompson and Viola Davis gave great performances but that comes as no surprise. Emmy Rossum as the wicked siren Ridley was fabulous and Thomas Mann was hilarious as Link. I especially loved Thompson's twisted charactershe played a crazy Republican fundamentalist named Mrs. Lincoln who gets possessed by Sarafine Duchannes the most powerful Dark Caster alive. As Sarafine her performance was definitely Dark bridging on psychotic. Not what I was expecting but I liked it. However I thought some of the other actors like the girls that played the Barbie cheerleaders were horrible. There is a way to portray phony people and there is a way to pull off a satire while still keeping it believable. Besides plot and acting I loved the costumes and set.

It took me to a place that I had never thought about and I will say that that is something when there are so many movies out these days. For those who give it crap for not being like the book I do have to say that look at most any book to movie series i.e Harry PotterTwilightHunger Games there are things that have to be left out or reworked in order for a movie to go through it will never be EXACTLY the same.

	schema:reviewBody "The word on the street is that this is the expected successor after the conclusion of the Twilight film franchise having some parallels in its tale that deals with the supernatural and love between a being of higher power and that of an ordinary human except for the reversal of genders and set in a schooling environment of an idyllic small town where people know just about everyone else. It's also based on a successful series of novels by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl so it's everyone's bet just how this first installment would perform that would determine its future as a potential film franchise where many other potentials have fallen after its initial start  The Dark is Rising The Golden Compass and I am Number Four to name but a few in this genre.Beautiful Creatures starts off rather beautifully with awesome visuals that would set to engage and create that visual feast for the eyes crafting a mystery from the onset in the dreams of protagonist Ethan Wate Alden Ehrenreich who see an ominous sequence of events only to not see who that raven haired female is due to a deliberate obscuring by her long tresses. But soon enough the latest stranger in town happens to be Lena Duchannes Alice Englert who brings forth with her immense powers conveniently unleashed against those who taunt her because of their small town mentality especially that of Ethan's ex Emily Zoey Deutch.But Lena has other problems to worry about and that's due to an internal family feud with different camps set up who want her pledged allegiance being a caster and thought to be one of the most powerful ones yet. On one hand there's Macon Jeremy Irons her uncle who serves as adviser and father figure. But on the other is mom Safarine Emma Thompson and evil cousin Ridley Emmy Rossum who try to turn her all of whom come together for that merry celebration of computer generated imagery that in all honesty are gorgeously rendered making Beautiful Creatures live up to its namesake. It's almost like Star Wars with Safarine dead set in getting Lena turn to the dark side when it's her 16th birthday so that they can rule the universe and galaxy with their powers between mother and daughter. Lofty ambitions but that's what evil folks fantasize about.The romance is something you'd have to get used to though since it forms the bulk of the story here. If you're a fan of Twilight and its treatment of first love between two unlikely beings separated by life then this would be something quite up the same alley with inherent powers that define the abilities of one side of the couple which are used for that effective courtship. There's plenty of cooing between the love birds here as they spend time together like any teenager in love if not researching with Amma Viola Davis who is a seer of the town and an ally in Lena's identity crisis.If I had to give this film its due credit it will be how it set up the hook for that emotional resonance in the final scene. There has to be some personal sacrifice in store for our protagonists in order to cement their relationship although the solution presented here was of a taller order that called for some twists during the big magical battle set against the recreation of the Civil War's Battle of Honey Hill. It was in fact the final few minutes that became the movie's saving grace and lifted it from mediocrity providing it that bit of a heart beat and soul that primed itself for subsequent episodes in the series.".

The effects were pretty amazing and I have nothing to complain about on the acting. But the only thing that bothers me is that people keep calling this Twilight. For one Twilight has poor acting and a stupid story line. I read the books before the movies and they were only okay. This has a fantastic story line and it is more... realistic i guess. Yes it has magic and what not but he likes her because of her! Not because he just cant stay away from her. The movie does have a lot of romance but it's more believable that they really care for each other. It is an insult comparing this amazing book and pretty good movie to Twilight. Yes if you like Twilight you should like this too just because Twilight was made into a movie first does not mean that this should be compared to it. It is not a Twilight copy. Especially if you read the book it is for a much more mature mind.".

Another frequent complaint seems to be that there is not enough in the magicspecial effects department True but the relative sparseness here adds a necessary realism and highlights what spectactics the film does have. The townspeople of Gatlin South Carolina are stereotypical Biblethumping yokelrubes but that serves its purpose in the way it contrasts Lena Englert who is just about the only character who does not speak in a deepsouthern accent. It also helps in how Ethan Ehrenreich and his buddy Link Thomas Mann completely defy their hickish appearances. BEAUTIFUL CREATURES captures the whole Southern Gothic tradition quite well. One way or another the relationships in this film are very real. BEAUTIFUL CREATURES also walks the thin horrorcomedy line most admirably.On the dimmer end of things the whole texture of the film is a little slow and murky and it would probably have been a little better with a few minutes cut here and there.".

Something along the lines of 'Twilight' this assumption was Incorrect. And I was pleasantly surprised and pleased this wasn't another case of sparkling vampires or something similar. For all those who haven't seen this movie and believe it's the same thing as Twilight this alone being the reason you're not going to see it you'd be wrong like I was at the start I recommend getting a bunch of friends and seeing it on a weekend . Where Twilight was just a pure romantic love story for fanged freaks 'Beautiful Creatures' is a contemporary version of 'Romeo and Juliet' that explores the humanity of an unknown supernatural world of powers preferably known as 'Casters' that's what they call themselves.When I came out of the cinema I was smiling I would even go as far as saying I was 'Claimed' by it HAHA lame joke. This was an entertaining film all the actors had chemistry together and it was refreshing to see new actors take on a role such as this one effortlessly. The main characters that stood out from the rest would have to of been Jeremy Irons Emma Thompson Alden Ehrenreich Alice Englert Viola Davis and Emmy Rossum. Just the main characters is all I'll mention only three below  Alden plays the role of Ethan Wate the main character we are first introduced to and which the plot of the story follows from his point of view much like the books this is based off. Alden Ehrenreich plays a convincing role as the small town boy who aspires to be different and intelligent planning to leave rather than follow the small minded community members of Gatlin that will undoubtedly stay in the town for the rest of their lives this Southern gentlemanly style of character stays with Ethan and is more so expressed when the new girl arrives at the school Lena Duchanne also known as old man Ravenswood's niece. Alice Englert plays the unknown new girl Lena and we soon realise she isn't what she seems as windows decide to smash inwards all on their own doing along with bizarre weather patterns that involve lightning hitting the same place making the towns folk dust off their bibles and prayin to the good lord for mercy. But this is a romantic and all the commotion has an appealing magnetism for Ethan and so instead of avoiding the 'not so cool girl' that dresses weird and is related to the towns version of the Boogie man Macon Ravenwood Irons he goes and talks to her getting closer to her feelings than her not so normal family would like the idea would be to break them apart and Lena's Uncle Macon Ravenwood is determined to do so and who better to play the role as the intimidating relation but Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons. Irons brings a life time of experience to the set and to see him perform in this type of genre is quite different but effective as he plays Lena's Uncle we see he cares for her deeply and can be instantly branded with being an over protective guardian but who wouldn't be if your nieces sixteenth birthday would decide whether or not you turn to the 'Dark or the Light' also known as the 'Claiming' simply put the Good or the bad to the bone destroy everything in your path Evil what a hurdle to get over right and it's not like anyone wants her to go Dark yeah? Right well there's that to.With a well written script that involves expressing humanity in a supernatural world coupled with wit and humour and just the right amount of special effects this is a fun and entertaining film to see. It wasn't spectacular but it's worth a look. And I hope someone gives the two budding actors Alice  Alden another go because they weren't all that bad.PS If you have read the books and disagree with how the movie panned out don't make it your mission in life to hate it take it for what it is they can't make the same magic that a writer can with a pen but they can get pretty close. I had seen the movie first before I read the book there are some major changes. But I liked the performances of the cast hence the reason for My score below. Acting On all accounts 810 VFX for what there was 610 Costume  Design 810 Book to Film Adaptation 4.510 Genre Supernatural Romance forbidden love did it fit well in the film? 7.510My score 710 Personal opinion I found it more enjoyable than Twilight. Worth a look possibly not a read you will probably be disappointed.".

My friend and I recently read the book in preparation for going to the movie. We adored the book and were excited to see the film. First let me say that I have seen countless movie from book adaptations and granted they all stray. However most of the time there are just a few niggling details that bother me. This movie COMPLETELY lost the charm of the book it was adapted from. Every beautiful moment every lovely detail was eliminated for cheap CGI effects and cloying pitiful attempts at romance.While the performances were solid by some very talented actors I have to wonder why they even accepted the parts??The most glaring problems were the following 1. Amma and Marian fused into one character  WTF? 2. Ethan portrayed as a lovable idiot 3. The HORRIBLE accents used in this movie were incredibly grating  and I am from Mississippi 4. Why did all the inhabitants of Ravenwood look like they just stepped out of a community theater's performance of Alice in Wonderland? 5. Where was BOO RADLEY?!?!? How hard is it to get a dog people!?! 6. Larkin wasn't dark  he was insipid and frankly a useless character 7. Why was the trial at the beginning of the movie and not after the dance and for that matter  why didn't we see the dance? 8. Rosemary and Lemons anyone?! 9. the sixteen moon song 10.Nothing with Ethan's dad  nothing. 11.All of the scenes with the locket visions were pitiful.I could go on and on and on and on...even small things like the movie Ethan is watching when Mrs. Lincoln comes to his house on Halloween were different. How hard is that to get right for goodness sake?!In summary this movie was awful. I tried to just view it as a movie and separate it from the book I had read in my mind but that made it even more insipid. I was literally laughing out loud in parts they were so schmaltzy and ridiculous. MAYBE maybe if you hadn't read the book and were 12 years old and were an idiot maybe then you would enjoy this movie. At least I got to listen to Jeremy Irons talk that was the only redeeming factor.I wanted to address other reviewers comments that even the Harry Potter movies strayed from the books. This is true. However key characters plot lines and story elements were never eliminated as they were in this film. Based on the storyline of this movie the film makers have made it virtually impossible to continue the series. Rant over.".

Later we walked out of the theater and we had a good time. Even though the professional critics on Rotten Tomatoes gave it mixed feelings I thought this is a pretty good film. It's not spectacular though for there are some problems that I do have with the film.The story was OK. It became quite predictable by using some of the same clichs that we've already seen before like in Twilight but it got me interested especially towards the end of this flick. There are some times where the exposition throughout the film is a bit too much for my tastes.Flaws aside this film does have some good qualities. The cinematography is brilliant and the scenery of South Carolina is beautiful to look at. The direction is abovedecent and the music score is surprisingly good. The special effects are pretty good too and the golden eyes effect is the perfect highlight. The dialog is pretty smart and mixes melodrama and campy humor pretty well throughout the film.The best part however would have to go to the cast. Emma Thompson as Serafine sometimes overacts but by golly was she enjoyable Emmy Rossum did a nice job as the foxy Ridley Viola Davis did very good as Amma and Jeremy Irons the famous actor from The Lion King Eragon etc. did a fantastic job as the menacing and edgy Macon Ravenwood. However the best characters would have to go to the two main protagonists. Alden Enrenreich did an amazing job as the charismatic Ethan Wate while Alice Englert is a perfect Lena Duchannes thus making them a much likable duo than Bella and Edward from Twilight.Overall I have yet to read the book it was based on and I understood all the hatred this flick had but despite it's own problems Beautiful Creatures is a pretty good fantasy romance flick that is way better than the Twilight movies and I think would be recommended to those who haven't seen it yet.".

Hollywood scenting a sure buck has begun adapting these with differing rates of success. The template for them all is of course the runaway success of the Twilight films which stuck close to their literary sources and used a cast of pretty and pretty vacant leads leading to the films deserved reputation for boredom and cringe worthy sappiness as well as slow meandering plots that went nowhere very slowly Now that Meyer's cycle has played itself out we're all waiting for the new Twilight in the same way people of a previous generation looked for the new Star Wars Could it be Beautiful Creatures?The novels by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl have been phenomenally successful and earned their own devoted fans. From the comments on this site it appears the film has deviated pretty massively from the book as many adaptations do angering fans in the process but also meaning that the film written and directed by Richard LaGravanese stands and falls as its own original creation and as a standalone film it is actually pretty good!The storyline of course is made of mythopoeic tropes like destiny first love forbidden love the chosen one the call the call rejected the wise counsel the murderingprotecting parent figures etc. It is all transposed to a sleepy town where all American fiction it seems exists in South Carolina a place where the minds are as small as the town and the future is anything but rosy. Of course into such a place must come the outsider in this case our heroine Lena Duchannes Alice Englert who is of an ancient line of witches called Casters who are born with an imprinted character a destiny that will either be for light or dark the world exists on a balance of the two apparently so both are needed The female Casters apparently have no choice in the matter and at moonrise on their 16th birthdays the claiming happens and they become their predetermined type Now how's that for a mythology? Seems Lena may be going the dark way especially given a family curse going back to a Civil War ancestor who committed an Imothepian blasphemy by using a forbidden spell to resurrect a dead Reb' lover but seems there may be a way out of it but with a very high price indeed. Drawn to her is the local intellectual kid but with jock looks Ethan Wate Alde Ehenreich whose love of the edgy works of Miller Burgess Vonnegut and Buchowski unite the two lovers an interesting idea in this sort of milieu as well as contempt for the local prom queen bitches. Also in the mix is her protective Uncle Macon Jeremy Irons who is a Caster too as well as Ethan's dead mother's lover are you getting all this? and guiding her into the light. On the other side is Macon's sister and Lena's mother Sarafine Emma Thompson a very dark witch indeed who knows Lena will be the one to bring balance to the Force oops wrong movie! and wants her to turn evil so she can get Armageddon on the boil aided by Lena's sister Ridley Emily Rossum a sexy man teasing bitch witch. Aiding the light side is the local supernatural record keeper seer and Voodoo high priestess Amma Viola Davis who will guide Lena to the truth. Oh yes and Ethan is the descendant of the dead Reb' lover that cursed Lena's line! How will destiny play out?BC is for such a film quite smart with ideas about fate choice responsibility and sacrifice as well as an appreciation for great literature and the lust for knowledge and growth. As in most modern fantasy movies the age old division of Light and Dark takes on an ideological character with Serafine and Ridley espousing a pessimistically nihilist worldview damning love God virtue et al as feeble fantasies where only power over others really exists. Macon Lena Ethan and Amma of course have faith and respect and a little wisdom too. Serafine interestingly hides as a Bible bashing Christian Rightist her own dark joke about what she perceives as the worst of Human folly while the Human Prom Queen bitches claim Christianity but are the exact opposite of all its virtues and teachingThe direction and writing by LaGravanese are excellent and show he was interested in making a good movie rather than just a successful one. The film is long but plays well and never drags. The main asset the film has is its great cast. Englert and Ehenreich are superb as the young lovers smart sassy and very credible  No Stewart or Pattinson are they! Backing them up are three top drawer actors Irons Thompson and Davis and rather than stunt casting they add real weight and power to the story and they are never short changed by the script but given room to breathe and live. The special effects are pretty dire but they count for little in this story so it won't make too much of a difference. The Southerntinged music by Thenewno2 adds local colour to the proceedings and technically the film is fine apart from SFX.Apparently it has not been a big success and that may damage its sequel chances. As a standalone it is a fine film and has a selfsealing ending of the Ruby SparksNightwatchPrince of Persia kind that hints to more should we wish to go there again one day.".

	schema:reviewBody "so this weekend I went out of my way to catch a movie that interested me a lot from the trailers and the concept. Beautiful Creatures I know at first glance it seems like a wanna be twilight but I actually found it a lot better. I had to drive to another city to a theater I've never been to and see it all by myself in an empty theater and I didn't care. It was that good lol .Both Twilight and Beautiful Creatures are in the same genre of Young Adult stories but both couldn't be more different. From a film level this tops the twilight films. The actors are way better. The two leads in the films were charming and great in their roles. They really made them seem like real people then cardboard cut outs of people like twilight so when the two leads fall in love... it's built honestly and naturally instead of it being unrealistic. Alice Englert was beyond impressive in this role. She natural frail and yet you don't know what lies in her character. It's great seeing the object of affection of the main character being down to earth and yet gorgeous. Alden Ehrenreich as the lead was pretty good I wasn't sure how I was going to like his character because at first he seemed too silly but slowly the film makers made him seem real... someone who was willing to fight for what he knew was right... which was Lena. Not just that but the supporting characters were well rounded solid actors who really gave this film a sense of being a real story instead of a cheesy teen movie. Jeremy Irons is amazing as always. I love how the film flowed through out it's not an original story but I loved the rich history of the story and the world that was in.My issues with the film are small... mainly i wish they film makers would be have let this film breathe a bit and take it's time. They a great story and interesting history... i wanted to see them take the time to actually go deeper into the world and let us enjoy it for bit. At times the film seemed to rushed at points or when something really cool or interesting happens... the film makers don't take the chance to really use it the best it can. Some of the CGI was kind of cheesy and towards the end the story uses a plot element that if they would have gone with completely then I would have hated this film but they didn't and gave me what I wanted for the characters. At that point getting to really enjoy the story and the characters... you can't help but to cheer them on. There's a lot of moments where i thought i knew where the film was going to go and it changed it on me. Personally I don't think i would have done some of those choices as a writer but it worked for this story. It really kept me interested. I didn't think I was going to like this film as much as I did. There was a lot that worked in it's favor and it's sad that not a lot of people turned out to go see it.It's way better then the twilight films and it actually has good acting. I think with a lot bit more time and money... this film would have been even better truth be told there are some moments that are on that edge of being too cheesy but despite that... I completely loved this film and enjoyed it for what it was. A good little story about supernatural powers good vs evil love and the power of love. I know there's a lot of people that will think this film will be as bad as twilight and it isn't... I actually thought it was nice charming film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lead by two really unknown actors the love story is allowed to be told for all it's problems and over the top characters in a universe that feels both new but old If it was not for the cast of actors the film was able to get I never would have watched the film because I just imagined not being able to handle another supernatural romance story. The film tells the story of small town boy Ethan Wate Alden Ehrenreich when he meets Lena Duchannes Alice Englert who seems to change his life with how different she is from the Christ worshiping people of the small town that seem to turn away anybody new. Lurking also in the film is the story of dark magic that may change the faith of these characters for either the good or bad.Making the female counterpart the supernatural character was quite different from past teenage romance stories and made for a more interesting story. The film did not feel like it went on for too long because of how fun the film felt at times to see some of these great British actors doing what I would call horrible southern accents especially in the case of Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson. The production people of the film did not seem to take any care since at times the visual effects and cinematography of the film did look good at all which was a negative to the film. The film was interesting to watch even when I was annoyed having characters to explain everything for people whom have not read the books the film was based on I did not read the books myself but did not need an explanation.Alice Englert might breakout with this film even though the first thing I really remembered her in was when I saw her play Rosa in last year's Ginger and Rosa. I did not like her much in that film but in this film she made more of an impression on me as her performance was both convincing and had a natural feel to it. It's funny that she is the daughter of directorwriter Jane Campion. Alden Ehrenreich played the mortal Ethan and while I was unsure of his performance at the start of the film his performance became better as the film went on. Emmy Rossum only appeared in small scenes playing Ridley Duchannes and she mixed both her flare for comedy and drama and if only she was given more to do she would have stole the movie. Other actors also doing good work in the film and also looking they were having fun was Jeremy Irones playing the same character he always plays Emma Thompson playing both good and bad and Viola Davis doing some good work which involved her sitting in a church once again every movie she makes her character has to sit at the aisle of a church.The film was enjoyable to watch for the actors and an unexpected turn on romance. However watching the film did feel hard at times to see the bad production work on the film that seemed like an afterthought for the people involved.MOVIE GRADE B MVP Alice Englert".

The film tells the story of small town boy Ethan Wate Alden Ehrenreich when he meets Lena Duchannes Alice Englert who seems to change his life with how different she is from the Christ worshiping people of the small town that seem to turn away anybody new. Lurking also in the film is the story of dark magic that may change the faith of these characters for either the good or bad.Making the female counterpart the supernatural character was quite different from past teenage romance stories and made for a more interesting story. The film did not feel like it went on for too long because of how fun the film felt at times to see some of these great British actors doing what I would call horrible southern accents especially in the case of Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson. The production people of the film did not seem to take any care since at times the visual effects and cinematography of the film did look good at all which was a negative to the film. The film was interesting to watch even when I was annoyed having characters to explain everything for people whom have not read the books the film was based on I did not read the books myself but did not need an explanation.Alice Englert might breakout with this film even though the first thing I really remembered her in was when I saw her play Rosa in last year's Ginger and Rosa. I did not like her much in that film but in this film she made more of an impression on me as her performance was both convincing and had a natural feel to it. It's funny that she is the daughter of directorwriter Jane Campion. Alden Ehrenreich played the mortal Ethan and while I was unsure of his performance at the start of the film his performance became better as the film went on. Emmy Rossum only appeared in small scenes playing Ridley Duchannes and she mixed both her flare for comedy and drama and if only she was given more to do she would have stole the movie. Other actors also doing good work in the film and also looking they were having fun was Jeremy Irones playing the same character he always plays Emma Thompson playing both good and bad and Viola Davis doing some good work which involved her sitting in a church once again every movie she makes her character has to sit at the aisle of a church.The film was enjoyable to watch for the actors and an unexpected turn on romance. However watching the film did feel hard at times to see the bad production work on the film that seemed like an afterthought for the people involved.MOVIE GRADE B MVP Alice Englert";

She ends up locked in said barge and sailing down the Seine river with her fraternal captors.If you can get past this highly implausible beginning the movie becomes a little more interesting as it transforms into a relationship movie between the female hostage and the two brothers. There is some very nice scenery of the Seine and of Paris. Also the Manet painting is not the only Blonde with Bare Breasts here or a bare ass or bare. . .um. . . as Giocante turns in one of the typically sex roles she has been doing since she first appeared as a teenager in Marie Bay D'Ange in the late 90's. Giocante is not a top either star in France or outside it her most international film was a small part in the bizarro Vincent Castel Western Blueberry but she's perfectly adequate here as are the two actors who play the brothers.I don't know if people who don't tend to like French movies in general would care much for this but I thought it was OK.".

	schema:reviewBody "I clicked the spoiler button but this will probably not ruin the movie  might help. I have just watched this movie on TV and it is an interesting change from the usual fare. By no means a great movie nevertheless it has specialist interest and a particular feelthough perhaps falling short of what the director was aiming for. As it happens I also just read or reread Mort Rosenblum's Secret Life of the Seine his description of the river its history and the commercial bargees that used to dominate it. Rosenblum was editor of IHT and lives aboard a boat moored in central Paris. It is kind of a heist movie of Manet's painting La Blonde aux Sens Nu now in the Musee d'Orsay family drama romance and bargee's tough life in the modern world. The cinematography is great though it often resembles something out of the 70s which is probably fair verisimilitude for the life of bargees today when their way of life began to fade away. The older Julien twentysomething and younger Louis 14 y brothers live and work aboard their steel barge that is mostly used to transport sand gravel or maybe wheat. Their brute of a father lies dying in hospital refusing to sign over the boat to the elder son. It is a standard 38 metre Freycinet steel barge a peniche named Styx. Because barging is barely viable these days many of these peniches end up as steel scrap or some are converted into luxury private floating homes or hotels. And this movie perhaps incidentally shows you why. The opening scene and the only part set in Paris other than a few minutes at the very end shows the City of Light from an angle most people never see but no less enchanting. Being almost penniless since their father got sick and being unable to do commercial jobs without his signature the older brother hatches a plot to steal the painting almost casually Louis strolls into the museum and walks out with it not as far fetched I suppose given how many famous paintings have been taken this way but is observed by the girl guard Rosalie Vahina Giocante who happens to look like the girl in the painting bien sur who chases him back to the boat where older brother kidnaps her. They make their getawayon the barge at 6 km per hour up the Seine! You can guess where it goes from there.For those of us besotted with the canals of France their wanderings east of Paris on the Marne river and canals is totally authentic and beautiful again in a way most people will not have seen. They stop at an old vinecovered house on the river which itself was subject of a painting by Manet it might be intended to be the Ile d'Amore a legendary bargees hideaway the old crones who live there have copies of Manet's paintings and Rosalie cleverly swaps the fake for the real La Blonde to protect it. As in any heist movie lots of things go wrong Julien gets almost beaten to death by thugs Rosalie saves Louis from other thugs etc but it is all more or less resolvedthough again perhaps not entirely convincingly. Including I believe the issue of inheritance of the boat when the father dies hint French law does not allow parents to disinherit their offspring but revealed is a reason why the father only beat up the older brother but with a twist. Reviewers do not give it a high rating but I PVR'd it and will watch it again as I suspect it will repay on repeat.".

It offers a true warpostwar situation and deals with the people that suffer from it.The story is quite simple and I've found some of his other movies to be more emotional. However it is one of his most serious and violent. I do think Ozu is capable of adding more depth to his movies than what we see here but I was very happy to find a different subject from what he does usually explored in a such disturbing way. Ozu's themes are pretty much the same all over his work but A Hen in the Wind stands out for a different kind of serious issue. It is for that very refreshing.Very serious very sad very human unexpectedly violent and a touching look at a postwar situation it stands out mostly for being different from Ozu's usual themes.".

	schema:headline " Dark exploration of moral decisions in an extreme situation";
	schema:reviewBody "A Hen In the Wind 1948 is quite a dark film and the gloomy mood is emphasised by the shots of postwar Japan with its poverty and slummy areasthe environment in which the events take place. It is this environmental context which focuses the moral ambiguities explored in the film.A crucial conflict is created when a young wife Tokiko Amamiya Kinuyo Tanaka accepts a onceoff job as a prostitute to get the money to save the life of her young son. She finds the experience deeply shaming and the money attained she never returns to the brothel. However when her husband Shuichi Shji Sano returns from the army she confesses to him what she did. The knowledge causes him to fall into a deep depression and generates an unforgiving fury. Later he visits the brothel to see if indeed his wife had worked there on only one occasion and meets a young girl who tells him why she feels forced into the trade. Strangely the husband feels compassion for the girl and even gets her a job to get her out of prostitution.I say strangely because even Shuichi's coworker finds it odd that he can measure the girl by one standard and his wife by another. That he cannot realise that under terrible conditions human fallibility may cause one to do what would normally seem unthinkable. Finally in a rage he causes his wife to fall down a flight of stairsand the shock seems to bring him to his senses. Thus the film does have a final uplifting moment with the reconciliationbut the basic problem is not solved it is only resolved in this specific context.The wife may seem rather like a doormat to a modern audience but remember that the position of women in prewar Japan was not particularly liberated. Given that I think that Kinuyo Tanaka creates a gentle and realistic character. It seems that Ozu did not particularly like this film and considered it a failureperhaps owing to the melodramatic plot and the difficulty of creating a convincing character for the husband who seems incapable of seeing the moral contradiction in his attitudes. Personally I liked A Hen In the Wind because it did honestly engage with the problems with making a moral decision in an extreme situation and the need for selfawareness honesty and charity.".

Characters crawl slither and slide about. Sometimes visually oversized bare feet stick into the foreground. Kinuyo Tanaka loses all self possession at the climax and practically keens her dialog  at a much higher pitch than I've ever heard her use in any other film.This is an interesting story that deals with the collateral damage caused by WW2 and the ensuing occupation  as it affected the lives of one young married couple.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the most serious and sad of all Ozu's films I have seen. The plot is simple the wife named Tokiko played by meek and moving Kinuyo Tanaka tries hard to survive in the postwar Japan with her little son while her beloved husband is still absent. One bad day her son gets seriously ill and Tokiko has to sell her body just once to pay for his medical treatment. When her husband finally returns and finds out what's happened in fact she told him herself being too honest to keep that shameful secret he's not inclined to forgive her and gives her very hard time scolding her and even beating her while she is as meek and obedient as she always has been. The reconciliation happens only when he almost kills Tokiko unintentionally of course and being shocked for a very brief moment he understands that he'd better forgive his wife in the name of the happier future.There are some crucial moral dilemmas showing the total lack of compassion and respect to women in those days. 1. Was Tokiko really that guilty? For a modern point of view even Japanese the wife has done nothing wrong. Survival at all costs is a respected thing today not like in old Japan where men and women easily killed themselves to avoid dishonor that was considered much worse than death. In this movie Tokiko mentions the suicidal thoughts too. But being eager to see her husband again she continues living  for him and for their child. She doesn't care for her own survival but she's ready to sacrifice herself for her child. No one around her seems to be able to understand it neither her best friend nor her husband.2. What's the right of Tokiko's husband to blame her? As much as we can see the husband does nothing for Tokiko and the boy  he does not send any money to her probably thinking she is a magician able to make money out of nothing or turn things to gold by a single touch. When she tells him how did she get money to pay to the doctor another totally immoral thing considered pretty normal by those people is the need to pay for the treatment of a little ailing child  no cash no help who cares if this child will not survive he seems to be pretty surprised she could not just borrow the money from someone. Well she did it before. And she has already sold her clothes and any valuables she could sell except her sewing machine she needed to continue working. If her husband wouldn't come that day probably she'd have to go to the brothel again or just die. Simply as that.3. Is it normal to make the weak suffer even more?! When after the climactic quarrel the husband lashes Tokiko away making her fall the stairs barely escaping death or serious injury he seems to be shocked for a while probably realizing he'll go to the jail if she dies  but what does he say or do when realized she's alive and able to move? He just lets her to climb painfully up the stairs back to the room while he's just sitting there in a corner with a sulky face ready to say some lofty words about trust and understanding they need to keep in their family. Why the hell didn't he help her up the stairs? Why didn't he run to her headlong begging for forgiveness? But here we have only one character to beg and plead and this is certainly not the husband. Because of his wife treason he believes he is suffering his friend believes it too even Tokiko's friend the one that blamed her harshly for selling herself and then for revealing it to the husband believes the husband not the wife is the sufferer here. Even Tokiko herself thinks the same way. But isn't she suffering way more than her man? Ozu is deeply sympathetic to Tokiko but neither husband nor friends look enough compassionate to her case... That makes the viewer feel very sad for her and for the same fate many real women suffered in real life. Times have changed a lot and happily in the most civilized countries women are considered to be equal to men but watching the old movies regarding the sad fate of meek and submissive female characters oppressed by men we have to remember as it was before to never let anything like that happen here again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gaam Yuk Fung WanPrison on Fire1987 is the second film in the On Fire Trilogyexcluding Prison on Fire 2.  The first film City on Fire1987 dealt with a man who's trapped between duty with the police and loyality with the triad gang he's working undercover with.  Prison on Fire1987 is about a man sent to prison for manslaughter who slowly learns how to survive in prison with the help of a fellow inmate.  A harrowing look into the prison system of Hong Kong.  Makes Midnight Express1977 look like a pleasent experience.  Like City on Fire this film shows a world of brutality where only the strongest and toughest survive.  Chow Yun Fat is brilliant as the prisoner Ching who takes the new guy under his wing.The role of the new guy was originally offered to Danny Lee who turned the role down.  Tony Leung Ka Fai was given the role of Lo Ka Yiu and did a wonderful job.  The actor gives a sense of naive honesty in his performance. Lo Ka Yiu gets in trouble when he accuses one of the prisoners of stealing sissors.  This put him under the wrath of the prisoner in glasses who sets him up as a rat.  Roy Cheung is sadistic and dislikable as Officer Scarface Hung.  His best roles are when he plays dislikable and dispictable characters like the arrogant Police officer in City on Fire1987 or the Triad punk in School on Fire1988.Ringo Lam deals with many issues involving the prison system in Hong Kong. excellently scripted from the writer of Xia Dao Gao FeiFull Contact1987. Emotional involving film with an realistic fight scene during the climax. One thing I would like to know is the name of the song that's playing on the radio during the New Year Celebration.  Officer Scarface Hung gets what was coming to him when Ching becomes deranged.  One of the best acting by Chow Yun Fat comes in the climax when he goes insane.  He plays this scene with an emotional wildness that hasn't been seen from him since.".

Often I'd be bored watching old films which I had thought the world of. But this movie still amazes and excites me after so many years.I am sure the more violent scenes were cut from the version I watched because I vaguely remember moments that were a lot more shocking. But I would't classify it as a violent movie because there was a lot of meaning to it. If I as an elementary school child could take it it shouldn't be any more gruesome than The Ring 2.Simply watching Chow Yun Fatt was a treat in itself. His acting was intriguing and absolutely intense. Never did a moment pass that he wasn't giving in his best. The smiles and the stares the jokes and the scorn the singing and the scolding... and who would forget his orange with 3 cigarettes? No kid from a chinesespeaking family doesn't remember this classic arrangement.Tony Leung another great actor could be seen shining in his own right. Although much of the glamour belonged to Chow Yun Fatt Tony Leung's performance in the suicide scene and the sheer ignorance in his eyes as he incurred the wrath of just about everyone were truly commendable. He was the stupid little lamb in the film.Watch this film and you'd find Anna and the King and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon terrible jokes. I still can't believe Chow Yun Fatt starred in these 2 films. From an Asian's point of view his recent Hollywood films were disappointing. His roles in these new films were a far cry from his memorable performances in The Story of Ah Lang A Better Tomorrow and this film. Special effects can't be everything in a movie. Realism is more important.And don't walk away without learning how to sing the prisoners' favourite song! Yian sum yu sei shueang yao do siu...".

	schema:headline " Intense convincing and gritty  all the things that can be expected from Ringo Lam";
	schema:reviewBody "Hong Kong film maker Ringo Lam has done many extraordinary films during his career. They include the extremely bleak and violent School on Fire 1988 City on Fire 1987 the incredible Full Contact 1992 and Prison on Fire 1 and 2 from 1987 and 1991. Prison on Fire stars the then raising star Chow YunFat as Ching a positive and friendly inmate in a prison in which Lo Ka Yiu played by Tony Leung Ka Fai is sentenced. They are both judged for a manslaughter and now they'll have to survive the violence and triad corruption inside the stone. What follows is a very intense 100 minutes and a film that won't be remembered among the least effective works of the great Lam.The film is pretty close to School on Fire even though it is not as fierce and pessimistic as that film which was made one year later. Prison is pretty powerful and believable depiction of the state of prisons in Hong Kong and how much power the triad members have there. Where School depicts the horrible violence among school children and triads Prison depicts violence and terror among convicts and triads and how it all may end as horribly as in School. But this time Ringo leaves a hope for a better tomorrow as Chow's character even mentions at one point and so the film is much more optimistic than the harrowing School. Still the finale in the prison is very violent and shocking so the ride through the prison won't be an easy or pleasant one at all and why would Ringo do such a pointless and light film that wouldn't have its message and anything to say in the first place? That is exactly why his films are much more than just action and gun battles.The cast is very good in Prison and it includes Roy Cheung as the violent warden Scarface and Roy can also be found as a triad leader in School and a cop in City on Fire. The characters especially Chow's and Tony's seem to develop little too fast as their dramatic decisions and actions are not as carefully explained and introduced as possible. I mean the scenes like the suicide attempt and the angry and almost comical face expression Chow gives to Scarface at one point they show that these men really can act and they can but these kind of actions should be little more restrained and explained but still Chow's character is here much better than in City on Fire which suffers a lot from the weak character of Chow's.The ending in Prison is near the rage and mayhem of School and I felt really bad during the finale so once again Ringo has shown his unique talent and power of his cinema. Chow turns into the kind of wild animal that is hiding inside every one of us and that just should be kept there forever no matter what the situation is. That kind of finale is very powerful and leaves the audience pretty stunned and often in pure disgust as in the case of School. Overall the violence in Prison is very strong and hurts almost as much the viewer as it does the characters and that is the only way to depict this horrible thing honestly and in a way that something important can be achieved and told by the film. I'm afraid the present day Hollywood wouldn't dare to do films like this but fortunately there are alternatives and people who want to make films not just because of money.Prison is composed by Lowell Lo who has also made the soundtrack for films like Naked Killer Clarence Fok 1992 The Killer John Woo 1989 and Ringo's School on Fire but the usage of music is never as near as strong in Prison as it is in School and that is also among the elements that make School such a strong experience. Prison has also some very atmospheric photography inside the prison and there are some nice neon lights and almost mysterious lights coming through the windows at some points. There's also some very bright photography in the interiors and that creates almost a dream like feel to the film and also depicts the state of mind of the inmates and how things vary from pure danger and alarm to peace and quiet inside the prison.Prison is among the reasons why Hong Kong cinema is so powerful and unique and it is also among the reasons that make Ringo among the most talented directors in the field. His real masterpiece was still to come Full Contact but still Prison is among the most noteworthy achievements of his. 810".

	schema:headline " Slowburns to a devastating climax";
	schema:reviewBody "This Chinese prison drama is a film that just gets better as it goes along. It starts off on the usual ground with a green inmate unfairly sent to jail and before long all the prison movie clichs are coming out the ruthlessly corrupt guards the rival prison factions and the tough gang bosses and inevitable riots. So far so typical. But then the film pulls an ace from its sleeve with the presence of Chow YunFat pretty much playing the opposite of his John Woo tough cop character as a friendly humorous fellow prisoner who befriends the lead and helps him find his way around.Chow YunFat is excellent in this film. I don't want to spoil the plot too much but his character undergoes a gradual transformation as he becomes involved in the violent politics of prison life and come the climax he's giving an unforgettable showstopping turn as an ordinary guy pushed to the limitand beyond. Bestial inhuman and altogether frightening this is Chow YunFat like you've never seen him before.The Chinese star isn't the only good thing about PRISON ON FIRE. Ringo Lam an underrated director more than holds his own against John Woo. This film is the definition of the word slowburning gradually building up to one of the most unforgettably violent endings of the era. The fact that it takes a long time to get to that stage just makes it all the more effective. What's interesting is that the chief villain in this  officer Scarface played by Roy Cheung  is far more of a subtle presence than usual for this genre. Instead of making the lives of his prisoners a misery with punishment and violence he actually seems like an all right type of guy before you realise his talent for backstabbing and betraying turning one against the other.The other cast members are particularly good here Tony Leung DUMPLINGS convinces as the mildmannered convict not cut out for prison life and Sammo Hung lookalike KaKui Ho is fine as the gang leader you don't want to fall foul of kudos to the filmmakers for making him an ordinary guy slightly overweight and wearing glasses instead of the usual bodybuilder type. Kwong Leung Wong also shines as gang leader Billy a man who initially appears to be yet another villain but soon becomes a key ally. PRISON ON FIRE is a delightful movie that more than holds its own against later prison flick ISLAND ON FIRE.".

	schema:reviewBody "...and soon enough like any situation where the pressure does nothing but build it'll explode.Chow YunFat plays Chung Tin Ching a prisoner on a manslaughter charge who befriends a harmless naive twig of a man named Yiu also on a manslaughter term. At first he's a nuisance but as he sees just how useless Yiu is in his situation he can't help but step in when Yiu's blunders aggravates the wrong people. Friendship blossoms and then the two of them must fend for themselves and each other against the cruel warden Officer Hung and Hung's obnoxious rat. The situation intensifies... it escalates... and when it finally explodes it is intense emotional and effective.I've seen six of Ringo Lam's films now the other four being Prison on Fire II right after I saw this one City on Fire Full Contact and two of his Van Damme vehicles and Prison on Fire is definitely the secondbest film I've seen from him so far. It's nothing original and the villains are a little cartoonish at times but for the most part it's a great movie and definitely among the best of Chow and Lam.".

	onyx:emotionText "...and soon enough like any situation where the pressure does nothing but build it'll explode.Chow YunFat plays Chung Tin Ching a prisoner on a manslaughter charge who befriends a harmless naive twig of a man named Yiu also on a manslaughter term. At first he's a nuisance but as he sees just how useless Yiu is in his situation he can't help but step in when Yiu's blunders aggravates the wrong people. Friendship blossoms and then the two of them must fend for themselves and each other against the cruel warden Officer Hung and Hung's obnoxious rat. The situation intensifies... it escalates... and when it finally explodes it is intense emotional and effective.I've seen six of Ringo Lam's films now the other four being Prison on Fire II right after I saw this one City on Fire Full Contact and two of his Van Damme vehicles and Prison on Fire is definitely the secondbest film I've seen from him so far. It's nothing original and the villains are a little cartoonish at times but for the most part it's a great movie and definitely among the best of Chow and Lam.";

Early on Yiu gets on the wrong side of Mickey one of the 'bosses' amongst the inmates. With the help of sadistic prison officer Hung AKA Scarface Mickey makes other inmates believe Yiu is an informant which puts him in danger. Over the course of the film they endure occasional brutal violence frequent sense of threat and the inevitable boredom. Yiu must also deal with the fact that his girlfriend is studying in England.This is not a plot heavy film it is more a slice of Hong Kong prison life shown through the experiences of Yiu Tony Leung Kafai does a fine job making us believe in this ordinary man caught in a frightening situation. Chow Yunfat stands out as he does a great job as Ching a likable character who for the most part tries to avoid the inevitable conflicts. The rest of the cast are pretty good to notably Roy Cheung who is genuinely menacing as the sadistic 'Scarface'. There isn't a huge amount of violence but what there is is fairly brutal. The fights aren't stylish martial arts extravaganzas but are scrappy with a sense that the characters are really hurting. There is also a sense of threat I was unsure if both of our protagonists might not survive to the end. It isn't entirely grim though there are quite a few humorous moments spread through the film. Over all I'd recommend this to fans of prison dramas just don't expect the full on action so many Hong Kong films contain.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are lots of prison movies around Tango and Cash Lockup and Shawshank Redemption. Prison on Fire probably comes much closer to Lockup than the others as in these two movies the people in prison are guilty for their crimes. Prison on Fire was released before Lockup and has a look at the three year sentence of a man in a Hong Kong gaol.The man which the film centres around is not a hardened criminal he just was protecting his father when a group of thugs tried to steal food from his store. The thugs beat up his father and he ran then down and kicked one in front of a bus. The charge was involuntary manslaughter.Prison on Fire looks at the politics that goes on in a Hong Kong gaol and is much more colourful than an American film. The gangs that operate on the street operate in the gaol as well and if you are not part of a gang then you are likely to be used as a scapegoat. As is expected for a gaol there is a lot of violence and fighting between the gangs and the man who is not involved gets caught up in the power struggle as a scapegoat. He is not a fighter and thus is lucky that Ching ChowYunFat who is also neutral helps him out.The movie focuses on this man and the struggles that he faces in gaol. His relationship with his girlfriend is examined as she struggles to wait for him to be released. He also faces potentially loosing her as she moves to England to study and it seems like she is going to run off with her tutor. There is also the struggle with the prison guards as they use him to extract information from the gang bosses.There is a bad guy in this movie and that is a Triad boss named Marcus. Marcus is at war with another gang and this gang uses the man to get Marcus into trouble. Ching and the Man attempt to reconcile themselves with Marcus and even though they have proved that Marcus is not strong he does not want to listen. The action heats up in the cells when the guards leave for the night for that is when the gangs begin to rumble. It seems that certain people are placed in certain cells for the guards' pleasure but this comes out much more in Prison on Fire II. Prison on Fire is set entirely in the prison and is quite an enjoyable movie.".

Hardened criminals who stay in a particular prison become unwitting participants as tier bosses rank number one. Chow Yun Fat plays a magnificent inmate who's life is turned upside down after killing his wife in a fit of jealous rage. His bunk mate 51910 Lo Ka Yiu is a man who is put inside because of a manslaughter charge. Now as they try to do their time the bosses always has a way to make their lives even more disparaged by using them as scape goats for their own crimes inside the prison with the help of a superintendent who is as bad as the bosses. For the most part seeing the prisoners try to cope with sanity is at best the most difficult. I enjoyed how each and every one of the characters lose control in one way or another as they try to clear their names. Despair sets in loneliness rigour in the minds and self pity. Even though the criminal system in china is probably the most strict it does show that not all guards or higher ups are that uptight. But in this film seeing those men lose their sanity is the worst nightmare they have to face. Trying to keep above water keep themselves occupied with work or play or even with family visits. Much like the prison systems across the globe. Except as I watched the film you could feel chow's anger as he rips off the ear of the guard nearly going insane like the last time when he killed his wife. Excellent performances through out. Lots of passion and very gritty. I recommend this to anyone who watches the prison genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Les Diaboliques is one of the tightest pure suspense movies I have ever seen.  The story starts out slowly but as it moves on peculiar things start to happen.    This movie keeps you guessing in such a way you are riveted to your seat hoping for a quick resolution to the suspense.  Yet as the story unfolds the suspense deepens.  The final scene of the movie had me sitting back holding my breath.This movie does not offer cheap pop out and scare you tactics. Rather it makes the viewer expect things to happen that don't.

The final scene of the movie had me sitting back holding my breath.This movie does not offer cheap pop out and scare you tactics. Rather it makes the viewer expect things to happen that don't.

All in all this is an excellent horror film that has strong Film Noir overtones and precedes New Wave by a couple of years and its simple yet powerful direction by Jean GeorgesClouzot elevates it from a standard thriller to one to which all others are measured spawning countless imitations with much less satisfying degree. One wonders what treatment Hitchcock would have given it and interestingly it's all here the almost casual presentation of spousal abuse that occurs offcamera in one chilling scene early on the events that lead the women Vera Clouzot and Simone Signoret to make a drastic decision concerning killing Clouzot's husband Michel DelaSalle and then the growing deadly certainty he may not be quite dead after all... and may be after the terrified women. The last 15 minutes are one of the most tensioninducing I've ever seen in any climactic montage even if it does veer into a certain implausibility but the intent is to tell a suspense story and Hitchcock has often mentioned the suspension of disbelief factor and have long gone into history as one of the most horrific moments in cinema.To those interested in watching LES DIABOLIQUES please do NOT watch its American remake DIABOLIQUE with Sharon Stone and Isabelle Adjani. It pays to read the subtitles in this film.".

I must admit I found Clouzot's earlier WAGES OF FEAR1953 slightly disappointing and therefor temporarily held back from watching any other films he made but how wrong I was! This much discussed classic was one of the most frightening and disturbing films I've ever seen. The music theme played during the opening credits with the organ and the singing schoolchildren still makes the hairs in my neck stand up even at this very moment.The story revolves around the tyrant schoolmaster Delasalle Paul Meurisse of a seedy boarding school his wife Vera Clouzot and his mistress Simone Signoret. An he maltreats them both they decide to work together to murder him. They drown Delasalle in the bathtub and dump the corpse in the abandoned swimming pool next to the school. But then eerie things start to happen. When the pool is drained and no body is found the two women grow increasingly fearful that Delasalle is still alive. When subsequently his suit is returned from the drycleaners and the schoolchildren repeatedly testify they've seen Delasalle they start to panic and the strange occurrences surrounding his supposed resurrection slowly drive them into insanity and complete paranoia.Justifiably hailed as one of the most suspenseful films ever made and often compared to Hitchcock's work. Clouzot lacks the master's wit but as far as suspense goes he is incomparable. Very much opposed to Hitchcock this film  like most of his work  has a very cynical and misanthropic feel to it. Perhaps largely due to this very dark tone and Clouzot's excellent eye for detail even today it still has the power to drive you right up the wall. And Simone Signoret whom I've never consciously seen before in other films greatly added to my admiration of this film. A sublime actress and an absolutely hypnotizing screen presence. The entire cast is terrific for that matter with Charles Vanel as inspector Fichet another standout.Clouzot takes his time to build up the story very precisely but once the mysterious things start to happen every scene adds to an almost unbearable tension. You'll watch every facial expression and every detail on screen with increasing paranoia yourself in order to understand what on earth could have happened. And the ending is so surprising that I wasn't quite sure anymore about the things I just saw even right after the film's ending. A genuinely great movie that more than lives up to its status and has lost none of its impact over the last five decades.Camera Obscura  1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Another terrific suspense film from HenriGeorges Clouzot Les Diaboliques also known as Diabolique is a tense story of murder suspicion and revenge. The plot revolves around two women Christina Vera Clouzot and Nicole Simone Signoret who conspire to murder the brutish man who is Christina's husband and Nicole's lover Michel played by the delightfully sullen Paul Meurisse. He is the principal of a boarding school for boys who relies on Vera's money to support his excesses and the two women are both teachers at the school.Vera has her doubts about committing murder even though Michel is incredibly abusive. But Nicole convinces her to help drug and then drown Michel. All seems to be going well until Michels body goes missing and the two women turn against each other. The situation is complicated further by the appearance of a retired police inspector who is determined to help Vera find her missing husband despite the poor woman's protests. The tension continues to mount until the hairraising climax.This movie is on a par with some of Hitchcock's best work although Clouzot doesn't mix much humor in with the suspense as Hitch often did. However Vera's interaction with the droll inspector does provides some chuckles. Unlike his previous film The Wages Of Fear Clouzot doesn't spend a whole lot of time on the setup of the plot but gets right to the meat of the matter and from there Diabolique rolls along very quickly with barely a letup in the action.I can't believe it took me so long to see this masterpiece. Highly recommended.".

The movie is full of scary scenes of something unspeakably bad waiting  to happen to the murderesses. The longawaited bathroom climax is not  the most scary part yet it is a welcome release for all the pentup  emotion and Vera Clouzot truly appears to be near death. Her features  twisted and torturedher expressive body wretched and thin like a  concentrationcamp prisoner. She looks to be in real pain.  Les Diaboliques means The Devilish and the Devil is clearly at work  here. I have seldom felt a stronger presence of evil and Clouzot  manages this feat without a single concession to the bloodbath that is  the modern horrormovie.

Being a huge Hitchcock fan and knowing the history of 'Les Diaboliques' and how it propelled Hitch into making masterpieces as 'Vertigo' and 'Psycho' I sadly saw the story's solution coming way too early  namely the instant one of the male teachers said to the other that Simone Signoret's character had quite a commanding presence after about two thirds of the movie as she was giving orders and then rushing up the stairs. The only logical nonsupernatural solution was the one that the movie ended with  that the titlegiving diabolical ones where not the two women but the sadistic headmaster and his mistress. I'd have loved to have a lot more 'signs of the unexplainable' bothering the women both women not just the frail wife  aside from the missing corpse always a great idea for a story one of the boys having talked to the headmaster after his supposed death and the matter of the corpse's suit. In my opinion the women quarreled to soon and although I liked the performances at first I soon found that Signoret's character was too obviously dominant too selfassured too straightforward and most of all a lot ! too relaxed when the body of a person I just murdered happens to appear hundreds of miles away to be believable. As for Vera Clouzot's character it was just way too convenient to have a rather young person have a heart condition in a thriller as not to mean something later on. The fact that the 'corpse' was seen standing in the bathtub on the cover of the DVD's German edition didn't help matters either in a rather small but still recognizable picture  But what bothered me most was the character of the private investigator. What was the point? So that he could mete out justice in the end? Since he obviously had a hunch who the real victim was why didn't he warn her??? Bottom line this is a picture one might or should even as a movie fan have seen once but unlike a lot of thrillers one knows the ending of I see no reason to view 'Les Diaboliques' again. The absence of a composer of Bernard Herrmann's stature and the uneven camera worked against my involvement in the story as well. I prefer 'Wait Until Dark' 'Psycho' or 'The Haunting' and quite a lot of others as far as suspense is concerned. Sorry M. Clouzot nice try but I didn't buy this one.

	schema:reviewBody "The boys' school in Saint Cloud a suburb of Paris run by Michel and Christina Delassale serves as the background for one of the best suspense thrillers of the French cinema. The school belongs to Christina but it's Michel who has the last word about everything. This penny pinching man insists in giving his students living at the boarding school the worst food money can buy. Michel is also a man who loves to slap his wife and his mistress Nicole Horner who is a teacher at the school. When we first meet them Nicole has a swollen eye and wears dark glasses to hide her shame. Obviously everyone guesses what is really going on between Michel and Nicole even his wife. Christina is aware of the extramarital goings on between her husband and his mistress. A strong minded Nicole shows how she dominates the weaker Christine. Nicole who is fed up with the situation convinces Christina something must be done. She sets things in motion to go to her home town during a brief vacation so that Christina and Nicole attract Michel to come after them as they have a plan of their own about how to deal with his abuses.The women's plan is to bring Michel's body back to the school and dump him in the murky swimming pool where he would be discovered as drowned by accident or perhaps his own suicide. When the pool is drained there is no corpse. When one of Michel's suits is sent from a dry cleaner's the women are dumbfounded. When they go to investigate the owner hands them a key for a nearby hotel room.Christina who is a fragile woman with what appears to be a weak heart feels guilty. When she reads in the newspaper about a drowning victim found on the Seine she has to find out to see if it's her husband. Of course the dead man is not Michel which heightens the mystery. What Christina didn't count on is the retired inspector Alfred Fichet who watches her outside the viewing room at the morgue. This man will become the key figure to solving Michel's disappearance. Les Diaboliques was Clouzot's triumph because the suspense works until the end. He based his screen play in a novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejar who also served as the basis for Vertigo. In fact much has been said about the similarities between the two directors but it is unfortunate because both men approached their work in different ways. Clouzot hints subtly at perhaps a lesbian relationship between Nicole and Christine as it appears both want to be rid of the horrible Michel.The acting is first rate. Simone Signoret one of the best and most attractive actresses of her era makes an earthy Nicole. She is calculating because there is a lot at stake. Vera Clouzot plays Christine as a bundle of nerves because of the gravity of her actions. Paul Meurisse is the evil Michel. Charles Vanet is the old inspector Fichet. Also in the cast a young Michel Serrault and the singer Johnny Holiday who appears uncredited as one of the boys in the school.Henri Georges Clouzot was at the top of his craft and he clearly showed he was a master of suspense bar none.".

And good acting.In charge here is HenriGeorges Clouzot who is famous mostly for this and to a lesser degree the fabulous Wages of Fear from two years earlier. There is little here familiar for American audiences except maybe the Hitchockian tone paced with a steady build that would make the English director proud but instead made him jealous apparently since Clouzot bought the script hours before Hitchcock was going to. The perfect pitch for dialog for humor against the ominous background and for the innocence of a bunch of naughty boys all add up to make a neverending suspense. The famous admonishment at the end not to talk about the film to people who hadn't seen it only emphasizes how good the film is the second time even when you know what's going to happen. It isn't all about surprise but about an expert manipulation of the medium cinema for maximum effect. It's a film not too different in style from the best of the dark semiGothic dramas of American 1940s cinema this is later and even though you are busy reading subtitles at times it clicks along with visual and gestural ease.

Yes apparently. It got a ton of PR and certain critics raved. Life magazine for one did a spread on how shocking it was. The don't reveal the ending title card predated Hitchcock's Psycho's marketing gimmick by a few years  when audiences routinely walked in during the middle of a film.But there's a reason Psycho has withstood the test of time and rewards repeated viewings and Diabolique is a cinema footnote.With Diabolique you know EXACTLY what's coming  and you're right. It's just a matter of seeing how cleverly or not Clouzot works it out. The suspense such as it is lies not in any real emotional involvement with the characters and situation because you already know where the film is going but rather in how thrillingly it's going to be depicted.Answer? Not very.In other words the plot was stale even in 1955. So the suspense lies in seeing if Clouzot can bring new life to a tale as old as Euripides.Answer? No.The actors? Wonderful. Particularly the young Simone Signoret. Vera Clouzot the director's wife borders on Garboesque beauty and is fine except when she veers off into bugeyed terror too often.Psycho has been criticized for its final explanation scene by the psychiatrist. By contrast that's Shakespeare compare to this claptrap quickie ending.What REALLY drives a stake through the heart of Diabolique is the schoolboy's last line I saw her I know I saw her. Huh? This pseudoprofundity is supposed to make us imagine that maybe the lovers DIDN'T scare the wife to death? That she's actually still alive? To do WHAT? Get a divorce from this abusive husband like she should have done all along? HAUNT them from beyond the grave? What? Answer? Nothing.A lot of talent is wasted here on a thirdrate plot with an insulting payoff.Amazing this was ever considered much of anything.It's not. Diabolique is a Bmove posing as a French artfilm shocker.".

The suspense such as it is lies not in any real emotional involvement with the characters and situation because you already know where the film is going but rather in how thrillingly it's going to be depicted.Answer? Not very.In other words the plot was stale even in 1955. So the suspense lies in seeing if Clouzot can bring new life to a tale as old as Euripides.Answer? No.The actors? Wonderful. Particularly the young Simone Signoret. Vera Clouzot the director's wife borders on Garboesque beauty and is fine except when she veers off into bugeyed terror too often.Psycho has been criticized for its final explanation scene by the psychiatrist. By contrast that's Shakespeare compare to this claptrap quickie ending.What REALLY drives a stake through the heart of Diabolique is the schoolboy's last line I saw her I know I saw her. Huh? This pseudoprofundity is supposed to make us imagine that maybe the lovers DIDN'T scare the wife to death? That she's actually still alive? To do WHAT? Get a divorce from this abusive husband like she should have done all along? HAUNT them from beyond the grave? What? Answer? Nothing.A lot of talent is wasted here on a thirdrate plot with an insulting payoff.Amazing this was ever considered much of anything.It's not. Diabolique is a Bmove posing as a French artfilm shocker.";

While Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho may have been dealing with extra thematic material beneath its horrific surface providing additional dimensions that the French film didn't have Diabolique or Les Diaboliques as it's known in France is a thriller whose atmosphere and sense of mystery equal that of the great Hitchcock classic. The same dark threatening black and white cinematography and bizarre macabre goingson of Psycho meet their French counterpart in Diabolique much to the viewer's delight. And while Psycho gave the world perhaps the most memorable scene revolving around a shower Diabolique presents the most memorable scenes connected with a bathtub. More outstanding than any other bathtub scenes in my opinon including the ones from The Shining.From the tension before the murder to the mysteries that arise afterwards the suspense mounts to an eerie climax that remains one of the Cinema's most exciting whether you predicted it or not. If you weren't expecting it it will truly be a frightening and confusing in a good way surprise. If you successfully foretold it it will satisfy your suspicions and still captivate your attention. The only thing that seems subpar about the film is the police detective's role in the incidents during the climax and after. You may wonder why he didn't arrive on the scene earlier or whether he could have prevented certain events from occurring. It seems awkward that he shows up when he did and knows all about what just happened. One gets the idea that perhaps French Production Codes of some kind had an effect on the plot at this point giving the ending a somewhat forced and artificial flavor.".

It is interesting to know that Hitchcock wanted the rights to this and intriguing to imagine what he would have done with it. It's interesting to note that the film makers were not above providing some comic relief in the form of the landlord and his wife in the boarding house where the murder takes place.

I didn't find Diabolique bad by any means but hearing people say that it's better than anything Hitchcock ever did is pretty laughable in my eyes. I think it looks worse by comparison to Hitchcock but in it's own right it's a solid if not particularly impressive work. Concerning the wife and mistress of a school headmaster who conspire to murder him together HenriGeorges Clouzot's film took a while to get going for me but once it did I found some solid enjoyment out of it.A lot of what makes it work comes more from the work of the two women at it's core. Simone Signoret as the mistress takes charge of the murderous plot and stands firm in her beliefs cold and calculated. She's always trying to remain in control remain collected and when things start to unravel you can see her slowly twist at the idea of potentially suffering the consequences. Vera Clouzot as the wife takes on the more unstable emotional role and she really makes it sing. She is wild uncontrollable and never at rest. Whereas Signoret is very still and mannered Clouzot bounces off the walls in her distress and this contrast between them drives the film more than anything the director himself does.There are some nice twists in the narrative that keep the mystery alive in the latter half of the film along with a stunning final sequence that finally lived up to the hype that had been built around the film. The final sequence was mesmerizing and terrifying culminating in a twist that I was surprised I didn't see coming. That being said the resolution itself was disappointingly pedestrian. Overall though I didn't find much to write home about here although it was certainly good. This was my first Clouzot film and I'll be sure to check out several more of his works but if this is a sign of what he has to offer me then I'm afraid I'll never be able to understand those who rank him above his English companion.".

	schema:reviewBody "As others have noted The 7th Dawn is a surprisingly good film and deserves more attention.  It opens with a stunningly photographed title sequence that evokes the haunting atmosphere and strange tension of Henri Rousseau's jungle paintings.  As soon as the titles fade however we are suddenly thrust into the middle of a brutal mass execution towards the end of World War II in Malaysia.  The entire film plays off of this combination of sudden violence and the mysterious unearthly beauty of the jungle.In its quest for national independence for Malaysia a guerilla army threatens British colonial society with acts of terrorism that leave the good civilized folk on edge.  They ask an American expat William Holden to intercede with the leader of the rebels played by Tetsuro Tamba because the two are old friends and served together in a guerilla army on the side of the Allies when they were all fighting the Japanese. Capucine also served with the two men in their guerilla days and these three form an interesting romantic triangle that goes much deeper than those found in most films involving loyalty to and betrayal of friends lovers family nation and ideology.Though we've seen Holden's character Major Ferris in other movies from Rick in Casablanca on down it's a great role for the actor who fills it with vigor intelligence and the necessary animal sensitivity.  It helps that he has good writing behind him and in fact the screenplay is one of the strengths of the movie with complex characters involved in murky moral situations a plot that keeps you intrigued and guessing and some larger themes right out of Joseph Conrad.  Susannah York's character may be a weak point of the film but the acting in general is quite good.   The Malaysian setting is quite exotic and Freddie Young's Lawrence of Arabia Doctor Zhivago etc. incredible photography adds to the moody violent and lush atmosphere of the film.   It all adds up to action adventure mystery political intrigue some refreshingly mature romantic relationships and even a touch of humor.  Though it doesn't quite rank up there with The Bridge on the River Kwai or Lawrence of Arabia people who liked those films should find The 7th Dawn a surprisingly strong film and definitely worth watching.".

It was pretty clear from the references and the red stars the Ng and his guerrillas were communists. This is an entertaining film from a jungle war that has been largely forgotten in the shadow of Vietnam. The British spent 12 years eradicating the elements they called communist terrorists before Malaysia became independent. Most of their enemies weren't convenientlyuniformed like Ng's forces but were more like the grenadetossing chauffeur. The SAS played a key role in suppressing the communists and the British pretty much wrote the book on how to deal with these sort of insurgencies lessons theAmericans too often seem to forget though they slowly seem to be figuring it out in Iraq and Afghanistan. Saw this movie years ago and liked it liked it more in a recent viewing in spite of its flaws. Always liked Holden have a real soft spot for Susannah York  and Capucine was splendid. Some great cars in this movie too and a Gloster Meteor too I think. And yes superbly photographed.".

This would be an intriguing remake if today's times were a little different. Today's culture is far into the antiterrorist mode to understand the psychology of insurgency. Vietnam was much more complex with the S.Vietnamese bureaucracy betraying themselves and China masterminding the NVA for its own purposes. William Holden played the naive if somewhat selfimportant voice of reason. He played the angle from his side and was critical of the British viewpoint.

At the time the film wasn't greeted with much enthusiasm by the critics but looking back there are several factors that make their negative outlook of the film seem somewhat inaccurate.

One would expect a cosier more flattering representation but The 7th Dawn has the courage to be critical of the British handling of such situations. Add to that some strong performances luscious cinematography by Frederick Young and a number of memorable scenes and you're looking at a film that has been largely underrated down the years.At the end of WWII freedom fighters in the Malayan jungle are finally able to leave their dens and hideouts in the undergrowth and get back to something resembling normality. One fighter the American Ferris William Holden decides to buy a patch of land and turn it into a rubber plantation taking his old lady guerrilla friend Dhana Capucine as his mistress.

Karl Tunberg's script wanders a lot and seems in need of a little tighteningup York's character isn't always convincing and upsets the solid characterisation found elsewhere in the film the final scene virtually plagiarises the ending of Casablanca. But there's still a good deal to enjoy in this exotic jungle romp  Holden is fine Capucine plays a refreshingly strong female character the action is exciting enough. One particularly powerful sequence features the British burning to the ground a village which has been unsuspectingly harbouring terrorists and their explosives another shows hundreds of Malayan cyclists carrying out a protest ride against the British governor for ordering for a nighttime bicycle curfew. Undeservedly forgotten and almost never screened nowadays The 7th Dawn is a worthwhile watch if you can find it!".

Holden like the country so much he's going to settle down as a rubber planter. Capucine is going back to teaching school and agitating for eventual independence from Great Britain.

Unfortunately their paths put them on a collision course with each other.Holden's a freewheeling hedonist who just won't settle down and marry Capucine and he's got a new distraction in the form of Sussanah York the daughter of the new British administrator. Her role is the weakest here and the dumbest. Her offer of sacrifice to bring peace to Malaya just doesn't ring true at all.I do like what Tetsuro Tamba did with his part. His people as he's been taught in Moscow can't feed themselves let alone govern themselves. They need Red style tutelage and he's going to see they get it.Measured against The Bridge on the River Kwai The Seventh Dawn falls far short. Still it's nicely photographed in the Republic of Malaysia and the cast is earnest enough in their roles. William Holden fans will like it.".

	schema:headline " not a war film but a story of colonial vestiges in postwar Malaysia and a bit flat";
	schema:reviewBody "The 7th Dawn 1964The best of this movie is an attempt to show the politics of Malaysia after WWII. There are lessons here that apply to our own time with European powers facing rising anger in developing countries. Here it's the British who are facing horrors from the Malaysians because they own so much of the good land and maintain typical colonial class and monetary power even though it was no longer an official colony. A little like half the world I suppose in midTwentieth Century including South Africa and Vietnam.The movie is stiff and forced in other ways and often feels like a movie that might have been made a decade earlier. It plays with clichs and uses convenient movie tricks that are false even to the uninitiated. The leading man hasn't that worn well over the yearsWilliam Holden. I generally like him but here I can feel him acting too often. Some of the charming ticks in his face or his dry delivery now seems fake and even smarmy like the letch in him can't hide beneath his acting or the leading man in him is all he has. I have a feeling these quirks were attractive at the time fifty years ago.It's not a total train wreck of a movie. Susannah York is stunning in a way that avoids the stereotyping she often reluctantly fit into the Pop British flowerchild. Unfortunately York isn't a terrific actress here and at first is merely the serious woman to put against Holden's character. She does have an important role but it's extremely limited you'll see why and she can be sculptural without pretense. But then next to York is the other woman to whom Holden 46 years old here is attracted which by itself is absurd York playing the less desirable woman. This is played by the younger and unconvincing Capucine. She went by one name but was born with the usual allotment. It's not that she's a bad actor really but that she's a frivolous object with so little awareness of what surrounds here. I'm sure people like her were in Malaysia but to make her a centerpiece of the movie brings everything down a couple notches.If we can absorb the stilted at times style and the improbable aspects in the subplots Holden with the young tart slashing through the jungle with machetes we are able to go back to the political facts. The details are fictional for sure but the broad outline the fear of Westerners in a land where they are not at all welcome is believable. And the film doesn't paint it completely as a bunch of innocent English richies being killed and tormented by the rabble though there is a little of that. It's more about a the real conflict of histories and ways of life. And a sticking to principles. I think a more potent idea here without York by this point is whether personal friendship can hold up through huge differences of culture and loyalty. This might be the best part of the movie and in those sections you'll at least feel depth to the idea and even the acting even if the outcome is a bit beside the point. In one later scene the woman at this point the tart asks How can you believe him? Exactly! The question of trust in the mind of the audience is obvious to the characters too and so it's the final large theme taking us from the first scene to almost the last.Everything outside shot on location which adds authenticity not only on the plantations rubber but later in the raw jungle. If you watch this you'll find things to like for sure. But it's not constructed very well and the clunky parts will overwhelm you at times. You'll also find that people who should be freaking out on death row or a man seeing his daughter likely to die calmly proceed instead. Or when someone takes a prisoner after a huge fight they then let down their guard and trust him to walk away with his weapon.It's too bad. A lot was pointed in the right direction at first. There are more recent movies that take the realism of their periods seriously and to probably better results blockbusters like Gandhi or The Last Emperor and more perceptive if imperfect films like Lust Caution and the weirdly chilling Disgrace. But the theme is really one of the largest in the history of movies actually if you start looking at everything from The Rains Came to The Letter both from the classic black and white Hollywood years. The 7th Dawn fits into this picture somewhere.".

He is involved in a love triangle with a Malayan rebel leader and an activist played by the beautiful Capucine. Holden effortlessly exudes authority and manliness. The so called macho actors of today look like chumps when compared to an actor like Holden. Capucine plays a stoic principled solider who is passionate about the rights of the Malays. This is the first time i'm seeing her in a film. She is a damn good actress and looked great too. Sussanah York the daughter of a British dignitary covets holden. She is introduced wearing a bikini and bathing in the sea. She is a female white liberal character straight of of a VS Naipaul novel. The plot resolution at the end is thanks to her silly liberal antics. She surrenders herself as a hostage to the malayan reactionaries in the hope that the British authorities would refrain from hanging Capucine who is falsely accused of planting grenades.But the film is an action adventure film that doesnt really take political sides and mostly present facts as they are. i enjoyed it.

Nice to see Tafler in a role other than his usual line in club managers and assorted crooks. Likewise Goodliffe shows a gravitas contrasting from his normal parts  the seedy Jigsaw 1962 through to various officer types and police inspectors.";

Coming off her success in Tom Jones York plays the daughter of a British commander who throws herself at Holden. Holden is apparently attracted to her but also has feelings for Capucine an earnest school teacher who is sympathetic to the revolution. Holden and Capucine had an offscreen romance going at the time. The film's not as bad as its reputation would suggest.".

I hate to be a nitpicker but at the beginning we see a helicopter with loudspeaker telling the rebels that the war with the Japanese is over. Now I know early helicopters were used by the Allies in small numbers late in World War Two. But in a remote area such as Malaya? Anacronistic I would think! Also the aircraft was a Bristol Sycamore not designed until the 50s!! This helicopter thing also happens in Where Eagles Dare. Don't film researchers do there homework?

	schema:reviewBody "The 7th Dawn was released in 1964 the year that President Lyndon Johnson took the initial critical steps in escalating the war in Vietnam. In turn the film was based on the 1959 novel The Durian Tree by Australian author Michael Keon. It is remarkable to think that the novel and the film both provided lessons that could have served as warnings about the tragic war that contributed to breaking the back of the American Century.The strength of the film is the ambiguous depiction of nationalist insurgents in Mayasia formerly known as Malaya who are rebelling against their British overlords in the aftermath of World War II. The film distorts the historical record by pointedly avoiding the labeling of the guerrilla fighters as communists. The leader of the insurgents a World War II hero who fought with the allies is portrayed sympathetically until the very end of the film.The performances are uniformly excellent with the charismatic Capuchine and the luminous Susanna York in the leading women's parts. Tetsur Tanba conveys the patriotic zeal of the leader of the insurgents. William Holden is serviceable as the apolitical American entrepreneur who is inevitably drawn into the conflict between the British and the Mayayans.The noted cinematographer Freddie Young captures a harrowing jungle sequence with a nearly unprecedented naturalism of detail. The beauty of the natural environment of Malaysia is juxtaposed with the violence of the British military in burning a village. This was the film artist who photographed Doctor Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia. The haunting musical score of Riz Ortolani is at the heart of a breathtaking opening credit sequence.Perhaps the content of this film has become less relevant with the passing of more than a half century. On the other hand the recurring word that is used throughout the film to describe the insurgents is not communists not guerrilla warriors not rebel fighters and not nationalists. The word that is used is terrorists. For this reason the film may continue to speak to us in a nuanced way about vital issues in the twentyfirst century.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am generally a soft touch for movies that have fictional characters in a wellknown historical setting and this one is no exception. Based on a 1936 underrated musical that opened in London and set on the eve of both World War I and the Russian revolution it involves a Russian Prince Nelson Eddy and a singer and revolutionary Ilona Massey who deceive each other as to who they really are and fall in love.  But even after they discover their true identities they remain in love until separated by the war and then the revolution.The sets and costumes are firstrate and director Reinhold Schunzel keeps the film moving at a nice pace and handles the crowd scenes extremely well. Mild comedy is provided by Charlie Ruggles and Frank Morgan. Although I'm not much of a fan of Nelson Eddy  he's somewhat bland in his acting  he does have a good voice so I did enjoy lots of his singing.  The stirring Ride Cossack Ride while the Cossacks are on horseback riding towards the camera which keeps moving back to avoid a collision is beautifully photographed.  His rendition of Silent Night in German while in the trenches during WW I answering the Austrian enemy soldiers singing of that song was a wonderful tender sequence.  Eddy also sings the Toreador song from Bizet's Carmen which will surely will be liked by opera fans.But I loved best the last 15 minutes or so when the Russian emigrs who have gathered in Paris after the war meet at the Paris version of the Balalaika Cafe to celebrate the Russian New Year. Instead of the joy you would expect on such an occasion you see the sadness in everyone's eyes at having had to leave their homeland.  Frank Morgan sings about his Land of Dreams and it moved me to tears.".

There was a general ignorance of the Stalin atrocities and an ambivalence about Russia as ally or enemy. Portraying Russia as a victim of WWI was not unrealistic and contributed to the sympathetic depiction of the nation and its peoples.As other writers have written Nelson Eddy acts rather stiffly. But I found his singing very enjoyable. The object of his affections played by Ilona Massey is rather charming and talented. THe other players were amusing and talented. The Wizard of Oz was released the same year. If anyone happened to see Balalaika and TWOZ back to back they must have done a double take when they saw Frank Morgan in his mustache and his busby playing nearly identical roles. In Balalaika the applicable scene is near the end of the film. In TWOZ he played the guard to the city of Oz among other roles. In a few long yearsafter WWIIAmerica's view of Soviet Russia would change dramatically. Here is a view of Russia before the American public came to see Russians as enemies.".

However lets examine here case she was lot sexier that Macdonald Hollywood has never been good at handling real sexiness it was falsified and made safe by Lana turner etc Massey was womanly in its best sense she also looked like a maneater and that alienated women and frightened men .To describe her as an opulent blonde is an understatement. Not only was she stunning to look at but could sing as well as Macdonald and was streets ahead of the over sweet shrillness of Kathryn Grayson and Jane Powell. MGM kept Massey on long leash in case Macdonald became troublesome. Massey resurfaced gloriously in holiday in Mexico making Walter Pidgeon smoulder in way he he never did with Greer.Massey finally achieved some sort of immortality in Love Happy as the uber voluptuous madam Engelich delivering the first recorded whammy to an overwhelmed Harpo Marx .Something she was also delivering to the men in the audience who wisely didn't let their wives find out.Massey was as delicious as a box of glac fruits shame on Hollywood for being stingy with such a mouth watering treat".

Neverthelss she makes a striking picture opposite the robust baritone who is in excellent voice here.As usual there are comedy moments to lighten the rather dark story set against the Russian revolution and these are handled rather indifferently by Frank Morgan Charlie Ruggles and George Tobias. Sharpeyed movie fans can catch a glimpse of actor Phillip Terry who is kept mostly in the background during the cabaret sequences.Overall it's a cumbersome story with a predictable outcome that takes too many long stretches between songs to tell a rather tedious story of lovers separated by their politics.".

	schema:headline " A superb Eddy and Massey song fest";
	schema:reviewBody "A balalaika is a threestring instrument played like a guitar. Its body is triangular and the pitch is a higher range. It's one of the principal instruments in Russian folk music. In this film Balalaika also is the name of a restaurant or nightclub in St. Petersburg during the last years of imperial Russia. Some of the early scenes take place in the restaurant that offers up a good menu of singing and Russian music.Balalaika is a very good musical romance with a tinge of drama and look at a period in history. The music performers and the costumes make this film. Ilona Massey appeared two years earlier in Rosalie that starred Nelson Eddy and Eleanor Powell. This film was the only pairing of Eddy and Massey as leads. Massey is excellent in her role as Lydia Marakova. She has a beautiful voice and appearance and she can act. Others have commented on her fine voice and relatively short Hollywood career. She had only a few more minor singing roles in later films along with roles in several films of other genres. Massey sings five songs solo or with chorus backing and she sings several other numbers with Eddy and others. She gives a wonderful rendition of the Russian favorite Otchi Chornia Dark Eyes. Nelson Eddy plays a double role as Prince Peter Karagin and as Peter Teranda. He has six solo or chorus backed songs. Among these is his marvelous Song of the Volga Boatmen El Ukhnem which he sings in Russian. Another standout number is from a scene where the Russians are entrenched against the Austrians during the First World War. It's Christmas and the Russians first hear the Austrians singing Silent Night in Russian. Eddy a prince and general of the Russian army responds and sings Stille Nacht in German to the Austrians. A fine supporting cast contributes mostly to the music and light comedy of the film. Charles Ruggles is superb as Nicki Popoff. Frank Morgan is Ivan Danchenoff Lionel Atwill is Prof. Marakov and C. Aubrey Smith plays Gen. Karagin the prince's father. The musical romance of the film overlays a drama with historical aspects. The latter are very awkward. The plot runs from the end days of czarist Russia to the start of World War I. It then jumps past World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution to Paris of the early 1920s. No doubt Hollywood's attempts in 1939 not to rankle the feathers of the Soviet Union have something to do with the weak historical aspects. The historical is interesting but that part of the story is very choppy. The film ends in Paris in the early 1920s with the displaced Russian royalty. This movie is based on a 1933 musical play The Great Hussar that opened in London in October 1933. It was quite successful enjoying a run of 569 performances through the end of 1936. The movie was well received by critics. In the year that produced the highest number of great films Balalaika topped made a little more than its budget at the box office. The music performances sets and costumes contribute to a very good and enjoyable film. Balalaika is especially a look at a fine female singer whom many would like to have enjoyed in more musicals.Here are some favorite lines from this film. For more humorous dialog see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the movie.Peter Teranda Don't they put numbers on these houses? Policeman The new numbers are on brass plates. That's progress. The janitors sell the brass plates for vodka. That's Russia.Ivan Danchenoff after the opera cast applauds following Lydia's audition Silence! I don't hire you to applaud but to be applauded.Lydia to Peter while they are racing in a horsedrawn carriage Oh careful. You're going too fast. Peter Teranda Who? Me or the horses?A soldier in the trenches Calvary stew. Another soldier We used to ride 'em and now we eat 'em.Jeanette Sibirsky What exquisite jewelry. Madam Danchenoff I'm afraid they're just copies my child. Ivan Danchenoff Yes yes. We ate the originals... indirectly.Michael Sibirsky speaking of his wife Once I commanded the czar's own guard. Now she commands me.The elderly Princess Natalya Petrovna asks Nicki Popoff to dance with her in Nicki's Parisian cafe. Nicki Oh your highness. Well and to think it took a revolution to bring us together.".

	schema:reviewBody "Balalaika is not the worst of Nelson Eddy's films that's I Married an Angel and even that for this viewer was not that bad. But it's not even close to the likes of Maytime New Moon and The Chocolate Soldier. Balalaika is a decent and quite nice film but did come across as very problematic. Eddy has never been the best of actorshis best performances have been in Chocolate Soldier Maytime and Let Freedom Ring and Balalaika doesn't really change that perception. He is at least better than he was in The Phantom of the Opera and I Married An Angel and at least he is more convincing as a Russian than he was as an Austrian in Bittersweet. But he is very stiff and wooden here he has charming moments but he never looks comfortable. The story is also very predictable cumbersome and even sillyat times and the pacing can be rather dull. The script fares little better often awkward sounding and lifeless the film was strongly censored at the risk of offending so that could be why while the humour is mild and unfortunately not very funny. Charles Ruggles fares the best in the supporting cast but excepting the last fifteen minutes where he's affecting Frank Morgan's comic talents are not really put to good use and his performance is somewhat indifferent. The costumes and sets are beautiful and the crisp black and white photography is especially striking in the Ride Cossack Ride and Stille Nacht Silent Night sequences ones that is stirring for the former and poignant for the latter. The score and songs are a treat to listen to At the Balalika Ride Cossack Ride Song of the Volga Boatmen and Toreador Song are particularly great. Frank Morgan's song in the last fifteen minutes is also very moving as is the ending itself. Even if his acting is not up to snuff Eddy still produces some magnificent singing in Balalaikathe best thing about the film always robust and beautiful and at its best in Ride Cossack Ride and Song of the Volga Boatmen. And extra credit for singing in four languages in one film you don't hear that very often. Ilona Massey looks absolutely stunning even that doesn't do justice to her beauty actually and a worthy leading lady for Eddy. They work well together and blend nicelyif not quite as much as Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. In conclusion a nice decent film but a long way from one of Nelson Eddy's finest hours. 610 Bethany Cox".

He is his usual limited self but she comes across as cold and humorless which is the polar opposite of Jeanette MacDonald.The storyline is thin and unconvincing sort of like The Student Prince he is royalty she is not so he passes himself off as a peasant to win her hand. An interesting aspect of the picture is that it treats the aftermath of the Russian Revolution and the dissolution of the upper class. Here many of Russian royalty end up in Paris after WWI in menial jobs much to their sadness and chagrin.

Even for professionals such an enterprise he decides to dig a tunnel is quite demanding but for simple commoners it's daunting as they also have their personal downsides thus Victor's wife has a most unwelcome tendency to blurt out the truth even to the grumpy local copper a crazy risk when you need to keep a criminal plan secret.";

Still this oldtimer baffoonery can be appreciated because De Funes is professional about it. He's better than the material he's given.

One bothering plot hole there's no way anybody could think anybody other than them robbed the bank. It's just so obvious we have scenes in which they ask about security or in which the kid is ever so curious what the vault looks like and they have a motive and they can constantly be seen with massive amounts of shovels or covered with dirt and they actually ask a guy about digging tunnels. I know I know it's just a funny little movie.".

I was soon to be disappointed as this is only a pale imitation of the preceding. The plot was over zany and farfetched and the behaviour of the characters was so stupid as to be annoying ! There was also overuse of special effects  useless in a film of this kind  and to boot the whole picture looked oversynthetic without natural colours and over dominance of blue and yellow hues. The other thing was that I didn't find the actors funny at all. That this film in spite of its numerous failings had a reasonable success at the box office only goes to show that presentday humour in France is slowly descending towards prehistoric levels of vulgarity unsubtleness and crudity. This film is therefore destined to an audience with very basic and limited humoral appreciation. Thank God we have the older films and the Vebers to remind us that good clean witty and intelligent humour did exist in the past.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ballermann 6 is a German movie from 1997 so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. The runtime here on IMDb says 95 minutes but all the versions I found run considerably shorter roughly 80 minutes namely. It is the second film of so far 3 from the Tom Gerhardt  Hilmi Szer film series in which they play two nicelyspeaking very simple guys who are basically just interested in cars female breasts and alcohol of course. Gerhardt is not only lead actor in here but also writer and codirector. The other director is Gernot Roll one of the finest cinematographers in German film history but here he proves once again that directing is definitely not his strength. Then again not even Spielberg could have directed a garbage script like this one here into a quality movie. I am tempted to call these GerhardtSzer films live action versions of the Werner Beinhart movies. But as well as these work it really only works as animation and not as live action. It certainly isn't helping either that Gerhardt's one and only one shtick gets repetitive so quickly. And it's never funny at all. The inclusion of cameos by known faces to Germans like Jrgen Drews of course in a Ballermann film Ottfried Fischer or Uwe Ochsenknecht elevates the material only slightly maybe from 100 crap to 99 crap. In any case this film never should have been made after how bad the first one was and even after this second film they did not understand it and made a third film hopefully the last not too long ago actually. This trilogy is probably the worst German film has come up with in terms of all the trilogies that have been made in over a century. Shame on you Tom Gerhardt! Something good about this film here? That it runs for 80 minutes only and that's the only thing. It still felt like 2.5 hours. Stay far far away.".

I paid more attention to Tom Gerhardt. To get a clue what his character is all about he is very similar to the Tommie character in the Hausmeister Krause sitcom but I have to sadly admit that this character fits more to an adolescent than some 40 year unemployed person because it seems unrealistic that someone this old can be so ridiculously stupid and the fact that this is unusual doesn't make it funny either.The gags mostly range from slapstick to oneliners unfortunately neither both of them are funny most of the time. The movie is so often over the top that many odd scenes occur most of the time. Both of the main characters jump from a beach party to an hotel to the kitchen of a restaurant to an arena etc. etc. with no logical explanation how they've got there at all just to get some cheap childish jokes in.So that more people watched the movie when it was in the theatres it has a big list of cameo appearances from German celebrities and actors I still wonder how some of the more remarkable German actors could whore them out just to appear in this bad movie.At last I suggest anyone to skip this movie that contains sheer stupidness and watch the way funnier sitcom Hausmeister Krause.".

	schema:headline " Puts a human face on Cuban emigration and immigration";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1994 the collapse of the Soviet Union had caused the withdrawal of Soviet financial aid and personnel support for Cuba. This precipitated a severe downturn in the Cuban economy resulting in even more substandard living conditions for many. In response to the general unease Castro announced that any Cuban who wanted to emigrate to the U.S. could feel free to do so. Tens of thousands took him up on this and left on rafts boats lashedup inner tubes and about anything that would float. Immigration being no less an issue in 1994 than it is now the Clinton Administration responded by saying that the U.S Coast Guard would intercept the immigrants. Those who were intercepted were diverted to Guantnamo Bay where they were held for up to a year until the American government could figure out what to do with them. The mass exodus lasted some two weeks until the U.S. and Cuba reached an agreement that would allow 20000 Cuban immigrants a year into the U.S. many held at Guantnamo were ultimately given legal passage. Some in the initial frenzy made it to Florida on their own many died at sea. In the comfort of their homes Americans followed the events in the news media and for most people it remained a remote story. However Balseros brings the events home in a dramatic way by following seven Cubans over a period of seven years  from their preparations in Cuba to their journey and experiences in their new homeland. Anyone who watches this documentary will not soon forget this chapter in U.S.Cuban history.In the first part we get to know our travelers while they are still in Cuba. I was astonished to see the crude crafts that were being constructed for the 90 mile trip across the Florida Straits  some no more than inner tubes roped together. The motivations prompting people to risk their lives on such an endeavor obviously had to be extreme I wish we had been given a little more insight into what prompted these people to make such a lifethreatening trip to totally disrupt their lives by leaving friends lovers and country. And what did they think they would find if they were successful in reaching the U.S.?There is some incredible footage of people on rafts making the crossing  I have to assume this was actual footage. One of the most poignant parts of the film was the encounter on the way of empty rafts and isolated inner tubes floating on the rough waters  solemn testaments to the many who did not make it.The most engaging part of the documentary is in following the people after their arrival in the U.S. On their immediate arrival in Miami they were dispersed to cities all across the U.S. primarily under the auspices of Catholic charities. Some were more successful than others but being strangers in a strange land made adapting to the new capitalist society surely fall short of whatever dreams they must have had. One quote that stuck with me was Freedom has a price. More than one person had qualms about having left. In missing his more gregarious society one immigrant complains about having to make an appointment two weeks in advance just to see his neighbors. Some of the aspects of the U.S. we see here will make many Americans uncomfortable. As this film proves Americans can learn a lot about their country by contrasting their views and experiences with those of these newcomers from a different culture.In revisiting the immigrants after their having been in the U.S. for five years we see that some have stayed in contact with those they left behind and others have formed new relationships and left the past behind. The same goes for those who stayed on the island.As appropriate the score serves up some great Latin music. The woman's performance played during the closing credits is a knockout.Balseros reflects the complexity and unpredictability of human behavior the motivating power of hopes and dreams and the intricate relationships between politics and the individual.I think the film could have been improved with some initial voiceovers setting up the history and giving a brief introduction to each of the main characters as they appear. It was a little confusing at the beginning.What was in it for the people profiled in this film in exchange for their sharing in a very public way many intimate details of their lives?For a story treating many of the same themes see Before Night Falls a film biography of Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas who ultimately came to the U.S. in the Mariel Boatlift of 1980.".

	schema:headline " Definitely not the most powerful documentary ever but still moving";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of many different Cuban lives intertwined as they all hope of one day escaping Castro's communism and achieving the American Dream. However the degree to which they achieve this varies widely. Some like Rafael Cano are able to persevere and put their faith in God and achieve the dream. However another young woman who moves to Albuquerque becomes involved in drugs and falls into the depths of poverty and is eventually even disowned by her own sister. She even says at one point that she wants to go back to Cuba because it is her own country. For this character the American lifestyle was a lot less glamorous than it seemed from the outside.I don't believe the film was making an overt political statement. Although it did show the passion with which these young men and women so desperately wanted to leave Cuba it also portrayed the United States as villainous with Clinton telling Cubans to go back to their own country etc.I wish the film had shown us more about the lifestyles these characters led in Cuba before fleeing to the U.S. From what I could tell it seemed as if the only thing that excited Cuban people was the prospect of escaping to the freedoms offered by the United States. For instance when someone was leaving the village with his or her raft the entire village gathered around and bid him farewell and then people proceeded to follow him with bikes. It was almost as if a president were passing by on a motorcade. So I was really interested in learning about Cuban life under Castro but I would imagine it is definitely not as mundane as the film inadvertantly? makes it out to be.Overall 6 stars out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I missed this documentary when it ran for about two weeks at the Film Forum. I was hoping that it would resurface again as was the case when it was shown on cable not too long ago. Both film makers Carlos Bosch and Jose Ma. Domenech must be commended for tackling the story about seven or eight raft people in pursuing their dream to go to the United States in search of a better life. Cuba after more of 45 years of communist rule has been a monumental failure. I am sure that some people will argue that because the embargo and American policies toward that nation things turned out the way they did. In the end one dictator was replaced by another. The paradise that was promised at the beginning of the revolution is still to be realized. In order to survive in Cuba today one has to have either relatives abroad or to belong to the inner circle. No one wants to face the reality that when Cuba was a Soviet Union colony they could buy whatever it was needed either on credit or through gifts in way of oil and basic heavy machinery from its Russian bosses.That a lot of the population wants to get out of the tropical paradise is no surprise. In the case of the people singled out in the documentary only a few get to fulfill their dreams and get to live a modified American Dream while the other half failed miserably maybe because the reality of the dream turned for them into a nightmare.Of all the cases presented only about three make something out of themselves. Their idea of how capitalism works is much more of whatever dreams they might have had. The reality of life in the United States with its harsh realities play havoc with a few of the new immigrants. That is the case of the former prostitute who turn into a drug dealer and the young black sculptor who gets involved with the wrong kind of crowd in New York.This is a must see documentary that stays neutral neither in favor of the exodus or against it.".

A supposedly realistic account of the destiny of various Cubans among thousands who sailed from Havana to Florida in the early 1990's to escape Fidel Castro's regime I find rather curious how the filmmakers move at ease from Havana to Guantnamo or Florida and are always in the right place at the right time. With the overt attitude of new conquistadors I have witnessed in many Spaniards' behavior in Latin America which is one of the reasons I did not find the female character of Y tu mam tambin as nave as people seem to believe but a true reflection of this neocolonialist attitude I have directly observed it makes me suspicious of the true intentions of this film which I find more related to Spain's sensationalist publications and television programs than to real interest in the human drama of the Cubans' present situation. Due to the potentially explosive situations that may arise from this state of affairs the film does not lack interesting segments and testimonies. But I believe that any film made about and in Cuba today will have similar impact. As an alternative watch the Swedish documentary Surplus.".

When I visited the country of my parents 3 years ago from Havana to Pinar Del Rio trips I was overcome with a deep sadness as to how pitiful the international media has covered the plight of Cubans on the island. Finally! This movie captures it all too well and so realistically so accurately so heroically! It's about time! Regardless of how one feels about Fidel Castro Bill Clinton and the changes the US has made on Cuba's refugee policies the people of Cuba live in absolute misery. No other 3rd world country in the Western Hemisphere has so much misery as Cuba. Economic poverty is not Cuba's worst problem. Misery is! Everywhere I went people on the island of Cuba lived in misery fear mistrust suspicion a basic ethos are missing a will to live is gone anxiety depression loneliness desperateness and more. If you want to understand the situation in Cuba as it is today watch this film. Pity that Hollywood films in America don't report the truth as it is without getting bogged down on their stupid political selfrighteous statements from their comfortable palatial Hollywood homes.Watch this movie. It's great!".

I believe this is his only masala film he made and sadly he fails! The biggest letdown of the film is its script basically there isn't one. One could say Vikram Bhatt was making up the story while he was making the film. Riots gang wars corrupt politicians smooth criminals romantic boons etc basically the film has not nothing new or different one could watch. Keeping it short the film fails in its music side one song may work the story and the direction the acting is incredibly laughable. Even Mithun's B grade films are more worth your money than this. The casting is okay meaning for the time it was released and for the characters portrayed. Saif being a rising talent in them days who was know to be a talent when it came to romance tries to pull off the gangster look. Saif could not do it. Sadly this is weaker side of the film. Atul Agnihotri gives superb support in fact he is probably the best thing the film has to offer. Kajol does not impress. The songs in the film are okay at best the only one that makes an impression is 'Tham Zara'.Overall a poor product from Vikram Bhatt like a lot of others he has given us. The film had a lot of patch work and many things that could of made it work. It works for just two things Atul Agnihotri and one of the songs thats all. Don't waste you time on this one its not worth it.1.5 out 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Attending the 2009 Los Angeles Film Festival screening of Bananas! was a freaky surreal experience. This controversial documentary from Sweden almost didn't get shown at all.For the first time in my moviegoing history I bore witness to an odd set of rules which needed to be complied with in order for the film to be exhibited. An agreement between Film Independent sponsors of the Los Angeles Film Festival and Dole a corporation featured in the film forced the Festival to do three things1 The movie was removed from the prestigious Documentary Competition 2 A lengthy disclaimer was handed out to all patrons as they entered the theater 3 Said disclaimer had to be read aloud to the audience prior to the screening.It was made clear by the LA Film Festival representative that they are not eager to be sued. In fact Dole went to court to file an injunction to stop the film from being shown. The judge threw it out saying that she will not consider any request for prior restraint on free speech. Director Fredrik Gertten immediately declared in his impassioned introduction to the screening that he did not endorse the statement of the Festival. This elicited a huge cheer from the audience even though nobody had yet seen the film.So why the controversy? Bananas! documents the history of a lawsuit brought by several Nicaraguan banana plantation workers who were allegedly made sterile by Dole's use of the pesticide DBCP. The Tellez v. Dole Food trial is considered to be a landmark case in the history of workers' rights. The lawyer representing the men colorful Los Angelesbased attorney Juan Dominguez was later accused of helping the plaintiffs commit fraud by lying to the jury. But that finding was made after the film had been shot submitted accepted and scheduled by the Festival. Therefore the larger question is not whether or not the farm workers were telling the truth  but to what extent does a documentary filmmaker have a responsibility to ensure the veracity of his subjects? Is it even required? Or is simply telling the story itself worthy of documenting? There is no question that the workers' stories are moving and poignant nor that some did tell the truth according to the judge who made the decision that fraud had been committed which actually emerged out of a later case.There is no denying that Dole used the chemical in question  their own President and CEO admitted as much in court  even after it had been banned in many countries and even after being taken off the market by Dow its manufacturer for causing sterility. The deplorable working conditions the men endured are vividly captured by Gertten. And the allegations made against Dole by the plaintiffs are truly frightening. But this Erin BrockovitchDavid vs. Goliath tale is rife with issues surrounding the burden of proof.Is it the job of a documentarian to tell the truth? Or to simply observe? That became the subject of a panel discussion after the film's screening not whether or not the case itself was important. And that's a shame.".

For example there is not a recap of the facts by the lawyer who is the main character of the movies. It is a to say and not say we will discover in the court etc. Albeit they might have wanted to avoid legal challenges by Dole they could have been more precise. This is OK for legal thriller a bit less for the documentary.At the end of the day the kids liked it they found it an interesting story and the main message went through.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bananas is like a cookiebatter of all of those early Woody Allen jokes all plopped into a bowl and shaken around. It's a film loaded with political jokes but without a direct focus aside from Cuba and dictators and the like. There are numerous sexual jokes including one of Woody's funniest scenes involving a magazine the buying and holding on a subway very silent comedylike. And even Howard Cosell becomes an iconic figure in Woody's comedy in the brilliant opening scenes. The plot is very loose so if you're looking for that look elsewhere. Also to put it mildly some of the jokes may not work at all for some viewers of today. But it's the goforbroke irreverence of the picture that has it still worth viewing today. Much of Woody's own verbal bits are very good but it's also worth to note how the physical comedy while crude and a little offkey also has a good ring to it. Unlike the director's later films you can still sense that he's trying to 'get' how to make a film and so in trying to do anything he can think of to get a laugh of course some of it doesn't work. For example in Cuba the gag where the gargantuan pile of dung is carried down the stairs with the Lain music in the background gives a grin but not as big a laugh as might be intended. Indeed this might be Woody's most 'immature' film while still containing some of his more biting satirical jabs at dictators and oddball politics. Woody would still have this wild goforbroke style of humor more akin to some of his quirkier short stories in other films of the early 70s. While this isn't as successful in that regard as Sleeper or Love and Death I'd still watch it again if it was on TV even the romantic subplot undercooked in comparison with the rest of the more satirical stuff is interesting.".

Watching this movie today it seems as if it had been somewhat haphazardly written. I get the feeling that Woody Allen had kept a journal in which he noted the funniest sights he'd witnessed and the cleverest oneliners he'd heard over a period of years and then set about mixing all of these totally unrelated funny things into one script. It's like he was saying to himself I think I'll throw in the bit about the guy trying to discreetly buy a sex magazine in a quiet neighborhood store and getting embarrassed and then the snake bite bit later on. But first before the next plot turn I think I'll put in the bit in which a guy gets out of his car and falls into an open manhole. etc. You feel at times like you're watching a Benny Hilltype comedy show or a TV variety show with a series of comedy skits that have nothing at all to do with each other. Somehow Woody blended it all together into a fairly coherent story. There are also a few scenes which feature AirplaneNaked Gunstyle tongueincheek humor. But this movie had been made long before those were even thought of. There's a message in that This movie was ahead of its time. There's a segment of Bananas early on which is just one outrageously funny bit after another after another.   I guess the movie doesn't really have a point . . . except maybe that maniacal dictators are crazy dangerous and should be driven from power . .. or maybe that freedom is worth fighting for . . . or maybe that some causes are worth laying down your life for.

	schema:reviewBody "When asked why he titled his third featurelength picture 'Bananas' Woody Allen replied because there's no bananas in it. This in a nutshell pretty much summarises the general tone of the film. During the first ten years of his directing career it's interesting to see Allen slowly developing his craft as the years go by from 'Take the Money and Run 1969' to 'Sleeper 1973' and culminating in 'Annie Hall 1977' we notice how he learned to assimilate an unrelated collection of gags into a mature cohesive narrative. 'Bananas 1971' sits somewhere in the middle of all this with a more developed story than its predecessors but maintaining its roots as an anarchic comedy much in the same vein as films like 'Duck Soup 1933' and 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail 1975.' Though I had not anticipated enjoying 'Bananas' very much I must say that the film provided countless moments of immeasurable hilarity. Though slightly uneven in parts as is often the case some jokes hit while others miss the film delivers the promised laughs.The storyline is characteristically simple and absurd. After a revolution breaks out in the small South American nation of San Marcos a mediocre unintellectual New Yorker Fielding Mellish Allen travels there to impress his exgirlfriend Louise Lasser. After the fascist government tries to have him assassinated poor Fielding falls in with the rebel gangs somehow eventually becoming the President of the Latin American republic. This absurd plot line allows Allen to pile one gag on top of another and interestingly the story itself never seems to lose its way or go off on any tangents. The film's satirical take on war with the Vietnam War still raging in 1971 was very timely and Allen also aims a few jabs at the media's handling of warfare  in the ridiculous and inspired opening ABC's Wide World of Sports arrives in San Marcos to commentate the assassination of the current President. Later Howard Cosell returns to host the consummation of Fielding's marriage with an enthusiastic crowd watching the awkward couple tussling beneath the covers. 'Bananas' is a type specimen of one of Woody Allen's early funny movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the recommendation of a friend I watched Woody Allen's Bananas. Allen is often portrayed in the media and by critics as an albatross of Hollywood and I really don't have a lot of experience with his films. Besides Bananas I have only seen Match Point which is one of the best films I've ever seen. Being made in 1971 Bananas touches on the activism culture of the time and the USA's involvement in South American politics. Focused around the the fictitious country of San Marcos presumably any number of nationstates the USA was involved in destroying. It opens with the president of San Marcos being assassinated and a general taking the reigns of power in the country.Good afternoon. Wide World of Sports is in the republic of San Marcos where we are going to bring you a live on the spot assassination. They're going to kill the president of this lovely Latin American country and replace him with a military dictatorship.A stronghanded dictator a group of apparently marxist rebels ban together in opposition. Woody Allen's character is living in the States and falls in love with an activist who is looking for support of the people of San Marcos. They make plans together to fly down there in a show of solidarity but his girlfriend breaks up with him in one of the most humorous moments of dialog recorded on film. Because he already had plans to go he visits San Marcos where he is unwittingly joined to the rebel cause.This is a very funny movie especially is you are a fan of Groucho Marx  Allen's influence is quite obvious through lines such as I object your honor! This trial is a travesty. It's a travesty of a mockery of a sham of a mockery of a travesty of two mockeries of a sham.

	onyx:emotionText "At the recommendation of a friend I watched Woody Allen's Bananas. Allen is often portrayed in the media and by critics as an albatross of Hollywood and I really don't have a lot of experience with his films. Besides Bananas I have only seen Match Point which is one of the best films I've ever seen. Being made in 1971 Bananas touches on the activism culture of the time and the USA's involvement in South American politics. Focused around the the fictitious country of San Marcos presumably any number of nationstates the USA was involved in destroying. It opens with the president of San Marcos being assassinated and a general taking the reigns of power in the country.Good afternoon. Wide World of Sports is in the republic of San Marcos where we are going to bring you a live on the spot assassination. They're going to kill the president of this lovely Latin American country and replace him with a military dictatorship.A stronghanded dictator a group of apparently marxist rebels ban together in opposition. Woody Allen's character is living in the States and falls in love with an activist who is looking for support of the people of San Marcos. They make plans together to fly down there in a show of solidarity but his girlfriend breaks up with him in one of the most humorous moments of dialog recorded on film. Because he already had plans to go he visits San Marcos where he is unwittingly joined to the rebel cause.This is a very funny movie especially is you are a fan of Groucho Marx  Allen's influence is quite obvious through lines such as I object your honor! This trial is a travesty. It's a travesty of a mockery of a sham of a mockery of a travesty of two mockeries of a sham. But Woody also brings his own spin which is pretty political  You cannot bash in the head of an American citizen without written permission from the State Department.

One can usually recall a few scenes from a good movie but Bananas is one of those great movies which one can replay in the mind from beginning to end.  Bananas is neatly bracketed at the beginning and end by Howard Cossell playing himself in bizarre Wide World of Sports coverages.  Allen has total control as writer director and lead actor as in his later films but in Bananas the humor is broader and more cinematic. He plays the nebbish Fielding Mellish with less of the existential whining that mars his later films.  There is a youthful resiliance like a toy punching bag that keeps coming back up. That is what made Chaplin's little tramp both comical and endearing.".

Several gags such as the spoof television commercial for 'Old Testament' cigarettes  I smoke them...HE smokes them! quips a priest glancing upwards  the honeymoon consummation scene which is shot like a televised boxing match the trial scene which involves Miss America and J.Edgar Hoover disguised as a black woman could have fitted into any one of the gang's pictures. 'Bananas' was only Woody's second film as director the first being the seminal spoof documentary  yes the genre existed before 'This Is Spinal Tap'  'Take The Money  Run'. It stars our bespectacled hero as 'Fielding Mellish' a products tester who is incredibly unlucky when it comes to girls. Nobody wants to go out with him. He meets and falls for 'Nancy'  Louise Lasser Allen's realwife wife at the time  a political activist keen to end American aid to the banana republic of San Marcos in South America. They have had a revolution there and the country is now being run by a dictator called 'Vargas'. When Nancy breaks off the relationship Mellish flies to San Marcos to find her only to get caught up in the counterrevolution ultimately becoming its new President...As was the case with 'Run' this picture contains all of Allen's usual preoccupations  sex death human relationships. The gags come at you like bullets from a Gatling gun some work better than others. My favourites include Mellish trying to buy a porno magazine dealing with thugs on a subway train  one of whom is played by a young Sylvester Stallone  falling down a manhole as he gets out of his car hurting his back during training with the rebels and being forced to crouch as he joins the queue for food President Vargas thinking he has enlisted aid from the C.I.A. when in fact it is a Jewish organisation  suddenly the streets of San Marcos are teeming with rabbis  and Nancy telling Mellish that 'someone is missing' from their relationship. He asks what it is and she does not know. He replies that if she does not know what it is how does she know its missing? Woody has never made a secret of his love for the Marx Brothers' pictures and their influence is evident. This hails from what what we might term his 'golden age' when along with Mel Brooks he was the best American comedy film maker around. Three films in similar vein followed  'Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask'  1972  'Sleeper'  1973  and 'Love  Death'  1974   before Allen decided to reinvent himself with 'Annie Hall'  1977 .".

	schema:headline " Amusing Satirical Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "When asked why this film is called Bananas Woody Allen is said to have replied Because there are no bananas in it. Given that the action takes place in a military dictatorship in South America the name is presumably a reference to the expression banana republic and possibly also to the phrase go bananas meaning to go crazy.Woody plays Fielding Mellish an early incarnation of the sort of character he was to play in most of his films the perpetually worried neurotic New Yorker although in this case less obviously Jewish than some later Woody characters. Fielding who works as a consumer products tester gets involved with Latin American politics when he falls in love with Nancy a political radical whose pet cause is supporting the guerrillas fighting to overthrow the dictatorial President Vargas of the small Republic of San Marcos. When their relationship comes to an end he decides to visit the country for himself only to become mixed up with the rebels. The film ends with Fielding himself becoming President of San Marcos after a revolution and then on his return to the United States being placed on trial as a subversive.This film was made in 1971 near the beginning of Woody's career and like most of his other early films such as Take the Money and Run Sleeper and Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex. it is a pure comedy without the philosophical depth or analysis of human relationships that were to mark later films such as Annie Hall or Manhattan. The film with which it perhaps has most in common is Sleeper from two years later which also deals in a comic way with the theme of the little man getting mixed up in a rebellion against a dictator. Nancy has something in common with Luna the character played by Diane Keaton in the later film.The main difference between the two films is that Sleeper which is set in an imagined future two centuries hence revolves around physical slapstick humour of the sort familiar from old silent comedies. Although there is some humour of that type in Bananas such as the scene where Fielding tries to demonstrate an exercise machine for busy executives the style of humour is less physical and more satirical particularly in the scenes set in San Marcos.I particularly liked the scene where Vargas receives tribute from the peasants each of whom has to present their President with his weight in dung on his birthday so that he can fertilise his private estates a farcical concept but a suitably surreal and Chaplinesque comment on the politics of dictatorship and there have been some dictators who have made their subjects do things that are almost equally absurd. Some of the satire is aimed at American foreign policy during this period of history the State Department was prepared to support virtually any nonCommunist ruler no matter how oppressive and even Communist ones such as Tito if they were antiRussian on the basis of he may be a son of a bitch but he's our son of a bitch. The trial scenes also very funny can be seen as a critique of the American establishment's McCarthystyle intolerance of any political dissent.This does not however mean that Woody is simply concerned to attach the political Right from a leftwing position. There is plenty here to offend the political Left as well. Nancy is a shallow character a radicalchic funrevolutionary whose support for foreign revolutionary movements owes less to idealism than to a need to bring glamour and excitement into a humdrum existence. Fielding is initially even more shallow his interest in the politics of San Marcos is due to nothing more elevated than his hopes of getting Nancy into bed. Woody's also satirises the Left through the figure of Esposito the Marxist guerrilla leader modelled on Fidel Castro who succeeds in overthrowing Vargas only to prove as powerhungry as the man he has replaced and even more irrational. If there is a political message here it is that there is little point in a revolution which simply exchanges one dictator for another Castro was originally supported by many American liberals who became disenchanted when having overthrown the dictator Batista he failed to hold free elections and instead turned Cuba into a oneparty Communist state and a launchpad for Khrushchev's missiles.I felt that the film started off rather slowly although there are some good scenes even in the early part such as the one where a reporter gives a commentary on the overthrow and assassination of the President of San Marcos in the style of a sports commentary. It soon however picked up and turned into an amusing satirical comedy. It doesn't however have the depth of some of Woody's later films or quite the same biting verbal wit. 710".

Allen is a New York consumer products tester who falls in love with glassyeyed political activist Louise Lasser never really feeling right in this film almost immediately. It is very clear that Allen cares for her much more than she cares for him and he is dismissed. Lovesick and wanting her Allen decides to join a revolution in San Marcos and soon he even becomes the leader of the fighting. Could it actually be possible that Allen could rise to the top and become president of the small land? We get running playbyplay expertise throughout via Howard Cossell playing himself and ABC's Wide World of Sports. Bananas is a very short product only running about 82 minutes but the movie is still pretty impressive nonetheless. Allen's unique brand of storytelling and humor are enough to make Bananas one of his more memorable pictures. Far from a masterpiece the film will be loved more by Woody's fans than most others. 4 stars out of 5.".

When it's funny it's very funny and the film features a number of real stand out moments such as the power mad general dishing out the new laws he's made and of course Allen's neurotic dialogue which is always a treat. However at a number of moments you get the impression that Woody Allen is trying to be funny but he's failing miserably which only serves in being annoying. This is Woody Allen while he was still in his rather immature phase everything before Annie Hall and it shows by way of the rather ludicrous plot which sees Allen losing he girl he is infatuated with on the grounds of him not having leadership qualities. So he goes on the holiday to San Marcos that the two of them were meant to go on and somehow gets caught up with a group rebels there that are trying to provoke a revolution and eventually becomes president. Hey I told you it was silly!In Woody's immature period he had several hit's and misses with Sleeper being at the foot of his filmography and the wonderful Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex at the summit. This one is more hit than miss but to call it an actual 'hit' would be lying. Basically Woody doesn't capitalise on the more interesting parts of the story and instead seems all to keen to show us some slapstick humour. Although this is funny at a number of times this film could have been a biting political satire on how America deals with other nations or maybe even how rebels fail once they come to power. It could have even been an interesting commentary on the superficiality of love. Maybe Allen could have outdone himself and gone for all three! Basically this is a 710 movie where a 1010 one could have been. Don't get me wrong this is definitely a good film and well worth watching particularly for the Woody Allen fan it's just unfortunate that it came at a time when Woody was still a clown.".

	schema:reviewBody "...but certainly not Woody Allen's worst film. While it is hilariously funny it lacks the educated verbal wit of Annie Hall or Manhattan. Although this is obviously not meant to be an intellectual piece. It is done more in the tradition of Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex but were afraid to ask. Of course it puts his recent work to shame. The last semidecent movie Allen has done is Deconstructing Harry and even that wasn't nearly up to his caliber of writing. Curse of the Jade Scorpion and Hollywood Ending and even Small Time Crooks were pitiful attempts at recreating a style that unfortunately has not really been accepted by American society in over twenty years. The best and most recent work of Allen is by far Manhattan Murder Mystery. If you like dumb slapstick and some tacky but sharply hilarious jokes check out BANANAS.".

This is a drama focusing mainly on the bond between brother and sister the importance of family and how much one will risk for those he loves.

	schema:reviewBody "Bandhan is not a film one would want to watch for quality but merely for three hours of mindless fun. It is for the most part a typical and overdone Hindi masala flick which has action romance tons of tears and many songs. However it still can provide a nice watch for the entire family for lovers of Hindi films. Every genre has its fans I'm not a big fan of this genre but I can enjoy it when I'm with family and friends and there is nothing to be taken seriously. Some parts of this movie were actually quite entertaining to me some were unintentionally so. The entire SalmanRambha track when she pretends to be blind in order to trap him was pretty funny. I liked the brothersister relationship portrayed in the film. However unrealistic this movie is this part was to an extent well done. Everything else in the film was oldfashioned platitude particularly Ashwini Bhave's character's corny belief that a woman must never leave her husband's house unless she dies even if he brings another woman home. Jackie Shroff plays the husband who gets trapped by a young prostitute with restraint. Ashwini Bhave does very well as his wife Shweta Menon as the seductress is typical but effective. Rambha is passable in her role and she looks quite pretty. This film however is Salman Khan's film and is made strictly for his fans who certainly will not be disappointed by his work here. He is the reason this film remains watchable even at its most pathetic and intolerable points. There's nothing to rave about Bandhan but I'm not going to be too harsh on it. It's timepass better watched with family and friends nothing more and nothing less.".
