Through incompetence laziness and general uselessness they somehow manage to ride to glory and rescue their company.Despite being thirty years old this film is still delightfully amusing. The French scenery is breathtaking the characters lovable and the jokes simple enough for even someone who cannot totally understand French to comprehend. It reminded me very much of 'Dad's Army' it's a lighthearted romp through a potentially dangerous subject.It is not a cinematic masterpiece. The characters are stereotypical idiots bumbling around falling in rivers losing their shoes. It is not a deep movie. The plot doesn't really make a lot of sense and the direction is not memorable. But it was never aiming to be any of these things.I would class this as a Sunday afternoon film it's not serious and it's perfect to watch lazily on the sofa with a beer in your hand as Sunday lunch goes down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler I remember seeing this as a little girl and how it made me cry when Thomasina runs back through the rain and jumps back through the window to Mary.  I have had cats all of my life and this movie truly captures the love one has for their pet and the anguish one feels over the loss of it.It's a little distracting to watch this film and Mary Poppins too close together since the main two children are the same in both films but they are also wonderfully cast ... particularly Karen Dotrice as Mary.  It's also interesting that the bulk of this tale is told through the eyes and voice of the cat.In essence the story is all about overcoming the pain of loss and finding happiness again.  The father has lost his wife and has become hardened because of it taking it out on his daughter by callously dismissing the feelings she has for her injured pet.  Once the cat dies the daughter shows her disdain for her father by ignoring him and acting as if he doesn't exist.  Into the mix we get a witch who ends up enchanting the father and making him see that love is still possible  not only with her but also between him and his daughter.  He just has to open up to both of them. The end is very heartening which makes it sad that this movie is virtually unknown to the generation that didn't grow up with it.  I have a copy of it on laserdisc and since it is out of print have made VHS copies to give to friends with small children so they can enjoy it as much as I did.If you can find a copy watch it!  Time hasn't lessened it's appeal.".

It's also interesting that the bulk of this tale is told through the eyes and voice of the cat.In essence the story is all about overcoming the pain of loss and finding happiness again.  The father has lost his wife and has become hardened because of it taking it out on his daughter by callously dismissing the feelings she has for her injured pet.  Once the cat dies the daughter shows her disdain for her father by ignoring him and acting as if he doesn't exist.  Into the mix we get a witch who ends up enchanting the father and making him see that love is still possible  not only with her but also between him and his daughter.  He just has to open up to both of them. The end is very heartening which makes it sad that this movie is virtually unknown to the generation that didn't grow up with it.  I have a copy of it on laserdisc and since it is out of print have made VHS copies to give to friends with small children so they can enjoy it as much as I did.If you can find a copy watch it!  Time hasn't lessened it's appeal.";

Thomasina is a foundling cat so named because the family that took her in mistook her for a male cat at first and naturally called him Tom changing it later to the feminised form. This error is a bit of a worry given that the father of the family is a veterinarian Andrew MacDhui pronounced Macdooee played by Patrick McGoohan.MacDhui is a young man of science. His 'booklearning' skills are being sponsored in the local community by his patron the local vicar. Gradually his scientific methods are becoming accepted by the traditionally superstitious farming community. However MacDhui has emotional scar tissue. His wife died five years before leaving him with a young girlchild to raise. Furthermore it is revealed that Macdhui really wanted to be a doctor but was repressed into animal doctoring by his own father. Whilst efficient with the farm beasts MacDhui's lack of sensitivity leads to social disaster when he shows too much willingness to declare old spoiled pets beyond useful life and offer only one option to the petlovers Put 'em doon. 'tis the best thing for the poor creature. Once he applies his strictly rational approach to his own daughter's cat the village society ostracise him. Tragically so does his daughter declaring him as having died when her cat did. Strong stuff.Fortunately for the children in the audiencemuch of the film is made up of the schoolboy adventures of three young lads. They break open the isolation of an eccentric young woman Lori MacGregor Susan Hampshire by taking their various injured animal friends for her to look after she having an instinctive way of healing that has led to her being labelled a witch.Gradually the forces of Rationality and Empathy are brought together as MacDhui and MacGregor seek help one from the other. She needs his surgical skills to repair her patient's broken limbs that cannot be fixed by nursing alone. He eventually calls on her assistance to reach out to his daughter who becomes so emotionally withdrawn that she then physically sickens nearing death.The cat who has been a peripheral character makes a symbolic choice at the climax of the film. Her subplot has been negotiating the mythic nine lives of a cat. After being poot doon by MacDhui she had found her next life in the care of MacGregor. In the final scene MacDhui has to persuade the cat to enter the window of the dying daughters bedroom. His love for his daughter is enough to convince the cat he has learned his lesson and she trusts him enough to jump into his arms. The daughter is resurrected  MacDhui marries MacGregor and the world is all made better.McGoohan is excellent in the keynote role. He expresses both the sensible scientific man and the father bewildered by his daughter's baffling behaviour in a superbly believable manner. He even gets to do some fisticuffs in an ebullient fightscene with the brutal staff of a travelling circus. His Scots accent seems spoton too. Like his other 1960's Disney epic Dr. Syn there is a solid moral plot as well as plenty of interest and excitement. A super film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Three Lives of Thomasina is a very good movie. No questioning this is one of Disney's best liveaction movies. Maybe it's not one of their best known but it sure is one of the great Disney ones. Curiously the movie's title doesn't refer to the traditional nine lives of a cat it refers only to three of them. Curiously the opening scene is made in one of the strangest ways too but I like the way that's made for being quite unusual.The movie can be considered a family drama above all things but it also has numerous moments of fun. There is very little soundtrack unlike in many  if not most  Disney movies but the song Thomasina is nice.The story is set in Scotland particularly in the town of Inveranoch. The year is 1912. The Scottish scenario makes this a very rich production. Words are not enough to describe these scenerieslandscapes dazzling wonderful beautiful magnificent inspiring fantastic completely natural and pure. The purity of nature and the surrounding vistas always make a more than perfect panorama. The pleasant sound of the bagpipes accent the Scottish atmosphere.Our story centers mostly around Andrew MacDhui a cold and distant veterinarian who doesn't show much feelings for pets his daughter Mary and Mary's beloved cat Thomasina. Not only on these characters but also on Mary's friends Hughie Jamie and Geordie.Mary's 3 friends make the movie's funniest moments especially whenever they peek at Lori the beautiful and kind young woman who cures all injured and sick beings and runaway from her. It's hilarious when one of the boys says She's crazy a line which sounds even funnier because of the way he says it and especially because of his English with a Scottish or Scottish gaelic accent.This is the first of 3 films which Matthew Garber and Karen Dotrice star together. Matthew is Geordie Karen is Mary. Both are excellent. The fact that these 2 lovable kids are here is great. It's impossible not to laugh with Geordie. Yet at the same time he is adventurous and carefree he is kind and shy. In any of the 3 movies with Matthew and Karen the funniest of the two is always Matthew.Thomasina is a beautiful orange tabby cat. She doesn't speak per se but in some parts we can hear what she feels. That means a voice narrates her feelings. For me this is a more interesting solution that to literally put them talking moving lips and all. Elspeth March does a great narration job for Thomasina.Susan Hampshire is great in her role as Lori. Patrick McGoohan is tremendous as Andrew MacDhui. The film was directed by Don Chaffey the same man who directed Pete's Dragon.The movie is generally simple but there is a scene with spectacular special effects for its time the sequence which Thomasina is going on a fantasy trip to Cat Heaven and encounters Bast the ancient Egyptian Cat Goddess. Another very well made scene among others is Thomasina's almost funeral.The puppy that Mr. MacDhui tries to offer his daughter is really cute and adorable. Mr. MacDhui changes later in the movie becoming a better person more sensible and generous.This should definitely be on Top 250.".

I know a few vets who would profit from seeing this movie. Many of them seem to have lost sight of the fact that a pet is more than just a paycheck. This was made in the days before the Humane Society and PETA had so much power so I wonder how all the animals fared.

	schema:reviewBody "Mary McDuie Karen Dotrice is a young motherless girl living in Scotland at the turn of the 20th century. Of course she does have her father veterinarian Dr. Andrew McDuie Patrick McGoohan but he's been cold and distant since her mother died. Therefore her only real solace is her cat Thomasina a beautiful orange tabby with personality. It does help that her housekeeper is quite nice and the children of the neighborhood are her dear friends. On the outskirts of the village lives a lady Lori Susan Hampshire who the children think is a WITCH. She does have a yard full of rescued animals and a magic way about healing the creatures. Thomasina goes in and out Mary's bedroom window by the help of a tall tree and often goes out at night. Unhappily Thomasina eats the wrong food becomes sick and appears dead even though Dr. Mac promised to save her. Mary is so upset she ignores everything her father says hinting that he is dead to her. But when the children take the box with Thomasina to the town's edge planning to bury her and hold a funeral the witch appears and scares them away. Only she notices that Thomasina is still alive and takes her home to nurse her. Will Thomasina survive? Will the village drive the witch away? This lovely story has the rarity of being about a cat not a dog and a clever patient one at that. Dotrice is winning as the young girl who dresses her cat in clothes and takes him on buggy adventures. McGoohan is also fine as the stern father and Hampshire is sweet and lovely as Lori. Other cast members scenery costumes script and direction are all nicely fitting. Beware parents that Thomasina appears to die and there are many tears that may fall. However cat lovers Disney fans and family film friends will welcome this title as an oldie but goodie.".

This classic lacks more fame and popularity. It deserves more.The story is set in Scotland. The settings are gorgeous which accents the appeal. Also the lovely sounds of the bagpipes are there to remind us the Scottish environment. Even the soundtrack is enchanting.The story is solid and interesting. Some scenes are harsh and devastating nevertheless the movie is charming. There is a lot to like. To cool down the tense atmosphere of such a depressing story there are a few characters who are a comic relief Mary's friends Geordie Jamie and Hughie.The actors are great and even their Scottish accent is very believable including those who aren't or weren't Scottish. The two charming Mary Poppins's kids are here. Matthew Garber's role is something like a slightly wilder more carefree and more comical version of his own Michael Banks.Lori is a good and beautiful witch. Now where did I hear that only bad witches are ugly? Ah yes it was in 'The Wizard of Oz'. I knew it! Indeed Lori is a witch but a good one. And beautiful too! I hardly even think of her as a witch but as someone kindhearted with some respectable powers used for goodness.I don't know the title of this in Portugal.".

	schema:reviewBody "The presence of Patrick McGoohan one of my favorite actors of the modern era was my motivation for renting out the 1964 Disney picture The Three Lives of Thomasina but as it turns out this charming film has much to offer besides his usual sturdy support. In this one McGoohan doesn't play a secretagent man or gaysmashing king but rather a widower veterinarian named Andrew MacDhui living in the small town of Inveranoch Scotland in 1912 with his young daughter Mary and their 4yearold ginger cat Thomasina. Their peaceful domestic life is shattered when MacDhui is forced to put Thomasina to sleep after the cat contracts tetanus and Mary becomes walled off and unforgiving. Fortunately Thomasina after a surprisingly FXladen dream sequence during which she encounters the Egyptian cat god Bast does return and sets off on life 2.... It is almost impossible to speak of this film even as a middleaged adult without using the words cute and charming. If Paul Gallico's 1957 source novel Thomasina which I have not read is half as appealing as this adaptation it must be very likable indeed. Besides a sweet and compelling story the film offers sterling support by a raft of fine British Irish and Scottish character actors such as Laurence Naismith Wilfrid Brambell who will always be Paul's very clean grandfather to me! and Finlay Currie. Beautiful Susan Hampshire stands out as Lori MacGregor the nature girl witch with a superempathic way with animals and the child actors are all wonderful especially newcomer Karen Dotrice as Mary. Throw in some gorgeous Highland scenery a catchy theme song and even an actionpacked and emotionally fraught finale and you have one winning entertainment indeed as suitable for the adults as the kiddies. Way to go Walt!".

What a rip!Carl Jung finds that the hero's adventure is is fundamental to the collective unconscious. I didn't know about Jung at 7 but I did have a well formed notion of heroes and adventures and I knew that girls did not act as heroes and go off to have adventures and quests. Cartoons such as Mighty Mouse were just plain insulting telling girls that you need to be rescued you cannot solve the problems you face yourself. So I was hungry for this movie. I can only imagine how my tiny face dropped in the dark as I realized that the dead cat living the remainder of its nine lives was the premise of the film.".

There are few cat films of note and Disney's Thomasina can take its place as one of the best in content and performance.

The secondary performers are sterling with the village clergyman and the family's housekeeper especially engaging. Juvenile actress Karen Dotrice as Mary McDhui is superb with her coworker Matthew Garber turning in an excellent performance as her playmate. Dotrice and Garber would one day appear as the Banks siblings in Disney's masterpiece Mary Poppins. A word of warning! Many film viewers today are sensitive to the treatment animals receive during production and sadly Thomasina is marred with the evident abuse its performing feline star receives the poor cat is soaked with water for several rainy scenes and in the dream sequence she appears to have been dropped from a height twisting and turning to regain her balance. Additionally the cat was likely anesthetized for the funeral scene anesthetization during film production is forbidden by today's ASPCA and there are other scenes in which the viewer may wonder not only about the cat's treatment during production but the treatment of other animals as well. The film was made at a time when ASPCA regulations regarding animal abuse during film production were less stringent than today's regulations. A fine film in content and performance but some viewers will have issues with the treatment of the cat during production.".

	schema:reviewBody "Polish filmmaker Andrzej Wajda's 1979 film Maids Of Wilko Panny Z Wilka also translated as Young Girls Of Wilko shows that like such filmmakers as Ingmar Bergman Robert Bresson and Yasujiro Ozu he is an artist more interested in endurances than mere 'scenes.' His characters speak as if philosophers but in a naturalistic style. They are not the hypereducated bourgeoisie of Bergman the spiritual elitists of Bresson nor the everyday philosophes of Ozu. Yet there's something more to them and Wajda than what is on the screen even if the film as a whole fails to reach great heights.His two most famous Polish descendents in cinema Roman Polanski and Krzysztof Kieslowski are filmmakers who believe in indulgence. This is not a comment on the success of their indulgences merely a recognition of them. Polanski for example has a predilection for the Grand Guignol and would have been perfectly at home in the 1920s making silent films alongside the great German Expressionists. Kieslowski on the other hand grew into a filmmaker who heaped visual razzledazzle with spiritual symbolism almost to the point of surfeit. By contrast Wajda's film is a Chekhovian chamber play although most of it is set outdoors. It is one of those works of art in which in answer to a query such as 'What is it about?' the only answer is nothing and everything. It is in a sense akin to Betty Smith's fantastic novel of female maturation in early Twentieth Century America A Tree Grows In Brooklyn save that much of the basics are inverted. The lead in Maids Of Wilko despite its title is a thirtysomething veteran of war. Instead of his eventual departure from his youthful stomping grounds he is returning to them after fifteen years away in the late 1920s since 1922 and '23 are mentioned as being some time ago in which time he was in World War One and ended up a farm manager outside of a big city. The interwar years make this film a historical period piece unlike most of the films of Polanski and Kieslowski which are set in contemporary times and it's interesting to note how similar the characters are to their counterparts in films set in other countries at the same period of time rather than their differences. Maids Of Wilko was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award in 1980 but while it's a very good film it's not a great one and never really soars into the stratosphere. The three other sisters in the film Julia Anna Seniuk Jola Maja Komorowska and Zosia Stanislawa Celinska are not as well defined as Tunia nor Kazia to the point of their being almost interchangeable yet the situations sketched and the actors who play the three other main characters are wonderful. The only semimemorable moment for Jola a blond with a facial mole is when she lectures Wiktor that 'Moral authority is invoked by those who live immoral lives.' By contrast there is one standout scene when Kazia comes to a party in a dress she borrows dances with Wiktor and takes off her eyeglasses that defines her character and the futility of mere words in capturing emotion. It is almost 'pure cinema.' She tips her head backward so he can kiss her but when he does not the look of disappointment on her face is palpable enough to be felt by every viewer. It is a moment no novel nor poem could capture for it forces all the viewers into the same position as they reflect on their own disappointments.It is in moments like this that do not go wasted that Wajda proves he is a great film director even if his overall film falls shy of that claim. Everything in Maids Of Wilko has import if not to a character than to the viewer and that is a rarity. The film is complex without being overly complicated. It plays out like a Bront or Dickens novel with more depth. The same is true for the handsome yet deep Wiktor who never quite learns the power of the word even if I do. It is .".

One that I just watched is 1979's Panny z Wilka The Maids of Wilko in English an adaptation of a short story by Jaroslaw Iwaszkiewicz. Like Nikita Mikhalkov's Burnt by the Sun it shows a man visiting some people in the countryside whom he'd left many years earlier. But unlike that one  in which the unpleasant surprise comes from the visitor  here it's the visitor who gets a surprise.I read that there's speculation that Wajda made this movie palatable to Poland's Sovietbacked authorities so that they wouldn't notice when he made Man of Iron a movie supporting the Labor Solidarity Movement. Whatever the case it's an outstanding movie. I recommend it.PS Maja Komorowska Jola is the cousin of Poland's former Pres. Bronislaw Komorowski.".

One that I just watched is 1979's Panny z Wilka The Maids of Wilko in English an adaptation of a short story by Jaroslaw Iwaszkiewicz. Like Nikita Mikhalkov's Burnt by the Sun it shows a man visiting some people in the countryside whom he'd left many years earlier. But unlike that one  in which the unpleasant surprise comes from the visitor  here it's the visitor who gets a surprise.I read that there's speculation that Wajda made this movie palatable to Poland's Sovietbacked authorities so that they wouldn't notice when he made Man of Iron a movie supporting the Labor Solidarity Movement. Whatever the case it's an outstanding movie. I recommend it.PS Maja Komorowska Jola is the cousin of Poland's former Pres. Bronislaw Komorowski.";

By the end of HC I said to my friend in the theater That was a good movie Christian or not!  And if you're not Christiandon't worry.  The movie is not heavyhanded with a religious message in any way until one scene near the end.  While the acting won't remind anyone of Olivier and Streep it's pretty good.  David Keith 'An Officer And A Gentleman' 'Daredevil' and Mel Harris 'thirtysomething' are very good.  Frank Perettiwho wrote the book Hangman's Curse provides some good comic relief in his role as an eccentric scientist.  I was also impressed that the makers of HC weren't afraid to include a subplot of an interracial romantic relationship.  By far the story is the star of the Hangman's Curse.  It has plenty of plot twists yet they were believable.  My friend solved whowhat was behind the Curse before I did much to my chagrin!  You can tell that HC was not a cheaplymade movie. A few of the night scenes are a little too dark but in other scenes the camera angles and closeups helped maintain the suspense.  Both teenagers and adults will enjoy this movie.  I highly recommend that parents go see it with their teenage kids and discuss the issues of the movie afterward.  It wasn't until I was leaving the theater that I realized that Hangman's Curse had no gory slasher scenes no nudity and no profanity yet was entertaining.  When was the last time you could say that about a mysterythriller film?".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie does a nice job of rendering the book. Granted similar themes have been touched upon as to the aspects of childhood spies and such but there are some deeper themes coming across that need to be remembered.The Primary theme of this first volume of the Veritas Project addresses the growing problem in our schools of bullying and its consequences. Peretti isn't just blowing off steam because of a childhood experiences he's drawing from the studies done in the recent school shootings throughout the United States.The villain in this movie is obviously much more sinister and intelligent than some teenager with an ax to grind and a 3006' but the point is still clearly made.Perhaps this is one of the reasons this movie is rated so low people like to guess at meanings.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie does a nice job of rendering the book. Granted similar themes have been touched upon as to the aspects of childhood spies and such but there are some deeper themes coming across that need to be remembered.The Primary theme of this first volume of the Veritas Project addresses the growing problem in our schools of bullying and its consequences. Peretti isn't just blowing off steam because of a childhood experiences he's drawing from the studies done in the recent school shootings throughout the United States.The villain in this movie is obviously much more sinister and intelligent than some teenager with an ax to grind and a 3006' but the point is still clearly made.Perhaps this is one of the reasons this movie is rated so low people like to guess at meanings.

In the end I liked the movie and would rewatch it when given the chance.  I was quite intrigued about the Springfield family and how they were going to tackle this latest assignment. The acting was good imo. I didn't know the film was based from a book series until now. But after seeing this movie I'm going to check my local bookshop for this book.

	schema:reviewBody "Hangman's Curse is an adaptation of a book by a Christian author Frank Peretti published by a Christian publisher and promoted by Christian bookstores. But the religious aspects of the book are soft peddled in favor of elements intended to make it appeal to a wider audience interested in a traditional mild horror film. There is an obvious agenda but it does not overwhelm the story mostly they wanted to present a positive message for Christian kids in an uncharacteristically cool package and to show that being Christian does not mean a kid has to be a total dork.The agenda does have a dark side a simplistic message that being different and asserting your individuality is a misguided response to facing life's challenges without the assist of inner spirituality. Some may view the film's ending message as antidiversity although it positively portrays interracial dating it ends with a conformist message. But this is inserted in such a clumsy and contrived way that few will feel any threat of manipulation.The compromises they made to mainstream this film have offended both extremist Christians and hard core horror film fans which is not exactly a surprise. Extremist Christians are upset because the Christians in the film seem to be just like regular their wordnot mine people. There has also been some objection to the wardrobe of Leighton Meesier the actress who poses as a student to investigate the situation although it looked pretty wholesome to me Meesier's actual sin is just being radiantly beautiful. If your own faith does not run toward elitist religious egoism you will find almost nothing objectionable. Hardcore horror fans will find this fairly tame although the premise is clever and there are some nice suspenseful moments.The cast is mostly unexceptional and in many cases the physical casting is way off. The jocks are anything but physically imposing the main bully would do better cast as a fat nerd and has no business in a speaking role. Crystal and Ian the two main goth kids are supposed to be outcasts but they are the most physically attractive students in the whole school.The performance of Andrea Morris Crystal is the best thing about Hangman's Curse. She is totally convincing in the film's most difficult role. It is a great acting for the camera performance and the director showcases this with frequent tight shots on her face. Meesier is also solid and Frank Peretti himself makes an amusing appearance as an eccentrically jolly scientist.The direction and editing is very strong. The sequencing keeps things active and interesting. Apparently they deleted material that was needed to clarify the effects of the spider bites that the victims did not die but rather went into comas until the anecdote was discovered and administered is unclear.Then again what do I know?

	schema:reviewBody "I read some of the other comments that people left about this film and found many of them to be very biased for or against. I think it is pretty silly to criticize the film for being too Christian when it is of course written by a Christian author. That is like complaining that your ice cream is cold creamy and sweet. If anything the Christian message was toned down. Some of the criticism was that the movie was too much like an after school special. I suppose that this criticism is intended to complain against the movie being written with a moral and with the intent of reaching a youthful audience. But again I ask why criticize something for being what it is intended to be? This movie clearly WAS written to teach a moral and reach a youth audience and it did a decent job of it all the while keeping the viewer entertained. Frankly anyone who believes that secular movies are not preaching a message are naive. Every writer intentionally or unintentionally inevitably pours their beliefs and biases into their work. In our society this is fine unless the message happens to be from a Christian perspective. Then it is branded as preachy or religious and dismissed as propaganda by the disingenuous as though all other genres are innocent of such bias. I enjoy watching both Christian AND secular movies... but I am not duped into believing that one is selling a message and the other is not.I've seen many Christian films and they often suffer from bad scripts bad acting bad production and bad soundtrack. Some get one or two aspects right rarely do they get them all right. This movie had good production good soundtrack and a good script. Overall the acting was good also though Frank Peretti should not have allowed himself to be cast in this film. I love Frank's books he is an awesome writer but we can't expect to be good at everything and movie acting is not his talent. He played the character way over the top becoming a parody... like someone out of an episode of Scooby Doo. Had he done the wise thing and insisted on a professional actor to play the professor it would have improved this movie but don't let this one sour point stop you from seeing this film. Especially if you are a parent with 12 to 16 year olds because this is a movie that you can watch with them without ever having to worry about surprise nudity or foul language. I get so annoyed with writers who have no imagination and believe that a movie is unauthentic if the characters don't curse every third word from their mouths. I see Bogart Cagney Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne films that are just as compelling today as back in the day when they were made and guess what!! ...No Foul Language! Imagine that! I'd like to see more films made like Hangman's Curse that are able to keep me interested without resorting to swears and sex. For it's genre and intended audience I give it a slightly generous 8 out of 10.".

It also has Mel Harris Thirtysomething David Keith Firestarter Billy Moses Mystic Pizza and some rather talented teen actors  Meester and Smith.  HC is intended for a teen audience and if they are not overly discriminating they should enjoy it.  It isn't terribly preachy like many Christian movies and the plot is actually interesting before it becomes obvious who the villain is.  The Christianity is sort of sprung on us at the end.  There are hints of it during the film and there are some insightful digs at the naturalistic worldview but there could have been more obvious examples during the first hour graduating into the expressions of faith later on.  At nearly two hours HC is also a bit too long and it could have been shaved during editing to pick up the leisurely pace.  I got my copy at WalMart for 10. It is also available at Christian book stores. It's worth seeing and it's a start  hopefully if they do another one they'll be able to excise the annoying bits.  Someone should write them.".

This movie goes to show what passes for entertainment todayAs for the scare factor i was more frightened by the Mr. Rodger's neighborhood Halloween special it did give off a nice glow on my television while i was playing a board game with my friends though that's the only compliment they will get from me.".

It was much better than I thought it was going to be and well adapted to the screen. As always with films based on books there were some plot changes although not major ones. Minor changes in plot details didn't bother me and seemed better for the screen than what was in the book. In some places there was some cheesy acting but overall the acting was decent. The characterization and plot development is excellent with just the right amount of clues to logically lead to the ending. This film is a good mix of action suspense light humor and family wholesomeness. I highly recommend this film.".

I rented this because I wrote a spider story recently called Bite of the Spider on the Reality Check Anthology. Peretti is a talented writer and this is a must watch for those who are want to get familiar with his style of writing. Expect a lot of Christian themes in his work and this is no different in that way.This is a dark movie though elements of Peretti appear in the characters and Dr. Wheeling is Perretti's quirk. As Stephen King does cameo in his movies Peretti plays an active role in this one. I want to try and get a copy of this book the ending is one to expect when if you are reading Peretti's books. A friend of mine swears by his work. I am surprised this movie got bad reviews but Mr. Peretti if you are reading this you should bring your masterpiece to life  titled The Oath or This Present Darkness. Being what you were able to do with this movie  it is a good moment to unleash that book onto the big screen. You should be the one writing it instead of a crew of screen writers. I think if Peretti actually wrote the screen play this thing would be a classic in this style of films. This one does have an element of Hitchcock and got to love the use of the spiders in the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hangman's Curse shows a remarkable improvement in Christian film for it's storyline and it's photography. Frank Peretti novels are an excellent basis for films they have so much complexity and suspense to make for an interesting film. And the photography in this film is top nouch much better than the soap opera treatment most Christian films get. This film look stunning and although this book was written for a bigger budget the special effects are pretty good. What I think I liked most about this film instead of making it cater to the teen audience by adding horrendous drinking drug use and loads of premarital sex it concentrates on providing an interesting story and teaches good lessons about being accepting and being careful of what you say to other people as well. Hangman's Curse could have been much scarier the book is downright bonechilling even for a kids novel. This of course is partly due to the special effects the able Frye scenes are the hurt the most although if I made this film I think it could have been much scarier if there was no high contrast when able would pop up on the screen if they just saw able hanging there with no effect. That would have been cooler anyway the effects here are soso and therefore the scares are soso. The acting is the low point for the film THE REALLY low point. The acting here is terrible whereas the story and photography of the film is the best I have seen in Christian film this has to be the worst in Christian film. It's absolutely terrible. The only actors here that shine are David Keith and the girl that plays his daughter she's a very promising young actress. Giving a great performance. Christian films from Christian film companies ie not The Passion of The Christ which was given a 30 million dollar budget from mel Gibson haave a long way to go before being respected me thinks but Hangman's Curse is definitely a step in the right direction with The Passion of The Christ and Luther I think Christian film has what it takes to become great.".

So the central message of this film is the question how to manage the fact of a terrible loss. On one side we have the main character a farmer from the swiss jura that has lost his child in an accident. On the other side we have the two kosovians brother and sister who also suffered a terrible loss during the kosovian war and took refuge to Switzerland. Both parties had an extreme encounter with death yet they react totally different to it. This is the chance for the farmer to learn that there are other ways to resolve a situation of grief and sorrow.That's also where he gets cornered between two lives he could chose. On one hand his wife full of agony who has to get medical treatment. On the other hand his new kosovian girlfriend that surprises him with her will to live.Wherever the movie was shown always one thing surprised me. At the end nobody moved nobody talked the people just sat still and remained silent. I guess the ability to absorb an entire audience in such a way is rather extraordinary and deserves a high score hence 910.".

And while the movie is slow and achingly sad at the beginning it is by no means a difficult or abstract film to watch. The people though they are clearly superb actors in a drama and not documentary subjects are as earthy as they come and they are real to the viewer in the way that great actors in a classic play are real the main character brings to mind the great Bruno Ganz. The picture was shot in Switzerland in a region I am myself familiar with and the stark and beautiful landscape provides a wonderful metaphor for the foreground drama.

Lot's of irony here with a man who's life has been forever altered by fire who because of that he prohibits the use of any fire on his property despite the winter which has set in. He ends up being in front of an inferno of flames everyday at his foundry job. Meanwhile as the ember of love seems to die out from his marriage new sparks ignite with another woman. The husband and wife are going through an emotional and mental meltdown while the brother and sister and their family are going through a refiring of their mental and emotional sate of being. Long Winter Without Fire has a cold icy look and feel to it. Marie Matheron as Laure and Gabriella Muskala as Labinota turn in fine performances.

	schema:reviewBody "The title of this film isn't very catchy even in the original French but it gives fair warning of what's to come a motion picture in which much is to be endured and little is to be enjoyed. Tout un hiver is a glimpse at crosscultural encounters that might put a Swiss mountain farm couple's hardship into perspective when the husband gets to know some refugees from Kosovo who've suffered much greater horrors. Jean Aurlian Recoing and his wife Laure Marie Matheron have lost most of their livestock in a fire that killed their fiveyearold daughter. Laure has lost her mind as a result and Jean puts her into a psychiatric clinic a step that Laure's possessive sister Valrie Nathalie Boulin seems to ill approve of.Jean must get work at a steel mill to pay debts and that is where he meets the Kosovar refugees working there including Kastriot Blerim Gjoci and his sister Labinota Gabriela Muskala. Jean is drawn to Labinota perhaps because she seems as griefridden and bereft as he does. Her husband disappeared six years ago when soldiers murdered a whole community. He may have been killed or he may have escaped but she is still waiting. Kastriot is friendly to Jean and invites him to Kosovar social gatherings he hides his own traumas but at times has a short fuse. The Kosovars have seen their families raped their throats cut their houses burned to the ground.The harsh but spectacular Jura mountain landscapes are a big player in this film. Cinematographer Witold Piciennik's cinematography is impeccable and sometimes uniquely lovely. His closeups of the principals spare us nothingthere's no escape from the fact that Recoing's and Gjoci's faces are genuinely expressive but the two ladies are overplaying their melodramatic roles Matheron far too exaggeratedly nutty and Muskala too pathetic and sweet.Jean considers selling everything and moving somewhere else a new start. Laure who is perhaps beginning to become coherent again is not enthusiastic. But like the rest of the story this issue is something we keep going back and forth on without any resolution.There's heavyhanded symbolism about crows against the snow fire forbidden in the farm and big fire at the steel mill. Where is the Polishborn and trained Swissadopted director Zglinski going with all this? The editing is relentlessly arcless when we think Laure may be better we glimpse her engaging a a long mad scream of pain. Though Laure comes out of the clinic and Jean has some warm times with the quietly accepting and ultimately cheerful Labinota there's no sense of resolution no sense indeed that we've gotten anywhere. Zglinski is obviously interested in the contrast between the warm Kosovars parallel to the warmer and wilder Poles he knows from his own experience and the more stoical and shutdown Swiss. But that's just a given not a source of any revelations. As if the parents' terrible grief weren't enough everything else seems exaggerated. The Kosovars are a little too celebratory and unpredictable. The insurance assessor is a dry mincing creep out of Dickens. The possessive sister almost seems to have a lesbian attachment to Laure. The steel mill camaraderie has a consistently menacing and nasty air about it. One leaves with a sodden feel of unmitigated grimness.Seen at the SFIFF April 2006.".

	schema:headline " mild thoughtful and typically European";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie's Europeanism is so conspicuous right from the beginning until the very end. The overall surroundings and thematic undertones make room for no speculations and discussions. Such is the weight of a European movie which though decently acted and directed lacks the technical and visual grandiosity which we are used to seeing in American projects. The movie is touching with a storytelling confined within a very dull way of living. It focuses on the weary life of a Swiss family which struggles to get by in an unsettling environment of a lowkey community. On the other hand there is an Albanian family brother  sister which happens to be living in the same community after previously being evicted from their homeland Kosovo.Kosovo has suffered a bitter war with the ruling regime applying an ethnic cleansing and eventually taking reign of the province. The war is over now and the regime is out but its presence over the years has forced many ethnic Albanians to flee the ever threatening atmosphere and seek refuge wherever they encountered open doors. One of the open doors was Switzerland which boasts one of the biggest Albanian communities in Europe. The family which the movie talks about has been warmly integrated in this community and now it's up to them to survive the demanding reality. Therefore the Albanian man finds a job at a metal factory where he befriends the Swiss man who represents the native aspect of the story. So the smart thing here is that the director has managed to find the commonness between the refugee and the native inhabitant whose weary lives have led them up to striving for the same thing money for living! The native Swiss is a decent man industrious by nature and characterized by a cold Europeanlike reticence. Whereas the Albanian is much of a lovely man warm and friendly  he is hardworking and intrinsically humane. The virtue that the director wants to give importance to from both characters is affection and dignity. He makes the characters to exhale their inner emotions whatever their visible traits seem to be. The men become good friends they spend time together and they develop a sense of mutual belonging. During the film there are a couple of scenes which splendidly depict the way Albanians spend time together in mass gatherings celebrating and nativedancing. That's beautiful for sure! These scenes also depict the nostalgia that they feel for their fatherland which they have been forcefully estranged from. To mess the things up the director plays with the pride of the Albanian man. He creates a secret relationship between two characters which will ultimately make things take an unintended direction which in fact will happen to be very distracting.As I said this is a mild movie with a selfnarrative storytelling. It is more about Albanians in Switzerland than the Swiss family itself. If you are curious to know about this then this movie is worth watching. 610".

	onyx:emotionText "The movie's Europeanism is so conspicuous right from the beginning until the very end. The overall surroundings and thematic undertones make room for no speculations and discussions. Such is the weight of a European movie which though decently acted and directed lacks the technical and visual grandiosity which we are used to seeing in American projects. The movie is touching with a storytelling confined within a very dull way of living. It focuses on the weary life of a Swiss family which struggles to get by in an unsettling environment of a lowkey community. On the other hand there is an Albanian family brother  sister which happens to be living in the same community after previously being evicted from their homeland Kosovo.Kosovo has suffered a bitter war with the ruling regime applying an ethnic cleansing and eventually taking reign of the province. The war is over now and the regime is out but its presence over the years has forced many ethnic Albanians to flee the ever threatening atmosphere and seek refuge wherever they encountered open doors. One of the open doors was Switzerland which boasts one of the biggest Albanian communities in Europe. The family which the movie talks about has been warmly integrated in this community and now it's up to them to survive the demanding reality. Therefore the Albanian man finds a job at a metal factory where he befriends the Swiss man who represents the native aspect of the story. So the smart thing here is that the director has managed to find the commonness between the refugee and the native inhabitant whose weary lives have led them up to striving for the same thing money for living! The native Swiss is a decent man industrious by nature and characterized by a cold Europeanlike reticence. Whereas the Albanian is much of a lovely man warm and friendly  he is hardworking and intrinsically humane. The virtue that the director wants to give importance to from both characters is affection and dignity. He makes the characters to exhale their inner emotions whatever their visible traits seem to be. The men become good friends they spend time together and they develop a sense of mutual belonging. During the film there are a couple of scenes which splendidly depict the way Albanians spend time together in mass gatherings celebrating and nativedancing. That's beautiful for sure! These scenes also depict the nostalgia that they feel for their fatherland which they have been forcefully estranged from. To mess the things up the director plays with the pride of the Albanian man.

	schema:headline " For A Few Nuggets More";
	schema:reviewBody "Although it doesn't rival director John Huston's legendary classic The Treasure of the Sierra Madre 1948 with Humphrey Bogart The Ruthless Four qualifies as a taunt entertaining little Spaghetti western that ranks several Stetsons above its European competitors. Roughly speaking for the sake of simplicity Spaghetti westerns can be classified in three groups the traditional Sergio Leone epics with bounty hunters galore in the arid Southwest such as For A Few Dollars More 1965 while the nontraditional Spaghetti westerns varies the settings or protagonists principally Sergio Corbucci's The Big Silence 1968 where the action occurred closer to the Canadian border than the dusty Mexican border as was the Leone custom. Corbucci's offbeat westerns steer clear of traditional elements preferring to rearrange them as exemplified in Corbucci's Django 1966 where the hero dragged around a coffin with a Gatling gun style machine gun in it. Mind you Corbucci made westerns that accommodated all three groups but his different westerns emerge with greater prominence. Navajo Joe 1966 with Burt Reynolds as the Native American protagonist qualified as another example of an out of the ordinary Corbucci oater. Similarly director Lucio Fulci's Four Gunmen of the Apocalypse 1975 is another example of this different breed of European western. The third group is Corbucci inspired too the Mexican revolution westerns. Leone rode around this subgenre until he helmed Duck You Sucker in 1973. These westerns usually featured a mercenary as the protagonist such as Franco Nero in The Mercenary 1968 and Companeros 1970 who sold his services to the highest bidder during the war between the corrupt Mexican government and the poor peons at the dawn of the 20th century. Typically however he reformed by the finale to take sides with the peons. Marxist theorists would crave these yarns for their political ramifications. Admittedly this analysis reduces the entire Spaghetti western genre to a single bullet in the cylinder of a Colt's .45 revolver.The Ruthless Four fits into the second group of Spaghetti westerns in terms of its protagonists. Sam Cooper Van Heflin of Shane excels as a crusty old prospector who strikes pay dirt with his partner at a remote mine carved out of a slope in the middle of nowhere. Cooper's partner doublecrosses him and tries to kill him but Cooper outsmarts his adversary and kills him in a mine explosion. Cooper barely survives the journey of hardship back to town. Along the way human carrion steals his pack horses at gunpoint and leaves him stranded at a river with his goods strewn around him. Cooper gathers what little that he can carry then does something that no other character has ever done before in any Spaghettimuch less an Americanwestern he pours out the gold that he cannot tote into the river! Sam Cooper has a moral compass that doesn't deviate from the right setting and this explains his longevity. Once he reaches town Cooper decides to wire a 100 dollars to a kid that he helped raise before he turned to prospecting. He realizes that he cannot trust a partner after his last experience so he beckons for Manolo Sanchez George Hilton of Sartana's Coming Get Your Coffins Ready to join him. Unfortunately Cooper doesn't realize that Manolo has grown into a man who is drastically different from the boy that Cooper raised. First Manolo is a liar a cardsharp and cheat second Manolo is in cahoots with an enigmatic but evil hombre named 'Brent the Blond' Klaus Kinski of And God Said to Cain who dresses like a preacher drinks milk in the saloon and proves as deadly as a rattlesnake. Later after they reach the mine and we actually see them excavating rocks Brent looks like death personified with a pickax instead of a scythe. He wears a cloak and the dust from their exertions covers his striking features so that he resembles the Grim Reaper. Manolo's inclusion of Brent surprises Cooper so much that he convinces a man with a grudge against him Mason the incomparable Gilbert Roland of Any Gun Can Play to come along with them as he tells the others because four men can dig more gold than three. Earlier Manolo had used this idea to justify Brent accompanying them. This uneasy quartet spends the rest of the movie keeping their suspicious eyeballs on each other. Mason blames Cooper for his incarnation in a Florida prison and his subsequent contraction of malaria.Director Giorgio Capitani stages a firstclass gunfight at the ruins of a monastery as our heroes head off into the desert for the mine. The elaborate pretense that Mason and Brent engage in prior to the shootout is clever. They want to have their guns in hand without the villains noticing that they have drawn them. Inconspicuously our protagonists rely on sleight of hand to remove each other's pistol without attracting attention. This way Mason and Brent can start blazing away a lot sooner at their ambushers. The unusual relationships that exist between the protagonists generate considerable tension throughout this 96minute melodrama. The characters are more complex than in the usual Spaghetti.

	onyx:emotionText "Although it doesn't rival director John Huston's legendary classic The Treasure of the Sierra Madre 1948 with Humphrey Bogart The Ruthless Four qualifies as a taunt entertaining little Spaghetti western that ranks several Stetsons above its European competitors. Roughly speaking for the sake of simplicity Spaghetti westerns can be classified in three groups the traditional Sergio Leone epics with bounty hunters galore in the arid Southwest such as For A Few Dollars More 1965 while the nontraditional Spaghetti westerns varies the settings or protagonists principally Sergio Corbucci's The Big Silence 1968 where the action occurred closer to the Canadian border than the dusty Mexican border as was the Leone custom. Corbucci's offbeat westerns steer clear of traditional elements preferring to rearrange them as exemplified in Corbucci's Django 1966 where the hero dragged around a coffin with a Gatling gun style machine gun in it. Mind you Corbucci made westerns that accommodated all three groups but his different westerns emerge with greater prominence. Navajo Joe 1966 with Burt Reynolds as the Native American protagonist qualified as another example of an out of the ordinary Corbucci oater. Similarly director Lucio Fulci's Four Gunmen of the Apocalypse 1975 is another example of this different breed of European western. The third group is Corbucci inspired too the Mexican revolution westerns. Leone rode around this subgenre until he helmed Duck You Sucker in 1973. These westerns usually featured a mercenary as the protagonist such as Franco Nero in The Mercenary 1968 and Companeros 1970 who sold his services to the highest bidder during the war between the corrupt Mexican government and the poor peons at the dawn of the 20th century. Typically however he reformed by the finale to take sides with the peons. Marxist theorists would crave these yarns for their political ramifications. Admittedly this analysis reduces the entire Spaghetti western genre to a single bullet in the cylinder of a Colt's .45 revolver.The Ruthless Four fits into the second group of Spaghetti westerns in terms of its protagonists. Sam Cooper Van Heflin of Shane excels as a crusty old prospector who strikes pay dirt with his partner at a remote mine carved out of a slope in the middle of nowhere. Cooper's partner doublecrosses him and tries to kill him but Cooper outsmarts his adversary and kills him in a mine explosion. Cooper barely survives the journey of hardship back to town. Along the way human carrion steals his pack horses at gunpoint and leaves him stranded at a river with his goods strewn around him. Cooper gathers what little that he can carry then does something that no other character has ever done before in any Spaghettimuch less an Americanwestern he pours out the gold that he cannot tote into the river! Sam Cooper has a moral compass that doesn't deviate from the right setting and this explains his longevity. Once he reaches town Cooper decides to wire a 100 dollars to a kid that he helped raise before he turned to prospecting. He realizes that he cannot trust a partner after his last experience so he beckons for Manolo Sanchez George Hilton of Sartana's Coming Get Your Coffins Ready to join him. Unfortunately Cooper doesn't realize that Manolo has grown into a man who is drastically different from the boy that Cooper raised. First Manolo is a liar a cardsharp and cheat second Manolo is in cahoots with an enigmatic but evil hombre named 'Brent the Blond' Klaus Kinski of And God Said to Cain who dresses like a preacher drinks milk in the saloon and proves as deadly as a rattlesnake. Later after they reach the mine and we actually see them excavating rocks Brent looks like death personified with a pickax instead of a scythe. He wears a cloak and the dust from their exertions covers his striking features so that he resembles the Grim Reaper. Manolo's inclusion of Brent surprises Cooper so much that he convinces a man with a grudge against him Mason the incomparable Gilbert Roland of Any Gun Can Play to come along with them as he tells the others because four men can dig more gold than three. Earlier Manolo had used this idea to justify Brent accompanying them. This uneasy quartet spends the rest of the movie keeping their suspicious eyeballs on each other. Mason blames Cooper for his incarnation in a Florida prison and his subsequent contraction of malaria.Director Giorgio Capitani stages a firstclass gunfight at the ruins of a monastery as our heroes head off into the desert for the mine. The elaborate pretense that Mason and Brent engage in prior to the shootout is clever. They want to have their guns in hand without the villains noticing that they have drawn them. Inconspicuously our protagonists rely on sleight of hand to remove each other's pistol without attracting attention. This way Mason and Brent can start blazing away a lot sooner at their ambushers. The unusual relationships that exist between the protagonists generate considerable tension throughout this 96minute melodrama. The characters are more complex than in the usual Spaghetti. The Augusto Grand Slam Caminito and Fernando Di Leo Mr. Scarface screenplay makes the subtle implication that Manolo and Brent are homosexuals.'The Ruthless Four differs from most Spaghetti westerns.

	schema:reviewBody "If you're a Western movie genre fan you've probably caught the classics Shane and 310 to Yuma with Van Heflin in prominent supporting roles. The surprise in The Ruthless Four is that Heflin leaves both of those prior characterizations firmly in the dust with a strong lead role as Sam Cooper a grizzled gold prospector who's saddled with a trio of partners when his plans called for only one man he could trust. Coming near the end of his career Heflin pulls out all the stops to give a noteworthy performance and I'd be hard pressed to come up with another that was any better than this.Rounding out the 'ruthless' quartet finds George Hilton portraying Cooper's adopted son Manolo Klaus Kinski as Manolo's enigmatic former companion and Gilbert Roland's Mason hired on by Cooper to keep the others honest while he's trying to cover his own back. The homosexual subtext between Manolo and Brent the Blonde Kinski is the subject of a couple of quick teases in the story and is never fully developed. However there's not much more explanation for Brent's intrusion into the expedition which gives Cooper some pause as to Manolo's reliability. It's also not immediately apparent that Mason Roland will prove honorable by the time the film winds down so that gives the picture another hook to keep the viewer interested. On top of all that you've got a pair of brother bad guys hovering around on the fringe of the action hoping to cash in by the time the picture's over.However it all could have gone down hill with a puzzling opening scene when Sam Cooper's original partner in the gold dig turns on him with the idea of taking it all for himself. Those kinds of scenes always bothered me when I was growing up  here was a gun man who had the drop on his partner with the intention of killing him and then he doesn't kill him. I mean why leave anything to chance when you can win the whole ball of wax right there. But instead in an attempt to what be fair? the guy challenges his foe to draw down. When anything can happen and it usually does the villain loses and it serves him right for being such an idiot.And how about when Cooper was waylaid by the bandits who stole his horses but left the gold sacks? What movie were they watching? Come to think of it how did one of the bandits get behind Cooper to knock him out with a rock? Cooper had his back to the river and it wasn't like he couldn't keep an eye on all of his attackers. Just a very clumsy scene that didn't make very much sense to me.But get beyond those couple of examples and the rest of the story is pretty intriguing with some interesting twists and turns that move the picture to a climactic showdown. This had to be the only time I ever saw a cowboy on horseback use an umbrella in the rain Manolo and Kinski ordering up a glass of milk in the saloon was definitely an oddity. The only sure thing if you can call it that would be that Van Heflin would come out pretty much as he went in as last man standing. How each of his partners fared well that's for you to find out as this wasn't called The Ruthless Four for nothing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sam Cooper Van Heflin is a gold prospector who discovers a mine filled with gold but his partner tries to kill him but before he does Sam gets him. Riding back to town his robbed of his horses but not his gold. Too heavy to carry all of it he dumps some in the river and hides the rest. When he arrives in town he sends a message for his adopted possibly homosexual son Manolo Sanchez George Hilton to see if he wants to be his partner and go back up to the mind. After Manolo arrives in town so does the mysterious Brent Klaus Kinski who gets in with the deal because of Manolo. Not trusting what has happen Sam asks Mason Gilbert Rolanda long time army buddy who now has a grudge against him to tag along so his not backstabbed and he agrees only if he gets 50 of his share. So now the conniving begins when the four head out for this mine.The Ruthless Four is one of many spaghetti westerns that flooded the mid to late 60's but something about this ItalianGerman production that stood out from the rest for me. It's not I think it's brilliant but actually the simple story which at times felt like it came across more out of something of Hollywood is a curious piece. Its hard to put my finger on it sure it didn't entirely blow me away but this a sturdy spaghetti western is done with buckets of chic and grit. Though I warn you if your looking for a abundance of wild and overthetop violence you'll surely be disappointed as they only come in small doses. But when they do occur that's when the flair kicked in with well mounted shootouts and showdowns even if they do lack some sort of sting well except for a certain bloody showdown between Brent and Sam. But like I typed earlier these are far and in between plenty of sequences involving a lot chat confrontations accusations and scheming. That's basically what happens in the first half of the film but when the four head out to the mine that's when things kinda get going with a change of pace in the plot. It's more about the effects of paranoia and greed with these shifty man trying to knock each other off or teaming up to get this gold no matter what. There's always something going on to keep you glued.What makes up for the slow going nature is the encroaching camera shots that seem to have a mind of its own! It rather was dynamic especially amongst the upbeat moments. And also Klaus Kinski performance his venomous persona soared above the rest and added a lot to proceedings. His sly character didn't say too much but the his appearance and blistering stare were just unsettling. In my eyes he also makes a grand first appearance on screen. Just like in most spaghetti westerns the camera work is prominent but so is the score and landscape. Here is no exception but the score that flooded the film was rather bloated and bombarded some scenes without grace. But not enough to really tick me off. Now the location well the harsh rocky terrain where most of the film took place truly helped portray the rough and cruelty of the ever changing face of the west.The well rounded characters and story builds on a remarkably persuasive script it wasn't particularly hammy like I thought it might be. Sure there were some things left up in the air but it didn't damage the story at all. It was more up to you to decide on certain things that were hinted. While the other three performances from Gilbert Roland Van Heflin and George Hilton were nothing but terrific.Solid spaghetti western caper. It's something a bit different but I would definitely recommended it if only for Kinski's performance. Give it a chance you might be surprised?".

	onyx:emotionText "Sam Cooper Van Heflin is a gold prospector who discovers a mine filled with gold but his partner tries to kill him but before he does Sam gets him. Riding back to town his robbed of his horses but not his gold. Too heavy to carry all of it he dumps some in the river and hides the rest. When he arrives in town he sends a message for his adopted possibly homosexual son Manolo Sanchez George Hilton to see if he wants to be his partner and go back up to the mind. After Manolo arrives in town so does the mysterious Brent Klaus Kinski who gets in with the deal because of Manolo. Not trusting what has happen Sam asks Mason Gilbert Rolanda long time army buddy who now has a grudge against him to tag along so his not backstabbed and he agrees only if he gets 50 of his share. So now the conniving begins when the four head out for this mine.The Ruthless Four is one of many spaghetti westerns that flooded the mid to late 60's but something about this ItalianGerman production that stood out from the rest for me. It's not I think it's brilliant but actually the simple story which at times felt like it came across more out of something of Hollywood is a curious piece. Its hard to put my finger on it sure it didn't entirely blow me away but this a sturdy spaghetti western is done with buckets of chic and grit. Though I warn you if your looking for a abundance of wild and overthetop violence you'll surely be disappointed as they only come in small doses. But when they do occur that's when the flair kicked in with well mounted shootouts and showdowns even if they do lack some sort of sting well except for a certain bloody showdown between Brent and Sam. But like I typed earlier these are far and in between plenty of sequences involving a lot chat confrontations accusations and scheming. That's basically what happens in the first half of the film but when the four head out to the mine that's when things kinda get going with a change of pace in the plot. It's more about the effects of paranoia and greed with these shifty man trying to knock each other off or teaming up to get this gold no matter what. There's always something going on to keep you glued.What makes up for the slow going nature is the encroaching camera shots that seem to have a mind of its own!

After being robbed by some bandits Heffin must leave his gold behind and head back to the city where he asks his stepson George Hilton to go back and get the gold with him. The stepson agrees to go but is forced into taking an ex partner Klaus Kinski and even Heffen is forced to bring along a man Gilbert Roland and soon all four are looking over their shoulders. This is far from a great film but it has a terrific cast and a very good story which makes this a worthy addition to the good titles that this genre has given us. The music score really hurts the film as it sounds out of place but outside of this everything else works just fine. What works the best are the terrific performances with Heffen leading the way. Just take a look at the early scene when his character is dragging himself out of the desert and nearing death from lack of water. I'm not sure what Heffen did to look the part but it's rather amazing to watch him. Kinski playing that mysterious silent man is terrific as well and makes for a great villain. Roland also delivers a fine performance as the calmer bandit and Hilton is good although can't really touch the other three men. There are a couple classic shoot outs in the film with an excellent one coming half way through the film. The direction is also nice throughout and there's some wonderful scenery as well.".

George Hilton has basically confirmed in an interview that he and Kinski are supposed to be gay lovers in this film too which lends a unique angle to the film.Van Helfin plays Sam Cooper a gold prospector who after searching for decades finally finds gold out in the middle of nowhere and is immediately doublecrossed by his partner. One dead partner and a blasted mine entrance later Cooper heads across the endless landscape and finally makes it back into town where he sends for surrogate son and expartner Georgel Hilton.Hilton worked with Cooper for years but gave up the search to go off and do something else. Cooper reckons that Hilton is the only guy he can trust and while having a sauna together more homoeroticism here as they spot two seminaked blonde gunslingers Cooper bumps into another expartner Gilbert Roland who has a major chip on his shoulder with regards to Cooper.Stranger still is the blonde milk drinking preacher who has started hanging around the place staring at Hilton. It turns out that Hilton and Kinski have some sort of relationship but judging by the body language it's an intimate one and not a fair balanced one as Hilton seems to be Kinski's 'btch'. Cooper isn't too happy to have this weirdo come along with him but Hilton tells him a third pair of hands is better than two. Cooper then hires Gilbert to watch his back saying that four pairs of hands are better than three. I'm detecting some trust issues here...While basically a film where four guy stare at each other mistrustingly the film is fascinating due to the actors involved. Van Heflin literally looks like someone's hung him to dry in the sun for several months while Gilbert Roland alternates between being immaculately turned out to shivering with Malaria tremors and gives us a little dance right before a gunfight that wouldn't be out of place in a Tarantino film! Kinski keeps himself restrained and that's what gives his character so much menace. He uses those crazy guy to glare at everyone without expression but you know there's murderous thoughts going on in there. His understated hinted relationship with Hilton just adds another layer to this outstanding film.Nice cinematography too. I hadn't heard of this one until last week. How many other gems are out there?".

What is known is that the party ended with the death of one of the guests and that foul play and an ensuing coverup have long been suspected but never proved.

Griffith and Mack Sennett and later founded Paramount Studios with Adolph Zukor has fallen on hard times. Once responsible for forty pictures a year he now struggles to get a single film made.  And his birthday aside he has decided to mix business with pleasure during this cruise pitching an idea to Hearst Edward Herrmann to combine their resources and make movies together.  Hearst however has other things on his mind rumor has it that his mistress Marion Davies Kirsten Dunst is being courted by Charlie Chaplin Eddie Izzard and he has brought them together here to observe and decide for himself if anything untoward is going on between them.  Hearst is not only in love with Davies but is obsessed with her as well as the course of her career and he's not about to let this baggypants comic actor interfere.  And Hearst a powerful and controlling man always gets what he wants and what he wants right now is for this business with Chaplin to disappear.  So it is that in the midst of celebration paranoia overtakes the host of the party and it's about to cast a pall over the proceedings and ultimately involve everyone aboard in one of the greatest unsolved mysteries ever to come out of Tinsel Town.  It's a story that Hearst keeps out of the papers making sure in his own way that dead men indeed tell no tales.Bogdanovich successfully captures the era as well as the mendacity of this rich assortment of characters who are all the more intriguing for the fact that they are real people rather than the product of imagination and it proves that fact is often more bizarre than fiction.  The excesses and overindulgences of many within the Hollywood community during this period rivals anything happening today and one of the most telling scenes in the film is when novelist Elinor Glyn Joanna Lumley offers her take on what Hollywood really is and what it does to those who dwell within.  Glyn is also the narrator of the film a wise choice as it adds a balanced perspective to the events as they unfold and are summarily grounded by her often wry and incisive observations.  The final words of the film are hers in fact a final observation that encompasses so much in so few words that it provides an impact that makes it the perfect ending.  And it makes you realize what a terrific job Bogdanovich did with this film and how well he brought this material screenplay by Steven Paros which he adapted from his own play to life.The film is highlighted by a number of excellent and memorable performances beginning with Herrmann as Hearst.  This is possibly the best work he's ever done in his career perfectly capturing the many facets of this extremely complex man.  There's a depth to his performance that conveys not only the bravura of a powerful individual and one who delights in using it but the vulnerability as well.  He also makes you cognizant of the fact that Hearst is a man capable of almost anything including creating his own reality and maintaining it with his limitless resources.  It's one of the subtle underlying nuances that Herrmann brings to his portrayal which is altogether convincing and believable.Kirsten Dunst also rises to the occasion turning in a remarkable performance as Marion Davies.  It's a concise reflection of a young actress caught up in a situation that is at once enviable and undesirable who manages to tactfully negotiate the sensitive issues with which she is faced with a sensibility and maturity beyond her years.  And through Dunst we see the many layers of Davies' personality the funloving girl as well as the responsible woman who finds herself in a perpetually tentative environment and selflessly refrains from playing the prima donna or attempting to act as if she is the center of the universe something to which too many others who have been swallowed up by the Hollywood lifestyle over the years are prone.  It's a comprehensive and convincing performance that proves that Dunst has the stuff to fulfill the promise made by her work in previous films.  The performance that surpasses them all however is turned in by Eddie Izzard as Chaplin.  Izzard captures the very essence of Chaplin physically and emotionally with a detailed portrayal of the man created through expression and astute introspection.  This is not the onscreen persona the Little Tramp' but Chaplin the complex individual and artist who is presented here.  Izzard brings him to life with singular nuance and depth and it's a performance that should by all rights earn him an Oscar nomination.  Skillfully acted and presented The Cat's Meow' is a memorable film that offers some insights into a town and lifestyle that few have ever experienced.  910.".

Things begin to fall apart when Hearst suspects a guest  none other than Charlie Chaplin Eddie Izzard the most famous man in the world  of having an affair with his actress girlfriend Marion Davies Kirsten Dunst.Although the film is entertaining there is something underwhelming about it. Its stage origins are obvious  characters perambulate from plot point to plot point spouting exposition never appearing much more than caricatures and thus failing to evoke much sympathy.The casting of Eddie Izzard in the pivotal role of Charles Chaplin is a grave mistake though the script saddles him with a most unsatisfactory characterisation of Chaplin to work with. Chaplin was not a serial romancer as is implied in the film but a serial seducer. He would have been the last person to urge a woman to run away with him on the basis of undying love. He spent his most famous years running from women who suggested exactly that freely admitting to them that while sex was a pleasant diversion his work came before any woman. It's a casting decision that is an obvious attempt to distance us from the Little Tramp as opposed to Chaplin the real man but we never get a true sense of either. Ironically Izzard actually resembles the real Thomas Ince far more than does Cary Elwes and as a reallife cabaret performer could conceivably have brought the flamboyance and eccentricity of the reallife director to life better than Elwes does.The film also takes an annoyingly facile view of women perpetuating the dull cliche that all women spent the 1920s with a bad case of St Vitus' dance and addicted to laughing gas. The grating performances of Claudie Blakley and Chiara Schoras in particular throw the beautifully understated efforts of Kirsten Dunst into high relief. Dunst feels like the only real person in this cast of cartoon characters  beautiful funny and vital she is the best thing in the film. Yet there is never any moment in the movie to suggest the true depth of her dedication and passion for Hearst portrayed as a rolypoly father figure rather than the hard nosed businessman he was nor any justification for leaving him for the roguish but uncharismatic Chaplin. Unfortunately the more interesting conflicts in Marion's  life such as her growing alcoholism and her dissatisfaction with Hearst's insistence on casting her in leaden romances rather than the comedy to which she was so obviously suited are only touched on lightly.Though it could have been a thoughtprovoking and complex experience as Joanna Lumley's poignant final statements imply and like Gosford Park' to which it has been compared in the end The Cat's Meow' doesn't feel much more substantial than your average game of Cluedo.".

What's more it feels like it actually could've happened. The interactions between the characters leading up to the act are given much more screen time than the actual act itself. So when it happens it doesn't seem preposterous at all.The story concerns newspaper honcho William Randolph Hearst Edward Herrmann and company celebrating the birthday of Hollywood producer Thomas Ince Cary Elwes on Hearst's yacht. That company includes Hearst's loveractress Marion Davies Kirsten Dunst Charlie Chaplin Eddie Izzard author Elinor Glyn Joanna Lumley gossip columnist for Hearst's newspaper Louella Parsons Jennifer Tilley and Tom's lover. Tom hopes to negotiate a contract with W.R. Hearst for Marion to star in his next few films but Hearst is more concerned about the attraction between Marion and Chaplin. Elinor is nearby to dispense advice while Louella unsuccessfully attempts to mingle. There's also a pair of party girls on board attempting to have a raucous time as possible.The Cat's Meow has an eclectic ensemble with a Robert Altmanesquire taste to it. Edward Herrmann's role may be the most challenging because he has to juggle eccentric warmth and jealousy as W.R. Hearst. Joanna Lumley is wonderfully dry. And for those like me who only remember Eddie Izzard for his droll standup work he's surprising in this film. He's quite good as Charlie Chaplin. Kirsten Dunst is the biggest name on the cast. She's very fetching in the Cat's Meow and this represents a change of pace from her dearth of Hollywoodoriented films.As good as the cast is this is really just as much Peter Bogdanovich's film. After the excellent Last Picture Show he sort of faded away and made smaller films The Thing Called Love for example. Although The Cat's Meow will not make him a household name hopefully maybe his work will garner more attention again. His direction is very good here.Oh I should also mention the costume design and music here. The production values in general are excellent in imitating the feel of that era. I was reminded a little of Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway and not just the Jennifer Tilly connection. Anyways The Cat's Meow is a good movie with interesting characters and thoughtful direction.".

Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer Joanna Lumley is compelling as novelist Elinor Glyn and Kirsten Dunst is winning as Marion Davies though why movies never use her reallife stutter is difficult to explain. But these elements don't add up to a successful whole. The screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenesthe meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well craftedbut not so hard on the big picture. Several minor characters don't need to be there and don't behave consistently. The basic plot is full of illogic e.g. why does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to tell Hearst something he really doesn't want to hear? and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome. I'd like to think a trip on Hearst's yacht was more fun than the movie indicates. Davies is characterized as a standard bubbly Flapper type which isn't really accurate and the screenwriter's ideas about Chaplin and love are implausible. Strangely Bogdanovich who seemed so connected to the Thirties in Paper Moon lacks a similar affinity for the Twenties. He insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream which gives the party guests a very artificial look and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period e.g. Yes We Have No Bananas. When Hearst insists everybody Charleston Charleston! it looks as if the actors had a tenminute dance lesson just before the scene was shot. The lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies I'm sure but not this time.".

	schema:headline " An overlooked Gem that was snubbed by the Oscars";
	schema:reviewBody "I am abhorred that the Oscars could ignore this film for all the categories it so well deservedBest Actress Kirsten Dunst Best Actor Edward Herrmann Best Costume Design Best CinematographyAnd those are just the obvious ones!Peter Bogdanovich is one of my favorite Directors. He has an amazingly vast Encyclopedia of knowledge about Hollywood during this time. He was good friends with the master Orsen Wells and even did the Commentary for Citizen Cane in Wells' place. He was unquestionably the perfect Director for putting this story to screen.Kirsten Dunst is remarkable playing 24 yearold Marion Davies at only 18. She does a superb job in the role and deserved a lot more attention than she was awarded.I strongly disagree with comments that the supporting cast was bad. Everybody was perfect for their role! The sax player WAS a sax player not an actor from Berlin where most of the movie was filmed and he did fantastic! He only had one line for goodness sake!Though I would concur that Jennifer Tilly played Louella Parsons a bit unlike we would expect I support her decision to treat her this way for the sake of this film. She lightened up the film with her bumbling silliness. So what if Lolly wasn't like that in real life? It worked well for the movie.My only slight complaint was the decision to have one of the flappers briefly flash us show her chest during a party scene with her the other flapper the sax player and Chaplin. It was unnecessary and felt out of place with an otherwise clean movie. My guess is this was the reason for the PG13 rating.There is hardly any language  in fact Bogdanovich changed the film's only Fword to screw to clean it up even more than the original script. This works much better for the period than filling it with 21st century language.Anybody interested in the 20's William Randolph Hearst or 'The Golden Age of Hollywood' MUST see this movie!8 out of 10. I can't decide between 8 and 9!".

He has an amazingly vast Encyclopedia of knowledge about Hollywood during this time. He was good friends with the master Orsen Wells and even did the Commentary for Citizen Cane in Wells' place. He was unquestionably the perfect Director for putting this story to screen.Kirsten Dunst is remarkable playing 24 yearold Marion Davies at only 18. She does a superb job in the role and deserved a lot more attention than she was awarded.I strongly disagree with comments that the supporting cast was bad. Everybody was perfect for their role! The sax player WAS a sax player not an actor from Berlin where most of the movie was filmed and he did fantastic! He only had one line for goodness sake!Though I would concur that Jennifer Tilly played Louella Parsons a bit unlike we would expect I support her decision to treat her this way for the sake of this film. She lightened up the film with her bumbling silliness. So what if Lolly wasn't like that in real life? It worked well for the movie.My only slight complaint was the decision to have one of the flappers briefly flash us show her chest during a party scene with her the other flapper the sax player and Chaplin. It was unnecessary and felt out of place with an otherwise clean movie. My guess is this was the reason for the PG13 rating.There is hardly any language  in fact Bogdanovich changed the film's only Fword to screw to clean it up even more than the original script.

Secrets had to be kept and Hearst was willing to pay any price to see they were kept granting all who cooperated and apparently all did whatever wish and he could do it as any genie in any bottle. If you are looking for something different and willing to give this movie a chance this movie is for you. This movie deserves better than the 6.5 of the IMDb and I give this movie a 7.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Pauline Kael did her celebrated combination of original research and character assassination entitled Raising Kane she mentioned that in the course of the final version of CITIZEN KANE that we have Orson Welles pruned out some events put into the script by Herman Mankiewicz. Mankiewicz for example wanted to make the eventual collapse of the first Kane marriage to Emily Norton Monroe to be caused by Kane's accidental encouragement of the assassination of Emily's uncle the President of the United States. This was based on an incident that Hearst's enemies seized on involving Ambrose Bierce a Hearst columnist in 19001901 writing a quatrain about the killing in 1900 of Governorelect William Goebel of Kentucky that suggested that the missing assassination bullet was headed for Washington to stretch McKinley on his bier. When Leon Czolgosz shot and killed the President in September 1901 Hearst's foes recalled the lines and said Hearst encouraged political murder. The original script for Kane had Emily accusing Charles for her uncle's death and never forgiving him.That was cut with Emily's growing dislike for Charles based instead on his ego his concentration on his newspaper empire and political ambitions and his neglect of her and probably their son. The business with Susan Alexander is the final straw.It was not the only cut of a sensational nature. In the final film Susan tells the reporter that he should speak to Raymond the butler because he knows where all the bodies are. In the original script Raymond was with Susan a witness to Kane actually killing a man but covering it up. This is why Raymond remains so important to Kane in his later years. It also helps explain Susan's growing dislike for her husband.It too was cut. Welles was wise here  everyone in Hollywood would have known what that was about and any denials about Kane not being based on Hearst would have been dismissed because the dead man would have been too much of a coincidence to ignore.In 1941 it was generally suspected throughout Hollywood and in much of the U.S. that William Randolph Hearst was in some way responsible for the death in 1924 of movie directorproducerpioneer Thomas Ince. Ince had been one of a set of guests invited on Hearst's luxury yacht the Onieda for a cruise. Others on the cruise included novelist Elinior Glyn Hearst's mistress Marion Davies the great Charlie Chaplin Tom Ince and a newcomer to the Hearst empire gossip writer Louella Parsons. At some point on the trip which was supposed to be a two week cruise Ince was rushed ashore in serious condition and taken to a hospital. He died two days later. The cause was varied according to the bulletins usually being either a heart attack or a stomach ailment. However rumors soon emerged that an incident happened on board the Oneida that led to the shooting of Ince probably at the hands of Hearst.The story has never completely died and even today there is a small body of evidence that Ince did not die a natural death. The basic scenario was that Ince was on deck when Hearst was chasing Chaplin who had been fooling around with Davies and in shooting at Chaplin Hearst accidentally wounded Ince. Hearst was powerful enough to clamp down on the tragedy but at the same time there was a cost Louella Parsons was just a new employee at the time. Now she blackmailed her boss into making her a national columnist and a real power in Hollywood.Peter Bogdanovitch who directed THE CAT'S MEOW was a close friend of Orson Welles. One can't quite get it out of one's head that this film a twisted prequill to KANE was meant as Bogdanovitch's homage to the classic film and his attempt to smear Hearst who after 1941 did everything he could to hurt Welles.The period detail is very good and Edward Herrmann makes a dandy Hearst sort of a return to the mad playboy husband of Goldie Hawn in OVERBOARD which also takes place on a yacht. Certainly he is supremely confident as the millionaire but he is also smart. A running story line is that Tom Ince Cary Elwys is trying to get Hearst's backing for a rejuvenation of Ince's film career supposedly on the verge of collapse in 1924 but that Hearst is not stupid enough to waste his money that way. However Herrmann does also demonstrate that he is more than a little possessive about Ms Davies Kirsten Dunst and that he is worried about that little cockney Chaplin Eddie Izzard going after his woman. Certainly Chaplin's reputation with the ladies was enough to give any man pause. Jennifer Tilly Louella Parsons certainly is keeping her eyes open she is after all a gossip writer and it pays dividends at the end. As for Joanne Lumley as Elinor Glyn she gives the film a kind of narrative and framework Glyn by the way if you can't recall her was the woman who termed the euphemism for sex appeal as it and was to make a screenplay called It that starred Clara Bow who became the It girl  otherwise she has become pretty forgotten.The film is worth watching  not perhaps another PAPER MOON or LAST PICTURE SHOW but better than AT LONG LAST LOVE. Do I think Hearst killed Ince? If he did it was a sheer accident because who would kill a well known figure under such circumstances as part of a comprehensive murder plan!".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Bogdanovich's The Cat's Meow' is an only mildly interesting take on an unsolved scandal that has become a part of early Hollywood folklore.  The year is 1924.  The setting a yacht owned by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst.  The occasion the birthday celebration of one Thomas Ince a movie mogol desperate to join forces with Hearst's organization.  The guests Charlie Chaplin Hearst's mistress actress Marion Davies the neophyte gossip columnist Louella Parsons and famed bodiceripper writer Elinor Glyn.  The mystery  the sudden death of Ince under potentially shady circumstances.  It is Miss Glyn serving as the tale's narrator who states right up front that most of what we will be seeing in this rendition is pure speculative fiction.  Given the fact that writer Steven Peros who wrote both the screenplay and the stage play on which it is based had pretty much a free hand when it came to dreaming up a convincing scenario to explain the tragic events of that November weekend it seems odd that he basically settled for little more than an updated production of  Othello' played out in a Great Gatsby' setting.  Hearst is of course Othello himself the powerful leader driven into a jealous rage at the thought of his dearly beloved's betraying him with another man.  Ince plays the part of Iago a selfcentered opportunist who poisons Hearst's mind against Marian's fidelity using a combination of whispered innuendo and fabricated circumstantial evidence to achieve his purpose though his motive for doing all this is never very adequately explained I must confess.  Marian is of course the beloved Desdemona  though she seems a less wholly virtuous innocent than the character Shakespeare gave us.  Finally Chaplin plays a considerably less virtuous innocent than the play's Cassio the man allegedly having an affair with Othello's  that is to say Hearst's  dearly beloved.Even without the Othello' parallels The Cat's Meow' never really adds up to very much in the long run.  Perhaps the characters are too broadly drawn to really make us believe that what we are seeing is an actual historical event and not mere dressup playacting.  Hearst Edward Herrmann seems like little more than a petulant befuddled buffoon hardly a man who would be sitting atop one of the world's great corporate empires.  Louella Parsons as played by Jennifer Tilly comes across as a hopeless ditz a nitwit who literally stumbles through a stroke of good' fortune into her long and lucrative career as one of Hollywood's premiere gossip columnists.  And Eddie Izzard makes a thoroughly bland and unconvincing Charlie Chaplin.  He neither looks nor moves like the legendary performer and seems to be completely devoid of the kind of charismatic persona one would naturally associate with Chaplin both onscreen and off.  Only the lovely Kirsten Dunst makes a mark on the audience's emotions.  Her Marion Davies radiates a highspirited warmth that brings a touch of muchneeded humanity to the rather cold clinical world these characters inhabit.  Of course recreating this world is one of the prime dictums of the film but it is hardly earthshattering news at this late date and especially to anyone who has ever read the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald to discover that the idle rich of the 1920's were all a bunch of shallow selfabsorbed hedonists without morals values direction or purpose.  When Glyn gets the chance to sum up the moral lesson for us at the end we can barely stifle a yawn at the pedestrian nature of the revelation.'So what makes The Cat's Meow' worth seeing?  Well it certainly feeds a kind of morbid fascination we have for that longago world of early Hollywood when movies were in their infancy their creators largerthanlife figures and their scandals made all the juicier by the fact that the press actually played along with keeping the details a deep dark secret  thereby enhancing the curiosity factor and guaranteeing that a kind of modern popculture mythology would grow up around that industry and that time.  It is that mythology that The Cat's Meow' effectively opens up for us.  That along with the sharply observed details of the period is what makes the film flaws and all into a reasonably diverting drawing room entertainment.".

	onyx:emotionText "Peter Bogdanovich's The Cat's Meow' is an only mildly interesting take on an unsolved scandal that has become a part of early Hollywood folklore.  The year is 1924.  The setting a yacht owned by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst.  The occasion the birthday celebration of one Thomas Ince a movie mogol desperate to join forces with Hearst's organization.  The guests Charlie Chaplin Hearst's mistress actress Marion Davies the neophyte gossip columnist Louella Parsons and famed bodiceripper writer Elinor Glyn.  The mystery  the sudden death of Ince under potentially shady circumstances.  It is Miss Glyn serving as the tale's narrator who states right up front that most of what we will be seeing in this rendition is pure speculative fiction.

	schema:headline " A version of a famous Hollywood scandal";
	schema:reviewBody "No one will ever know what really happened aboard William Randolph Hearst's yacht on that fateful weekend in 1924. Director Peter Bogdanovich recreates it based on rumors in The Cat's Meow a 2001 film starring Kirsten Dunst Edward Herrmann Cary Elwes Eddie Izzard Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Tilly. The weekend in question is a celebration of producer Thomas Ince's birthday aboard Hearst's yacht with a guest roster that included Hearst Marion Davies Ince his mistress Margaret Livingston Louella Parsons writer Elinor Glyn Charlie Chaplin and others. Thomas Ince was removed from the yacht supposedly ill and died in his home several days later supposedly of heart failure. Rumor has it that Hearst suspecting an affair between Davies and Charlie Chaplin shot Ince by accident either mistaking him for Chaplin or because Ince happened to be on the dock at the same time and got in the line of fire. Morning newspapers not Hearst papers claimed that Ince had been shot the evening papers did not carry that story nor did the Hearst papers. No one who was on board the yacht ever spoke of the incident except in the most ambiguous of ways. Louella Parsons' column became syndicated in over 600 papers and she worked for Hearst until she retired Ince's mistress Livingston received a whopping increase in salary. She finally retired to manage her husband Paul Whiteman's band.That's the story Bogdanovich goes with and it makes for a meandering but intriguing story. The meandering part is not so much a fault of the film but done on purpose  it's a weekend yacht party after all and Bogdanovich shows us the parties the conversations and the intrigues of various guests. He captures the atmosphere of the '20s and the splendor of Hearst's yacht very well.It's hard to say how accurate the actors were with their characterizations for my part I don't know what Charlie Chaplin Hearst Glyn or Parsons were really like. From seeing Marion Davies in films and in photographs Dunst seems too young though her acting is good. Herrmann I suspect captures Hearst beautifully  powerful a good host a sometimes brutal man and very much in love with Marion. When he saw Citizen Kane believing that Susan Alexander was based on Marion he was most upset at the portrayal of Susan as a drunk. Tilly plays Parsons as if she was an airhead  I believe externally in real life Parsons did come off as a silly ineffectual woman all the better to gain your confidence in fact she was an ambitious person who wielded a lot of power. Tilly captures this in her last scene Parsons gets down to business and drops a lot of her act. Lumley's Elinor Glyn is elegant intelligent and more of an observer she narrates the film  I suspect that is true as well. Cary Elwes doesn't register much as Ince who is portrayed as a desperate man trying to get his career back on track with Hearst's help.Eddie Izzard's Chaplin is problematic. Physically he seems all wrong  Chaplin was quite goodlooking and much slighter than Izzard Izzard hints at a British accent but doesn't really come off as very British or very graceful which Chaplin definitely was. The writing of this character may be incorrect as well as it's doubtful that Chaplin would have actually wanted Marion to leave Hearst.All in all though it's not an edge of your seat kind of film The Cat's Meow is a good film about a fascinating piece of Hollwyood lore. It seems likely that Ince did not die of indigestion heart failure or suicide but that something did happen and the guests were sworn to silence it's also more than likely that the police and DA cooperated in covering it up. There is an interesting sidebar to this story  Davies' secretary Abigail Kinsolving was considered a suspect in Ince's death strange since he supposedly died of heart failure. She claimed to have been raped by Ince and it was noted by guests on the yacht that she had bruises on her body. She had a baby some months later and died in a car accident near San Simeon. Two suspicious things there she was found by Hearst bodyguards and there was a suicide note that wasn't in her handwriting. Her orphaned daughter was supported by Marion Davies. Did Kinsolving know too much? Whether she did or not the rest of us know too little.".

The meandering part is not so much a fault of the film but done on purpose  it's a weekend yacht party after all and Bogdanovich shows us the parties the conversations and the intrigues of various guests. He captures the atmosphere of the '20s and the splendor of Hearst's yacht very well.It's hard to say how accurate the actors were with their characterizations for my part I don't know what Charlie Chaplin Hearst Glyn or Parsons were really like. From seeing Marion Davies in films and in photographs Dunst seems too young though her acting is good. Herrmann I suspect captures Hearst beautifully  powerful a good host a sometimes brutal man and very much in love with Marion. When he saw Citizen Kane believing that Susan Alexander was based on Marion he was most upset at the portrayal of Susan as a drunk. Tilly plays Parsons as if she was an airhead  I believe externally in real life Parsons did come off as a silly ineffectual woman all the better to gain your confidence in fact she was an ambitious person who wielded a lot of power. Tilly captures this in her last scene Parsons gets down to business and drops a lot of her act. Lumley's Elinor Glyn is elegant intelligent and more of an observer she narrates the film  I suspect that is true as well. Cary Elwes doesn't register much as Ince who is portrayed as a desperate man trying to get his career back on track with Hearst's help.Eddie Izzard's Chaplin is problematic. Physically he seems all wrong  Chaplin was quite goodlooking and much slighter than Izzard Izzard hints at a British accent but doesn't really come off as very British or very graceful which Chaplin definitely was. The writing of this character may be incorrect as well as it's doubtful that Chaplin would have actually wanted Marion to leave Hearst.All in all though it's not an edge of your seat kind of film The Cat's Meow is a good film about a fascinating piece of Hollwyood lore. It seems likely that Ince did not die of indigestion heart failure or suicide but that something did happen and the guests were sworn to silence it's also more than likely that the police and DA cooperated in covering it up. There is an interesting sidebar to this story  Davies' secretary Abigail Kinsolving was considered a suspect in Ince's death strange since he supposedly died of heart failure. She claimed to have been raped by Ince and it was noted by guests on the yacht that she had bruises on her body. She had a baby some months later and died in a car accident near San Simeon. Two suspicious things there she was found by Hearst bodyguards and there was a suicide note that wasn't in her handwriting. Her orphaned daughter was supported by Marion Davies. Did Kinsolving know too much? Whether she did or not the rest of us know too little.";

Then the next day I started critique it more and noticed more flaws in the movie.  The story didn't seem to gather momentum as it went on but seemed too even in tone and pace.  I imagined better ways to shoot some of the scenes and wished for a more mordant tone because the story is a pretty dark one after all.

The film does something which I think any great documentary should when it covers or explores historical events. It frames the entire hostage crisis in a larger context. Yes the film covers 21 hours of September 5th on which the hostage situation commenced and one could say resolved itself. However in order to understand the reactions of the German government the Israeli government the media and the Olympic Games' fans and participants the film discusses the German desire to create the atmosphere of peace to erase the stigma of the 1936 Olympics then full of Fascist propaganda. It touches on the ongoing IsraelArab conflict. It touches on the meaning of the Olympics.One Day in September never strays from its focus however which is to document the hostage crisis and what it meant. What makes the film great aside from its intelligent approach to the subject is how well the atmosphere of the hostage situation is carried across. By the end of the film you do feel like you've watched the news for a day glued to the TV screen hoping that the people will make it out alive. Watching it you are reminded of how illprepared states are for terrorist attacks still rings true even recently because of the ulterior motives of statesmen. A lot of what happens at the state political level happens because it has to look good. The Germans were unprepared for the terrorists because they thought that extreme police security would welcome images of preWar Olympics in Germany. They wanted to appear a certain way. The same went for how they handled the crisis.The film like many terrorist crises ends with a tragedy. What remains with the viewer is not only the deep sadness at how one of the most peaceful world events turns into one of the most hateful but also how incredibly contemporary those events from over thirty years ago still seem.".

I have faint memories of the tragedy that transpired thirty odd years ago and watching this documentary brings it all back for me. This is one of the best documentaries out there. It tells simply and clearly what happened and why. Using both news footage of the event and interviews conducted recently amazingly the interviews include one with the only surviving terrorist who is now in hiding this story tells the tale completely and compellingly. You get sucked into it even though you know whats going to happen or think you do. The amazing thing about this film is that even if you know what happened it still manages to surprise you with new information that wasn't available before.This is a sad story told compellingly.".

I have faint memories of the tragedy that transpired thirty odd years ago and watching this documentary brings it all back for me. This is one of the best documentaries out there. It tells simply and clearly what happened and why. Using both news footage of the event and interviews conducted recently amazingly the interviews include one with the only surviving terrorist who is now in hiding this story tells the tale completely and compellingly. You get sucked into it even though you know whats going to happen or think you do. The amazing thing about this film is that even if you know what happened it still manages to surprise you with new information that wasn't available before.This is a sad story told compellingly.";

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this documentary is a harrowing experience. I think the DVD version is unique in that even its menu page looks terrifying. By the end of the film however I was more angry than scared because of the amazing level of incompetence German and Olympic officials showed in handling the hostage situation. The media also behaved abominably broadcasting playbyplay accounts of the police's plans right into the ears of the terrorists. It made me think that the Bush administration might be partially correct in keeping the media in the dark about American military activities in Afghanistan.I don't understand why some people felt the film didn't give the context of the kidnapping. I think Jamal al Gashey the only kidnapper left alive now explained quite clearly why he did what he did. But if the film had spent an extra hour discussing the IsraeliPalestinian conflict would that have made a difference? In my mind nothing justified the kidnapping of athletes who by their very presence at the Olympics were trying to further world understanding. I can't think of many things that do justify holding innocent hostages for ransom. The director seems to feel that way too. Apparently that makes the movie too biased for some viewers.As for the comment that the movie demonizes the kidnappers I don't agree. The filmmakers include a German official's statement that if he had met him in a different situation he would have liked the terrorist spokesman Issa. al Gashey tells some very human stories such as an ironic account of getting into the Olympic village with the help of American athletes out after curfew and he insists that the plan was never to murder the Israelis. And al Gashey's brief but affecting account of being exiled from his childhood village does a lot more to argue the Palestinian side of the conflict than any brutal hostagetaking scheme. Too bad he never has realized that.Interestingly filmmaker Kevin MacDonald wrote that in Israel he has been accused of giving too much time to the Palestinians. He also notes that Simon Reeve wrote a companion book to the movie because there were many aspects of the story we could not include in a 90minute film. It's a pity the existence of the book isn't publicized more assuming it's any good.I do wish the film had spent more time discussing the aftermath of the tragedy and that MacDonald had used his incredible opportunity of interviewing the last remaining terrorist to ask him some more hardhitting questions instead of being satisfied with a stepbystep account of what the kidnappers did that day. However I just read that it was extremely difficult for MacDonald to get al Gashey to talk at all.I wasn't completely convinced that the Germans colluded with the terrorists in the Lufthansa hijacking and would have liked to see evidence for that. I would also have liked to learn more about the Black September group. Basically I think the film should have been longer. If it was kept to its current length for some marketing reason I think the sponsoring studio should rethink that rule.However the only choice I really wish the filmmaker had not made was to accompany extremely gruesome shots of bodies with loud psychedelic music. It would have been more respectful to show the images in silence.Watching the film in light of the events of a day in September of 2001 and after makes me think that the world hasn't come very far since 1972 in terms of solving the Middle East's problems.".

	schema:reviewBody "It would appear that many people believe that the documentary format should be held to some sort of objective newsgathering standard. Whenever two clips are spliced together regardless of the content there is some editorializing. A documentary is an editorial. If you want nothing more than unopinionated truth than the only avenue open to you is uninterrupted security camera footage. You can and sometimes should disagree with the opinions offered by the documentary filmmaker as a critical viewer but one faulting the filmmaker for offering an opinion is like criticizing water for being wet. The line that must be discerned is whether the filmmaker is overly deceptive or insidious in trying to convince you of his or her opinion. This is a line that can be very difficult to draw.Mr. Ruvi Simmons of London does not seem to realize these basic tenets of documentary filmmaking One Day in September however concentrates more on the human interest of the event itself neglecting background information in order to convey a onesided and grossly biased perspective on a tragic occurrence. I am a filmmaker and I know that as such one must choose a theme and a perspective for a feature length documentary. The main problem that this person has with the film is that he is that it neither explores the underlying issues behind the IsraeliPalestinian tensions. This is a 2 hour film not a 40 hour miniseries. There is no way that the filmmaker could have adequately explored the history of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and still told the story that he or she intended the story of the hostage crisis at the Games of '72. Mr. Simmons also took offense at the filmmaker for vilifying the terrorists who perpetrated this plot. I do not need to offer a critical retort as any logical person can understand why this statement is foolishness. It sounds as though Mr. Simmons feels as though the terrorists were justified in hurting innocent athletes a continent removed from their conflict. Obviously this person would dislike this documentary although he does not mention that the documentarian interviewed one of the terrorists to present his side of their story.If you want to have a solid introduction to the acts of terrorism at the Games of '72 then this is a good work to watch. It is true that the thrillerstyle is a bit gimmicky but it does add somewhat to the suspense if you do not know the outcome. If you are intending to see the film Munich then this is probably a good primer I have not yet seen it as it has not been released. Just remember this film is just as much an editorial as Spielburg's film will be.C".

	schema:reviewBody "In Britain at least this film has been strongly criticised by hardly disinterested intellectual heavyweights like Edward Said and Tom Paulin. The main argument against the film is that it takes place in an historical vacuum that it shows members of the 1972 Israeli Olympic team being taken hostage by Palestinian terrorists but it does not explain the political reasons why this happened.  This is largely true  although there is brief mention at the beginning of the horrific camp conditions Palestinians suffered in their own homeland appropriated by Israel it says nothing about this highly contentious appropriation about the natural urge to struggle against it.This is underscored by a blatantly manipulative structure  while the representative of the hostages is necessarily solitary anonymous in hiding talking in shadows the other surviving terrorists were murdered by Israeli assassination squads this information is recorded in a coda thatseems like some kind of chilling reward for the audience the dead men are shown as almost saintly  pictured getting married with babies smiling honest healthy sporty part of a community and tradition  one story talks about the highminded ideals of one coach who fraternised with his political enemies from Lebanon.Aside from the dubious shamelessness of this manipulation I don't really have a problem with the film's focus.  Coming from a country where political terrorists have for thirty years been slaughtering wholesale largely apolitical citizens in the name of justice who have used bogus political ideology as a front for gangsterism I am somewhat out of sympathy with anything that proclaims humanitarian motives and leaves innocent people dead.  Critics complain that ONE DAY ignores the story of the Palestinians their feelings of repression and injustice  and it is unlikely a film on this subject will have a voiceover from a powerful Hollywood player and win an Oscar  but to do this would abstract the event would turn it into a political chess game and not a ghastly abomination where real people far too young with families are unaccountably murdered.  It is the stuff of paranoid modernist literature  you wake up one morning with all your friends and by sheer random chance you're held hostage and killed.So if we agree that the film is fatally biased we can see that it has many virtues.  ONE DAY has been called a thriller  it was literally so for me because I'd never heard about this atrocity  and the techniques used the pounding score the edgy editing the foregrounding of clocks and deadlines the withholding of explanatory hindsight information all contribute to a sense of almost unbearable tension.  I don't know how this is for people the majority who know the story.About half way through as you begin to realise how things will probably turn out the film stops being a thriller and becomes an exercise in dread time contracts and you hope the film goes on forever so that the intolerable denouement is postponed.  It is unbearable.  But after the film you begin to question the ethics of all this.  One of the themes of the film is the media treatment of the crisis the reprehensible desire of the Olympic Committee to get it out of the way as quickly as possible  one victim's wife accuses the media of turning the crisis into a 'show'.  But this is precisely what Macdonald does turning human tragedy into an entertainment by turns kinetic and visceral.Other plusses are the revelations of shocking farcical German incompetence desperate to reveal deNazification by having no security whatsoever the callous indifferent facesaving here by representatives of the police is the film's true sickening achievement.  The brief montages of the sporting events the whole point of the Olympics are exhilirating soundtracked to an uplifting Moog Bach making you wonder why people can't make better sports movies.ONE DAY has been compared to Errol Morris's documentaries and you can see superficially why  the Phillip Glass score the distortion of footage and time the letting authority hang itself.  But Morris in a film like THE THIN BLUE LINE is concerned not so much with presenting a truth as destroying the official version exposing its weaknesses repressions lies. His recreated scenes heightened images distancing effects all point to the artificiality of the official 'truth'.  Morris uses documenatary's claim to authenticity and truth to expose the inauthenticity of 'truth'.  His is a critical cinema.MacDonald however IS offering official truth here  there is no real difference between what he says and the ABC news reporter.  This is not a critical film pandering to firmly entrenched ideologies.  Further the documentary as a genre is limited.  It can tell us about facts analyses. It can reveal witness.  There is an astonishing frisson in being able to see these terrorists walking and talking on the big screen that projection of fantasies like people not mythical constructs.

True its focus was on the Israelis and their lives and how they were killed by evil fundamentalist Palestinians. However if you say the film is biased then you're saying that maybe it should lean a little bit the other way and tell more about the Palestinian terrorists and their personal plight in the conflict. But how can anyone be sympathetic to terrorists? The point has been brought up that both sides of the conflict experience terrorist attacks so why should a filmmaker focus on one side more than the other however I think the fact that this attack took place at the Olympics an event that represents the unity of the world and its people is what makes the attack and this documentary so important. Therefore Kevin MacDonald in my opinion has license to be as biased as he wants toward the Israelis because they were the focus of this terrible event that occurred during a time that people around the world should have been united under the Olympics banner.".

But how can anyone be sympathetic to terrorists? The point has been brought up that both sides of the conflict experience terrorist attacks so why should a filmmaker focus on one side more than the other however I think the fact that this attack took place at the Olympics an event that represents the unity of the world and its people is what makes the attack and this documentary so important. Therefore Kevin MacDonald in my opinion has license to be as biased as he wants toward the Israelis because they were the focus of this terrible event that occurred during a time that people around the world should have been united under the Olympics banner.";

The terrorists are taken to a nearby airport in helicopters to a waiting jet. German cops who are stationed in the jet and disguised as a flight crewm at the very last second just as the helicopters are about to land chicken out and abandon their posts. The head of Mossad who by now has joined the Germans at the airport is incredulous at the lack of professionalism of the whole ambush also he accuses the Germans of taking the hostages out of the Olympic village just so the games can continue.

The coup de grace the vilest insult to injury comes in the aftermath of this debacle  Three Palestinian terrorists survive the gun battle at the airport and are taken into custody. Within days a nearly empty German airliner bound from Beirut to Frankfurt is hijacked by Arab terrorists who demand and obtain the release of the 3 terrorists in custody.

If you're desperate for it to be making a political point you're bound to be disappointed especially as that implies that you have a political viewpoint that you want to be confirmed  this film won't do that. It isn't a film about politics  it is a film about people and how people work about the nature of good and evil not of good VS evil as everyone else seems to be reading it. It is ultimately philosophical more than political and most of all about the nature and effects of what the religious would call sin. If there was one point that came across it was that humans aren't born evil in the original sin type of sense but they are born responsive into a world that contains evil.The film forces you to be put into a position where you are made to empaphise with people who you strongly disagree with and this feels distasteful. That's because it is but it is most definitely valid. One of the early scenes featured the terrorist describing his childhood and how he had grown up in a refugee camp knowing that his only chance in life came with the possibility of a Palestinian homeland  much as you hated it you began to find yourself realising that from his viewpoint he had every right to fight for freedom and the opportunity that every child should deserve. You also knew that from an objective moral viewpoint his act was heinous and should be punished after all he wasn't without choice at the point when the act occurred. You were also presented with the irony that the Israeli athlete most focused on was intent on living at peace with those of other races i didn't see this as an attempt to make a generalisation about the Israelis so much as an attempt to show that generalisations don't work. And so his wife and child are left with the difficult choice of whether to follow the completely natural response of hatred and bitterness or somehow find an alternative way. And then there were the Germans who were keen to either set right or leave behind their shameful past and ended up just providing a stage for the terrorists and a show of their own incompetence in dealing with them.I'm not saying this film was perfect but bizarrely considering its subject i don't think it is primarily making a political point.".

You would have to be LIVING in a vacum not to know their plight and it's hard to argue that terrorists are human.  Besides the surviving terrorist spoke about talking and joking with the prisoners a momentary respite for the viewer as it must have been for those involved.  As far as absolving the Israeli gov't the point was obvious and well made no Israeli and even Jew for that matter could feel safe if the demands were met.  And none of criticisms state provide any evidence for their complaints I might add.That being said as a Historian there are some rather speculative aspects to the documentary.  For example Douglas states that the East Germans helped the terrorists scope the place out before hand but it is unclear whether they knew of their intentions or not ala the americans helping them in which is a major fault in the fact presenting.  Also rather curious was how Douglas tells how the plane hijacking was a scam and then states the surviving terrorist confirmed this which to me indicates they set up this scenario for the interviewee and he merely said 'yes.'The main point of this documentary is for the viewer to ask how not why. How could everything fall apart as it did? I left wondering how in Cold War Europe an extraction team from East Germany England France Russia ect. could not have been employed within hours and how much did Cold War politics played into that factor.

But their real coup would be to have interviewed the one and only surviving terrorist who partook in the horror against the spirit of the Olympics.It also provides those born after 1972 or too young to remember a look at the events surrounding that day  from the Olympic organizers who are too arrogant to suspend the games the indifference of the athletes in the Olympic Village the lack of adequate security as compared to today to the politics behind the entire affairs.Perhaps what will rile you are the West German's botched attempt to rescue the hostages.They were surprisingly illprepared deploying untrained teams lack of proper equipment and had to recall countless of attempts before the final embarrassment at the airport which exposed their severe weakness at handling terrorist incidents. All the hostages were killed in the confrontation when the terrorists threw hand grenades and emptied bullets into the helicopters they were in. It's only after this that the Germans formed their antiterror squad the GSG9 Counterstrike players will be familiar with this term.To make matters worse there was a cover up and collusion between the Germans and the terrorists when the latter apparently hijacked a Lufthansa flight with only 12 passengers on board and no women and children and the former handed over the 3 surviving terrorists of the Munich incident in exchange for safe passage of the flight.Which is where Spielberg's movie comes in following squads of Mossad agents hunting down and assassinating those 3 1 managed to survive countless attempts on his life together with others who are implicated or involved in the planning of the Munich operation.This documentary provides an excellent and compelling background preparing you for the Munich movie coming soon.

	schema:reviewBody "One Day in September is an interesting documentary exercise favouring a thriller structure it seems dismissive of any pretense to objectivity a quality that is incorrectly expected of the documentary form. I think the problem lies in just how unbalanced the representation is and I think the film would have benefited from a more rounded view. The film is heavily weighted to a representation which condemns the German authorities and sanctifies the terrorists' victims. The hatchet job done on the Germans is pretty rough  given they were in a fairly untenable position it's terribly unfair to condemn them in hindsight. This aspect of the film displays remarkable petulance. I have fewer reservations about how the Israelis and the Palestinians are each represented I guess I don't expect it to be any other way. It's the kind of documentary that demands a responding documentary but alas I don't see one forthcoming. With all that said the dynamic structure of One Day in September is its most impressive aspect. With all the political implications surrounding the film the best moments are those sequences when the sportsmen and women are set to music. They're invigorating moments and perhaps overshadow the significance of the terrorist incident by contrasting man's evil doings to the eternal beauty of mankind in the pursuit of the limits of his physical capabilities.".

The hatchet job done on the Germans is pretty rough  given they were in a fairly untenable position it's terribly unfair to condemn them in hindsight. This aspect of the film displays remarkable petulance. I have fewer reservations about how the Israelis and the Palestinians are each represented I guess I don't expect it to be any other way. It's the kind of documentary that demands a responding documentary but alas I don't see one forthcoming. With all that said the dynamic structure of One Day in September is its most impressive aspect. With all the political implications surrounding the film the best moments are those sequences when the sportsmen and women are set to music. They're invigorating moments and perhaps overshadow the significance of the terrorist incident by contrasting man's evil doings to the eternal beauty of mankind in the pursuit of the limits of his physical capabilities.";

	schema:reviewBody "One Day In September is a gripping movie unfortunately it is full of false allegations and  plainly  lies and manipulations of truth.  I would like to point out the most severe instances  The East German olympics team helped the Palestinian terrorists to stake out the premises at the Olympic village.  Even though the documentary presents this as a fact as usual without offering any evidence as far as I know this allusion is far from being proven.  As is evident from the rest of the movie the security at the 1972 Olympics was generally rather lax and the Palestinians still didn't have a good idea of the premises they didn't know much beyond the address of the Israeli trainers and hadn't properly planned their escape.  The German army had marksmen but they couldn't be used because of legal red tape. ... The Bundeswehr only introduced proper i. e. specially trained and equipped marksmen in 1997 until then all they had was so  called ZF  Zielfernrohrschtzen which used a regular G3 automatic rifle with a 4 scope i. e. a regular army rifle and not a specialised sniper rifle.  The German government colluded with hijackers of Lufthansa airliner so that they could get rid of the three surviving terrorists.  Complete and utter nonsense.  How on earth could the German government have aided the hijackers?  By phoning them and saying hi we would like to get rid of the terrorists could you please hijack a plane so as to give us a flimsy excuse and could you please hijack flight LH1234 from Beirut coz there are no women and children on board?  In other words does anyone really think that the Palestinian terrorists needed an official invitation from the German government?  Please don't insult my intelligence.  The German government gave in surprisingly quickly considering that the hijackers only held 12 hostages.  That is actually one hostage MORE than the Olympics terrorists held.  If the German government was quick to give in it was most likely because they had anticipated this situation they were very aware that there was practically nothing they could do about it and were eager to avoid further bloodshed.  Basically the movie is blaming the Germans for not sacrificing 12 of their citizens.  German government should have consulted Israeli government for permission before handing over Palestinian terrorists.  What on earth for?  They knew the official Israeli position i. e. never give in to Palestinian terrorists no matter what the cost only too well!  Exchanging the terrorists for the hostages certainly wasn't very heroic but the hijackers held 12 hostages what choice did the government have?  German government was quick to hand over the surviving terrorists because they wanted to cover up their blunder.  What was there to cover up?  ALL the hostages as well as most of the terrorists were dead several policemen had been killed or wounded  the outcome was obviously catastrophic.  The head of Mossad along with other independent witnesses was on site in Frstenfeldbruck.  The entire mess was in plain sight there was nothing to cover up.Incidentally one can equally well speculate that the German authorities had NO interest in a trial because it would have focussed public interest on blunders that led to the death of all the hostages as well as that they HAD a vested interest so that Germany could be seen as taking a firm stand against terrorism or to reconcile with Israel.  On the other hand you can also speculate that Israel had no interest in a trial because it would have given the terrorists the chance to propagate their political views during the trial and it would have placed them in a German prison out of reach for Mossad who wanted to see them dead.  The key word here is speculation.  Ulrich Wegener and Hans  Jochen Vogel admitted to the collusion of Germany with the Beirut hijackers ... at least that is clearly the impression given by the movie in the following scene I have translated it partially from German to English so the verbiage might not be exactThe circumstances of the hijack were suspicious ...  One of the Palestinians opined that the whole affair had been staged by the German government in collusion with the terrorists to avoid further threats to its citizens and to cover up its blunder.Ulrich Wegener  I think it's probably true.  At that time the mentality was so.Hans  Jochen Vogel  On such questions Willy Brandt the federal chancellor always made this gesture shrugs ... meaning I can't say or do more.You can't hear what questions the interviewer was asking but I think it is quite clear that it wasn't did the German government collude with the Beirut hijackers?.  I would opine that this scene is pure manipulative propaganda.  If you have the video or DVD check it out for yourself.  German authorities wanted to move the hostages and terrorists out of the Olympic village as quickly as possible so that the games could continue.  I doubt whether the hijackers were much concerned about what the German side wanted.  The initiative came strictly from the terrorists themselves.  As Jamal Al Gashey states in his interview they had been instructed to finish the operation within 24 hours and to demand to be flown out of Germany before this deadline.  Germans should have allowed Mossad in. Mossad could have solved the situation and prevented bloodshed.  Mossad is a secret service not an anti  terrorism police force which is noted even by the CIA for its ruthless and plainly illegal actions  allowing them to operate in the Olympic village was therefore clearly out of the question.  Even on an international level specialised anti  terrorism forces only came into existence after and mostly in response to the September 1972 attentat. CNN states on its website  Munich was a watershed. In great measure it has been since 1972 that the general public has submitted to security searches in airports arenas and other public events  and learned to live with the threat of terrorism.  Germany was criminally negligent about security at the Olympic games.  This is equal to saying that JFK was negligent to have driven in an open car through Dallas or that there should have been anti  aircraft missiles on top of the World Trade Center  with hindsight it is easy to be prophetic.  Clearly not even the Israeli side envisaged that such an attack would have been possible.  Also as the film states at least some of its representatives came to Munich as a gesture of we are still alive you couldn't kill us.  So what should the German police have done  put them under 24  hour armed surveillance and house them in a segregated high  security unit?  German authorites handled the crisis incompetently.  No question but at the time and lacking specialised police forces who wouldn't have?  I think they did the best they could and were clearly very concerned about the security of the Israelis  in fact the movie shows that the then secretary for the interior Hans  Dietrich Genscher even offered himself as a hostage.  The Olympics should have been interrupted immediately.  By the way this decision was handled by the IOC headed by the American Avery Brundage NOT by the German side.  Personally I agree that the Olympics should have been interrupted immediately and for a longer mourning period but I can also see that the IOC didn't want to be seen as giving in to terrorists. Typically for the maliciously manipulative style of the movie IOC members are being shown at a party eating and drinking at the same time as the voiceover tells of their failure to halt the games immediately thereby suggesting that they didn't care for the plight of the hostages.I would also like to reply to some of the statements made by previous reviewers   One reviewer wrote  the crazed excited facial expression of the Palestinian killers in the interview near the end of the movie reminds me of the faces of the old nazi on stand at Nuremberg ... at least in the material shown in the movie the hijackers didn't exhibit any such behaviour so the producers of One Day In September used slow motion and zoomed in on Jamal Al Gashey as he was squinting essentially using a very manipulative technique that would make even Britney Spears look menacing. In fact Jamal Al Gashey who at the time of the crime was not even 20 years old was somewhat of a poster boy terrorist smiling and friendly looking. And by the way I would like to know which scenes of the Nuremberg trial you are referring to  generally the Nazis on trial there were noted for being rather ordinary  looking.  For Christ's sake this isn't Hollywood where all the villains have scars and wear black hats.  I had no idea just how illprepared unprofessional and callously negligent German law enforcement was during the whole affair.  Callously negligent implies that German police wasn't too bothered about the Israelis... hey they're only Jews har har and that's obviously unfounded crap. Ill  prepared and unprofessional  at the time specialised anti  terrorism units didn't exist in Europe and practically at all world wide.  this documentary shows how the German response to the attack was well one which many W.W. II era German leaders would have enjoyedtotal indifference even obstruction.  Just for your information apart from the fact that not even the movie suggests German indifference or obstruction the political party in power at that time was the SPD Social Democrats who were the only party to have voted and unanimously against Hitler's Ermchtigungsgesetz and who were massively prosecuted by the Nazis.  Then federal chancellor and peace Nobel prize winner Willy Brandt spent the Nazi era in exile.  Exactly who are you accusing of what?There is no doubt that severe mistakes were being made that led to the terrible killing of all the Israeli hostages and the documentary would of course have been entitled to point them out.  Instead the film makers seemed to think that the reality hadn't been quite gruesome enough so they produced a movie that is nothing less but modern  day propaganda.

	schema:reviewBody "ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER is a documentary film about the 1972 Munich Olympic games hostage crisis in which Palestinian terrorists took members of the Israeli team hostage.  This film keeps the viewer's interest by telling the story in realtime with all events in chronological order established by newsreel footage interviews with people involved and other firsthand accounts.  The film ultimately portrays the utter incompetance used by everyone involved to try to resolve the conflict unsuccessfully. I was not very familiar with the incident before viewing this film so I personally got a lot out of it.  It really is a gripping piece of work with no sides taken in delivering the true story of what happened that fateful day in September.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in the event or just to history buffs in general.  I think almost anyone who sees the film will learn a lot of information about the incident and I would urge them to do so.  Highly Recommended.".

This film keeps the viewer's interest by telling the story in realtime with all events in chronological order established by newsreel footage interviews with people involved and other firsthand accounts.  The film ultimately portrays the utter incompetance used by everyone involved to try to resolve the conflict unsuccessfully.

All of which is exactly what most people tend to do in situations such as these personalize and humanize the victims while demonizing the proponents.The film fills in backstory on the German government. Just enough back story that is to make one angry at the German government for being criminally negligent despite the fact that this assumes they had any reason to suspect that such an event would take place at the Olympics. It also goes to great lengths to show the Palestinian celebration of the dead men upon their return home but makes no effort to show what could drive men to such acts... Again assuming the presence of evil rather than a logical motive. And the film focuses its efforts on one victim and his widow clumsily humanizing the story in a way which makes it even more ghastly yet as was previously mentioned by the time the film reaches it's conclusion we feel absolutely no remorse about the deaths of the terrorists.This is the kind of film that proposes eye for an eye in regards to terrorism and inflames hatred of Arabs in the eyes of those who do not understand the motives and do not wish to.It is blame wrapped up in a convincing package. Using a human tragedy as ammunition to incite anger at the terrorists rather than intelligent reflection on the horror of the action.It is possible to loathe the action without seeing the perpetrators as inhuman...

In fact all the contenders were stars as they always are during these world competitions. Of course we know their names. We have access to the names of every contestant and finally every winner and loser. The fact that they come with biographies certainly isn't any surprise. That's the nature of the Olympics. We don't know much of anything about the terrorists. They weren't the athletes in the competition. Why should we know about them? This excellent film does not take sides as hard as it must have been to avoid or make any overtly political statements and this has been criticized in some quarters. Instead of presenting a political diatribe or a hate machine or a propaganda film this documentary sticks to the facts presented chronologically for the main part and leaves the viewer to draw any conclusions. There are some conclusions we can hardly avoid but the film doesn't abet in trying to sway us. This is simply a tragedy reviewed and the inability to deal with the circumstances leading up to it in any practical way. The film whizzed by as painful as part of it was to watch. There wasn't much to see about the personal reactions. That wasn't the purpose of this fine piece of work.Curtis Stotlar".

Despite the antagonism between Andrzej and the hitchhiker Andrzej offers him a ride as far as the marina. By the time they reach the lake their antagonism has dissipated enough that Andrzej asks if he would like to join them on their sailing trip. The hitchhiker accepts despite knowing nothing about sailing. As the sailing trip progresses the antagonism between the two men begins to increase again fueled on both sides as each strives to be the alpha male.

We were told it was made behind the backs of Iron Curtain thugs only surviving because of international attention. I wouldn't meet Tarkovsky or Kieslowski until later. And that it was made by the fellow who had made the striking Repulsion which at that time was anticipated but yet unseen in the States.I've since learned some striking things that both Polanski and his cowriter wanted to play the hitchhiker and indeed it is Polanski's voice. And that the mistress who seems only half alive was in fact played by a nonactress they found by looking at swimming pools. Also that the situation was suggested by a long planned and discussed Orson Welles project The Deep that was started after this and never completed. The writing is good of course especially the central image the title denotes but the camera finds the perfect place always. It is like Altman's camera after this that discovers the action rather than say Spielberg's where the action is obviously happening in such a way to be cleanly seen by the camera. And so much harder on a boat!But the interesting thing about such an introduction to a filmmaker is the relationship that follows we know certain things about how he thinks and sees. We expect the conversation to continue and mature over the years. And what a rocky ride this man has taken us on through perfectly created worlds in which I include Ninth Gate but also through pure dreck and rank sentimentality both of which tag The Pianist.Sometimes he's internal to the narrative even the charmed actor. Sometimes he is outside the narrative pulling strings as with this film but sometimes it is clear he never got out of bed.As with Kubrick and so many others you really must start at the beginning which essentially means here.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

The middleaged husband a successful and cynical sportswriter invites the young man on board perhaps to show off his nice yacht his seamanship and eventually his superiority. His young and sexy wife does not say much but as the yacht moves along and tension between two men rises she seems to enjoy the presence of a passenger and the obvious competition between them for her attention.Made of the very simple material the film is a brilliant psychological thriller that shows the young writerdirector's extraordinary ability to create menace on the screen throughout the profound study of the characters' deep hidden emotions. Not as widely known as Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby Knife in the Water is the perfect introduction to the work of the director whose craft in creating disturbing studies of anger humiliation fear and sexuality is truly remarkable.".

But within that story are little bits that keep the story pumping alive. There's also a style that lends itself to a kind of filmmaking that was just budding with the newwave movements of the 60's. Roman Polanski who cowrote and directed the film as well giving an entire voiceover to the hitchhiker is careful in reeling in the emotions out of little dialog and is also granted two tremendous assets aside from the actors 1 Jerzy Lipman's crisp freeflowing and usually tight to get the tenseness of the three characters bw photography draws one in by it's deep focus and sometimes documentary feel. 2 Krzysztof Komeda's jazz soundtrack. Polanski uses the riffs of the soft easygoing side of the weekendout the upbeat pacing when a humorous situation occurs when the hitchhiker loses control of the boat the variations that sometimes occur with the simple shots of a boat sailing fast and slow across the water. Komeda's score for the film is among one of the better ones I've ever heard in regards to it being a great work on it's own and to corresponding to the film he would later provide the memorable theme to Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. The acting itself is interesting in what is not said between them what has to be said by their expressions. The fact that the three have distinct personalities adds to the tenseness it would've been more conventional if the hitchhiker Zygmunt Malanowicz wanted to come on and stay but Andzrej Leon Miemczyk is the more insistent one. Krystyna Jolanta Umecka meanwhile never says more than the other two but is perhaps smarter as well. One thing that definitely shows the film breaking away from the attitudes of the 50's in the emphasis on the sexual tension and the actors convey that very well when called upon  adding to this Umecka is a total natural knockout if not entirely in performance though the quiet inward quality is when she's at her best.

What sets this film apart from others is it's place in movie history and it's polished no pun intended directorial style.This early hit by future great director Roman Polanski manages to make you believe in these three people without questioning the typically silly things that people do in thrillers.  Of course most of us would not invite a strange hitchhiker onto their private boat for an evening especially when the hitchhiker carries with them a huge hunting knife and an attitude. Just throw your disbelief to the wind and sit back and enjoy this little gem.  I loved the juxtaposition of the vast open air and beautiful water vistas with the claustrophobic atmosphere aboard the little yacht.  The terrific moment when the couple dares the young man to hang over the edge of the boat and he begins to run on water alongside.  Even the inevitable seduction rings true due to the circumstances.  I won't reveal anymore scenes.  This film is to be enjoyed by all!  The only complaint is while I saw this film at the normally wonderful Film Forum in NYC the  grossly outdated and shabby looking subtitles positively cry out for a restoration!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Roman Polanski's first full length feature is a simple minimalist piece filled with male posturing dead end situations claustrophobic environments and eerie calm. This is part of Polanski's art house beginnings but many of its themes and much of its style would be carried through to his later more accessible work.Like many a Polanski picture Knife in the Water shows us men competing over a woman. Typically however this is to the end of making the men look ridiculous rather than objectifying the woman. Here the competition is the central theme and the bulk of the film is basically a series of set pieces in which the middleaged husband and the young hitchhiker attempt to outdo each other or show the other up. This drama is concentrated and focused by having only the three characters and confining the action almost entirely to one location. This kind of minimalism is a safe simple way to make a straightforward uncluttered story  a good strategy for an up and coming director  but it's a lot harder to make a really great picture out of such simple elements and the young Polanski does fall somewhat short here.What Polanski does have is his natural talent and feel for cinematic form. His sense of rhythm was evident from his earliest shorts and by this point he had clearly settled upon a style of slow even paces letting scenes take as much time as they needed and never being afraid to hold a shot into socalled dead time if he felt it was necessary. Often the stillness of Polanski's pictures could build up a greater feeling of dread or tension than speed and shocks. Here the pace is leisurely in tune with Komeda's breezy jazz score a sound synonymous with early Polanski. It may be slow but Knife in the Water has great atmosphere.Another of Polanski's strengths was in his feel for space particularly confined space. In Knife in the Water we have a kind of contradiction on this level because a small boat in the middle of a lake is both a very wide open space and a small confined one. You kind of get half the effect of a later Polanski picture such as The Tenant  you do get the sense that the characters and the camera itself are incredibly restricted in their environment but of course you don't get that feeling of all the walls pressing in on you. Nevertheless Polanski was a master at creating this sense and he does tend to surround the camera with bits of boat or actor. There are numerous closeups  typical of the early Polanski although it's something he would drop later in his career  which give a slightly surreal look to some of the shots. A particularly effective moment is the first shot of the boat drifting out across the lake with trees dotted in the background which then cuts to a closeup of Krystyna the wife lying on her back filling the lower half of the frame with the exact same background as the previous shot.Knife in the Water is a fairly good film with some good ideas. It suffers a bit from style over substance but is well acted and well directed and is not long enough to get overly tedious. Better things were to come from Polanski once he moved out of Poland and began his Englishlanguage film career.".

	schema:reviewBody "Almost legendary as director Polanski's first fulllength feature film this moody tense tale of oneupmanship remains impressive today even more so when considering the circumstances of its genesis. Niemczyk plays a stubborn and cocky man who is travelling with his younger wife Umecka by car en route to their sailboat for a long day of sun and fun. When a young hitchhiker Malanowicz steps in front of his car a tug of war begins in which Niemczyk and Malanowicz attempt over and over sometimes playfully and sometimes not to outdo each other in practically everything they can think of. Niemczyk enjoys taunting the seeminglyassured Malanowicz encouraging him to overextend himself at various tasks and trials while Umecka looks on sometimes amused and sometimes annoyed. The tension builds throughout the day relieved only occasionally by periods of camaraderie and placidness. Eventually however the men's attitudes and rivalry begin to boil into a serious level of competition leading to fear confusion and deception. Made under the Communist regime in Poland Polanski's film was fraught with issues from the start and was in fact banned there for depicting upper middle class citizens enjoying the luxury of sailing on a private boat. Polanski who suffered a skull fracture in a car accident during the filming refused to rest up for fear that his film might not see fruition if he took time off for recovery! He achieves amazing results from the potentially disastrous raw materials at hand such as two young performers who had never been in a film before ! and the specter of working in the confined locale of the sailboat on water water as a filming location has defeated many a budget and many a director over the years. Film buffs attracted to the movie for it's striking title and the director's reputation for blood and mayhem may be disappointed that the movie doesn't end with a lot of violence but the mental game of chess is intriguing enough to hold one's attention abetted by an almost endlessly growing feeling of tension. Also the young lady of the film is quite attractive in her bikini once she dumps her goofy cat's eye glasses and let's her hair down. The men are frequently stripped down to abbreviated swimwear as well though their appeal will depend upon the taste of the individual viewer as they are not necessarily matine idol in their appearance. This concept was reworked and amped up in the later film DeadCalm starring Sam Neill Nicole Kidman and Billy Zane. Fans of that film might find this one tame but this one is the more atmospheric not to mention realistic of the two.".

What I did expect was a taut psychological thriller. What I got was a dull film that excited me almost as much as sailing ie not at all. The direction and acting were quite good and the location was used to maximum effect. Part of my enjoyment was just the gee whiz I can't believe they're filming on a boat. However using the word atmospheric to describe this film I guess basically means plotless and rudderless. The first 60 minutes of the film lacked all tensionthe conflict between the two men was totally uninteresting and underplayed to the point of nearinvisibility. As I watched I simply waited for something to happen. Not in an ontheedgeofmyseat way but in a godwhenwillthismovieend way.

When they reach the marina Andrzej unexpectedly and without any reason invites the young man to sail with them initiating a tense dispute of power with the youth in a claustrophobic and erotic environment.Nz w Wodzie is a claustrophobic tense and erotic little movie of the earlier career of Polanski. The simple story is supported by a magnificent cinematography and camera work with unusual angles and great performances of the lead cast. The Brazilian DVD shamefully misses many subtitles leaving without translation many sentences in the dialogs. I immediately recall at least two movies that used concepts of this screenplay Dead Calm and the open end of Adrian Lynes Unfaithful. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Faca na gua Knife in the Water".

When they reach the marina Andrzej unexpectedly and without any reason invites the young man to sail with them initiating a tense dispute of power with the youth in a claustrophobic and erotic environment.Nz w Wodzie is a claustrophobic tense and erotic little movie of the earlier career of Polanski. The simple story is supported by a magnificent cinematography and camera work with unusual angles and great performances of the lead cast. The Brazilian DVD shamefully misses many subtitles leaving without translation many sentences in the dialogs. I immediately recall at least two movies that used concepts of this screenplay Dead Calm and the open end of Adrian Lynes Unfaithful. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Faca na gua Knife in the Water";

And the result is a subtle many layered masterpiece.A couple take a hitchhiker out on their sailing boat. What follows is the subtle underplay of power sexual tension and male posturing. The suspense like in most of Polanski's movies is psychological and the conclusion ambiguous. The only thing constant is the beauty. It is one of those films that belong to the director. It is technically perfect yet the 'technique' as in all good art never takes centerstage. The acting is excellent all the actors look tailormade for their roles. Komeda's score is very good too. It is a film that requires close possibly multiple watching. And the rewards are utterly fulfilling. Whether you are a Polanski fan or just a lover of good cinema Knife in the Water won't disappoint you.".

When I saw the movie I had never seen such a perfect kiss and there had probably never been one like it on American screens. I look at it now and it's no big deal but then it affected me deeply. I saw it alone and a few days later had a date with girl who didn't really care for me. It all changed when I kissed her goodnight....and she asked me to stay a while.

The menacing diabolical suspense. Reasons? There simply isn't enough conflict the teenager is no threat to the couple just a disturbance like the mosquito he swats in a scene because he's too vulnerable and weak. The choice of music score wrecks it too. Cheery jazz? Here? Why? 2. The delicious dark humor so enjoyable in the somewhat similar 'Culdesac' is nowhere to be seen it's just too plainly told to give it that extra vital dimension.And if the youngster is a symbolic indicator of the need for an overhaul in the couple's relationship the script gives us no info about the characters or dialog enough for this to work as a strong drama either nice final shot though suggesting the choice of crossroads the couple face. The title is also more promise than delivery  yes there's a knife... and finally it ends up in the water but the incident isn't followed through with a muchneeded impact. Masterpiece and toprating? Hell no very average to be honest!But OK on the plusside moody BW photography and the premise of the setting. I guess it was used here first so a credit nod for that. 5 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.".

In that culture they are comfortable and even complacent with each other and each knows their place and their duty. They are ready for the incessant dull routine of sailing for 24 hours their nondestructive get away.An unexpected disruption to the routine the husband almost hits a pretty young man with the car. The couple offers the student a ride and the husband and student start the exchange that continues throughout the movie. The husband sees something in the student and invites him to accompany them on their excursion. The student doesn't have anything better to do and accepts. All are willing to accommodate the guest.Because the husband is successful and established operating from the position that he knows how the world really works he starts to mentor the student using whatever tactics get the messages across.Operating from the position that he should be free to make his own decisions and mistakes the student resents or at least resists the husband's mentoring and sets adversarial to the husband.The wife is dutifully subservient and quiet as usual. She knows her husband's position opinions and history. She quietly works to ensure everyone has a calm quiet time.As the continual conflict between the husband and the student wears on everyone's nerves in the closed setting each character loses the firm footing of their established existence and becomes more dynamic as the environment becomes more turbulent and destructive. The husband starts to accept some ideas from the student but senses the change in his relationship with his wife while continuing with his predetermined agenda. The wife starts to open up to the others in the relationship but starts to vocalize and think more independently while trying to stay within the confines of her established role. The student starts to see some of the ideas being mentored but still resents perceived abuses from the husband while trying to not be an unpleasant guest.When they are parked for the night the student and the wife start to be attracted to each other singing and composing poetry because the husband is tuning into the boxing match on the radio and leaving them to entertain themselves. The husband finally suspects impropriety after lights are out. When he finds none they pull up the anchor lose the knife and sail to the climax.This is a story about the independence of youth versus the regimen of establishment the evolutionary power struggle that changes all regardless of whether they are on a side or not. The driving elements are all there. Resentment jealousy cruelty stupidity arrogance shame naivety and imprudence abound.The lack of gimmicks keep you focused on the characters. The subtitles drown out the soundtrack for slow readers and those who don't speak Polish. The black and white photography ensures all of the magnificent vistas are gray and subdued whether stormy sunny or night.Some camera shots are pointedly provocative building our tension and focus on the characters. The performances were believable and realistic. Dialogue is appropriately limited even sparse. The simplistic set is readily identifiable to the audience.This isn't psychological suspense. It's just life readily identifiable to any culture. This movie is a timeless provocative classic. I want it for my collection.".

Right from the start the two men are at odds continually having a battle of wits experience skilland neither of them willing to back down. Of course there's a female to impress as well. Knife in the Water is really a good study of human interaction exploring such themes as power struggles distrust and relationships. Throughout all this there is a wonderful underlying tension that never lets the viewer fully relax. And of course Polanski's direction is outstanding even this early in his career and his decision to use jazz for the soundtrack was a nice touch. Paving the way for his future work Knife in the Water is definitely a worthwhile experience. The Criterion DVD on the other hand is somewhat of a disappointment. The rewind and fastforward functions have been disabled and the subtitles though adequate do not seem to translate all the lines of dialogue. I believe these things were at Polanski's request perhaps for some sort of artistic preservation but frankly I just found them annoying. However the second DVD containing eight of his short films helps to make up for those faults. Anyway in a word recommended!".

In fact to put it bluntly I totally loathe them. I prefer movies that at least try to have a cohesive plot line with a reasonably accessible story idea and some decent tight pacing ie something that's both informative and fun. This is my interpretation of the classic idea of a good story well told.With that in mind I wish to state that this movie film whatever really does work at all levels. It's a good intelligent story apparently based on fact about a very bright very young kid who is discovered to be naturally good at chess and enters the serious national tournaments. During which time there are raised issues of the concept of the winning ethos and keeping or losing your humanity in the process.This cast is magnificent here. The central leads are played by Joe Mantegna and Max Pomerance as the father and son respectively. Both give very wellbalanced performances. Sensitive without being sappy. Max in particular is very good especially in the dramatic climax of the film which he handles with total dignity. It could have been so over the top and patronizing in lesser hands but this time it isn't.They are ably supported by Laurence Fishburne and Ben Kingsley as two different types of coaches from opposite side of the tracks sorry for that old clich. It may seem formulaic but in this case the dramatic contrasts works surprisingly well and both come over as intelligent representatives of their particular points of view. And there are also great character moments by David Paymer QUIZ SHOW MR Saturday NIGHT etc and Hal Scardino THE Indian IN THE CUPBOARD as well.Over all I would highly commend this film as the type of story that manages to tread the fine line between intelligent ideas and an entertaining story. I recommend it to everyone. Give it half a chance and it can work for you. It really is a great example of intelligently entertaining!".

And I believe that this is one of his best characters and best films.As far as Max Pomeranc's acting is concerned...wonderful. Even today I can't think of a kid who's had a better performance. Truly good acting. And sadly for his short lived career I'd have to say he was in his prime there.The creativity in this film is awesome! My favorite scene is when BruceKingsley is teaching JoshPomerac the dynamics of chess and when the camera flips back and forth between the chess pieces each time building up the conversation and going up the ladder of significant pieces. Powerful scene with powerful lessons.I also enjoy that if you don't have much of an interest in chess that it still keeps you capitvated. I wasn't as interested in chess until I saw this movie. And I'm even more interested in film I thought that I couldn't be more interested.And finally...the score. I love James Horner. And this is one of the reasons why. Along with Sneakers Braveheart and many other Horner scores I find it makes the movie that much better.Truly a movie to remember always.".

	schema:reviewBody "Searching for Bobby Fischer is possessive of a certain wonderful insight it is a film that offers no heartwarming premeses and still manages to ease the soul.The characters dwell in an utterly contemporary world you will find no neighbors hauling in bags of money chiming churchbells perfect families or milliondollar smiles anywhere in the film.  At the same time this world of this film exhibits a resilience against its crueler realities that most of the art of the twentieth century eschewed in favor of probing the darkness of existence.  Yes the main characters are prosperous but the spectre of Fischer hangs over the world as a daunting warning of things to come.  The mood of the piece enhanced by the excellent cinematography sets the film up to succeed wonderfully and the actors and text deliver.One of the things I like the most about this movie superficially is that it does not insult the game of chess as it depicts it.  The depiction of the chess world is insightful and accurate from the sharp division between granitehewn chess scholars and colorful tactical wizards to the truly unequaled awe and gravity accompanying the notion of the Grandmaster. Perhaps these are things that can only truly be appreciated by those who have ventured to this world but thankfully the film integrates these elements seamlessly into a universal story that is original and poignant in its detail and elegance.Every actor in this film is spectacular without exception.  That is a bold statement but it is completely justified.  At no point do any of the actors miss a step all the performances are smooth and appear to be utterly effortless.  In their featured roles Ben Kingsley and Lawrence Fishburne put in performances that match in art craft and intensity if not in length any of their more prominent film roles.  Joan Allen is mindbogglingly wonderful considering how precise she has to be to fit such a massive character into such a truncated part in the script.  This is Joe Mantena's very finest performance and of course this movie contains child acting to match any film ever made.  Even the bit parts are acted with intensity depth and elegance.  A lot of this is easy to miss because on the surface the film is so evenhanded but repeated viewings continually bring to attention wonderful nuances of these performances.Any summary or synopsis will fail to accurately relate the message of this film as in any great work of art the quickest most efficient way to word the resolution of the film's ideas and conflicts is to watch the film. This is where Searching for Bobby Fischer really shines.  There is no way these characters could have ended up where they are from any other sequence of events than the one that took place this is a wonderful example of how a plot is woven into a story rather than imposed on it.  The flipside of this is that there is extremely little to be found in this film that can be applied universally without reservation and yet it still manages to be convincing.  There is something mysterious about this movie that rises toward the staggering mysteries of life and repeated viewings are really the only means toward a full understanding of these ideas.Undoubtedly this is the best film made in the 1990s based on a true story if you like me discount Schindler's List from such assessments.  It hardly seems fair to compare Schindler's List to any other film due to its unique purpose..  If you have not seen it I highly recommend it.  It may just change your life.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS The movie Searching for Bobby Fischer parallels the lives of Grand Chess Master Bobby Fischer with that of young seven yearold chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin Max Pomeranc. The movie does it by inserting newsreel footage of Bobby winning the World Chess Championship Tournament in Reykjavik Iceland back in 1972 against the Soviet Unions Boris Spassky. It then jumps back to when Bobby Fischer was a young boy and man in the 1950's and 1960's as his obsession with chess brought him the fame and glory that he sought. Yet at the same time denied him the life of a normal boy growing up in post WWII America that his night and day chess fixation cost him. Josh has lots of promise in becoming a future Bobby Fischer he has a computerlike mind and a natural ability to foresee moves by his opponents even before they even know that they'll make them. One thing that Josh doesn't have is that drive and determination as well as killerinstinct that Bobby Fisher had and as far as I know still does in playing to win and pulverizing his opponents into the ground by doing it. Josh likes all kinds of sports besides chess and his dad Fred Waitzkin Joe Mantegna is a sports writer who takes Josh along to the Yankee and New York Mets baseball games where the young boy really has as much of a good time watching the ball games as he has playing chess. Fred realizes what a whiz his young son Josh is in the game of chess and wants to have him study the finer points of the game by hiring former national chess champion Bruce Pandolfini Ben Kingsley to tutor him and Bruce right away realizes that Josh has the makings of another Bobby Fischer. What does bother Bruce about Josh is his playing with the local chess hustlers like Winnie Laurence Fishburn in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. Which in Bruce's opinion is far to fast and doesn't give young Josh time to develop his all around concentration and understanding of the game of chess. During the course of the movie Josh is driven relentlessly by Bruce in his attempt to mold him into another Bobby Fischer but Josh slowly starts to lose his interest in winning all the chess tournaments that he enters. The very fact of his invincibility makes Josh feel uneasy since it's always expected of him to win like the sun is expected to rise in the morning that there's no fun or excitement in it for him any more. Losing becomes more of a growing experience for Josh and even arouses his passions in making him feel more human. Josh is also too sensitive to beat down his opponents like Bobby Fischer did. That later lost him the championship game against the likewise seven yearold chess phenomenon Jonathan Poe Michael Nirenberg. After his defeat to Jonathan Josh is looked on as if he let down all those who believed in him and at the same time he starts to get his life back together as a young boy living a normal life and not carrying the weight of the entire world of chess on his shoulders. It's during this time that the real talent that Josh had in playing chess comes up to the surface without him being driven relentlessly by Bruce. Those untapped talents leads him to go back to playing chess first with his friend at the park Winnie and then working his way back in winning a number of tournaments to his becoming a top chess champion competitor. All that finally earns Josh a rematch with Jonathan for the Junior Chess Championship of the US in Chicago at the conclusion of the film.Powerful movie and very intense for the young boys and girls in it in how they drive and push themselves to be the best at the game of chess and at the same time putting themselves in danger of sacrificing their one and only childhood to do it. Josh Waitzkin did reach the top back then when the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer was made in 1993 and is still there some ten years and dozens of tournaments later. He did it without losing both his childhood and his kind heart and sensitivity for his fellow man by doing it.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the best things about Searching for Bobby Fischer is that it brilliantly captures the essence of the book it was based on.  Fred Waitzkin's book is not just about chess but focuses much on the relationship between a father and his son. The film does exactly the same and the interaction between the actors is handled skilfully by its director.  This is without doubt one of the best sports movies I have seen in a while you feel an intense level of excitement throughout the chess games and there is a great blend of poignancy humour and serious drama also at play.  Ben Kingsley is fantastic as Bruce Pandolfini and his scenes with the young Max Pomeranc are a joy to watch. Max Pomeranc who plays Josh Waitzkin is perfect in the lead role and really shows he is the heart of the movie. Adapting books to films has never been an easy task but this one is probably one of the best adaptations I have ever seen.".

Fred Waitzkin's book is not just about chess but focuses much on the relationship between a father and his son. The film does exactly the same and the interaction between the actors is handled skilfully by its director.

	schema:reviewBody "You've lost. You just don't know it yet.  Joshua Waitzkin Bobby Fischer regarded by some as the greatest chess player who ever lived lost interest in the game several decades after becoming World Chess Champion. As Fischer grew as an artist  and chess is in a sense an art with its very own aesthetic  he began to outgrow the game entirely. He had discovered all there was to discover mastering the board and finding no value within its black and white grid. What's more Fischer began to develop a feeling of profound disgust for the game. He now held his opponents in contempt seeing them all as inferior players who possessed neither the skill nor artistry to beat him. By the time Fischer began contemplating quitting the game forever the heyday of chess when grandmasters were superstars and games were heavily promoted international events was already long gone. Younger players began copying the moves of the masters and chess became a form of memorised routines and prerehearsed tactics. Chess as an art was dead.For a while Fischer fought against the mechanization of chess he even beat several chess supercomputers creating a variety of flamboyant and fresh tactics even a series of new rules and objectives but eventually he gave up. Having given himself to a cruel mistress whose 64 squares and 32 pieces had demanded complete and total loyalty submission and sacrifice he eventually decided to quit and move on to other things. Almost like a modern day Godard Cinema is dead! It is useless! he was an angry artist too big for a dead artform. He had conquered it achieved all he could and found nothing of value in this victory. Over the following decades he would join religious cults bounce from one confused romantic relationship to the next always feeling miserable and unsatisfied. Seeking the sort of close human relationship that the cold confines of the chessboard could never offer he reportedly died with the following words on his lips Nothing eases suffering like human touch. Searching for Bobby Fischer is about reallife chess prodigy Joshua Waitzkin. At first glance it seems like your regular sports movie  Waitzkin fights various opponents until he faces and defeats Jonathan Poe the current National Scholastic Champion  but it pushes past this to become a surprisingly dark film which seeks to find the value if any of art the meaning or lack thereof of professional mastery and the sinister truths which emerge when one considers the libidinal motivations behind any and all human actions.The film begins with Waitzkin's father hiring a strict instructor played by Ben Kingsley to teach the young boy to be as aggressive and skillful as Bobby Fischer. Kingsley teaches the kid to hold his opponents in contempt that there is no inherent value in victory and that one can only win by dominating another human being. Victory is simply the inferiority of your opponent combined with your own cultlike sacrifices made to the board. Mastery is intimately intertwined with the superego victory tied with aggression even sadism.Realizing that such dedication is turning his son into a robot Waitzkin's mother turns to Laurence Fishburne a chess hustler who plays on park benches. Fishburne teachers Waitzkin's to be spontaneous to play fast and trust his instincts to love the game and be gracious to those he plays.Eventually the film becomes a kind of battle between the id ego and superego. Fishburne represents the pleasure principle playing purely for pleasure in the moment whilst Kingsley represents the reality principle teaching Waitzkin's to put his life on hold and give himself over totally to the board so that he may reap the benefits of mastery 10 years down the line.The film's surface message is that one must achieve a sort of balance symbolised by Waitzkin's merging of both Fishburne's and Kingsley's tactics during the film's climactic showdown. After this Waitzkin's begins to take up other games football baseball karate etc and tries not to let chess suffocate his life. Chess thus becomes a kind of spiritual guide like a medieval craftsman's way of life where one does what one loves and humbly does it to perfection and then moves on to another craft. Waitzkin  still a young man  would then go on to write selfhelp books in which he espouses the realisation that victory and mastery ultimately means less than the process of acquiring knowledge within different fields. Conquer yourself and move on. There is no opponent but that within.But does this work? In real life a decade after this film was made Waitzkin would become a master in various other forms karate Tai Chi etc before coming to the same kind of mental breakdown that Bobby Fischer did many years ago. He bounced from one craft to the next mastering them all but of course finding no inherent value in this mastery.Beyond its dark implications the film works well as conventional entertainment. Chess is perhaps the most cinematic of games and so each chess scene here oozes a kind of palatable tension. Most of the film's best moments involve both audience members and chess players thrilled at having spotting obscure and daring combinations that five to ten moves down the road will inflict upon our opponents utter ruination. It's cool stuff.8.910  Novice director Steven Zaillian is largely unaware of this film's true implications. Likewise most viewers see the film as a conventional sports movie with a gooey Hallmark Channel aesthetic. But in a way Zaillian's ignorance works in the film's favour. He's making your typical sports movie looking for the orgasmic pay off of victory and family reconciliation whilst Waitzkin's father who wrote the story is telling a far darker tale. This tale has to be in the background denied ignored or always indirectly addressed.".

Of course there's the obligatory final championship game in which to win Josh must face his fears personified in the evil chess boy and Bobby Fischer wannabe Jonathan Poe. But by now we realize this film is NOT all about winning and losing. And that brings me to the line I began this review with. As much as we rejoice with Josh in his victory this actually pales in comparison with what he does in the final scene. Because Josh is now secure in is Dad's love and the respect and admiration of his chess teacher he is free to show love and compassion to his best friend by cheering him up and saying something that is both poignant and hilarious considering how close in age they are.Searching for Bobby Fischer is the film by which I actually measure all other sports films.

	schema:headline " A perfect little gem of a movie spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie tells the story based on fact of sevenyearold chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin. It follows him from the time his gift is discovered until he wins a national championship.  You should not avoid this movie if you know nothing about chess  it touches on many themes of broad interest such as being a good parent dealing with lost dreams handling success living with disappointment being yourself when it conflicts with the desires of others examining the value of a balanced life and the nature of art.  Also you need not worry about any half hour waits between chess moves  much of the chess played is speed chess and the serious games are telescoped so as to keep the attention of anyone who does not measure the quality of movie by the number of car crashes and explosions.Among the many delights in this film perhaps the greatest is the astoundingly natural performance of Max Pomeranc as Josh.  It has to rank as one of the best performances by a child actor.  His performance is so sensitive heartrenderingly touching joyful serious and believable that it must in large part be the achievement of the director.  No kid could be that good naturally.    The rest of the cast is excellent as well.  Joe Mantegna plays Josh's sportswriter father Fred with a simple but subtle directness and Joan Allen plays Josh's mother Bonnie with a gritty warmth and understanding.  She is very much plugged into Josh's emotional needs.  Fred and Bonnie are a typical couple sincerely coping with the challenges of raising a kid with an exceptional talent. Fred enlists the retired grand master Bruce Pandolfini Ben Kingsley in another fine role as Josh's teacher.  Bruce is a strict disciplinarian who sees in Josh a way to redeem the joy he lost when chess wizard Bobby Fischer decided to disappear after winning the world championship in 1972.  In addition to Bruce's desires for Josh Fred is pushing Josh as hard and as fast as he will go.  Whereas these two strongwilled men have their own desires for Josh in a pivotal scene with each man the endearing and gentle Josh leads each of them to understand that while they may have been searching for Bobby Fischer who they most assuredly have found is Josh Waitzkin. Most of us are fascinated by genius by talent beyond what we can imagine.  Using this fact the screenplay heightens our interest by cleverly interweaving documentary footage of Bobby Fischer.  If you can remember back to the early 70's you will recall that this primadonna's primadonna had such an effect on U.S. culture that you saw people playing chess in every public venue.  Hard to believe from the current vantage point.  On occasion the musical score gets out of control being more appropriate for a bigscreen western epic but in many scenes sound is used as an effective punctuation mark.  The closeup sound of chess clocks being struck and pieces being moved provide an aural metaphor for the battles being waged on the chess boards.  Conrad Hall was justifiably nominated for an Oscar for best cinematography for this film.  Who would have imagined that you could generate such interest and excitement by filming chess pieces chess boards and chess halls.        There are many wonderful and moving scenes in this movie. For example Josh's first encounter with the game when he sees a motley group of hustlers engaged in speed chess matches in Washington Park. Josh is immediately transfixed.  If you have ever experienced anything like this in your life this scene will give you chills. Or the scene where Bruce first meets Josh in Josh's bedroom.  Bruce enters the room with the reverence a devout Catholic would have in meeting with the Pope.  Gingerly stepping around Josh's toys the sound track calling attention with squeaking floors Bruce absorbs the room's environment with the pleasure of an oenophile drinking an exceptional wine.  Such is the intoxicating attractive power of genius in some men's lives.Movies don't get much better than this.".

Bruce is a strict disciplinarian who sees in Josh a way to redeem the joy he lost when chess wizard Bobby Fischer decided to disappear after winning the world championship in 1972.  In addition to Bruce's desires for Josh Fred is pushing Josh as hard and as fast as he will go.  Whereas these two strongwilled men have their own desires for Josh in a pivotal scene with each man the endearing and gentle Josh leads each of them to understand that while they may have been searching for Bobby Fischer who they most assuredly have found is Josh Waitzkin. Most of us are fascinated by genius by talent beyond what we can imagine.  Using this fact the screenplay heightens our interest by cleverly interweaving documentary footage of Bobby Fischer.  If you can remember back to the early 70's you will recall that this primadonna's primadonna had such an effect on U.S. culture that you saw people playing chess in every public venue.  Hard to believe from the current vantage point.  On occasion the musical score gets out of control being more appropriate for a bigscreen western epic but in many scenes sound is used as an effective punctuation mark.  The closeup sound of chess clocks being struck and pieces being moved provide an aural metaphor for the battles being waged on the chess boards.  Conrad Hall was justifiably nominated for an Oscar for best cinematography for this film.  Who would have imagined that you could generate such interest and excitement by filming chess pieces chess boards and chess halls.        There are many wonderful and moving scenes in this movie. For example Josh's first encounter with the game when he sees a motley group of hustlers engaged in speed chess matches in Washington Park. Josh is immediately transfixed.  If you have ever experienced anything like this in your life this scene will give you chills. Or the scene where Bruce first meets Josh in Josh's bedroom.  Bruce enters the room with the reverence a devout Catholic would have in meeting with the Pope.  Gingerly stepping around Josh's toys the sound track calling attention with squeaking floors Bruce absorbs the room's environment with the pleasure of an oenophile drinking an exceptional wine.  Such is the intoxicating attractive power of genius in some men's lives.Movies don't get much better than this.";

It's curious therefore that writerdirector Steve Zaillian drawing from the book by the father of the reallife Josh Waitzkin chooses to dress this movie in the same clothes of virtually every other sport' movie that is the tale of the driven loner who must overcome his inner doubts to achieve greatness.Josh Waitzkin adeptly portrayed by debutante Max Pomeranc who incidentally is also a ranked player is an ordinary child with an amazing gift for chess.   Inspired by the hustlers who play for money in Washington Square  especially an aggressive hustler called Vinnie Fishburne who wins by unnerving his opponents as much as he does by his skill at the game  Josh quickly rises through the ranks supported by his father Mantegna who employs Bruce Pandolfini Kingsley to nurture the boys innate talent. The relationship between Pandolfini and the boy although respectful grows increasingly adversarial as the serious stuff begins and Josh's nerve begins to waver.   Vinnie and Pandolfini represent opposite ends of the chess spectrum each vying for Josh's loyaltySEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER is an entertaining wellacted movie its pace is leisurely but never flags and it explores the relationships involved in the story intelligently if a little shallowly at times Josh's relationship with Vinnie  potentially the most interesting of the story  is especially underwritten.   Only Zaillian's decision to make Josh's youthful chessplaying nemesis a somewhat sinister figure something along the lines of the singlebrowed baby who occasionally pops up in the Simpsons is badly misjudged. Zaillian seems conscious of the scarcity of a readymade audience for this kind of tale and strives to make chess something that it isn't  exciting  in an attempt to woo a larger audience.   Thus he allocates equal time to the highspeed duels of the junkies and losers' at Washington Square as they capture pieces at breathtaking speed in their twominute sprints as he does to the lengthier and more sedate combat of the tournament player. However even during the tournament games he chooses to have his participants slam their pieces on the board and smack the timer with exaggerated force in an attempt to inject excitement.  The film is shot through with darkness hinting at the essentially introspective nature of the game and its participants many of the scenes take place in darkened rooms populated by shadowy figures hunched over their pieces and the chessplaying fraternity is portrayed as a rather meanspirited lot populated by embittered and eccentric men.   The enigmatic figure of Bobby Fischer serves as both an icon and a symbol of the consequence of the pressures genius bestows upon its owner.The concluding match it has to be said is very effectively staged managing to wring every ounce of emotion from a potentially dry situation although regrettably the story ultimately succumbs to genre convention once the game is over.".

Great story and great acting by Max Pomeranc.So naturally I wanted to learn more about Josh Waitzkin and much to my disappointment I found that the ending was a complete lie. Yes Josh did play for the US championship. But in reality Josh didn't win. When Josh was 9 years old he had a draw against a 7year old named Jeff Sarwer. And an analysis of the game shows that Jeff was clearly winning but a mistake cost him ending the game in a draw.Jeff Sarwer is an interesting story. In real life Pandolfini said that he had never met anyone else with such a raw talent for the game. But unlike Josh who grew up in a comfortable surroundings Jeff really did play speed chess with the drug addicts. His father was considered abusive and Jeff and his equally talented sister Julia were taken away from his father by protective services. But the kids ran away from a foster home back to their father and Jeff didn't play chess again for almost 20 years. And when he did he beat a number of grandmasters despite having no apparent practice.So far we know that the ending was a lie thanks to the Internet making these games from 1985 available and that Jeff played with the drug addicts. So what is really true?My unfortunate conclusion is that Josh's dad saw that while his child was talented he was nowhere close to Jeff Sarwer by the way Josh never made GrandMaster. But with Sarwer out of the way why not make his son look good and make Jeff look bad. What a travesty!".

The teacher had forbid Josh from playing anymore speed chess with adults in the park mom let him get back to it. A happy Josh once again took interest in chess and began playing better than ever.In the climax Josh was playing the final game of a tournament against a kid he feared he couldn't beat. With renewed assurance that his parents and teacher loved him for who he was and not for his chess he played a relaxed game but made a bad move. Josh was in danger of losing but studying the board realized the 12move sequence that would gain him the victory. He held out his hand offering a draw trying not to embarrass his opponent. They would share first place. His opponent was a bit indignant refused said play.  And Josh won the match.There is a bit of cliche' in the story. The men are all aggressive and the mom is the only one who understands the boy. But the film is so well done and the message so faithful I give it a very high rating. The DVD has a very nice picture for this age film the sound is Dolby 5.1 but there isn't much surround sound.".

	schema:reviewBody "Coaches teachers and parents of kids often make one of two errors in competitive activities1. They try to convince their kids that winning is the only thing that matters. 2. They instill in their kids a great fear of losing.Josh Waitzkin is a young 7yearold boy who enjoys playing the game of chess. He's also a very nice sweet kid who never feels comfortable or even enjoys beating an opponent. He simply loves the game. When he first plays his father in a game of chess he doesn't try his hardest. He's afraid of beating and hurting his father's feelings. This part of the film lays the foundation for the entire rest of the film. His mother has to tell him it's okay if you beat him. You won't hurt his feelings. Only then does Josh play at his best and wins.Fred Waitzkin Joe Mantegna represents the first fear that I listed. He's an extremely supportive father who is very proud of his son. He's better at this than anything that I will ever do in my whole life he says of Josh. While his passion and support are strong he falls into the trap of living vicariously through his son. Winning is the most important thing to him. When Josh loses a match to an inferior opponent Fred is upset and can't understand why Josh lost. He doesn't realize that Josh loves his father and only wants to please him. It isn't until then that Fred realizes his mistake and he finally encourages Josh to play for fun.On the other side is Josh's chess teacher Bruce Ben Kingsley. He represents the second fear that I listed. He is afraid of Josh losing. Bruce is a man who is so scarred by his own losses that happened long ago that he more or less hides out in an old chess room. At first Fred Waitzkin has to talk him into taking his son as a student. While Bruce's demeanor is somewhat cold it's obvious that he truly loves Josh and can't bear the thought of Josh going through the pain of losing a match. It isn't until the end that he realizes that Josh is really in no danger of this even if he did lose. Josh isn't greatly affected by either winning or losing. He only likes to play. But Bruce tries to tell Josh that he needs to hold his opponents in contempt. That type of notion simply doesn't exist in Josh.Bobby Fischer held the whole world in contempt says Bruce. Josh responds I'm not him. Josh already knows who he is and he isn't trying to be the next Bobby Fischer no matter how much everyone else wants him to be. He only wants to be himself.There are two characters in this movie that already know Josh's heart and they give him the positive values and support that Josh needs.First his mother Joan Allen. She is so enamored by Josh's good heart that at one point she threatens her husband. He's not weak. He's decent. And if you or Bruce or anyone else tries to beat that out of him I swear to God I'll take him away.Second is his friend Vinnie Laurence Fishburne a man that Josh meets in Washington Square where Vinnie spends his time playing speed chess with other people who are mostly transients. Josh quickly makes friends with him even though Bruce doesn't like it. But Vinnie holds the wisdom of competition that Bruce fails to give to Josh. You're playing not to lose Josh. You have to risk losing. You have to play on the edge of defeat. That's where you want to be!I can't stress the performance of young Max Pomeranc Josh Waitzkin enough. He seems to know exactly who Josh is and he plays him with a gentle sweetness that can't be ignored or overlooked. You see it in his eyes and facial expressions. He looks at his opponents not as enemies but simply another kid sitting across from him who could easily be his friend. Josh has a wellbalanced life. Chess isn't everything to him. He enjoys doing other things. Perhaps this is a testament to why his character is so strong. His opponent at the end Jonathan Poe thinks of only chess and we quickly find that he is a very unhappy and miserable kid. He's the kind of player that Bruce tries to make Josh and we are thankful that Josh never goes down that road.Competition is so strong in our culture. Most parents teachers and coaches fall into these two fears without realizing it. We push and push we forget that they are children and that we need to stress the importance of having fun being a good sportsman and being gracious in victory and defeat. It's truly amazing to find that Josh Waitzkin already realized this at the tender age of 7. Hopefully we can begin to pass these values on to our own kids.".

	schema:headline " Drama about chess life and staying true to oneself";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite the title Searching for Bobby Fischer 1993 isn't about the extraordinary chess champion Bobby Fischer but rather truelife chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin played convincingly by Max Pomeranc. The story chronicles his rise to prominence as a 78 yearold in the world of chess competition. The eccentric and reclusive Fischer permeates the proceedings however as he's constantly referred to and there's even footage of him being interviewed or beating a dozen experts simultaneously etc. Joe Mantegna and Joan Allen play Josh's father  mother while Ben Kingsley and Laurence Fishburne play his formal and informal teachers respectively.I don't think you need to know about chess to enjoy this film but it wouldn't hurt. It's primarily a drama and secondarily a sports film. Being about chess it lacks the action of conventional sports films but it's a sports film nevertheless with its inherent formula. Regardless I was surprised at how suspenseful they made the final match which isn't easy to do since chess doesn't seemingly lend itself to cinema.This is a film that'll likely improve on repeat viewings because there are a few interesting subtexts. For instance Josh's formal instructor and his dad keep trying to mold him into the likeness of Fischer and his misanthropic mindset but Josh's mother and informal instructor encourage him to be who he is and play naturally. The former two foster rigid discipline and contemptible aggressiveness while the latter two encourage spontaneity and the joy of the game. Perhaps a balance between both is best.Years ago I informally studied chess for a couple of years reading books and manually performing all the moves buying  playing computer sets etc. but I'd only be considered average at best compared to the child players in the film. The reason I bring this up is because as much as I knew on the topic at the time I realized I merely touched the surface and that there were whole new realms to explore learn and master. This is the way it is with any great sportarttopicoccupation. To truly grasp any one of them and master it to any degree requires serious determination and great sacrifice. You can't be a jack of all trades and expect to be extraordinary in one.The movie also seems to be saying that you shouldn't sacrifice everything else to be a chess master and lose the joy of playing the joy of living. After all what good is that? While this is true it only goes so far and Waitzkin's life since the movie proves it He wanted to do other things than be a chess champion which is fine but to do so he had to drop out of chess competition altogether which he did in 1999. By contrast Garry Kasparov is considered the most consistent chess champion holding the record for the longest time as the No. 1 rated player in the world from 1986 to 2005 two freakin' decades precisely because of his skill determination and sacrifices.The movie inspires you to look up the incredible Fischer who reigned supreme in the 60s through early 70s and then dropped off the face of the earth. In 1981 he stayed with grandmaster Peter Biyiasas for four months where he beat Biyiasas seventeen times in speed chess. Biyiasas later testified in a Sports Illustrated interview He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. Bobby honestly believes there is no one for him to play no one worthy of him. I played him and I can attest to that. Bobby Fischer never viewed the film but rightly complained that it was improper to use his name and footage of him without his permission. Fischer never received any compensation from the movie and said he was swindled.Look for the beautiful Laura Linney in a bit part.The film runs 109 minutes and was shot in New York City including Washington Square where numerous scenes take place and Toronto.GRADE B".

I was smooth talked by Justin Mark's assurance that his treatment of the movie was respectful and to be prepared for a new era of gaming films. I was pumped and on board and then... I saw the film. THE GODAWFUL The script from this movie was a joke. When Bison utters something about milk and expiry dates I laughed. It was a nervous laugh but it was laughter. This movie makes no sense to me at all. The pitch was it was a Chun Li story about looking beyond revenge. In the end she gets her revenge and the moral is? Revenge is the answer. THE BAD The costumes in this movie can also suck it. I felt terrible for Kristin in the night club scene wearing a ridiculous dress and using her feminine wiles  primo top dollar dancing to the unaware to lure Cantana a lesbian associate of Bison into a bathroom. The pacing of this movie was dreadful and we are handheld for every scene if Chun Li is walking on the screen she will undoubtedly inform us I was walking.. ... REALLY? Really. THE UGLY The truth is this movie insults movie goers gamers and people in general. Am I supposed to feel for Chun Li even though she had a privileged life and a loving mother? How is she a victim of circumstance? Am I supposed to feel Vega's threatening persona through five minutes of him getting the crap kicked out of him? Am I supposed to believe Bison is all evil when he continues to nurture his daughter? I think this movie was seriously edited so terribly whatever good there was to salvage was lost on the cutting room floor. Whoever edited this needs to be bird kicked in the throat. It just makes no sense to me how the editor could do his job watch the movie and allow this to enter the theaters. The best parts of the movie involved subtitles and a sunset. That is it. So there you go street fighter 2? Most assuredly not.".

Acting is not that good especially Chris Klein's. The fighting scenes are not that bad though they do have some confusing and sloppy stunts. It is based on the popular fighting game.The story ChunLi's father was kidnapped by some bad guys who are Bison and Barog. Few years later she sets out a journey to find her father. The cops led by Charlie Nash and Maya. Blah the story is typical. Fight scenes are slotted in between the actionpacked journey. Charlie NashChris Klein makes the acting unintentionally funny. Even the way he walks. One word I can describe his acting Lame. It seems that he is bored plus he is overacting. I got to admit that some of his looks are priceless. He makes the story less serious. But whatever it is I was entertained.Overall It is not that bad as what other people commented on it. If you want an enjoyable movie leave your brain at home. Don't take this movie seriously. If you do that you will be groaning all the way plus it may seem to you that you are sitting on the sofa for more than 2 hours. This is the first videogame adaptation for the year.

Her dad gets taken away from her at a young age by M. Bison who uses him in his criminal plot to overthrow Bangkok. Unfortunately for Bison Chun Li grows up meets a mystic who teaches her some freaky stuff and sets out to kick his ass. While the Van Damme version was far from spectacular it had a sense of humor about itself and wasn't afraid to have fun with the material which was at the very least entertaining for a lazy hour and a half. The Legend of Chun Li tries to be a dark brooding action thriller with something like Batman Begins as its model...but the material just doesn't support it. The plot goes back and forth between clichs and just plan dumb hokey scifi stuff. Yes being rid of your goodness is actually a plot point. The script is loaded with cheesy dialog and flat characters which doesn't make the actors' jobs any easier and they really don't live up to the challenge. Chris Klein is particularly bad in his attempt to be the bad ass.You would think the action would at least make it worth the time but even that is nothing to brag about. The fights are far too staged and obviously fake. They throw in some signature moves from the video games that are beyond reality. If they'd been shot differently they would've been cool but here they just look ridiculous. These are things that would fit at home in a more cartoony film like its predecessor...but sorry no go.".

Great. This part proceeds with the pacing and depth of a newbie film student's freshman project and is completely unremarkable. WHat is TRULY terrible however is that she NEVER SHUTS UP!

Right from the getgo you are amazed at the flat base dialog that would only impress those who had just discovered the joys of reading  the speech is flat stilted and poorly acted by all in the cast. M. Bison's entry into the early set was particularly painful to listen to and Balrog's cheesy entrance into the scene was so godawful that I was actually pining for the time when he held a video camera as ChunLi's cameraman back in 94! Oh and let's talk about one plot point that just angered me off from the getgo M. Bison's origin. So supposedly in order to drive out his conscience which is supposed to make him more powerful? Heh...okay... he must rip his unborn daughter from her mother's womb in a spooky cave where evil spirits dwell.Huh. Riiiight.Now it's bad enough that they made up such a stupid plot point to begin with but can someone please explain something to me just how is it that M. Bison could have actually even HAD a conscience in the first place if he was willing to go through with killing his wife and ripping out his daughter from her womb? Further HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO MAKE HIM MORE POWERFUL?! ............yeah. It's a lot of this I stole these plot ideas from my ten year old son crap throughout the whole film.Oh and if anyone EVER defends Chris Klein as an actor after this film they lose all credibility...not just as a film critic but as a human being with ANY opinion whatsoever.

	schema:reviewBody "Having enjoyed the game as I a kid I was excited to see Chun Li in a new feature adaptation. The cast showed signs of mixing it up with its choices and I was willing for the ride.While the overall origin story is strong the piano playing a very nice touch for depth unfortunately many scenes come off as campy. On a scale the strongest scenes are easily those between Kristin Kreuk and Robin Shou as Chun Li and Gen and sadly the weakest being Michael Clark Duncan and Chris Klein's characters of Balrog and Nash.That was the central problem for me here there is an exciting action piece at work but is jumbled with various other plot lines and set pieces that really feel out of place. The feeling of the film comes off as uneven as was also the case with Director Andrzej Bartkowiak's previous works in CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE and DOOM. This film unfortunately continues Bartkowiak's pattern.Nevertheless Chun Li was carried well by Ms. Kreuk and the effort was well mounted.RT.".

For instance Chun Li was clearly Chinese when she was 10 years old. But when she grew up she was half Chinese and half Caucasian.A lot of the people here complained about the storyline and the lack of special effects. Too much nick picking...The storyline wasn't too bad it didn't stay 100 to the video game storyline but somewhat similar. And to me was the storyline good enough? yes it was I wasn't expecting much in the first place so i could only go up from there.There wasn't too much special effects in this movie. Which I enjoyed more actually. The movie would look too unrealistic if fireballs were thrown everywhere.Acting was OK not great and convincing but for this type of movie its good enough.Honestly this movie isn't as bad as people claim I've seen much worst movies made by the wayan brothers. And the notion that even the first street fighter movie was better than this one is totally ludicrous. The first one had the worst acting color special effects ever not even close compared to this one.".

The fights were original acrobatic and fun. Better wire work as in romeo must die! It almost never looked fake. But what I liked most was that there were no unnecessary special effects. remember 1994? OMGIn other words The film worked for me because it was not trying too hard. Not too much action drama and special effects. Its not a great film but decent. Try not to expect too much and you will not be disappointed.

Maya Sunee Moon Bloodgood who's corny and horrible one line's make you wonder why they are even in the story. Their presence in the Movie ruined anything good in the movie. At one pint Chris Klein delivered a line and sounded like a funny punchline it wasn't neither was anything that came out from him. Another disappointment to fan's was the short fight scene between ChunLi and Vega the fight was not worth the slight build up for it. In general I enjoyed a bit of the movie mainly watching ChunLi's journey and Bison Neal McDonough playing a cold blooded villain which was the only character that was fun to watch. The opening fight was the best through the movie after that the rest just are plain. The end give's us a nice little hook to see the next one as they mention Ryu and the Street Fighter Tournament but if the same writer and director are to do it I rather save my money and avoid watching it especially if Charlie Nash Chris Kleinwill be in it.I was disappointed as a fan and a movie goer.".

I hate movies where the characters tell their story and when their telling it from their prospective. That was how it started for street fighter. Vega was over too quick and not great the club scene was all right until ChunLi did her upside down kick it was way poorly done. And the ending was really weird. While ChunLi and Gem are talking Gem mentions Ryu's name..it must be a hint that there will be a sequel. Hopefully if there is one it will be better than this.The movie was very confusing to watch and I just didn't understand what exactly was the point. I just got cheesed off at a point.

	schema:headline " You'd Think Capcom Would Make It MORE Accurate";
	schema:reviewBody "So one would think that this movie would be more accurate to the video games and Anime movies since Capcom had direct hands in this. Nope! This is even worse than the 1994 film. But unlike that one this one isn't fun. This one isn'y laughably bad. It's just bad. I'll basically go through it so spoilers if you actually wanted to be surprised.I went into it expecting crap based on the trailers. But at first I'm pleasantly surprised! Duncan is Balrog and portrays him very well. Big black boxer working for Bison enjoys killing people. Spot on characterization and acting. The opening fight with Chun Li's dad against Balrog and his henchmen was good fun all the way through. I was having a great time! Then M. Bison comes in. Who appears to be the nicest British man in the world. I don't think he's actually British but that's how he feels. He is not fueled by Psycho Power he is not the be all end all badass. He's a guy in a suit. Now at first I thought this is how he would start then later in the movie he would get his Psycho Powers. This never happens.ChunLi's actress isn't a bad actress. She plays the role very well. But there's a big major problem she looks nothing like ChunLi. This is a glaring issue if for no other reason than it being so distracting to a fan of the games. She's barely Asian more meek than the most powerful woman in the world and her legs are NOT super duper awesome. Speaking of which Chun Li never does her kick attack in this movie. Her trademark move is nowhere to be seen. She does something similar to a Spinning Bird Kick and a Kikoken. In fact the focus of making Chun Li so awesome in this movie is her learning and performing the Kikoken. Nevermind that this move has never been the focus of Chun Li's character ever it's her lightning fast kicks. But I'm glad there was a fireball in this movie that was the main down note of the original live action Street Fighter movie. Also she's not a cop. At all.Robin Shou finally pops back up into movies playing Gen. Of course the character is portrayed completely wrong. He's not an old assassin he's a middle aged former criminal. He also teaches Chun Li the Kikoken. But since Gen hasn't been such a staple character like say most of the SF2 characters it isn't as obvious. It's nice to see Robin again as well.Charlie Nash appears in this as well. The name is pretty much all you get though. He doesn't fight doesn't Sonic Boom and doesn't really look like Charlie.Vega is a waste of Vega. He's dressed in all black and has long black hair making him look like a ninja as opposed to a Spaniard fighter. Sure he's the Spanish Ninja but his costume is ridiculous. The mask looks like a really cheap prop especially even compared to the 1994 film. The actor as well is a horrible cast for Vega. Vega is beautiful. The Vega in this movie is a tough guy and sounds more like a black man than Michael Clark Duncan. Plus his appearance is horribly short both times which is worse the second time around. You expect Chun Li vs. Vega to be the first really big fight and it's actually the shortest.The movie itself has serious pacing issues. Chun Li starts fighting about 15 minutes too late. A large chunk of the first act is based on Chun Li living amongst the people of Bangkok. Something which could have been wrapped up in a few minutes we would have gotten the point. Instead we're treated to what feels like a half an hour of boring narration and Chun Li walking around streets.Most of the time when Chun Li is kicking ass it's entertaining. The problem is how little it happens. And how boring the rest of the movie is. Whenever we cut to Nash we just don't care about that storyline. When Chun Li dances it's unneeded as is the borderline lesbian scene. The movie just crawls along trying to make its way to an ending you probably don't care about anymore.When we finally get to the end Bison starts kicking ass. He is able to punch Gen across a room with little effort but never does anything you would expect M. Bison to do. He fairs more poorly against Chun Li while in a very nice suit but keeps the upper hand until Chun Li performs her epic Kikoken technique which hurts him way more than it should. And after it's been drilled into our heads that Bison put his soul into his daughter and that's his ONLY weakness Chun Li kills him by snapping his neck 180 degrees. Thus adding another weakness Bison has having his neck snapped 180 degrees.So both Balrog and Bison are killed in this movie before the tournament even occurs.The film ends with Gen meeting Chun Li with an ad for the Street Fighter tournament hinting that Bison is behind it even though he was seemingly? killed. He mentions that there's a great fighter in Japan they must recruit His name is Ryu...something. And the film ends.So instead of properly making a Street Fighter movie the filmmakers behind this opted to make a prequel to what the audience would care about. A poor prequel at that which nobody will like so we may never get a realgood Street Fighter movie with Ryu as the main character. I would avoid this in theaters or giving it money at all. The only reason to give it money would be so there's hope of a sequel about the tournament.".

But I'm glad there was a fireball in this movie that was the main down note of the original live action Street Fighter movie. Also she's not a cop. At all.Robin Shou finally pops back up into movies playing Gen. Of course the character is portrayed completely wrong. He's not an old assassin he's a middle aged former criminal. He also teaches Chun Li the Kikoken. But since Gen hasn't been such a staple character like say most of the SF2 characters it isn't as obvious. It's nice to see Robin again as well.Charlie Nash appears in this as well. The name is pretty much all you get though. He doesn't fight doesn't Sonic Boom and doesn't really look like Charlie.Vega is a waste of Vega. He's dressed in all black and has long black hair making him look like a ninja as opposed to a Spaniard fighter. Sure he's the Spanish Ninja but his costume is ridiculous. The mask looks like a really cheap prop especially even compared to the 1994 film. The actor as well is a horrible cast for Vega. Vega is beautiful. The Vega in this movie is a tough guy and sounds more like a black man than Michael Clark Duncan. Plus his appearance is horribly short both times which is worse the second time around. You expect Chun Li vs. Vega to be the first really big fight and it's actually the shortest.The movie itself has serious pacing issues. Chun Li starts fighting about 15 minutes too late. A large chunk of the first act is based on Chun Li living amongst the people of Bangkok. Something which could have been wrapped up in a few minutes we would have gotten the point. Instead we're treated to what feels like a half an hour of boring narration and Chun Li walking around streets.Most of the time when Chun Li is kicking ass it's entertaining. The problem is how little it happens. And how boring the rest of the movie is. Whenever we cut to Nash we just don't care about that storyline. When Chun Li dances it's unneeded as is the borderline lesbian scene. The movie just crawls along trying to make its way to an ending you probably don't care about anymore.When we finally get to the end Bison starts kicking ass. He is able to punch Gen across a room with little effort but never does anything you would expect M. Bison to do. He fairs more poorly against Chun Li while in a very nice suit but keeps the upper hand until Chun Li performs her epic Kikoken technique which hurts him way more than it should. And after it's been drilled into our heads that Bison put his soul into his daughter and that's his ONLY weakness Chun Li kills him by snapping his neck 180 degrees. Thus adding another weakness Bison has having his neck snapped 180 degrees.So both Balrog and Bison are killed in this movie before the tournament even occurs.The film ends with Gen meeting Chun Li with an ad for the Street Fighter tournament hinting that Bison is behind it even though he was seemingly? killed. He mentions that there's a great fighter in Japan they must recruit His name is Ryu...something. And the film ends.So instead of properly making a Street Fighter movie the filmmakers behind this opted to make a prequel to what the audience would care about. A poor prequel at that which nobody will like so we may never get a realgood Street Fighter movie with Ryu as the main character. I would avoid this in theaters or giving it money at all. The only reason to give it money would be so there's hope of a sequel about the tournament.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had never heard of Chun Li until I first saw the announcement that Kristin Kreuk would get the lead. What I eventually learned about The Street Fighter I liked. A female lead in an action role which could compare somewhat to Batman sounded enticing. I guess another comparison that crossed my mind was Lara Croft.Kristin Kreuk won a great part when she got the role of Chun Li. Being a fairweather fan of Smallville I had long hoped she would find a fitting character in the movies. Her time has come. I like her ability to show intensity and weakness. Emotion is her best partner in acting.As far as the movie itself goes I felt somewhat cheated. I was intrigued by the introduction which was narrated nicely by Kristin. Some of the narration that continued was OK but it soon became an awkward and overbearing distraction. The director obviously did not recognize that crossing the line by overnarration in an action movie could be a definite drawback. He also did not seem to know that while this is a movie about a fictitious crimestreet fighter you don't have to litter this kind of movie with weak and poorly played characters like Charlie Nash and Detective Maya Sunee. They both seemed to be square pegs being forced into round holes. Chris Klein overplayed his part as though he thought playing an immature detective meant acting like a 12 year old one moment and 17 otherwise. I am sure the 12 and 17 yearolds who played this game were just as disappointed as I was with his portrayal. Meanwhile Moon Bloodgood seemed to be just as unsure what she was doing with her character. If there is a sequel these two characters will have to be rehashed  hopefully by two different actors. And at this point I have to say a new director should be considered as well. Andrzej Bartkowiak seemed too loosely connected to the true potential of this movie. Forget about accentuating bumbling law enforcement focus more on action mystery and oriental intrigue. Comic relief is good but outright stupidity is unforgivable.I found the fight scenes fun to watch and special effects were enjoyable although minimal. The story was good  better than the story tellers.Michael Clarke Duncan and Neal McDonough both were great. The deadly threat they both portrayed helped to keep the story together by giving the good guys more evil to fight off than they seemed to be able to handle. And Robin Shou was a great trainer and partner for Kistin Kreuk. If Kristin and Robin come back for a sequel then the sequel stands a chance of being better than the original even though I still give Street Fighter The Legend of ChunLi a 710".

	schema:reviewBody "We now have Street Fighter The Legend of Chun Li a story about the First Lady of Fighting Games herself. Yes Chun Li was featured in the previous movie played less than adequately by Ming Na but she was only a supporting character in that flick and aside from knocking a few heads and spewing some lame dialogue she didn't have much to do. So it's nice to see her finally in the spotlight portrayed by an actress who actually bothers to put some effort into her performance Kristin Kreuk.The previous Street Fighter film pretty much failed to give its characters any good development or reason to show any real emotions making it rather hard to connect with them. This new film at least tries and even succeeds in some places when Chun Li sheds tears in this movie we know precisely why and we understand her sorrow. She is endeared far more to us this time around. It would not be spoiling anything to say this movie is much better than its predecessor. But is it really a good movie? Well...Now obviously director Andrzej Bartkowiak and screenwriter Justin Marks had a daunting task before them. They not only had to please Street Fighter and Chun Li fans around the world but somehow try to make a good movie in the process. And of course you can't tell a story about street fighters without the proper pacing. Pacing in fact is where the movie's first failure falls into our laps as it's tragically rushed in all the wrong places. Events that should be treated delicately and given sufficient screen time to allow us to appreciate their significance are whizzed right by us drastically reducing their impact. Instead of thoughtful remarks we're given more passing comments on things that are supposed to tell us more about the characters we're watching. And aside from Chun Li Bison and to a lesser degree Chun Li's father and Gen none of the characters receives much by the way of development thus causing this film to fail in the same general area the previous one did. And Interpol Officer Charile Nash yes the same Charlie Nash whom Guile was so eager to avenge in the games is on the scene as well he's determined to bring Bison down. If only we learned why. Actor Chris Klein and actress Moon Bloodgood who plays his partner Maya aren't given much to do and what they are given to do isn't very engaging or exciting. Much of their contributions to the story are tossed out as quickly as they're flung in leaving us very little time to appreciate any of it. And Nash's oneliners which are of course meant to be witty are not really that witty. Or all that funny.On the whole the movie doesn't quite work. It has some good ideas and an interesting story but it really doesn't handle them properly. For every strong moment the film has there is a weak one to bring things down again and of course there's an open ending though if they actually make a sequel to this I'll be amazed. I likely won't be the first in line to see it though. I probably won't see the movie again either... well not in the theater anyway. I may buy the soundtrack however the music wasn't half bad. If you like solid electronic dances tunes the soundtrack may be worth your while. The movie on the other hand won't really entertain general audiences and I imagine fans of the games will be pretty divided on it.Oh and they mispronounced Ryu's name. AGAIN.Final score 610. Nice try but try harder next time guys.".

And that is pretty much all that is discernible from a plot that bounces around more than the heroine when she battles bad guys...and girls. The movie's downfall is its attempt to cram too much of everything into a world and story that is a lot more simple.The film starts off earnestly enough. The sweet tunes of a grand piano gently transport us into an ordinary world that is soon going to come crashing down. And crashing down it does and not in the good 'bashing your opponents face into the pavement' way but rather in the bland character's bad acting convoluted and totally unbelievable story kind of way. Now before I get into how bad this movie really is I will start with what is good about it. But 'good' certainly does not mean redeemable. The cinematography and camera work are great and truly capture the essence of the places the story takes us. The fight scenes are wellchoreographed and wellshot for the most part which is more than most Hollywood martial arts heavy films can say these daysI am glaring at the insanely hard to follow 'staticcam' of the Bourne films and Bond's latest foray into an unwelcoming actiongenre.And that viewers is where the goodness of this hack ends. What follows is a lot of overacting to the point of hilarity cheap and pointless oneliners too many implausible scenarios that don't have any basis in anything related to reality. And yes I know this is 'Street Fighter' and it is based on a mildly supernatural video game but some of the events that occur in this film are just too overthetopBison 'delivering' baby scene...enough said. The film raises questions we as viewers shouldn't need to ask...and then we never get answers to those questions! ChunLi and Gen are the films 'strong' points. Bison is nowhere near as imposing as he should be. And even though his Irishyes apparently Bison is Irish parents died just after he was born and he was raised on the streets of Bangkok with nothing but Thai people adult Bison somehow managed to retain a spoton Irish accent. Balrog is just plain hokey. Vega who is supposed to be a Spaniard but certainly is not in the film is...well he just is. His character is neither cool nor threatening and not even as arrogant as he is supposed to be. The characters of Nash and Det. Sunee are totally forgettable and as a matteroffact totally unbelievable as well. No decent highranking detective like Sunee claims to be walks around as scantily clad as she does when she's at work.Oh my God ladies and gentlemen I could go on and pick this film apart piece by piece but that would entail me giving away spoilers...and this film has spoiled having only been released yesterday. You wouldn't waste your money on spoiled food would you? I think not so don't waste it on this tripe.And for the record I am a fan of the games and I have seen the animes and read the graphic novels. I think I speak for all real fans that we want Ryu and we want Ken. We want their journey from children to brothers to karate street fighting masters. We want their revenge on Akuma and Ryu's scarring bout with Sagat. Simple. Right? No Interpol no sexy cops and no Shadaloo supposed to be Shadow Law btw.

I assure you that is not the case.If you're expecting a repeat of the vandamme flick then you will be disappointed as that is not what you will get. This is not a turn by turn fight movie it is an adventure movie. Chun Li goes to Hong Kong to rescue her father and ends up fighting a bunch of people along the way. Many of the fights involve gun ambushes and typical fight scenes for cheesy action films with people who don't do martial arts in real life. There is no tournament just her journey. The fighting is marginal the acting is marginal the action is marginal.Kristen Kreuk Chun Li is the same character as any other part she plays notably Lana in Smallville  she talks the same and pretty much acts the same but with more violence not that much more. She is not a great actress but she's not a terrible one either considering she has played the same role her entire life.Chris Klein however should die. He is almost entirely useless and tries to be a bad asssmart assI say clever things and look really cool while saying them then make a cool face after I finish the sentence character but he fails. It was painful to watch him because he's just so terrible in the movie. Imagine his character in American Pie or the one is Just Friends as a bad ass cop who wants to be cool and impress people but can't yet still thinks he does. It just hurts to watch. He is the reason I give it a 610. If he wasn't in it it could be a 7. Or an 8...or a 9 maybe even a 10 I don't know I couldn't watch without wanting to rip my eyes out during his scenes.The other people though are just plain average. They recite their lines and move properly. Overall a C for them.For the movie as a whole though I went in expecting complete crap and came out feeling like it was a decent cheesy action flick. I would not pay good money to see this but it wasn't necessarily a waste of time. If you're bored and see it in the video store for a dollar why not rent it? If it's on TV or if you see it online and you have free time go ahead and watch.".

I would not pay good money to see this but it wasn't necessarily a waste of time. If you're bored and see it in the video store for a dollar why not rent it? If it's on TV or if you see it online and you have free time go ahead and watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "I started watching this movie today because it was the most interesting stuff that was on TV that moment. I saw it pretty much from the beginning and the beginning of the movie had fast pace to setting up the starting blocks of the story. Chun Li's father is kidnapped and her mother dies because of an illness and she gets a old mysterious roll that has a message for her to leave her past behind and get on a new adventure. There's some great overacting in this movie by Chris Klein and Michael Clarke Duncan sorry about the overacting part Chris and Michael. The story is very simple but I don't think there's nothing wrong with that if your just looking for something pretty entertaining to watch. I like Kristin Kreuk so that's a plus for this movie  and I like the action in it. The action seems that you've seen it before but if your not looking to invent the wheel again it's good action. So maybe this movie isn't something that will be watched for ages but it's still a very watchable movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember reading Leonard Maltin's review of both Street Fighter movies. He first said that the original from 1994 was the worst movie ever based on a video game. Then he said this one made that one look like Citizen Kane! Yeah I can agree with him. Whereas the original film was extremely stupid with horrible acting at least they had the nerve to actually make the characters look the same way they do in the games. In this one they could barely even get a single costume right. Even Vega's mask looked off! You could in fact change the name of every character and the title and absolutely no one would know it was based on Street Fighter.None of the characters look or act anything like their video game counterparts. Why did they make these drastic changes anyway? Why even make it a Street Fighter movie? Why not just make it an original idea? I don't even think people would accuse it of ripping off Street Fighter because of how unrelated it is! It would still be horrendous either way. Even the plot is completely stupid. It features M. Bison being the father of Rose and he actually created her so he could sacrifice his good nature directly into her to become evil. We even see a flashback where he literally performs a Csection on her mother. He still has a soft spot for her. Why? He's pure evil now! Most of the hair colors weren't even right! I would expect a Street Fighter movie to have the main character Ryu in it but they couldn't even do that! They didn't even have the secondary character Ken in it! Ryu is in fact mentioned at the VERY end of the film when discussing an actual Street Fighter tournament. ChunLi says she isn't interested so the film doesn't even technically set up a sequel! Granted it's wonderful that it didn't but still very misleading. I admit to not being that familiar with the newer Street Fighter characters.Of course I didn't have to be to even know that they were represented horribly. Everyone in this movie is stupid even the extras! There's one scene where someone's shot and a crowd responds by throwing fruit at the shooter. Yeah I think that'll stop guns. Most of these characters serve no purpose with no distinct personalities. You could literally replace them with anyone else and no one would notice the difference. In the end M. Bison is defeated by having bags fall on him. Wow it's a Home Alone prank that does him in. This is idiotic in every sense but I guess it might be because it's worse than the already awful 1994 movie. Not for fans critics moviegoers or ANYONE. Zero stars".

After committing multiple murders in California they hightail to Thornton's and Williams' hometown of Star Arkansas to laylow.  Their journey across the backroads of Texas is fraught with danger it's not like they don't stand out and unbeknownst to them the cops are waiting....Very well done without the look at me I'm so realistic dialogue too often found in this much copied genre.  One of the best of its kind well worth the rental.";

The first time I saw this film was on VHS in the early 90's but now I have the chance of buying the DVD and watching it again. The dramatic story written by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson is engaging and without redemption. Cynda Williams in her second film is awesome but Bill Paxton steals the film in the role of a bragger hillbilly and chief of police that sees the chance of his life of arresting real criminals but meets his past instead.

Yet throughout the course of events Fantasia wants to go back home to Star City and see her little boy something that ultimately contributes to her downfall.

However things are complicated by Fantasia wanting to go home and more blood is shed along the way.ONE FALSE MOVE is a neglected gem. It marked the featurefilm debut of American director Carl Franklin who takes a runofthemill cops and robbers yarn and wisely places the emphasis on character. He is most ably assisted in this by a largely unknown but solid cast who give their director maximum effort in every scene. Williams Thornton who also cowrote the script and Beach are excellent as the three gangsters while Bill Paxton is also excellent as Hurricane the Star City cop entrusted with the task of helping the LA police track the gang down. The film got a very poor release at the time and it was even denied the film a screening at the Sundance Film Festival and it was dismissed as too violent. The film starts off quite violently but once it gets going the emphasis is on good old fashioned character study but because of it's failure to reach the Sundance festival it wasn't picked up by a major distributor and it more or less went straight to video. Director Carl Franklin has done very little since apart from DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS with Denzel Washington a crime thriller that was well received by the critics but didn't take on with the public. Billy Bob Thornton however has since become an international star appearing in such modern classics as A SIMPLE PLAN 1999 and the Coen Brothers' sublime black and white noir film THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE 2001.".

This movie at least in my opinion has one of the most violent not overly graphic but sadistic openings to a movie I have seen in a film. The way the murders and tortures are committed are a little hard to watch. But if you get past that the movie settles down a lot and you really want to see the bad guys get what's coming to them! And the language is extremely rough. I saw the movie again on BRAVO and while there is a lot of silent moments where they cut out the language nothing else is cut from the film.

In 1992 I had seen over fifty movies at the theater so I put together a top ten list and this movie made it easily.  Since I knew how the movie would play out on my second viewing I was able to look for other things.  This time I noticed though the thrilling aspects of the film were used to set the movie in motion underneath there was an examination of big city meets rural town.  Amazingly the main characters weren't treated as stereotypes.  Each character I count six was fleshed out but not too much.  There were no judgments on which life was better or any advantages or disadvantages to either style of living.  In a lot of ways the film reminded me of John Sayles' movies.

He gets in over his head tangling with onthelam murderous drug dealing thugs escaping from Los Angeles and heading to his small rural town of Star City Arkansas where they plan to hide out at friend's house. This film quickly becomes chilling horrific and riveting. The female drug dealer named Fantasia a sultry fox of a black woman has a terrible secret that complicates the entire situation in this southern crime tale. Billy Bob Thornton's screenplay is superb as is his acting and that of his costars including Michael Beech and Bill Paxton which helps us identify if not quite like the character 'Ray'. The haunting climax aided by a well used blues soundtrack is also worthy of specific recognition but in short this movie will not disappoint any audience appreciating an interesting story.Modelled on a High Noon good guys Vs bad guys like destiny narrative also has little observations on racism and the class divide between big city America and small town Americana. Sly little reveals in the script such as a policeman's alcohol problem show good attention to detail by the makers. While Franklin has a wonderful way with his camera only revealing enough for us to fill in the blanks and often his camera is used as a character POV device with close ups and cuts blending seamlessly with mood of the story. The cast are uniformly strong with the stand outs Williams Paxton and Thornton reaching down deep to give their respective characters some stunning grittiness doling out sadness misguidedness and rage with a believability that's as impressive as it is riveting to watch.Overall rating 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Carl Franklin and written by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson 'One False Move' is a thriller starring Cynda Williams Billy Bob Thornton Bill Paxton Michael Beachetc. Although the film on the surface is another drug deal gone wrong type thriller with violence and blood but it has a lot going on beneath the violence of the criminal activities portrayed on screen. The script deals with the themes of the contrast between the country and the city racism and the mask that many people wear to hide the complexities of their lives and their past. Somehow all these themes come together in the most seamless and nuanced manner to enhance the poignancy of the film. The plot reminded me of Richard Brooks' 'In Cold Blood'. It has a similar structure of criminals on the road trying to evade the law while the police is making plans to bring them in.The acting is very good from all involved. Many of the characters in the film are not what they might appear to be initially. I have to individually mention Bill Paxton and Cynda Williams for showing a lot of range by playing character the perceptions for whom change radically in the viewer's mind with the revealing of new facts about their past.I have already mentioned that the script is layered but even then this could have become a standard crimethriller with no depth. Carl Franklin actually underlined the themes in the script by putting more emphasis on the characters their behaviour and their past than just the violence of the criminal activities. The film ends on an optimistically in a subtle way. But personally I would have probably ended the film on a bleaker note to go with the subtext of the film.

The graphic opening is not one I can watch easily and adds an tight rope feeling to the following events. The male criminals' venality is frighteningly mundane to themselves. Cynda Williams as the broken Lila doing what she can to help her son brings a vulnerability to Bily Bob Thornton's character which is not enough to lessen his coldness. He appears to love her yet we all believe he would kill her without thought if his survival necessitated it. Bill Paxton's portrayal of a good ole boy with a secret of his own is sensitive. Sympathetic enough to make us care and believe he is a fundamentally decent man it does not shy from the reality of a man who has failed to live up to his own expectations. Using another ordinary house as the backdrop to the final bloodbath again emphasises the sadness of the story which reflects far too many broken lives. Having Dale meet his son for the first and last? time plays on our emotions and leaves just as many questions unanswered as have been tackled by the events and characters of the film. I wanted to know what happened afterward to the characters left behind by the physical and emotional carnage they had lived through.".

When she finally answers the phone and tells the miscreants that everything is kosher come ahead Paxton has ten minutes to call his office in Star City and have all his deputies rush out to his aid  but he doesn't. It's a small point and the pace at this point is so uptempo that it's overlooked.I'm describing it as intelligent because Frankin the director has handled the material very well. The local color and local culture of smalltown Arkansas is effectively captured. None of the characters is overdrawn. Nothing is inyourface obvious. The violence is over quickly and no more gory than necessary. And the violence is not used as a selling point  not done in slow motion or with multiple squibs exploding everywhere. There are no car chases and no explosions. Instead there are characters that are at least halfway believable as are the interactions between them. The two LA detectives make fun of the hick police chief laughing at his intention to apply for a job with the LAPD not knowing that he's overhearing them. They just chuckle at the thought and Billings says Can you imagine him hanging around Parker Center? The other LA detective Metzler has a bland face and unimposing presence he looks a bit like Fuhrman from the O.J. Simpson case but he turns in a fine performance. Some of the minor touches are most delicate. Paxton's wife is trying to get Billings to talk her husband out of his fantasies about being a bigcity policeman. You know him she says He watches TV. I read nonfiction. I read nonfiction. That's good writing. By Bobby Jim Thornton too.In fact everyone is good even the usually wooden Paxton. Billy Joe Thornton  or Clarence Earl Thornton or Edgar Allan Thornton or Oliver Wendell Thornton or whatever his names are  is outstanding as an impulsive weak killer. The performance is the more impressive if you know what a goodnatured easygoing guy he is off the screen. Beach is just fine as the collegeeducated guy with an IQ of 150 who never laughs or smiles behind his accountanttype eyeglasses but who slaughters helpless people dispassionately with a knife as if they were nothing more than trussedup swine. The only word to describe the sleepy eyed Cynda Williams is yummy. She's firstrate in this film switching back and forth between black locutions and those one might expect in a white middleclass family in the San Fernando Valley. Do catch this one if you have the chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "One False Move is one of the key sleeper hits in film. It had a relative lowbudget and was released straighttovideo. But word of mouth caused this to get a release in theatres soon after. It was the sleeper of 1992 that received acclaim by all. On At the Movies Gene Siskel ranked it as the best of the year while Roger Ebert ranked it the second best behind Malcolm X. Usually surprises like this are always remembered check out Rocky. Sure time has not been on its side and that's terrible for a film this good. It's just as bad as The Right Stuff from 1983 not aging well.Perhaps it is good that this is forgotten. That makes the surprise element of the watch stronger. If it was bigger maybe some people would find it underwhelming and not meeting expectations. Nobody talks about this anymore so that also gives me an intimate connection with this.The movie follows two parallel stories. The first is meeting a trio of violent drug dealers in Los Angeles. They're intense profane and ruthless enough to make the audience cringe while watching it. The movie opens with two extremely brutal drug bustsa good way to get the audience's attention. The trio consists of Billy Bob Thornton as the most vicious of the group Ray his reluctant girlfriend Fantasia Cynda Williams and highly intelligent Pluto Michael Beach. All the murders are brutal and they flee the state. A few times in the film they make boneheaded mistakes but the guys' intensity and Pluto's brains can get them out of things. Although mistakes are made we know they will definitely survive. Each scene with the trio are scary but thrilling and fun. Also we want them to stand a chance. Very few movies can successfully pull off unforgiving bad guys but still making them compelling.The other story deals with two LAPD cops who investigate the case and are led to the small town of Star City in Arkansas where the sheriff Dale Hurricane Dixon Bill Paxton works with them. At first there's some offbeat comedy as the big city cops bond with the cop from an uneventful town. As the deadly trio's route leads to the Dixon's town the cops soon find secrets about Fantasia that really raise the stakes.In great crime films the bad guys are always more fun. While the scenes with the bad guys are more fun here too we still get great joy out of the good guys. And the secrets that raise the stakes make the heart beat faster. It is all about the characters. Characterdriven movies are the best. We can't see through anything here a job welldone. And the movie also expertly deals with the themes of the past urban  rural cities and loyalty. And of course the principal photography are what's first and foremost when it comes to what's most memorable with this.Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "One False Move is directed by Carl Franklin and cowritten by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson. It stars Thornton Bill Paxton Cynda Williams and Michael Beach. Music is by Peter Haycock Derek Holt and Terry Plumeri and cinematography by James L. Carter.Three criminals Ray Thornton Fantasia Williams and Pluto Beach are on the run from LA. after a drug heist ends in a bloodbath. Heading for Star City Arkansas the three are oblivious to the fact that the law both local and of L.A. is lying in wait for them.One time actor Carl Franklin has good standing as a director in neonoir circles his Devil in a Blue Dress 1995 and Out of Time 2003 had the benefit of starring Denzel Washington with the former often thought of as an undervalued treasure. Neither of those films in my opinion comes close to the excellence of One False Move. A superbly understated thriller that oozes fatalism while studying the characters at hand. Beginning with brutal attention grabbing violence picture unfurls as a road movie until it reveals itself fully in the town of Bleakville. Franklin and his writers slowly open up the story to reveal an emotionally complex thriller bleeding the flaws from the main players with clinical glee. These be a mix of classic losers psychotics redemption seekers and a naive dreamer and there's a link from the past that's going to impact devastatingly on the present.Modelled on a High Noon good guys Vs bad guys like destiny narrative also has little observations on racism and the class divide between big city America and small town Americana. Sly little reveals in the script such as a policeman's alcohol problem show good attention to detail by the makers. While Franklin has a wonderful way with his camera only revealing enough for us to fill in the blanks and often his camera is used as a character POV device with close ups and cuts blending seamlessly with mood of the story. The cast are uniformly strong with the stand outs Williams Paxton and Thornton reaching down deep to give their respective characters some stunning grittiness doling out sadness misguidedness and rage with a believability that's as impressive as it is riveting to watch.One of the best crime pictures of the 90s and an essential viewing for anyone interested in pure neonoir. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Carl Franklin's directorial debut is a real surprise package as it not only has a story which is more interesting and original than most but also boasts a collection of characters who are much more than mere stereotypes. In fact it's the interactions between them and their various relationships which ultimately determine how the plot develops. The movie's carefully created atmosphere its precise pacing and its visual style are all impeccable and enhance its overall quality enormously.One False Move is a tense thriller which makes a powerful initial impact as it depicts very graphically the grotesque savagery of a series of murders before it develops into an intriguing tale about a group of people whose lives are destined to be brought together in an unavoidable and deadly confrontation.Two exprison buddies called Ray Billy Bob Thornton and Pluto Michael Beach and their accomplice Fantasia Cynda Williams steal a substantial quantity of cocaine and money from an L.A. drug dealer and then travel to Houston to sell the cocaine to one of Pluto's contacts. Ray and Pluto had killed a number of people in the course of carrying out the robbery and later in Texas Fantasia who is Ray's girlfriend shoots and kills a state trooper who was suspicious of them and stopped their car to carry out some checks.Two LAPD detectives are assigned to the case and soon uncover evidence which suggests that the three fugitives could be heading for Star City Arkansas. The detectives go to Star City and discuss their plans with the local sheriff Dale Hurricane Dixon Bill Paxton who is very impressed by the big city cops and is tremendously excited to be working with them.Fantasia leaves Houston by bus to see her five year old son who's being cared for by her mother in Star City and Ray and Pluto stay to complete their drug deal. The deal doesn't go well and the two men kill three more people before making their escape and driving on to reunite with Fantasia.A past connection between Hurricane Dixon and Fantasia whose real name is Lila is then revealed before the couple make a deal which leads to the story's extremely dramatic climax.The three criminals are an unusual combination as Ray is violent volatile and unpredictable Pluto is highly intelligent cool and calculating and Fantasia is a drug addict who has moments of compassion when dealing with children but also kills a state trooper without too much hesitation or remorse. When they're together their regular disagreements and unstable behaviour also make them seem just as likely to be a danger to themselves as to anyone else.The three lawmen are also not entirely on the same page. Hurricane is energetic enthusiastic totally unpretentious and thrilled to be working with the LAPD officers who he admires greatly. The two detectives on the other hand are seasoned and cynical city cops who exploit Dixon's good natured generosity and at the same time regard him as naive and inferior.The use of low angle shots and closeups in the violent scenes early on in the movie are particularly effective in emphasising the amount of fear and tension involved and similarly in some later sequences there are numerous moments of real suspense which are very convincing.The screenplay by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson is excellent the acting is of a consistently high standard and despite its various plot twists a palpable sense of inevitability remains strong throughout. One False Move is an unsettling movie but also one which is very compelling and memorable.".

In these sort of movies endings usually disappoint but I felt this tied up everything perfectly and there was no overdramatization which is what the director sometimes feels like he has to do.";

	schema:headline " A forgotten treasure";
	schema:reviewBody "It sucks that it takes the death of an actor to remind you that you still haven't watched something but that's how it was with the passing of Bill Paxton which reminded me that I still had somehow overlooked One False Move despite wanting to see it since it came out when Siskel and Ebert were raving about it for what seemed like months. They were right to rave about it. One False Move is a tightly wound taut masterfully acted and powerfully suspenseful film. It's also written with a precision and level of realistic detail lacking in so many screenplays. I had forgotten as I feel the entire world has just how great of a writer Billy Bob Thornton was once upon a time. This might be his greatest screenplay in fact. The plot about three criminals fleeing L.A. after robbing and killing a drug dealer heading to Arkansas to hide out moves forward with the ruthless momentum of a shark and with just as much bite. The opening is one of the most brutal sequences I've seen in quite some time and the violence that erupts in the rest of the film is just as brutal. Carl Franklin directs with a lean muscular hand. The violence occurs as it seems to in reality seemingly out of nowhere and with surprising impact. Every death hits with a hell of a punch you feel virtually every stab and gunshot. The characters are drawn with a fascinating level of insight and detail and every detail feels just right. Even the most violent and despicable of people in this movie is treated with respect and is intriguing and we really get to know them and what makes them tick. Aside from the acts of violence this movie is filled with powerfully rendered little moments that feel as natural as overhearing a conversation or catching up with an old friend. The biggest joy of this movie is unsurprisingly getting to know Bill Paxton's Dale The Hurricane Dixon the chief of police of a small Arkansas town that three vicious criminals seem to be heading toward like a particularly nasty storm front leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. Paxton is vibrant and electric here. He's utterly charming but he's much more than he initially seems and Paxton gets to hit those notes of complexity with grace and a natural easygoing nature. It doesn't feel like an actor playing a character it just feels like the filmmakers trained a camera on this guy and told him to be himself. Paxton usually gets to play either a good ol' boy or a dirtbag. This character allows him to play a bit of both and also to reveal acting muscles that those unfamiliar with his less popular work see Frailty for God's sake may not know he possessed. This is perhaps his greatest performance although he's excellent in Frailty and Big Love as well. It's a magnificent character and Paxton brings it fully forcefully to vivid life. Cynda Williams Billy Bob Thornton and Michael Beach are likewise excellent here. All of them are magnetic to watch even though Paxton really does run away with this movie. But the real power of the film is seeing how it unfolds the unexpected avenues it takes and the little touches and moments that bring it to life and make it feel a bit more like Real Life than most films of this ilk. It feels like a Coen Brothers movie in subject matter and occasionally the thrilling ways that Franklin moves the camera. But I daresay the Coens would never quite bring the level of verisimilitude to the tale that Franklin and Thornton do. That's no knock against the Coens who are among my favorite directors but One False Move is so uncommonly gripping and observant in a way that the glorious artful playgrounds of the Coens never quite are. It's not better it's just a different vibe and one that really makes this movie come alive in an extraordinary way. I usually don't watch movies on Crackle because the commercials that are interjected every fifteen minutes or so bug me but I'm glad I did this time. One False Move is unfortunately out of print and it's nowhere to be found on other streaming services. Thank God that Crackle is at least making this forgotten treasure available to be seen. Take my advice brave the commercials they don't edit content at least and watch One False Move. It really is an amazing film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie shows off some fine performances and pleasant music but the screenplay could have been better. It revolves around a 'chawl' neighborhood at the center of which live two brothers. The relationships between the characters were portrayed nicely e.g. how Soman's father confides in Raj and shares his disappointment how the neighborhood comes to one another's need etc. Ajay Devgan delivers a decent performance while Namrata Shirodkar shines in her role. She has done a great job of portraying her character's despair. She's always there for Raj and Rahul and she yearns for Raj's love but since he can't reciprocate her feelings she gradually walks a path of selfdestruction. Sonali Bendre is brilliant nonetheless. Her character has suffered hardship in the past this is mildly referred and now she makes her decisions based on practical thinking. She too loves Raj but she won't accept Raj's very limited devotion. Shivaji Sattam does very well and Reema Laggo portrays her character's metamorphosis wonderfully but she is a little annoying in the beginning. Anand Raaj Anand's music is pleasant but some of the songs could have been easily left out as it slows down the pace. The film tries to show that love and care is all what one needs at least in the case of the two brothers and hence why admit the handicapped brother to an institution? The way the institution was presented with all the patients wearing some kind of uniform was ridiculous. But why not rehabilitate the handicapped brother and provide him enough love and care? There's no need to admit him in an institution but he can still receive training and achieve some level of independence. But no none of that is mentioned. As with a majority of Bollywood movies this also tends to be melodramatic to some extent. Though I'd still say you could watch it for some fine performances good music and to feel good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Subject wise the film is commendable. It deals with the bond between two brothers one of whom is physically and mentally handicapped. The bond comes into test when the love life of the bigger brother interferes. The film is able to connect its audiences with the central characters. Ajay Devgan plays the central role well and the acting of child artist Dushyant Beg as the handicapped boy is just touching and presents with an innocence and spontaneity. Few sequences of the film is even able to moisten your eyes. Indeed the story of the film is touching and is well performed by its central characters. Despite this the film doesn't raise above the average due to a poor screenplay. The film is effective only when it comes to the story of the bonding. Rest of the film dwells into a love triangle which is boring with unnecessary songs. Besides some characters are loathed with over acting and unnaturalness. Had the film been worked out more in its narration the film could have definitely been better.Rating 2 stars out of 4".

	schema:reviewBody "Tera Mera Saath Rahen is one of Ajay's many great acting performances. The film has the quality a play and could be staged in the theater. Along with the usual BW true love romance and some wonderful musical numbers the primary focus is a more subtle introspective view into the hearts of the characters. Ajay plays the quiet hard working selfsacrificing introvert Raj Dixit who is devoted to his disabled younger brother Rahul.We aren't told why Ajay's character Raj has accepted a life lived only for his brother Rahul who suffers from Cerebral Palsy. We do see that they are both very happy in their sweet small life. Ajay's love for this young boy is both impressive and completely natural. Ajay often lovingly embraces the boy and happily lifts him up in easy innocent play or to rescue him from danger.I admit that at first I found the boy hard to enjoy and I give Mr. Devgan full credit for the way he reaches out for Rahul drawing him into his arms with obvious genuine affection calm and tenderness. And the boy is an endearing bright spirit who perhaps foreshadows the character Ajay will himself eventually play in Main Aisa Hi Hoon.Ajay's character Raj is respected at the office where he always does his work on time so he can catch the bus home and take care of Rahul. Raj is also loved and admired in his 'society' by the people who live there with him. This word 'society' is the subtitle translation of whatever Hindi term must describe these apartmentcomplexrooms built around a courtyard and provide what I would call a village within the city. Everyone knows everyone in the 'society' and their individual stories are well woven into the film.As Ajay's neighbors Mr.  Mrs. Gupta are extended family and help Raj take care of Rahul. But it is the friendship with Mr. Gupta played by Shivaaji Satam and Ajay that particularly interests me. Shivaaji Satam is a fine actor and while Ajay represents the difficulties of a young man Mr. Gupta is facing the boredom of middle age a fragmenting family and his own fears regarding loneliness and old age. His conversations with Ajay become more interesting each time I watch them. There is also an old man in their community who completes the 'stages of life' trio. Abandoned by his only son the old man finds himself trapped in the endless pain of lonely isolation even within this 'society' village and sadly the young adolescents often ridicule him.Sonali Bendre plays the gorgeous loveinterest girl Madhuri. She and Ajay fall sweetly instantly in love atfirstsight. Ajay's character here is so pure so innocent and so virginal that he is embarrassed and totally confused by his own feelings and his uptill now suppressed passions. I love Sonali. I think she is truly one of the loveliest women of India and here she is that incredibly beautiful girl with a pure heart any man would want to marry.Perhaps the best acting performance in the film comes when Ajay's character tries in vain to separate himself from his disabled brother. To please his new love Ajay has forcibly and rather violently placed little Rahul in an institution with similar children. In the unbearable shadows of darkness Ajay lies in his bed suffering the agonies of loneliness and separation from his brother. Their love for each other is an overwhelming and powerful mystery.Tera Mera Saath Rahen was not the first film that the critics acknowledged Ajay Devgan as very much more than just actionman. He gives a truly fine heartwrenching and very memorable performance here. His anguished desperate run barefoot through the city streets always makes me cry. Ajay excels at portraying a perfectly marvelous drunk  not only in this film but also in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam 1999 and as actionman ShivaAjay in Haqeeqat 1995. He would have been the perfect Devdas.There are also some really good songs three of which include the pleasure of watching the superb dancing skills of the gorgeous Sonali Bendre. Even though I'm sure she must be happily married these days  oh my I miss her! However I do need to warn you of the 'Jumbo Jet' song a sort of kid's Disney fantasy number that takes a little getting used to. Just put yourself into happy 8yearold mode and enjoy the silly flying fun.On quite a more serious note I must say that Ajay is in meltdown sexy handsome awesome form in this film. For me he is just about perfect here  and there is one all too brief scene where he is walking around in the amber nightlights dressed a rather tight white Tshirt that I am still in recovery over. Who needs Brando when you can look at Mr. Devgan! In the early part of the film there is another nanomoment when he is in one of those old 1940s style white undershirts  Wah! Ajay excels at playing the shy geek introvert who is simultaneously steaming with testosterone underneath  underneath that white Tshirt!I highly recommend Tera Mera Saath Rahen to you without any reservations. It is an intelligent wellmade film with a deeper meaning as well as happily entertaining and stands up after repeated viewing. It is not teenromance and has no yuppie gimmicks. This film is about the ineluctable inexorable invisible bonds whose power and mystery hold us deeply and profoundly in sweet love.".

	schema:headline " Watchers is not as bad as you probably think.";
	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people do not like this movie. In fact almost all the reviews here are negative. The problem seems to be that a lot of loyal fans of the book were angered by all the changes made in this movie adaption. I had the same type of feeling after I saw The General's Daughter. The General's Daughter left a lot of stuff from the book out and changed lots of stuff too. I found myself disliking the movie barley a half an hour into it. Luckily I have yet to read Dean Koontz's book Watchers and that is probably one of the reasons why I liked it so much. I was able to watch it on it's own and not compare it to the book and in my opinion it is a fine little horror movie.Corey Haim wasn't as bad as I thought he would be. After I had seen the hideous Fever Lake which is on the IMDB's bottom 100 list where it deserves to be I became cautious not to rent anything with Corey Haim for a long time. Then I found out Michael Ironside was in it and decided to risk the dollar and thirteen cents. Michael Ironside was excellent as always. He seems to be at his best when he is playing villains like he did in Total Recall and Highlander 2. The film is well directed and it moves at a very fast pace. The monster isn't that bad. You don't really see much of it thought other then a flash of hair or and arm coming out of the roof or something. You start to see the whole thing during the ending climax at the cabin which by the way I thought was pretty exciting.All in all I enjoyed this movie. It is fastpaced and it doesn't fall apart at the end like many horror movies do. It doesn't try to insult the viewer either with a dumb twist ending. Not that their bad we just don't need them all the time. Michael Ironside was good as always and his scenes are the best parts of the movie. I think tomorrow I'll rent Watchers II. I give this 810".

One is a dog with unusual intelligence. The other is an Outside eXperimental COmbat Mammal or OXCOM. Because of reasons divulged further into the film the oxcom hates the dog and so is trying to kill it. Watchers concerns the accidental involvement of Travis Cornell Corey Haim his mom Nora Barbara Williams and his girlfriend Tracey Lala Sloatman with the dog and oxcom as two National Security Organization agents Lem Johnson Michael Ironside and Cliff Blu Mankuma track them down.Many comments are made about Watchers being very different than the Dean Koontz book that serves as the launching pad for the film. This is true. But it should not affect your rating. If you want the book read the book. Judge the film on its own merits not how closely it matches the book. Bill Freed and Damian Lee who wrote the screenplay are just as much artists as Koontz is that's not a quality comparison just a statement that they're all artists. So is director Jon Hess. Their job as filmmakers isn't to slavishly follow the book as if it were a script. They're adapting the book as artists to make a unique artwork. It's based on the book. Not identical to it. You have to loosen your preconceptionsexpectations when you watch the film because you're going to be experiencing an artwork that you are not already familiar with even if you've read Koontz' novel.So is Watchers a good film? It's pretty good not excellent. Good enough to earn a B or an 8. Hess begins things on the right foot with one of the most beautifully filmed explosions I've seen in awhile. Unfortunately he trips a bit immediately afterward as we listen to some very thick jargonistic exposition. After that scene Watchers threatens to become a clichd 1980s film as we first meet Travis and Tracey.Veering towards clich is a tendency continually threatened. But it is only a skew. More often than not Hess is able to transcend welltrodden territory with a number of interesting twists Both Travis and Tracey are from single parent homes with their genders flipped. Both have unique mature relationships with their parents. Although this is a horror film a major focus is a cute intelligent canine and it often feels as much like an adventure film as it does horror a thriller or scifi which are all genres it touches upon. Hess introduces a large cast of characters some not entering until late in the game yet the film is never confusing and no characters feel as if they are left in the dustall of the threads are nicely tied up in the end. The structure is also complex in that there are two major villains the second becoming less obviously illintentioned as the film progresses until a twist accompanied by brutal violence makes one antagonist clearer. Soon after Hess gives us a nice moment of doubt with the other antagonist.The biggest flaw in my eyes is a dreaded common one with horror films since at least the 1980sthe attack scenes are shot too darkly too close too out of focus and they're edited too choppily. It makes it extremely difficult to tell what's going on which saps most of the tension from scenes that should be a highlight. Surely part of Hess' motivation for the style and this is the typical justification for this problem was worry that the creature would come across as humorous andor fake rather than frightening and suspenseful. In my view presenting the audience with a dizzying blur isn't a satisfactory solution. We only get to see the creature costumemakeup clearly towards the end of the film. It was well done enough that better shot and edited attack scenes would have brought the film up to at least a 9.Regardless of the degree of correspondence between the novel and the film Watchers presents a gripping story using smart alluring characters. It is frequently a nailbiter and the horror scenes are more feral than you might expect if not exactly gory although there is a fair amount of blood in a couple scenes. Watchers tends to be underrated because of misconceptions about the role of film when it comes to adapting literaturedon't pass it up or summarily dismiss it based on a misconception.".

In an effort to make the movie 'cute' instead of the fullfledged horror it should be it concentrates so much on the dog and its antics but leaves us to imagine the monster for the most part. Given that the monster is at least as smart and complex as the dog to see it reduced to simply a killing machine was a waste.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the excellent novel Watchers by Dean Koontz is this extremely awful motion picture that probably shouldn't be viewed by anyone. Not since The Running Man have I seen a book butchered so far beyond recognition. The difference however is that The Running Man film was still enjoyable as an amusing action film laden down a million catch phrases. This film Nope nothing remotely amusing. In fact if you love the book as I do you'll hate this bastardization even more.WARNINGCONTAINS SPOILERS Rightio I'm basically going to tell you the story here almost in it's entirety. Why? Because you dear reader do not also need to suffer through this abominationit's okay for me because I enjoy watching crap. Because I like complaining about shtty things. Now on to the nasty This film revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government and a mutantmonkeycreaturesoldier which escaped from a destroyed Government genetics lab with a supersmart golden retriever which the hero calls Furface. Groan Trust me in the novel this story rocked. I'll get to that later. Anyway the hero is none other that dreamy boychild Corey Haim. Oh I'm not kidding. Our hero runs around crackly voice and all trying to convince his Mom to help save this dog from the evil government which birthed him and made him genetically ultrasmart. The monkeycreature retardedly referred to as an Oxcom God help us is also a geneticstew of a creature built to be the ultimate fighter on battlefields of the future. Michael Ironside Total Recall Starship Troopersalways plays a badass is also in this film and no I couldn't figure out how anyone convinced him this would be a good idea. He plays a government agent with the NSO hunting the dog and creature. Oh yeah here's some spoilerama He's also a creation from the government and the same lab and lo and behold spends most of the movie being a prick and killing peopleand all that killing is supposed to be done by the monkeysoldier. Instead of a rockin' kickass creepy horror film we have a rectal hemorrhage of a teenybopper horror flick. The dog's intelligence is discovered alltooconveniently and believed easier than we believe we can see clouds by looking outside. Breakdown!!Change from Book to FilmLead character Travis turned from man to boychild.Man's love interest in book Nora is now his motherand all her depth and character growth is completely gone.Lem Johnson black man is now white Mr. Ironside. This matters as the character's strength was built on his heritage in the book.Relationship between two authority figures completely ignored Lem now kills the guy who was originally his best friend.One principle character in the book is now totally absent the immortal that hunted the heroesmaybe this is supposed to be Ironside but then why is he someone else?Dog never receives deserving name of Einstein in the movie.No part of the book took place in a High Schoolat least nothing that had strong bearing on the plot.Takes place over a matter of days rather months like the bookunrealistic pacing.Corey Haim's girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the bookand they never met in the book.Character of Lem Johnson is no longer coolheaded instead he's a total asshole that bullies his way through people.Hero Travis was part of Delta Force military segment specializing in hunting terrorists instead his Dad who is never seen in the film was part of that group.Perceived intelligence in the monster now totally absent.Subplots involving Soviets and The Mob completely gutted out of the story.These are just the most obnoxious changes and the one's I could remember off hand and a day later.The GoodEventually after 90odd minutes of pain and mental anguish the movie ended.Didn't Hurt It Didn't Help ItMichael Ironsideusually I like him.The dog is still fairly likable.Wacky totally 80's title screen.The BadOkay the writing for one is extremely awful.The direction is so halfassed that anyone watching the film will feel superior to everyone involved in it.The acting is crappy and weak especially from Corey Haim.Loose weak watered down story.The monster looks just pathetic that is when we are actually allowed to see the bloody thing. Its head is gigantically oversized the yellow eyes that were so much a part of the thing in the book are seen for no more than two seconds. Instead of a lean powerful fast intelligent killing machine we have some jackass in a pukeugly monkey suit forced upon us.Absolutely no character development.Even the violence and gore are done poorly for fck sakes this is supposed to be a HORROR film!! Usually violence is at least done well!The UglyThe idea that Dean Koontz whored out his brilliant novel to become this filthy fcking piece of sht brings me dangerously close to vomiting all over myself and anyone near me. There are movies worse than this headacheinducing as that idea may seem but so far only Alien vs Predator at least to me is a bigger travesty and more painful disappointment. Memorable Scene Watching the end credits start.Acting 310 Story 410 the novel was really good this is just terrible Atmosphere 510 Cinematography 410 Character Development 110 Special EffectsMakeup 410 NuditySexuality 010 ViolenceGore 410 Music 510 Direction 310Cheesiness 710 Crappiness 910Overall 310I would recommend that no one watch this movie ever except for a few extreme diehard horror fansand only if you haven't read the novel. Instead I would recommend that anyone interested in this avoid it entirely and buycheckborrow the book.www.ResidentHazard.com".

Michael Ironside Total Recall Starship Troopersalways plays a badass is also in this film and no I couldn't figure out how anyone convinced him this would be a good idea. He plays a government agent with the NSO hunting the dog and creature. Oh yeah here's some spoilerama He's also a creation from the government and the same lab and lo and behold spends most of the movie being a prick and killing peopleand all that killing is supposed to be done by the monkeysoldier. Instead of a rockin' kickass creepy horror film we have a rectal hemorrhage of a teenybopper horror flick. The dog's intelligence is discovered alltooconveniently and believed easier than we believe we can see clouds by looking outside. Breakdown!!Change from Book to FilmLead character Travis turned from man to boychild.Man's love interest in book Nora is now his motherand all her depth and character growth is completely gone.Lem Johnson black man is now white Mr. Ironside. This matters as the character's strength was built on his heritage in the book.Relationship between two authority figures completely ignored Lem now kills the guy who was originally his best friend.One principle character in the book is now totally absent the immortal that hunted the heroesmaybe this is supposed to be Ironside but then why is he someone else?Dog never receives deserving name of Einstein in the movie.No part of the book took place in a High Schoolat least nothing that had strong bearing on the plot.Takes place over a matter of days rather months like the bookunrealistic pacing.Corey Haim's girlfriend in the movie appeared in no more than two chapters in the bookand they never met in the book.Character of Lem Johnson is no longer coolheaded instead he's a total asshole that bullies his way through people.Hero Travis was part of Delta Force military segment specializing in hunting terrorists instead his Dad who is never seen in the film was part of that group.Perceived intelligence in the monster now totally absent.Subplots involving Soviets and The Mob completely gutted out of the story.These are just the most obnoxious changes and the one's I could remember off hand and a day later.The GoodEventually after 90odd minutes of pain and mental anguish the movie ended.Didn't Hurt It Didn't Help ItMichael Ironsideusually I like him.The dog is still fairly likable.Wacky totally 80's title screen.The BadOkay the writing for one is extremely awful.The direction is so halfassed that anyone watching the film will feel superior to everyone involved in it.The acting is crappy and weak especially from Corey Haim.Loose weak watered down story.The monster looks just pathetic that is when we are actually allowed to see the bloody thing. Its head is gigantically oversized the yellow eyes that were so much a part of the thing in the book are seen for no more than two seconds. Instead of a lean powerful fast intelligent killing machine we have some jackass in a pukeugly monkey suit forced upon us.Absolutely no character development.Even the violence and gore are done poorly for fck sakes this is supposed to be a HORROR film!! Usually violence is at least done well!The UglyThe idea that Dean Koontz whored out his brilliant novel to become this filthy fcking piece of sht brings me dangerously close to vomiting all over myself and anyone near me. There are movies worse than this headacheinducing as that idea may seem but so far only Alien vs Predator at least to me is a bigger travesty and more painful disappointment.

This one is about a boy who finds a dog what could be more touching than that. In fact I would have to say a bit to much time in the film is used exploring their budding friendship rather than on the super creature that is now coming for said boy and dog. Which there is a creature of super power homing in on the boy and his dog killing those that get in its way. The boy finally finds out about this and he and the dog and I think the mother go into a cabin and have a final showdown with said monster. You will not get to see said monster all that much and there could have been a few more kills or something but for the most part I found the movie entertaining. I would compare it to another Corey Haim horror movie Silver Bullet both are horrors that need more horror but both can be called okay...just kind of fluffy.".

I went into this expecting something awful and while I didn't exactly get a brilliant horror film I am lead to believe that it's fans of the book that are rating it down because as a film in it's own right Watchers is an entertaining and somewhat original little horror movie. The plot obviously takes some influence from Predator and begins with an explosion at a research lab. It's not long before a rancher is killed by some strange beast and the boyfriend of the dead man's daughter has picked up an ultraintelligent runaway dog. A secret Government agency is soon on the case as the murders continue. The boy continues to be fascinated by the dog's intelligence but it somehow ties in with the murders and the agency is soon on his tail too.The script for this film was originally written by Paul Haggis who later disowned it. I don't know why  the writing here is nowhere near as ridiculous as his 2004 hit Crash! Anyway the main reason this film works is undoubtedly the dog who aside from being rather cute is also the best actor in the film. Corey Haim hot off the success of The Lost Boys is the human lead and actually has a rather good chemistry with the dog although it is a little bit ridiculous seeing him talk to it most of the way through the film. The plot is rather convoluted and as such the film is more than a little bit messy but the ridiculousness of it all pulls it through during the more awkward moments. Michael Ironside also appears in the film and does well as the 'bad cop' side of the Government agents. The monster is of course one of the most interesting things about the film and the way it goes around killing people is always entertaining and gory although unfortunately we don't get to see a lot of it and when we finally do it's rather disappointing  obviously the filmmakers had seen Bigfoot and the Hendersons! Still this is the sort of film that can be easily enjoyed despite the numerous problems and I'd recommend to any undiscerning viewer of eighties horror.".

Quite often when I encounter a movieadaptation of a famous novel there are always hundreds of people complaining about how awful the movie version was in comparison to the book. Well I've never  and probably will never  read the book so at least I don't have to feel ashamed about tremendously liking the film! It's like I don't know any better you dig? This is also the case with Watchers for example. Allegedly the Dean Koontz novel differs enormously from the 80's horror film version with characters and story lines altered left and right in favor to appeal more to contemporary horror loving audiences. Travis the lead character is originally a 40yearold social outcast in the book whereas he's a poignant 16yearold rebel kid in the film portrayed by Corey Haim who was quite big at the time thanks to the success of The Lost Boys Lucas and Silver Bullet. That's the 80's horror film industry for you. Can you blame them? Either way Watchers is a shamelessly entertaining and virulent late 80's creaturefeature with a pleasingly high body count gruesome special effects an irresistible charming 80's setting and ambiance cool acting performances and one of the best use of an intelligent dog in a film ever. Travis Cornell lives with his yummy mother nearby a research facility where the government  in all secrecy of course  works on the ultimate warfare weapon. The weapon itself is a giant and nearly indestructible Bigfoot creature but the breakthrough is that it is telepathically linked to a intelligent dog. The monster is programmed to track the animal down and kill everything on its path in between. The dog and the monster escape from the lab just before there's an explosion. The dog hitches a ride in Travis' truck and he decides to keep the animal when he notices its abnormally high intellect. The dog can type warnings on a computer and compose messages via a game of scrabble for crying out loud! Meanwhile the Oxcom monster leaves a trail of blood and mayhem throughout the area and if that isn't worse enough yet there's also the relentless government agent Michael Ironside. He's after Travis and his dog to cover up the failures. Watchers is fastpaced and exciting with massacres that are delightfully gruesome. The Oxcom monster has the nasty habit of removing people's eyeballs which leads to a handful of grisly images and eerie makeup effects. The acting performances are great. Barbara Williams is excellent as Travis' caring mother and Michael Ironside behaves psychopathic and nightmarish as always. Corey Haim uses his typical 'rebellious 80's teenager' charisma to maximum results and the dog  Fur Face  is genius. Oh Watchers also provides the opportunity to admire hunky boy Jason Priestley and watch him get slaughtered by Bigfoot before he became world famous as Brandon Walsh in Beverly Hills 90210. Splendid 80's nostalgia!".

But the Creature finds himself closer to the dog while murdering people along the way to kill it. Now Travis his mother Nora Barbara Williams and the dog are on the run from this monster. Travis has to find ways to prepare to kill this creature before it's too late.Directed by Jon Hess made an technically well made Horror movie that is completely forgettable despite some interesting moments in this cheap B movie. The golden retriever dog gives the best performance in the film The dog scenes with Haim are the best moments in the picture. Ironside is always a joy seeing playing a bad guy with a hidden agenda. Surprisingly Two Time OscarWinnerPaul Haggis Screenwriter of Casino Royale Crash Million Dollar Baby actually wrote the original adaptation of this movie. But they had many changes to his script which his original script was probably closer to the novel. Since American and Canadian producers made many displacement that didn't look like from the novel by Dean R. Koontz Hideaway Phantoms anymore. The most unconvincingly thing of the picture is the creature which you never get a good look of the monster. Since most of the cinematography of the film is quite dark. Although it was probably wise since the directorHess felt the monster looked like crap. Who else than King of the B MoviesRoger Corman Frankenstein Unbound The Intruder Little Shop of Horrors executive produced this mess. Since he produced plenty of cheap films are actually better than this one half of the time. Which it was followed by three direct to video sequels!

Hearing that his girlfriend Tracey Lala Sloatman has been attacked he finds Special Agent Lem Johnson Michael Ironside trailing the dog and a special project. As both he and the dog spend time together he realizes that the dog is a real genius and begs his mother to keep him. As a series of strange accidents in town plague the community the two discover that the project that also got loose with the dog was a vicious creature trained for military purposes and has been trailing the dog for it's own reasons. Desperate to save them both they team up to take down the creature before it attacks more residents.The Good News This wasn't all that bad of a film. One thing that really works is that this is actually a wellexplained film for it's type. There's a really great reason given for the creature and the dog which is quite different than most other films. This one's reasoning is a really unique and novel one that is pretty clever. There's some really new ideas in the theory presented with it taking on a really new ideas. There's a really big body count in here that makes it pretty good. There's some throat rips a whole slew of eyeballremovals being thrown onto an electrical panel having their face scratched up and a decapitation included as well as others in here. The decapitation is the single most brutal one being shown in afteraffect and having just a mangled stump left. The large amount of deaths gives it a pretty fastpaced feel to it as a body is dropped in what feels like every other few minutes. That extends from the opening minutes with a fantastic setpiece that really works and carries throughout the entire course. The action is pretty nonstop from a great confrontation in the woods where three get it at the same time to a fantastic quest to escape inside an undersiege house and the final blowout at the cabin this one manages to contain a lot of action inside it. This is what makes it more watchable since they can overcome a lot of negativity when there's some big series of action scenes along the way. Another big plus is that the creature is basically kept offscreen for the majority of the film. This is one of the smartest moves possible. It's seen in quick fleeting moments here and there but never really anything that could give a good definitive viewing of it and it's not revealed until a couple of secondlong scenes at the very end surrounded by shadows. It keeps it away from the trap of constantly showing a cheesy nonfrightening creature for the during of the film and taking the fear of it away. Since it's unknown what it looks like the reveal of it at the end despite seeing glances along the way gives way to fear when it's onscreen. A great move and one in a series of good moves that make this one a good film.The Bad News There's only a few areas in here that don't really work. The biggest one that doesn't is the fact that there's a really cheesy stench that carries this flick over. It's not a necessarily bad thing but to have the story lines about a mutant creature chasing after a genius dog being trailed by the government agents responsible for both is just a tad too much to take seriously. The high amount of action in here also plays into it a bit. The biggest problem is that most of the attacks are shown offscreen. There's a blurry flash and a lot of screaming during most of the attacks in here and from there it's just impossible to tell what happened until it flashes back to the afteraffects. Most of the attacks happen in that fashion and it does get a little annoying when they're all in that manner. This is the biggest flaw as it really devalues the ferocity of the creature but these are the main flaws.The Final Verdict This was a very entertaining film in a surprising way and it overcomes the few negatives it has. It's a great pick for those looking for a decent undertheradar creature feature or those looking for a night of cheesy entertainment.Rated R Violence Graphic Language and Brief Nudity".

Having been adapted from one of the very best novels Dean Koontz has ever written this movie is the epitome of putrid sludge.I found the movie to be enjoyable. It isn't a bad movie really. I just can't figure out where in this screen play is Koontz's original literary work. Now forgetting the teenageroriented movies like Licensed to Drive I typically like Corey Haim's movies. the Lost Boys and Silver Bullet were excellent movies and so is this one. It wasn't his fault that the director screen writer and original author did not see eye to eye and his performance in this movie was just as good as it was in the aforementioned movies I did like.However the story told in this movie is so far from Koontz's original work that I am amazed he let it ride with his name still attached. The book is a masterpiece and while I did enjoy this movie immensely it was nothing like the book.The dog was genetically engineered to be the intelligence and the monster was the genetic equivalent engineered to be the brawn. The monster will follow the dog relentlessly wherever the dog goes as it is not only trained to do so but engineered to this task in order to allow the dog to lead it to its prey. The dog is the hunter and the monster is the killer. They are a genetic assassination team complete with an engineered psychic link created by covert American underground government one of those threeletter associations which officially do not exist.The dog is freed and befriends Corey Haim's character. But since the government can't have the intelligence half of their prized assassination team loose like that they loose the monster to find him thereby endangering the boy as well. But the dog by this time has developed a kinship with the boy and must keep him safe which means running from the monster each time he draws near.This of course is the Reader's Digest Condensed Version of the movie and just a drop in the sea to the deep richness and quality of the original literary novel by Koontz. If you rent this movie and enjoy it I highly suggest reading the book The Watchers by Dean R. Koontz.It rates an 8.110 on the B scale.That's about a 6.410 on the A scale from...the Fiend .".

The film has a lot of changes for the novel Watchers the one difference is the main character Travis. In the book he was an adult and an retired Delta Force soldier while in the film he's a teenager. Watchers has it's good points the film does have some gory scenes in parts. I'm a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was cool to see him in this film he always does a great performance in all his films. The OXCOM costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film. The dog Einstien was impressive since it was well trained.The film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab a dog and a monster. Both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the Creature would attack and eliminate them. The Dog finds a teenager named Travis who takes him home and discovers that he's intelligent and so he names the dog Einstein meanwhile the OXCOM is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes two Government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand. Soon Travis learns that his not safe as the OXCOM is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in it's way so Travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend who's being held at the hospital by the two agents. They then hideout in the woods while the Government agents and the OXCOM are not far behind.Watchers is not a great adaptation of Dean R. Koontz novel but it is a entraining 80's horror flick some fans of the book may not want to watch this since it's not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80's horror movies may want to check this out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cherry Blossoms was just one of 15 films I have seen this year at the Seattle International Film Festival and it has beaten my previous favourite from the festival this year 'The Home Song Stories' into first place. Cherry Blossoms was not just my favourite film of the festival it has probably got to be the best film I have seen in a long time hands down.To be honest when the film opened up with the cartoon like drawings of Mount Fuji I was a little dubious but as soon as the first scene kicked in I was hooked! We are slowly drawn into the life of Rudi and Trudi Angermeier opening up with Tudi being told by doctors that her husband does not have long to live and that maybe they should go on a vacation an adventure. Through Tudi's character and voice over we begin to learn about who her husband is and what might make him tick. This is all done at the top end of the film before we move on to see Rudi and Trudi visit their children now grown up adults with their own busy lives in Berlin. They have another son who lives in Tokyo who we meet later in the film.What follows is a very heartfelt exploration of an older couple very much in love. It was interesting to see how badly their children seem to treat them. We later find out in the film that is because their children believe that Rudi had kind of suppressed Trudi throughout her life and not let her do what she really wanted to do instead she devoted her life to her husband and children. Whilst that may have been true on some levels we also see a very different side between Rudi and Trudi in their intimate moments. They seem very much in love with one another and Trudi in particular seems to have been happy to have spent her life looking after the ones she loved. It seems like the children thought it was one way but the reality was very different. I wonder how often that kind of assumption can come up in real family life? Probably quite common I would think.So just when we are enjoying the movie and smiling as we get to know these people a big twist happens. I won't tell you what it is but I will say that I did not see it coming at all and it changes everything from that moment on.And here my friends is where I have to stop incorporating elements of what happened in the film into my review for fear of spoiling it for you.The film incorporated a lot of threads and various symbolic elements along the way but none of them ever seem forced. They all fit nicely into the flow of things.There is a massive transition between where Rudi's character in the film starts out and where he ends up. His journey is wonderful and it seems very natural. There isn't some kind of sudden flip it is very gradual and perfectly done. Often in films when you let a scene drag on or spend too long telling one element of the story it can obviously seem very tedious and boring but this was not the case here at all. Everything had it's own place and played it's part it helping to tell the story in a very natural and honest way.It takes a lot for me to cry when watching a film I'm a guy! but Cherry Blossoms did it for me and I cried more than once. The reason for this I believe is two fold. The first being that as I watched this couple I couldn't help but make my own personal connection to it. Thinking about my own relationship with my wife and how we may be when we get to Rudi and Trudi's age. The other reason is that you begin to care for these characters so much that when something happens to them it makes you just want to physically reach out your hand and help them. This is all VERY powerful cinematic stuff! If a movie can take you on a sweeping ride where you laugh and cry then that is a REAL movie! So many films you see are OK fine whatever etc etc but it is very rare that you come across a film which really gives you something back in such a powerful way.I can see that the writerdirector had a very intimate understanding of the people and places. Whether that be from personal experience or just observation and thought. Whatever the case it was brilliantly executed. The film was so perfect that when I go back and think about the film I remember other elements I had forgotten about elements which just make it so much more perfect in my mind. It really felt like the writer just sat down and poured out the film onto paper not over thinking or analysing it all. The truth I would guess may be quite different but I think that's part of the charm when you see a perfect film. It's so flawless that it looks almost effortless!From this moment forward I shall be furiously stalking the works of the writerdirector because this is an artist to be reckoned with. Cherry Blossoms is a masterpiece which shall immediately be going on my very small list of all time top films that everyone should see!".

	schema:reviewBody "A German director Doris Dorrie's third film in her trilogy on Japan Cherry Blossoms is an exquisite absorbing and deeply moving meditation on life death loss loneliness and grief.Talking about old parents with alienated and indifferent descendants the first half of the film may remind the audience of Yasujiro Ozu's film made in 1953 Tokyo Monogatari. The six huggingormassage by family members and strangers scenes and the father's harmonious relationships with his daughter's girlfriend and a Japanese girl successfully highlight the poor relationship between the father and his children.The second half in which the main character embarks on a reflective journey in search of traces of the deceased love captures the mood of Lost in Translation and Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles. The cultural shock experienced also makes the film distinguishable from Under the Sand.Cherry blossoms and Mount Fuji symbolize the fleeting and unpredictable nature of life. The film delivers a message that we should treasure the people around us pursue our dreams and enjoy life to the full so that we will have no regrets. Besides it is also about the main character's inability to communicate with not only the dead but also the living family members. Butoh a Japanese dance helps people to feel and establish connections with others. What's more the audience can pay attention to the symbolic meaning of the drawings at the beginning of the film and the photos at the end.The cinematographer and the composer also succeed in evoking different tones from several shooting locations in Germany and Japan. The suburbs contrast sharply with the hustle and bustle of city life. Apart from the poetic and stunning visual images and the Japanese music playing upon the audience's heartstrings the characters are so lifelike that the audience will care about what happen to them.On the whole although Cherry Blossoms is a bit too long without emotional bludgeoning or syrupy manipulation it is a little road movie producing emotional resonance and reflective ripples in a whisper.".

Beautiful scenes in Japan with great pictures offer the frame for the main part of story. It is fascinating to see the big contrast in the Japanese culture in modern Tokio and the older Japanese traditions at Fuji San as the old man  after his wife has died  makes up a visit to Japan to fulfill the wishes of his wife.

	schema:reviewBody "As the reviews I had read before watching the film were rather mixed I did not expect too much but I was really touched by the story.Trudi learns that her husband is fatally ill and may die soon. Therefore she convinces him to visit their children in Berlin who of course are rather underwhelmed by this parental invasion. The parents move on to spend a few days at the Baltic Sea where  out of the blue  Trudi dies. Her husband Rudi realizes that he did not really know his wife or take her dreams and interests seriously.As Trudi was very much interested in Butoh dance Rudi decides to go to Japan and see their other son who lives there. He gets to know a young Butoh dancer who has lost her mother and both decide to go to Mount Fuji together.A film about dying and blaming yourself for being unkind to someone who has just died might sound depressing and you can shed some tears while watching this film. Yet it is not a tearjerker and it has very funny scenes too. The director of photography deserves an award for his artwork and the duck hurrying around in a very important way is a running gag that just makes you laugh.Definitely the most touching film I have seen in the past few months. Go and watch it  it's a mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "When her husband is diagnosed with a terminal illness a German woman named Trudi decides it's time the both of them paid a long overdue visit to their adult children  two of whom live in Berlin and one in Japan. The catch is that the husband Rudi doesn't even know he's sick and neither do the kids. Thus Trudi must live with this horrible secret while putting on a brave face for those around her. But then a different wholly unforeseen tragedy strikes the family and the movie heads off into an entirely new and utterly unanticipated direction from where we thought it was going.A German movie set largely in Japan Cherry Blossoms is a beautiful and heartbreaking film about living for the moment and of not putting off till tomorrow what you can do today. It's also marvelously perceptive about the dynamics of parentchild relationships especially when as is true in this case the parents are viewed by their selfabsorbed offspring more as burdens to be endured than blessings to be cherished. The irony is that Rudi and Trudi have more in common with  and indeed are treated better by  many of the strangers and casual acquaintances they come in contact with than they are by their own children.But the movie is also an examination of marriage and of how partners can become so entwined with one another as a couple that they lose their identities as individuals missing out on the dreams and goals they had for their lives when they were still young and unattached. This is certainly the case for Trudi who has harbored a lifelong desire to take up Japanese dancing a desire that Rudi in his selfish indifference has pretty much squelched in her for the duration of their marriage. Such a realization of lost opportunities can lead to regrets recriminations and despair at the end of the road yet in the case of Rudi and Trudi one learns that lesson a little too late  and the other just in the nick of time.Elmer Wepper and Hannelore Elsner are magnificent as the aged couple superbly capturing the deepseated but often unspoken love that each spouse has for the other. A fine supporting cast led by Maximilian Bruckner as one of their sons and Aya Irizuki as a young street artist who befriends Rudi in his time of greatest need adds to the movie's richness. Another crucial element in the emotional force of the movie is the richly elegiac score by Claus Bantzer.The glory of this exquisitely realized and profoundly moving film is its willingness to grapple with some truly major issues  of life and death of sorrow and loss of filial and marital relationships  without getting heavyhanded and preachy about it in the process. Every moment in this film feels real and unforced yet the movie itself has the minutely workedout grace and precision of Japanese performance art which we see quite a bit of throughout the course of the film. In fact near the end there is a fantasy dance sequence that is quite frankly one of the most utterly spellbinding scenes I've come across in ages.Masterfully directed by Doris Dorrie Cherry Blossoms is a lyrical and unforgettable work that takes its place among the truly outstanding films of recent times.".

The film is very well written directed and acted. Also one of the best wholest descriptions of the current life in Japan I ever saw on celluloide. I loved the character of the young girl in Japan her wonderful delicate dignity in the face of the horrors of her lonely life.

Dating back to the 8th century hanami is an event without parallel outside Japan.The difference between the titles is a subtle but meaningful message. Just as the blossoms in themselves are different from the veritable cult surrounding them in Japan Drrie's characters live in two different worlds acting differently first clashing similarly to Lost in Translation and then  somewhat mysteriously  cohere. With this complex effective and moving story Drrie who has spent more than three decades writing and directing interesting and different films of varying quality has reached a pinnacle of her career. She owes a debt of gratitude to Yasujiro Ozu especially his Tokyo Story.Germans and Japanese Drrie has said are really very much alike  incredibly repressed and very irrational at the same time. This vague and rather ridiculous generalization actually seems to come to life in Cherry Blossoms. One of Germany's bestknown TV stars Elmar Wepper appears in his first movie role and he nails the character of Rudi Angermeier a cartoonishly ordinary man on an extraordinary journey. Unknown to him he is near the end of his life as he slowly believably emerges from a stolid German middleclass life of unvariable routine to traverse distance and radically different cultures all the way to Mount Fuji dancing butoh.There are two remarkable costars along Rudi's adventure his wife Trudi played by the glamorous actress Hannelore Elsner appearing heroically unglamorous here to fit the role of a plain housefrau and Aya Irizuki as Yu.Yu is one of those rare cinematic creations a character you may not understand but one who will stay with you. This waif runaway street artist is as bizarre a representative of Japan as  going back to Lost in Translation again  Bill Murray's Premium Fantasy woman Rip my stockings! and yet she also evokes Giulietta Masina's character in La Strada a couple of continents away.Watching Rudi and Yu under the cherry blossoms with the strangely elusive Mount Fuji in the background finally peeking out from behind the clouds is among the more memorable scenes in contemporary cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will not say 'Cherry Bloosoms' perfectly flawless. The first half of the movie is a bit too plain beautiful though. It is easy for audience to find traces of 'Tokyo Story' Ozu's 1953 work in the film. The filmmaker attempted a large amount of 'pillow shot'. Audience may feel like she was trying to replicate what Ozu did. It may not be a bad ideaespecially young generation nowadays has not even spent a minute on watching old films like Ozu's work. But to me 'Tokyo Story' is too perfect and the movie I am talking now is not anywhere near it in the case when both of them are critiquing the relationship between parents and grownup children. Yet I did experience a sublime journey throughout the course of this beautiful film. What really moved me is the second half of the movie its delicate description on 'mourning' on how a man copes with the mourning with all kinds of valuable memories of the dead. Beyond doubt the filmmaker did a great work on conveying the feeling of loss. The character'Yu' is impressive enough I still thought of her face that night after watching the movie. She is not the kind of girl with a beautiful face. We the audiences know nearly nothing about the character but she really hit my heart in a deep way. She is lonely and sad easily grabs the heart of audiences.Thanks to the soundtrack also. The film is soft slow sad but at the same time it taught me a lesson. To treasure every single person besides me and to pursue what really matters to me as can life be ever predicted.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a beautiful movie! At the beginning I was especially surprised by the good script just to see the main characters talk just like real people talk and not like movie characters talk. Yes an unannounced visit by the parents can result in sometimes boring sometimes funny table conversations and here it's all so authentic somehow.As the story unfolds the movie more and more reminded me of About Schmidt and Lost in Translation. There's a little culture clash Rudi experiences in Japan but that's not the main focus of the movie and yes there are similarities to About Schmidt as it is sometimes funny and mostly touching to see Rudi deal with the death of his wife and the fact that his life is so different now. However compared to About Schmidt this movie goes a lot deeper has more poetry and more philosophy. The speed of the story is rather slow as too much speed would have destroyed the poetry inside the movie. The cinematography is astounding but does not waste beautiful images for cheap emotions. Watching the movie was a great experience so real yet magic and so touching! I only gave it 910 as I hardly ever give 10 WARNING Some Spoilers ahead I particularly enjoyed watching the relationship between Rudi and Yu such a terrific friendship between a man and a woman of so different ages and cultural backgrounds. Many other movies would have made a love story out of this friendship between a middleclass German senior citizen and a poor 18year old Japanese girl living in a tent in a public park. Other movies would have depicted a kiss at least. Not here I definitely liked watching this intense and deep friendship evolve. A rare thing to see in a movie these days. Don't get me wrong I also like love stories and enjoyed Harry and Sally but seeing how Rudi deals with the death of his wife and Yu with the death of her mother is great  it brings the two together on a very personal level where consolation means a lot and where sexual love would have destroyed a lot so I'm glad that Doris Drrie resisted the temptation to make them a couple.".

I can't imagine the added of burden of trying to keep it from him and act as if nothing were wrong. I failed miserably as a strong supportive caretaker.Many of the things Rudi went through were similar to what I imagined my life would become if he didn't make it. One of the things that really struck me was the portrayal of how seemingly mundane everyday events become vivid and painful reminders of what was and what you desperately wish you still had.

I failed miserably as a strong supportive caretaker.Many of the things Rudi went through were similar to what I imagined my life would become if he didn't make it. One of the things that really struck me was the portrayal of how seemingly mundane everyday events become vivid and painful reminders of what was and what you desperately wish you still had. A beautiful movie a work of art.";

When she learns that he is dying she arranges a trip to visit their children but the kids are too busy to be bothered with them.This is a remarkable film about life and death and love. It moves quite slowly and gently and allows us to get to know the couple and their selfabsorbed children. It deals with devotion and fulfilling one's dream and gave me a lot to think about. The story moves from Germany to Japan and is in German with English subtitles and much spoken English in the second half.The DVD cover calls this movie sublime and I agree.

At the first adbreak I checked the IMDb rating and decided it must be worth watching. Well it certainly was. Beautifully gentle and sad as well. This movie had it all  the beautiful Bavarian countryside then a bit of Berlin with the somewhat uncomfortable children having to put up with the sudden visit of their parents for why only the mother knew. Then to the Baltic Sea where against all expectations mother leaves the film and father must continue on. Then against all his normal routine Dad goes off to visit 'favourite son' who works in Tokyo. As Tokyo is one of my favourite cities to visit this was wonderful to see the daily routine of the city on film. And yes homeless people do live under canvas in Ueno Park because I have seen them  I was quite shocked when I realised what all those blue tarpaulinstents were for. The film ends in HakoneMt Fuji. And there was the only disappointing note in this beautifully observed film. Yes Mr Fujisan is shy  spoiler alert but surely if he was dancing forwith his wife as her last wish he would be FACING Mt Fuji not away from it? sad truth that the camera could not be in 2 places at once though. That minor point aside I loved this. Not having been influenced by what others have written I will now read some of them!2nd time around  Aug.11 Happened to see most of this on TV again last without initially realising what it was namely that I had already seen it. It was just as pleasing the second time around. It has such a gentle touch this movie and it is simply and emotionally charming in a distinctive way. Rudi does not have to say much at all for us to sympathise with his situation and the actor does this so well. The butoh girl is such an interesting and charming ingenue sort of contrast  the relationship with Rudi could have been somewhat creepy but it seems quite natural the way it develops. My own intersections with places in TokyoHakone also give this film a personal resonance which heighten the experience of watching it.".

After I accepted this rather artificial setup I found the rest of the story effective. The doctors suggest to Trudi that perhaps an adventure be taken to which Trudi responds My husband hates adventures. He would prefer it if nothing changed ever. Indeed Rudi is presented as a regimented but not altogether unlikable man. Trudi convinces him to visit a couple of their children in Berlin but that visit is awkward. The kids don't know what to do with the parents and Trudi sums things up with I don't know them any more. While in Berlin Trudi goes to see a Butoh dancing performance while Rudi waits outside. That scene is wonderfully filmed and seeing Trudi's obvious appreciation for the dance we see that Rudi has ignored and dampened some of Trudi's most powerful passions not out of malice but just for lack of trying.There is a favored son Karl who lives in Tokyo and Trudi has always wanted to go to Japan for a visit and to realize her dream of seeing Mount Fuji. More evidence of Rudi's repressive influence is that the trip to Japan has never materialized if you have seen one mountain you have seen them all is his philosophy. An unexpected plot twist has Trudi dying before Rudi. Oddly the person most sympathetic to Rudi's plight is his daughter's lesbian lover Franzi. In a conversation with her Rudi comes to understand things about his wife like her passion to become a Butoh dancer. During the course of this conversation Rudi sees just how remiss he has been by not making any significant attempt to understand his wife. A comment that brought Rudi up short was Franzi's saying that maybe there was another person inside Trudi that nobody ever saw. Not something a man wants to hear about his spouse.In a trip that is part atonement part self discovery part adventure and part attempt to understand and commune with his dead wife Rudi goes to Tokyo where he stays with his son. The visit with Karl goes badly with Karl landing some brutal verbal blows. But in contrast to the harsh family dynamics Rudi encounters a young street Butoh dancer and the friendship that develops between them among the cherry blossoms is pure poetry and leads to an emotionally powerful ending. The mini travelogue of Tokyo is nicely done as is the delicate score.".

Dorie's visual cues play out beautifully throughout her film as the narrative unfolds. Her dedication toward representing the Japanese in a much more respectful and flattering light allows her character transcend cultural barriers and lose himself in the beauty of Japan. At first one would question yet another film where a man goes to an adult bar in Tokyo but outside all of the strangeness he initially perceives the film ends up taking an intelligent and poetic turn. What at first seems to be more like TOKYO STORY builds into a meditation on mourning and transformation. Cultural differences provide an opportunity for finding understanding something Coppola completely seemed to be incapable of. The young Japanese dancer in the film is charming.

Through Butoh he is slowly able to let go by hanging on only gently. The Cherry Blossoms represent the impermanence of things the loss of loved ones the meeting of strangers...all stops along an ephemeral world. Mount Fuji shy yet mighty represents the eternal. A contrast of the letting go and holding on in memory.

Let me say that this film is about the crosscultural relevance of Japanese traditions for a fairly simplyminded Bavarian couple. She could never fulfill her dream to become a Japanese shadowdancer and he did not realize that their homely harmony was merely a facade. After his wife's death the man is told by his son that he did not know who his wife was.She had a dream to see the Fudjiyama but although her husband is diagnosed terminally ill she passes away six months before him. He does not know his disease. Crowded with guilt he decides to fulfill his wife's dream. He puts on her clothes under his owns and flies to Tokyo where his son lives. Because the welcome is rather frosty and the staying together problematic he meets an 18 years old girl who understands that he is traveling with his wife on his body and determined to show her the beloved Fudjiyama.A very long time ago people invented signs merely for the sake of communicating absent far or abstract objects. The signs should substitute the objects by representing them. If people needed the objects they could stick to them and just let the signs aside. However what should they do when the original objects are gone? Then there is the memory in the heads the memory also consists of signs but they are dissipating and fragile. So the yearning for the objects behind the signs was coming up. Was there a kind of magic who would transform the picture of a person into the real person? On the idea that the clothes that have touched the body of a saint are holy signs the whole relicsystem of the Catholic church is built. People travel around the world to visit the places where famous persons lived  as if their ghost would still house in their ancient apartments. People believe in the traces that beloved people left because when the people are gone this is all that is left. That the man decides to put on the clothes of his passed wife has a nice parallel in many languages where the clothes that are most closely to the body are called little body like German Leibchen for Leib body. The bra that held once a part of the wife's body possibly still holds her scent so a part of her must still be present in this bra and although the bra is only a sign for her this is the ultimate approximation that her husband can reach towards her after she has been gone.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Japan cherry blossoms are symbolic of the transient nature of life requiring only one week to bloom and then fall. In Cherry Blossoms the Ozulike film by director Doris Dorrie a practicing Zen Buddhist is a rare film about a subject that Hollywood usually avoids aging and death. Despite a few onedimensional characterizations it is a charming and often moving work that has a feeling for the silences the places within us that we have suppressed but which are always just beneath the surface. A longtime married couple Rudi Angermeier Elmar Wepper and his wife Trudi Hannelore Elsner live in a small German town. Rudi is tied to a routine.Each day he takes the same train to his job as a civil servant eats a sandwich and an apple at the same hour and rarely attempts anything new or adventurous. On the other hand Trudi has never stopped dreaming longing to go to Japan to become a Butoh dancer. When Rudi is diagnosed with a terminal illness Trudi is unable to bring herself to tell Rudi the truth. She instead suggests that it would be a good time for them to travel to Berlin to see their children Klaus Felix Eitner who is married with two children and their lesbian daughter Karolin Birgit Minichmayr who lives with her partner Franzi Nadja Uhl. Things do not go well however.Mirroring the clash of generations in Ozu's Tokyo Story the children are indifferent making it clear that they do not have time to spend with their parents and seeming to regard their visit as an intrusion. Only Franzi makes the parents feel as if they are appreciated taking them on sightseeing trips around the city. Shockingly Trudi dies suddenly during a visit to the beach near the Baltic Sea and a confused and lonely Rudi decides to visit their youngest son Karl Maximilian Brueckner in Tokyo seeking to be close to his wife in spirit by fulfilling her dream of going to Japan.He arrives during the time of the cherry blossoms where the view of the white Sakura blossoms surrounded by views of mountains and water is stunning. It is here that each spring in the ritual known as Hanami Japanese sit under the blossoming trees to celebrate the lives of those close to them who have passed away. Unfortunately the journey is marred by Karl's coldness towards his father who he believes has had little interest in his life. Feeling sad and rejected in the park one day Rudi meets Yu Aya Irizuki an eighteenyearold homeless street artist performing Butoh a dance expressing intense emotions through slow controlled and sometimes distorted movements often performed in white body makeup and painted face.Drawn to each other their innocent communion leads them to Mount Fuji  Rudi's wife's dream. As Rudi symbolically becomes both himself and his wife they celebrate and mourn their own love and loss. Cherry Blossoms suggests that we often prevent our true self from fully expressing itself either to ourselves or each other to blossom like the cherry tree. For Rudi after a lifetime of suppression the day came as author Anais Nin put it when the risk to remain tight in the bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.".

	schema:headline " A rather stiff dose of reality";
	schema:reviewBody "In 2004 the loud and politically motivated director Michael Moore made a splash with Fahrenheit 911 lambasting the Bush administration and making rude noises about the connections between oil and politics. The lack of academic rigour in his film allowed it to be dismissed as disingenuous although it created plenty of waves in the minds of the antiBush camp at least. Then in 2005 Stephen Gaghan made Syriana a tense wellresearched politically charged drama about the oil industry  which made plenty of sense to those steeped in world politics and economics without outwardly offending anybody. Now in 2006 two directors in Switzerland make A Crude Awakening  The Oil Crash a painstaking documentary about the frighteningly central role of oil in our lives. Gelpke has a background in anthropology economics before working as a newswar reporter and then becoming involved in scientific filmmaking. McCormack worked in corporate filmmaking and documentaries but also holds an Honours Degree in Environmental Policy and Management. As you might expect this film relies not on hearsay or fictionalised evidence but interviews with notable academics experts and advisors from across the political corporate and economic spectrum. The film's official website is awash with official protocols reports and other evidence to help you check their sources. It has no discernible political axe to grind. In other words it's hard to ignore.Maybe you've read a lot of literature and have made some connections. You know that the globe faces an energy crisis. Yes? Think again. If you thought it was serious multiply that a hundredfold and start examining it on your mother's life  or rather that of your children. If you thought there was a connection between oil and foreign policy good or bad stop and realise that the underlying mechanics are much deeper than that and go to the root of things you never even dreamed of. Stop and imagine your cosy world coming to an end.A Crude Awakening starts off by calling oil 'the excrement of the devil'. That is the first and last piece of rhetoric  the rest is cold examination of evidence which is perhaps one of the reasons it then has to work so hard to make its rather dry subject interesting . . . I was tired enough to nod off while watching it but the cold and careful facts started seeping down my neck until I was almost in a state of shock.Oil and other fossil fuels compared to human physical labour is so efficient as to make it look almost free by comparison. If we take away everything around us in our modern world that has not been affected by oil in some way from food to manufacturing but particularly transport there is hardly anything left. Our cities have consequently been designed and built unlike most of those in Asia and much of the world that predate the rise of oil around an almost neverending supply of cheap oil. There is no 'easy going back.' With Western supplies dwindling and the main sources being ever more in the hands of rogue or unstable governments oil essential to our continued way of life and a modern way of life that developing countries would emulate becomes a catalyst and magnet for war. From 1945 the promise of security to Saudi rulers became the exchange currency for the promise of a cheap supply of oil. Ordinary Saudis however have seen a massive drop in their quality of life which has led to discontent and the attraction of terrorism especially by migrating to neighbouring countries where there is are bigger power vacuums.The present lifestyle of the West according to the range of leasttomost optimistic figures presented in the film is impossible to maintain. This produces some bleak options. 1 militarise oil  in other words say to people if you want to keep your current way of life and present civilisation be prepared for a lot of wars to secure the oil necessary or 2 kick oil dependence which means developing new technology. Although some of the scientists in the film try to be upbeat about never underestimating the human capacity for technology they mercilessly dissect the present known options to show that even with the best outcomes the result would be the tiniest drop in the ocean of what is required.In the absence of sufficient fossil fuels they suggest that a world population of the current size would be difficult to maintain. We have an unsustainable lifestyle. Pushed into the corner do you want to get the bicycle to work  even if it's fifty miles away? Or do you want to say it's a future generation's problem? Put so starkly the neocon solution of 'democratising the Middle East' to ensure oil supplies in a publicly acceptable or marketable way sounds a more realistic mefirst solution than many liberals would care to admit . . . How much world poverty and deprivation not in third world countries but our own can the we stomach  and how much will our children have to stomach? Would you rather not know? Or do you maybe want to see this film . . .".

Then in 2005 Stephen Gaghan made Syriana a tense wellresearched politically charged drama about the oil industry  which made plenty of sense to those steeped in world politics and economics without outwardly offending anybody. Now in 2006 two directors in Switzerland make A Crude Awakening  The Oil Crash a painstaking documentary about the frighteningly central role of oil in our lives. Gelpke has a background in anthropology economics before working as a newswar reporter and then becoming involved in scientific filmmaking. McCormack worked in corporate filmmaking and documentaries but also holds an Honours Degree in Environmental Policy and Management. As you might expect this film relies not on hearsay or fictionalised evidence but interviews with notable academics experts and advisors from across the political corporate and economic spectrum. The film's official website is awash with official protocols reports and other evidence to help you check their sources. It has no discernible political axe to grind. In other words it's hard to ignore.Maybe you've read a lot of literature and have made some connections. You know that the globe faces an energy crisis. Yes? Think again. If you thought it was serious multiply that a hundredfold and start examining it on your mother's life  or rather that of your children. If you thought there was a connection between oil and foreign policy good or bad stop and realise that the underlying mechanics are much deeper than that and go to the root of things you never even dreamed of. Stop and imagine your cosy world coming to an end.A Crude Awakening starts off by calling oil 'the excrement of the devil'. That is the first and last piece of rhetoric  the rest is cold examination of evidence which is perhaps one of the reasons it then has to work so hard to make its rather dry subject interesting . . . I was tired enough to nod off while watching it but the cold and careful facts started seeping down my neck until I was almost in a state of shock.Oil and other fossil fuels compared to human physical labour is so efficient as to make it look almost free by comparison. If we take away everything around us in our modern world that has not been affected by oil in some way from food to manufacturing but particularly transport there is hardly anything left. Our cities have consequently been designed and built unlike most of those in Asia and much of the world that predate the rise of oil around an almost neverending supply of cheap oil. There is no 'easy going back.' With Western supplies dwindling and the main sources being ever more in the hands of rogue or unstable governments oil essential to our continued way of life and a modern way of life that developing countries would emulate becomes a catalyst and magnet for war. From 1945 the promise of security to Saudi rulers became the exchange currency for the promise of a cheap supply of oil. Ordinary Saudis however have seen a massive drop in their quality of life which has led to discontent and the attraction of terrorism especially by migrating to neighbouring countries where there is are bigger power vacuums.The present lifestyle of the West according to the range of leasttomost optimistic figures presented in the film is impossible to maintain. This produces some bleak options. 1 militarise oil  in other words say to people if you want to keep your current way of life and present civilisation be prepared for a lot of wars to secure the oil necessary or 2 kick oil dependence which means developing new technology. Although some of the scientists in the film try to be upbeat about never underestimating the human capacity for technology they mercilessly dissect the present known options to show that even with the best outcomes the result would be the tiniest drop in the ocean of what is required.In the absence of sufficient fossil fuels they suggest that a world population of the current size would be difficult to maintain. We have an unsustainable lifestyle. Pushed into the corner do you want to get the bicycle to work  even if it's fifty miles away? Or do you want to say it's a future generation's problem? Put so starkly the neocon solution of 'democratising the Middle East' to ensure oil supplies in a publicly acceptable or marketable way sounds a more realistic mefirst solution than many liberals would care to admit . . . How much world poverty and deprivation not in third world countries but our own can the we stomach  and how much will our children have to stomach? Would you rather not know? Or do you maybe want to see this film . . .";

This film filled in many gaps that really made sense to me of what was going on and has been going on for a very long time. It has impressed me so much that I have started going back to review history because of all the questions it has raised for me. This film puts into perspective and also gives me many answers for the bloodshed carried out in many of the wars of the last century and continuing into this century. When you have seen it there is a recognition as when you get newsinformationdiagnosis that makes you go AH ! That explains it !For me it was like getting an economic clinical diagnosis  of an economic terminal illness. And these are the reasons why.... And we've ignored all the symptoms...... And all the indicators...... And now with the best will in the world we will probably still have a huge decline before things can get better if they ever will...... But  by doing nothing we will have an economic meltdown.By waking up and taking action  by making sure those in charge take action we can slow the process and ensure that developing countries need to divert into renewable energy rather than old energy oil to achieve their aspirations.There is a lot that can be done starting with the reasons why that are portrayed in this film. It is absolutely amazing to see such a film on a big screen  but I must remember that this is real  this is our liveslifestyles we are watching going up in smoke. While cinema is the vehicle but this is not a film about make believe  in fact it is doing the opposite of what films are normally about and using itself as a means to get us to believe. This is my honest reaction so far after having seen this film only once over a week ago. Initially I thought it a bit repetitive but afterward I was glad as it has made it memorable to the point that I can't let it drop. I look at everything differently and through a different value system. It really is like you hear of how people reevaluate after getting a diagnosis of a terminal illness  that is what this film has done for me. I can't wait to get hold of a copy of the DVD.It is the best film I have ever seen  and the title couldn't have been better !".

	schema:reviewBody "If you think Hubbert's Peak is some up and coming ski resort you really need to see this film. Directors Basil Gelpke and Ray McCormack have crafted an informative and visually stunning film on the ramifications of Peak Oil. The film delves into the history of the oil age and how once booming oil centers such as Baku Azerbajian and Maracaibo Venezuela have morphed into ghost towns once the oil was gone. The manner in which access to oil is driving U.S foreign policy the ubiquitous nature of oil in modern society and the lack of scalable efficient alternatives to petroleum are presented for the viewer's consideration. Oh I forgot to mention the discussion of the concept of Peak Oil that once aggregate world oil output reaches its maximum peak subsequent recovery will plateau and then begin a permanent decline. Once this decline commences all hell will break loose with the world economy. Depending on the experts this decline could already be under way or it could be 20 years away but it is generally accepted that it is on the horizon. Gelpke and McCormack seamlessly present interviews with knowledgeable thoughtful proponents of peak oil e.g. Colin Campbell and Roscoe Bartlett as well as the occasional demagogue e.g. Matt Savinar. The effect is to inform in a very entertaining way rather than frighten. The visual style of the film is reminiscent of Michael Mann and the Phillip Glass soundtrack is on a par with the best work of Ennio Morricone. If you liked An Inconvenient Truth you will be enthralled by this equally important yet superior film.".

But seriously are you people the ones that have given this film rave reviews all nuts? This movie deals with a really interesting subject but turns it into an incredibly manipulated  highly suspect piece of political propaganda. The entire premise of this movie rests on the notion that we aren't just going to run out of oil which is obvious but we're going to run out of it so suddenly that it's going to cause a worldwide trauma. As if one day there will be oil and the next  oops! All the wells are dry! Next scene chaos murder war yada yada yada.The idea that we might possibly run out slowly over a long period of time maybe 3 or 4 decades?  allowing nations to CONTINUE switching over to alternative sources of energy doesn't seem to exist. Indeed one genius says that Hydrogen fueled cars won't ever work because the technology might not be fully ready for 30 to 50 years. Why is such a time scale a bad thing? Because this film basically tells us that the world is going to end before then.Look I get the point. Oil  bad. But why lie and manipulate facts in order to scare people? It just makes the film seem ridiculous and the creators like leftwing hippies.Examples? Sure I have TONS but I only need one. If you actually watch this POS which I do recommend if only to question it and learn how politically motivated movies can be I'm sure you'll find dozens of other factual inaccuracies Canada's extraction of oil from oil shale One guy tells us it must only be happening because of growing desperation. After all who would go after such an uneconomic source of oil as oil shale if our world supply weren't falling apart? Well smarty Canadian companies apparently. Why? Because They Make Money Doing It! Shale excavation actually does turn a profit especially when oil prices are high as they would be ifwhen reserves begin to run out. Oil need only be above 30 a barrel they're about double that right now for shale extraction to work on a large scale.Guess what else? There are conservatively 3 trillion barrels of RECOVERABLE oil in shale reserves. What's that mean? 100 years of oil at current usage. Double the usage? Fine still 50 additional years IF the Middle East were to run out today. Plenty of time to develop those alternative energies that this movie scoffs at yes they scoff and scoff often.Again I get the need to cut our dependence on oil. And ya know what? So does everyone else. I don't need fear mongers trying to put forth easily debunked theories and manipulated facts in order to sway my vote. If anything I think I'll go out for a nice long unnecessary drive tonight just to show my displeasure with their movie Congratulations.".

	schema:reviewBody "I decided to watch the documentary after the storm of positive reviews on IMDb. One viewer even reported not being able to sleep the next night due to the shock received form the movie. But I actually fell asleep somewhere in the middle after the revelation of some professor form Stanford that the US actually didn't go to Iraq to free the people but to secure the oil supply. What a surprise! I think it was clear to the majority of people right from the onset. And who doesn't know that we're gonna run out of oil? Everybody knows that. Who doesn't know that wars begin for oil? It's so talked about especially after the latest American campaign in Iraq that it's surprising anybody would mention it like some kind of insider information. So leaving the entertaining value of the old oil commercials and the historical background aside there was hardly anything substantial in the film that the general public is not aware of. Then it seems that the documentary was tailored especially to the US public as it I guess the coming scarcity of oil will mostly affect the countries the biggest consumers of carbohydrates i.e. the US. What I didn't like in the film is the manner in which the material was presented. The cutting was terrible all these music video style several seconds clips together with the video footage at hte background it all seems made with the only purpose to create a sensational effect at the same time lacking most of the informative value. Then some punch lines of the specialists interviewed in the films were especially annoying like one where the guy in the military pants said that people might worship Buddha Jesus or Allah but in reality they worship petroleum. I totally failed to see what was the point of the phrase but it sounded ridiculous. There were some more annoying comments lacking any sense and pronounced entirely in order to shock the unsophisticated viewer but let's not get carried away. The documentary was a bit entertaining not enough to stay awake but OK.".

He contracts a bit of a crush on Julie Christie's Marian his friend's older sister and consequently gets drawn into the awkward tacit love triangle between her fiance Trimingham Fox and masculine local farmer Ted Bates. Losey interpolates brief silent flashforwards to the present day as Leo revisits the area to speak with Marian in her dotage.If one has seen or more pertinently read Atonement Joe Wright's film on Ian McEwan's book then you'll be familiar with the themes and in part composition of The GoBetween. Leo divines the sexual tension and intent of the relationship between Marian and Ted but being not only young but also uninitiated in the implicit obligations of the upper class cannot understand why Marian is simultaneously agreeing to her union with Trimingham. Unlike Atonement Leo doesn't wilfully interfere with the relationships. Instead he does act as a catalyst that allows them to happen and is consequently affected by the outcome  the final sequence is a dryly tragic denouement which recalls the TV interview epilogue of Atonement only here there is no atonement to be made or had.The film is beautifully and unequivocally shot. The past may indeed be a different country as the voiceover tells us but it's not a figment of the imagination. The acting is very good with the exception of the younger Maudsleys who are weak. Michel Legrand's score is a cunning set of neobaroque variations for piano rendered oppressively rather like the society and heat. Losey's handling of the drizzled flashforwards is a beautifully rendered conceit that really makes the film for me wistful English and eloquent. 710".

The screenplay by Pinter is impeccable building a rhythmic alternation of times and places an alternation that ultimately crashes together. I have seen this movie several times  like Casablanca it just keeps getting better  and have taught it to innercity prefreshmen  they loved it. They were not at all used to films that try to be artistic creations and the slowness of the pace at first threw them off. However once we explored the multiple levels of meaning and revelation in each of the initial scenes they became drawn into the film caught up in its mystery and romance and fascinated by the vision of a totally alien yet oddly familiar world. Losey at his best is on a par with Renoir. Why isn't this film on DVD? Even the background music is really good.".

The juxtaposition between the two periods is stunning and mysterious. The acting is superb the sets and costumes are superior and the haunting Michel Legrand score stays with you long after the film is over.  I find the film to be quite elegant in its scenes of yesteryear where the old England seemed dreamy leisurely carefree and prim and proper compared to the dreary coldly realistic grownup modernday England where the past is spoken about and an explanation of what happened in the past is requested.Although the movie ends on a tragic note there is a hint of hope which I found oddly liberating a feature I didn't notice 30 years ago.  But like fine wine this movie ages well.  Enjoy and go on a trip to the past ...where it's a foreign country...they do things differently there.".

	schema:headline " Another PinterLosey Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the third joint venture paring writer Harold Pinter and director Joseph Losey. The other two are The Servant 1963 and Accident 1967. This venture combined with a topnotch cast makes for a great film No. 56 of the BFI's Top 100. Yet sadly the movie has not been restored in its original aspect ratio for DVD and I had to see it on VHS in the full screen panand scan version. I've a feeling that this is one of those films that MUST be seen in its original wide screen format since the photography of the English countryside setting is crucial to the movie and anything less does not tell the movie's whole story!Michael Redgrave tells the story in retrospect. It begins as a 12year old boy Leo Dominic Guard comes to spend the summer of 1900 at a large English country estate. He is a guest there and his relationship to the family is never made clear. We don't learn much about his background except what we overhear that his mother is a widow from the city. As he is introduced at the family dinner table he tells them that he knows magic and has conjured up curses on people but this seems a game between him and the other boy his age on the estate Marcus. As the two boys play the rest of Marcus' family starts to emerge as Marcus tells Leo about them while pointing them out. We view their lazy hot summer's life as they attempt to occupy themselves with conversation nature art culture and games. Leo attempts to fit in with the family led by its matriarch Mrs. Maudsley Margaret Leighton. Leo also becomes attracted to Marus' older sister Marian Julie Christie and develops a puppy love for her. At one point he proclaims that he would do almost anything for her. She in turn shows an admiration for him.One day as the family goes out for a swim they encounter their lower class neighbor Ted Burgess Alan Bates who is trespassing on their property by swimming in their lake. Leo later meets Ted and is gradually taken into his confidence. At Ted's coaxing he starts to secretly deliver notes to Marian and she in turn returns notes to Ted through Leo. Feeling 'out of the loop' Leo wants to know more. He eventually asks Ted to tell him about sex 'spooning'. At almost thirteen and with no father to guide him Leo has never been told the facts of life. Yet he senses that he should know more and that Ted will explain it to him though he never really does. When Marian becomes engaged to an upper class gentleman Ted seems displeased. However after a brief break off in communications Ted and Marian begin their secret exchanges again with Leo still acting as their dutiful Mercurylike 'gobetween.' Then on Leo's thirteenth birthday he suddenly learns the shocking nature of his carried missives.This film accented by Michel Legrand's score has a mysterious almost Gothic feel about it. There seems to be something always missing just out of view waiting to be discovered. But just as Leo is never made part of the secret neither is the audienceuntil the surprising ending.".

I think some of the contents of the film may be a bit confusing or unclear for someone who has not read the book but otherwise it is a good adaptation. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADThroughout the film we cannot help feeling sorry for the everrunning boy Leo Dominic Guard especially in two scenes first when he is scolded by Marian Julie Christie for initially avoiding her request she then manipulates him making him feel guilty to get her own way. The cruelty lies in the use of her privileged status which makes it easy for her to win over his resistance by reminding him of his poor background. Second when he is caught in his lies by Mrs Maudsley we can only pity him despite his mistakes.The feeling of an imminent disaster is well present and the building of the tension announces the end of the deceit for Ted Alan Bates and Marian as well as the young boy's lost innocence after his initial ignorance about sexual matters or the details of the love affair itself. As soon as the secret is out the triangular links are destroyed  the days of complicity between Leo and the two illicit lovers are over and the truth is fatal to the other triangle formed by Ted Marian and Hugh.One of the interests of the film is in the use of a certain language spooning as well as the subtext  Marian explaining to Leo  I must marry him Hugh implies the social pressure the society expectation and probably the fact she must know she is pregnant at this stage.Despite the tragic denouement and Leo's trauma there is a notion of hope at the end Now a much older man Leo is given a last mission as a postman.

	schema:headline " Love in a Heatwave";
	schema:reviewBody "Contains spoilersBased on a novel by L.P. Hartley 'The GoBetween' is set during a hot August in late Victorian or Edwardian England. References to the Boer War suggest that the year is 1900 or 1901. Leo a twelve year old schoolboy has gone to stay with his school friend Marcus Maudsley and his wealthy family in their stately home in the Norfolk countryside. Leo meets Marcus's older sister Marion who is secretly having an affair with Ted Burgess a local farmer. Marion needs to keep this relationship hidden from her parents who would not approve of Burgess as a potential soninlaw partly because they regard him as being a social inferior partly because he has a reputation possibly undeserved as a philanderer and partly because they are encouraging her to marry another suitor the rich aristocrat Hugh Trimingham. In order to keep her secret Marion needs a messenger to take messages between herself and Ted she cannot trust the servants whose first loyalty is to her father so she enlists Leo as the 'gobetween' of the film's title. Leo is ideal for this purpose he is from a middleclass background less affluent than the Maudsleys and is too much in awe of the beautiful sophisticated Marion to think of disobeying her. Moreover his youth and innocence about sexual matters mean that he does not understand the full implications of Marion's friendship with Ted.Throughout the film there are occasional scenes set at a later period in history the late forties or fifties to judge by the clothes and vehicles that we see. These are initially very brief glimpses lasting only a few seconds but we later see more of this later period including scenes of the nowelderly Marion and the middleaged Leo. The weather plays an important part in this film. The latterday scenes are shot against a backdrop of grey overcast skies. The turn of the century scenes however mostly take place against a background of sunshine and fierce heat. There is much evocative photography of the English countryside the pale sunbleached colours capturing the driedup dusty look of a late summer heatwave. The subdued tones of this film tend to set it apart from the richer colours of other examples of 'British heritage cinema' such as the work of Merchant Ivory. It is interesting that both Joseph Losey and James Ivory were American rather than British by birth. Although there are plenty of open vistas Norfolk is one of the flattest parts of England there is a stifling claustrophobic atmosphere. The pace of the film is for the most part leisurely the English upper classes rarely do anything in a hurry particularly during hot weather but there is always a sense of movement slow but inexorable towards some fateful denouement a sense heightened by Michel Legrand's urgent insistent musical score. The scoring is reminiscent of a late Romantic piano concerto. Just as the hot weather is building up towards an inevitable thunderstorm so the relationship between Marion and Ted is building towards a tragic climax. When this climax finally comes and their secret is revealed it does so on a day of torrential rain after the weather has broken. It is perhaps an interesting comment on changing climatic patterns that in the film a temperature of 83 degrees Fahrenheit which today in Southern Britain would be regarded as a normal warm summer's day is regarded as a recordbreaking heatwave. In 1970 a year coming at the end of two decades of cool rainy summers hot weather was not something taken for granted even in August. One of the main themes of the film is an examination of the social class structure of the period. This structure is more subtle than a simple richpoor divide. The Maudsleys part of the landed gentry are not quite aristocrats Trimingham a peer of the realm is the genuine article so they see his marriage to their daughter as a step towards social advancement. The family's attitude towards the bourgeois Leo is somewhat condescending as though he were a 'poor relation' but Leo's family are clearly not poor in any absolute sense if they were his widowed mother could not afford to send him to the same private school as Marcus. Even Burgess is probably comparatively prosperous Norfolk contains some of the richest agricultural land in Britain but his lowly social origins betrayed by his rustic accent and his status as a tenant count against him.There are a number of excellent acting performances in the film particularly from those two iconic sixties figures Julie Christie and Alan Bates as the doomed lovers Margaret Leighton as Marion's obsessive mother whose prying precipitates the tragedy Dominic Guard as young Leo and Michael Redgrave as the older Leo. The one thing I did not like was the use of the twentynine year old Christie to play the older Marion even the use of makeup and lowlevel lighting could not make her a convincing seventy or eighty and the film would have been improved by casting an older actress in the part. Dominic Guard did not go on to make many more feature films but the other major film in which he starred was Peter Weir's 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' five years later. There are a surprising number of parallels between the two films both are set during a period of oppressive summer heat around 1900 both have a similarly claustrophobic atmosphere and both deal with emerging female sexuality and with the VictorianEdwardian class system. 'The GoBetween' which is more realistic and less mystical in tone is not quite on the same level as Weir's masterpiece but it is nevertheless one of the best British films of the early seventies. There are also parallels with the only other film in which Bates and Christie acted together John Schlesinger's adaptation of Hardy's 'Far from the Madding Crowd'. With its rural setting and story of love between people of different social classes Hartley's novel clearly shows the influence of Hardy. 810".

The one thing I did not like was the use of the twentynine year old Christie to play the older Marion even the use of makeup and lowlevel lighting could not make her a convincing seventy or eighty and the film would have been improved by casting an older actress in the part. Dominic Guard did not go on to make many more feature films but the other major film in which he starred was Peter Weir's 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' five years later. There are a surprising number of parallels between the two films both are set during a period of oppressive summer heat around 1900 both have a similarly claustrophobic atmosphere and both deal with emerging female sexuality and with the VictorianEdwardian class system. 'The GoBetween' which is more realistic and less mystical in tone is not quite on the same level as Weir's masterpiece but it is nevertheless one of the best British films of the early seventies. There are also parallels with the only other film in which Bates and Christie acted together John Schlesinger's adaptation of Hardy's 'Far from the Madding Crowd'. With its rural setting and story of love between people of different social classes Hartley's novel clearly shows the influence of Hardy. 810";

	schema:reviewBody "The source novel obviously inspired by Lawrence's more carnal Lady Chatterley's Lover I had read a year or so ago on holiday and thoroughly enjoyed so it was with much anticipation that I settled down at last to watch this celebrated adaptation by American exile Joseph Losey with its topnotch British cast. I wasn't disappointed. To the best of my recollection the film is very true to the novel only slightly modifying the epiloguetype ending by introducing the yearslater reunion of Marion and Leo in teasingly inserted sequences which initially might confuse the casual viewer. The main theme of the movie to my mind is the corruption of innocence as the adults in the world of naive young outsider Leo take advantage of his susceptibility and willingness to please not to mention his pubescent fascination with physical love to use him as an unwitting pawn in their adult games of deception and lust. Thus we learn at the conclusion that Leo has never married or even by inference enjoyed any kind of natural relationship with a woman thus is his trust and innocence abused for all time.The film of course also comments tellingly on snobbery class division and heroism in betweenthewars England but in the end its most important facet is the interplay of the four main characters Marion Ted Burgess Lord Trillingham and of course young Leo as the film moves inexorably towards its predictably tragic ending. The acting is generally very good especially the main female parts played by Julie Christie and Margaret Leighton as errant daughter and suspicious mother respectively. The male acting I was slightly less enamoured of Alan Bates failing to me to really suggest the rough physicality which draws Marion away from the safe arranged matrimonial match offered by the affable jolly good chap Lord Trillingham well played by a young Edward Fox. The young actor playing Leo acts his part very well although the scenes with his young schoolfriend Marion's younger brother are a bit strained and accordingly unconvincing. The direction I found largely wellpaced although one or two short interludes seemed unnecessary in the editing and occasionally the frightfully frightfully accents of the cast grated somewhat. Harold Pinter's screenplay stays properly close to its source and is less noticeably Pinterian than I would have expected not too many characteristic pregnant pauses or repetitions. The climax sorry no pun intended in the barn was effectively led up to and delivered. I did however find the music by Michel Legrand lacked a little subtlety out of kilter with the delicate emotions on display here and also lacking the required pastoral touch. On the whole though this was a rewarding and entrancing movie as good a classic book adaptation as you could hope to see and probably a precursor of MerchantIvory's success later in the decade.".

No review of this film would be complete without a mention of Margaret Leighton's commanding performance as the powerful class obsessed matriarch Mrs Maudsley who ultimately is forced to cut through the knowing acceptance of the males and bring the relationship between Marian and Ted to an end at the same time unwittingly bringing Leo face to face with the disturbing truth of what goes on between men and women in the world of adults.".

Harold Pinter's screenplay in adeptly interweaving present and past anticipates by some thirty years work by Christopher Nolan Memento and by David Hare The Hours. Pinter and director Losey also succeed in capturing the suffocating English class system.Having never read L. P. Hartley's story on which the film is based it's impossible for me to judge the extent of Pinter's faithfulness to it. On film at least I feel the finale doesn't quite come off though I don't really know why. It may be because we don't really get to know the key character SPOILER it's Julie Christie's grandson whom we see but never hear and don't get to know. The more significant revelation of the finale another SPOILER is that Michael Redgrave's character has been permanently scarred emotionally blunted by his childhood experiences as the messagebearer between Julie Christie's daughter of the manor and Alan Bates' rugged farmer. But although Redgrave does his very best to suggest this we have to take it on trust from Julie Christie's character  we never really get to know old Marcus. And of course to have built up any more of his life as an old man would have completely unbalanced the film so the decision to keep it as oblique as possible was the right one. It just makes the end of the film rather unsatisfactory.Nevertheless the story set in the foreign country of the past is spectacularly welltold and magnificently acted not least by the excellent Dominic Guard as young Marcus  a great screen performance. Bates Christie Edward Fox Michael Gough  all reliably fine. As you sit watching the film if you know anything about Margaret Leighton at all you spend most of it wondering why this RollsRoyce actress has been cast in what appears to be quite a small part. But then comes the climax of the film and you realise why she's there. She's magnificent.It's worth mentioning the obsessive score by Michel Legrand. For many it won't work. I found it irritating to begin with but in the end I was won over by it. Not an unblemished masterpiece then but on the whole a compelling work of art.".

And of course to have built up any more of his life as an old man would have completely unbalanced the film so the decision to keep it as oblique as possible was the right one. It just makes the end of the film rather unsatisfactory.Nevertheless the story set in the foreign country of the past is spectacularly welltold and magnificently acted not least by the excellent Dominic Guard as young Marcus  a great screen performance. Bates Christie Edward Fox Michael Gough  all reliably fine. As you sit watching the film if you know anything about Margaret Leighton at all you spend most of it wondering why this RollsRoyce actress has been cast in what appears to be quite a small part. But then comes the climax of the film and you realise why she's there. She's magnificent.It's worth mentioning the obsessive score by Michel Legrand. For many it won't work. I found it irritating to begin with but in the end I was won over by it. Not an unblemished masterpiece then but on the whole a compelling work of art.";

Yet class divisions are at the heart of this fine movie. At one extreme is the highborn female characterMarian played effortlessly by the evergreen Julie Christie and at the other the hornyhanded son of the soil Ted Burgess portrayed by the outstanding Alan Bates. The undeniably upper? middleclass gobetween of the title acts not just as a temporal and physical link between the adult protagonists but also serves to hint at the continuing breakdown of class barriers.The film is beautifully photographed and evokes an England not yet gone forever but on the way out. The musical score has to be one of the best ever written for a movie and whilst powerful enough to be a work of art in its own right manages to remain subservient to the story yet contributing all the while to the tensions inherent in the storyline.Some things remain unresolved. Why did Ted feel that he had to kill himself? He'd committed no crime had displayed no evidence of anything other than a healthy interest in heterosexual activities and presumably paid his rent on time. He had so far as one can tell noone to chastise or condemn him and his skills as a cricketer would surely have given him considerable licence to behave as badly as he wanted. We see Marian's grandson towards the end of the film but there is no hint of his immediate parentage a whole generation completely overlooked.On the whole this is a movie classic. It is one that can be watched every couple of years or so if only to remind oneself on a cold and wet winter's night that there once was an England and an Empire on which the sun never set.".

Well yes but I wouldn't expect a large proportion of them to sit the entire way through it. It just doesn't have anything like the pace of today's blockbusters or teen movies. The enjoyment of this film is now largely an intellectual one  it's about the laughable views of the upper class and about booktofilm transfers.Incidentally to my knowledge this film has never been available for sale on DVD. And yet in March 2006 it was given away as a freebie DVD with the UK's Sunday Telegraph. The film industry is seriously undervaluing its backcatalogue.

Disapproving family matriarch Margaret Leighton who sees the world through slanted jaded eyes has a terrifically charged moment late in the movie where she confronts the child over a letter in his pocket and young Dominic Guard is excellent as well. The starcrossed lovers Julie Christie and Alan Bates have far less to work with surprisingly but do have superlative moments. The unvarying score by Michel Legrand becomes monotonous before long and the production design and cinematography are disappointing though the film has a quiet power that is unsettling. 12 from ".

Disapproving family matriarch Margaret Leighton who sees the world through slanted jaded eyes has a terrifically charged moment late in the movie where she confronts the child over a letter in his pocket and young Dominic Guard is excellent as well. The starcrossed lovers Julie Christie and Alan Bates have far less to work with surprisingly but do have superlative moments. The unvarying score by Michel Legrand becomes monotonous before long and the production design and cinematography are disappointing though the film has a quiet power that is unsettling. 12 from ";

And here I was thinking it was impossible to have worse chemistry than Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman in Episodes II and III...Oh boy was I wrong. Mewes and Hilton make them look like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Not that they don't try their best. I can't help but think that this character Owen is closer to the real Mewes than Jay...He's silly and goofy but also a little sweet and incredibly loyal. As for Paris she seems very uncomfortable as Lisa which is strange because this is not a person I have ever seen feeling uncomfortable about anything.Now on to the supporting cast who I must say are excellent. Like I said before Smith as Owen's lazy farting best friend back home is hysterical. The guy who plays Lisa's boyfriend Hayden is great. Also Owen's Uncle Earl is hysterical as are the guys in Hayden's posse This is definitely worth the rental but except crap...even from crap...".

	schema:reviewBody "Bottom's Up 2006 Directed By Eric MacArthur Starring Paris Hilton Jason Mewes Brian Hallisay Jon Abrahams David Keith  Nicholle Tom MPAA Rating R for sexual content nudity language and drug use Paris Hilton has not had what I would call a quality run in Hollywood cinema. In fact she has had about the furthest thing from it. After a brief role in the horror disaster Nine Lives and another role in the mediocre drama The Hillz it seemed as though she was finally getting her career on track with a starring role in the effective slasher flick House of Wax 2005. While she did not give an awardworthy performance she still held her own and gave audiences what they wanteda fun chase scene and a gruesome death scene. This is her followup to that movie and unfortunately she has regressed back into the straighttovideo market with Bottom's Up. This is an unfulfilling film with painfullyawful direction and no chemistry between the two leading stars Jason Mewes and Paris Hilton. The plot is thin and barely supports the weak romance that seems to be more a secondthought rather than a main plot line. On the upside the cast is likable and the jokes though few and far between do work for the most part. Overall this is a betterthanaverage straighttovideo film but it still reeks of predictability and recycling. There is hardly an ounce of originality and the movie really only deserves one watch preferably on television if anything at all.Owen Peadman Mewes is a bartender in Minnesota who heads to Hollywood to take part in a bartending competition to raise money for his father's small restaurant. He stays with his flamboyantly gay and yet in denial uncle Earl Keith. When the competition does not work out well for Owen he takes to working with his uncle at an entertainment television station as well as working his way into the Hollywood social circle. After a chancemeeting with wealthy socialite Lisa Mancini Hilton and her actor boyfriend Hayden Field Hallisay Owen is pulled into a world of betrayal bigotry and seductiona world that will change him forever and may lead him to the love of his life. But Hollywood is never a kind place to reside and for Owen keeping his head above water may prove to be far more difficult than he originally thought. This plot sounds like it could make for an excellent movie. Unfortunately it doesn't. Bottom's Up only delves into this plot in the most shallow ways delivering characters that we can't really care about and back stories that are flat and uninteresting.The performances in Bottom's Up have a certain blah feeling about them. They certainly don't stand out and are instantly forgettable. Paris Hilton does what is required of her. She will not be winning an Academy Award any time soon but she certainly shows that she is molding her acting skill into something more than she showcased in Nine Lives. Jason Mewes unfortunately disappointed me. He could do so much better than this but it seemed as though he expected the movie to be forgotten so he merely gave a dull performance and collected that paycheck. There is a certain charm about David Keitha charm usually wasted on horrible horror flicks that wind up on the SciFi channel. Here he hits the nail on the head. Brian Hallisay does an okay job for his first role in a movie. My biggest question for Jon Abrahams is why are you even in this movie? Did you just want so desperately to star with Paris Hilton again that you accepted a small unimportant role in a straighttovideo comedy? What a bad career decision on his part! The rest of the cast fits into that blah feeling I mentioned earlier.When this movie ended I had such a distinct feeling of indifference. I didn't like the movie. I didn't dislike the movie. I just didn't care either way. Erik MacArthur's direction is absolutely horrible and the brief animated sequences inserted along the way come off as cheesy and bothersome. What was the point of these? MacArthur also directed a short film featuring the same characters from this film played by different actors and actresses of course. The short was named Life Makes Sense If You're Famous. If this idea was originally planned for a sevenminute short why would you want to stretch it out into a movie that is eightynine minutes long? The logic behind that choice simply befuddles me. It explains why the movie seems as though the plot is stretched so thin and why the pacing is patchy and slow in many places. Overall I would say that there really isn't any reason why you should watch this movieunless it is on cable one night and nothing else better is on. But it still isn't a bad movie thanks mostly to the likable cast.Final Thought Though not bad there is no reason to watch it.Overall Rating 410 C".

I think its because these people are genuinely brain dead and have no talent to speak of.Clearly a movie bank rolled by people who have too much cash and too little ideas.So lets pull together  mail your mates and make this the no1 worst movie of all time to show the idiots who come up with this stuff were sick of it.".

All of the characters are undeveloped and the edition is very poor as some of the cuts last way longer than they should however Jason Mewes and Brian Hallisay are pretty good. Mewes has a not jaja funny character and he he does it fine Hallisay it's OK as a pretty boystoner actor. Hopefully we'll be seeing them in other flicks this one wont kill their careers cuz nobody saw it.Ill recommend it only if you're a huge fan of the actors or if you're at your house all alone with anything to do but stare at the your wall wondering why no one likes you.".

Those two mistakes were1 Completely forgotten to check IMDb before watching this film 2 Completely forgotten the fact that Miss Paris can never act !And because of the mistakes I have sat through an hour and a half watching this dull boring and utter crap film. I never thought that I'd be reviewing film that Miss Paris acted in but I think there is need to tell readers how bad this movie is. Whilst commenting on this film would not get me a Nobel prize at least it'll save valuable time to those who listen to my advice not to watch this film.A very poor rating of 1.9 out of 10 is a testament of how bad the film is. It shows that albeit some may find the movie to their liking majority of the voters said that this movie is very bad ! So my advice is pass this movie and buy  rent some other titles instead.Paris Hilton is...... Paris Hilton. No matter how many films she had starred in or how many hours she had spend time in acting classes the fact remains that she can never act. Experience does come in handy in other profession but in acting it's clear One either have the talent or one do not. Watching her wooden acting is so painful and I hope she can quit acting and find other better things to do instead. I think it is better if she becomes her dad's apprentice and learn her way in hotel business. She'll be a suitable heiress to her dad business.So a palatable score of 1 out of 10. To those who are involved in the production of this film count yourselves lucky because I can't rate this film a zero.".

Due to the films simplicity I'll just follow its lead and simply list my thoughts on the film. The chemistry of the male and female leads is completely non existent and i've never seen a less convincing couple on screen than Jason Mewes and Paris Hilton  The male lead in the movie is Jason Mewes who unfortunately is entirely unsuited to this role and charisma free. The plot is the most threadbare and tedious I have ever seen with a Minnesota bartender travelling with his gay uncle to Los Angeles and meeting a spoilt heiress. Sadly that really is about it. The script is neither funny nor creative. None of the characters are likable. In particular the supposedly humorous gay 'Uncle Earl' just being a stereotypical and plain annoying character. Editing on this film was clearly not a priority with many scenes appearing to take place that weren't really necessary and often scenes seem like endless drivel. Paris Hilton appears to be playing herself and is incapable of doing that. Her acting ability is non existent and it sounds like she has rehearsed her lines way too many times.One of the most surprising elements of this film was seeing Jon Abrahams star of 'Scary Movie' and 'Meet The Parents' playing a minor role in a poor DTV film. Despite this he seems completely uninterested when on screen and you can hardly blame him. But what was he thinking agreeing to this? Overall films don't get much worse than this and if you enjoy this film you really are easily pleased.I give this movie 210.".

If you are a true Mewes fan you will enjoy it even tho it is awesomely bad movie. Brian Hallisay does deliver a solid acting performance as a stoner celebrity not obsessed with the limelight. Paris Hilton why o why is Paris everywhere. She couldn't act her way out of a brown paper bag. Only acting she should be doing is in adult videos.

If you are a true Mewes fan you will enjoy it even tho it is awesomely bad movie. Brian Hallisay does deliver a solid acting performance as a stoner celebrity not obsessed with the limelight. Paris Hilton why o why is Paris everywhere. She couldn't act her way out of a brown paper bag. Only acting she should be doing is in adult videos. Oh and the gay uncle is a riot. 3 the jogging outfit.";

	schema:reviewBody "I can honestly say that it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. Watching Paris Hilton's acting was literally painful. The major problems were the bad acting lack of plot random flashes to cartoons no character development and terrible dialogue. First of all Paris Hilton has absolutely no acting talents whatsoever. It's like the lights are on but no one's home. She's off in space not even paying attention to what's going on. I can't say I really blame Jason Mewes for not doing a phenomenal acting job. Any one forced to act as if they felt a genuine affection towards Paris Hilton would clearly be asked to achieve a feat beyond the talents of anyone on the planet. The movie starts off to be about Jason Mewes trying to win money to save his dad's bar. He enters a bar tending flair competition loses and within the first 15 minutes the plot has completely shifted over to be a crappy written love story. This plot line is never mentioned again. For some strange reason there are random flashes where the movie switches over to cartoon. I suppose due to budget issues or whatever. I have to say that the somewhat amusing yet utterly retarded cartoon was Matt Davis throwing himself off a cliff while yelling I'm a huge jackass! I'm still not very sure as to what that had to do with the plot but it's always fun to see Matt Davis look like a douche bag. As for the character development we're supposed to believe that Paris Hilton is viewed as a rich snotty party girl as in real life who actually is nice kind helpful towards the poor and my favorite likes to read books. That's a laugh. Can you imagine Paris Hilton reading anything that doesn't spell COCK? The truth is there was absolutely no character development towards this idea that Paris Hilton was smart or caring. Think about it she has the personality of a brick and she can only act as herself you do the math. As for Jason Mewes character he nearly gets run over by Paris loses both his and his uncle's jobs due to her and he still says She seems nice. That doesn't add up. His character must possess some sort of ESP because he's able to magically sense the fact that she's a nice girl despite nearly getting run over and fired. The dialogue in this movie was dreadful. Some of the worst was that between Matt Davis and Uncle Earl. Their trash talking consisted of Go back to the valley Quaker oats and Let's rock n' roll chumpenstein! Other good lines were I'd rather be at home reading a book. I doubt that Paris Hilton could read a picture book much less one with actual words. I could go on giving examples of terrible of dialogue but with the examples I've given anything else would pale in comparison. On top of this the film contained poor cinematography bad editing and seemed to lack any real direction. I would definitely give this film one star but only because zero is not a choice. I don't recommend this movie to ANYone unless perhaps I hated them and wanted to steal 89 minutes from their life.".

She plays her part the way it should be played Although considering she plays a millionaire heiress dating the hottest teen heart throb in Hollywood  she couldn't mess up too badly. I have no doubt that most of the reviews will just bash Paris  her performance because even if she put in something Oscar worthy  people would hate it because they have an infatuation hating her no matter what she does.The story revolves around a young guy from a MidWestern town going to Hollywood to win a bar competition in order to collect the 10000 prize money to save his fathers steak house. The real problem in this film is Mewes. If Mewes' acting was described as wooden then Nicole Richie would be described as a skinny. He is TERRIBLE! The amount of times he looks into the camera is ridiculous and most of the time he seems a little stoned.David Keith is brilliant as Gay Uncle Earl  offering hilarity and nailing his part to perfection Jon Abrahams character is extremely under developed but you still get the gist of what an ass he is Brian Hallisay's turn as the heart throb isn't half bad but again his character seems under developed.One thing about the movie that does grate on you is the foul language. For the first 15 minutes it's OK and quite funny but after that the fuck and cock into every sentence is annoying! Overall  Not bad if a little underdeveloped with good turns from Keith  Hilton and bad turns from Mewes.610.".

But his character I don't think is explicitly a stoner per se I think he takes one bong hit in the movie and puffs on a blunt. If he was meant to be then it doesn't add anything to the story. He comes from a friendship group of wasters  including Kevin Smith's character  but he is a bartender with talent and ambition. He is therefore the hero who seeks his fortune in LA and eventually succeeds in his goal.Like the later Paris Hilton vehicle The Hottie and the Nottie this was grossly poorly received.

It's certainly the more glamorous if you're into the allure of wild LA parties high society and Hollywood hotties.Paris Hilton's acting may have been better in The Hottie and the Nottie but that also had a more predictable and formulaic story.

Boy moves town boy meets hot girl boy wants to be with hot girl boy has complications boy still gets girl. I thought that at times the acting was a little bit Clist but not from the main stars which was rather good and overally convincing much better than House Of Wax. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would recommend it as an uplifting movie for a night in with the partner as long as you want to be mildly entertained. Teens only though because it is not really that suitable for people who are in their mid 20's or any older.".

	schema:reviewBody "For fans of Jay and Silent Bob also known as Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith this movie was not about them in their usual roles. This movie was not written by Kevin Smith and has little bearing on the style and characters he would write into a movie. But to see them in the same movie in different roles made this worth a look. And I was not disappointed at all.Owen Peadman is played by Jason Mewes akaJay. Owen is a very milder version of Jay but still an intriguing character and his acting was excellent throughout the movie. From his facial expressions to his quick witted responses Mewes does not disappoint. Throw in the few scenes with the always funny and witty Kevin Smith and you still have a good Jay and Silent Bob connection. Not to mention Owen using the Jay and Silent Bob term Sirs in one scene. The underlying familiar humor was welcome.Now let's look at the characters of Uncle Earl Peadman played by an outstanding actor David Keith. David Keith has played many macho roles and seeing him play a gay man was quite different. But he played it well and by the end of the movie you felt his character.Now let's take a look at the questionable role for Paris Hilton. First of all the role was perfect for her because she's lived that lifestyle. I almost perceived her as wishing she was her character instead of playing it. But unfortunately that's not true. So putting her name aside I think the young lady who played Lisa Mancini did a great job at bringing out her character. She was a soft hard and everything in between.The movie will probably get bad reviews because of her. But as a comedy I thought the movie was witty funny and well written with underlying twists.I recommend this movie just because you can sit back and watch it and laugh without thinking too much. A nice view after a hard day at work.".

The film was shot on location and despite liberties taken with history it is an absorbing look at a mysterious culture that has virtually disappeared.1400 years ago Polynesian seafarers settled on the most remote island on earth Easter Island or Rapa Nui as they called it. Although most of what is known about their history is speculation based on archaeological evidence it seems the island went through an intense period of statue moai building followed by an equally intense period of tearing them down. In the course of which Rapa Nui was denuded of trees and its society decimated by warfare and famine. To regulate their dwindling resources the islanders conducted an annual ocean race with the winner's tribe ruling the island for a year under their leader the Birdman.Kevin Reynolds' movie is about these events. In fact every event in the island's history is in the film. What took over 1000 years to unfold takes place in what seems like a single season. Time compression is one of the major criticisms of the film.The writers constructed a Romeo and Juliet love story around the characters played by Jason Scott Lee Sandrine Holt and Esai Morales. This aspect of the story is quite effective due to their convincing performances. Less convincing are passages of silly dialogue between Eru PotakaDewes and George Henare playing the reigning Birdman and the High Priest respectively. However these are exceptions the rest of the script effectively moves the story along and explains why things are happening to this doomed culture.The making and moving of the moai are highlights of the film as is the birdman competition an event so gruelling that by comparison a modern triathlon seems about as difficult as an eggandspoon race. The film recreates the event at the actual location the cliffs at Orongo. Today it is forbidden to scale these cliffs but it seems the film was shot before the restriction existed.The score by Stewart Copeland the former drummer of the band Police features a blend of choral orchestral and new age elements. A traditional score may have worked but this one is inspired delivering a sense that time is running out for Rapa Nui.Much bare skin is exposed in the movie and nearly all the women appear topless. Gratuitousness is another charge levelled at the film however the alternative would have been Dorothy Lamour sarongs. Historical evidence suggests the costume designers got it right which probably pleased the marketing people who no doubt had an eye on the box office.Rapa Nui offers a very different cinema experience. It is not without the odd gaffe but it is also totally unique and utterly compelling as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "The studios should be applauded when they take on a movie that involves an all new setting and topic and encouraged to do so more often. We have plenty of stupid eye candy car chase movies and murder mystery flicks for those who enjoy that stuff. Rapa Nui goes somewhere else entirely. The road less travelled as it were.Set on Easter Island isolated as it is literally thousands of nautical miles from its nearest neighbour the movie fleshes out the most pivital time in that islands history as we understand it from the archeological evidence available. The residents had every reason to believe they represented the only life in the universe. Those of the population with vision must have been appalled to watch their religeous zealots engineering the destruction of the only habitat in the world. The protagonist seems to be one of those who sees the folly and wants to prevent it. spoiler coming?I am not the first to note that this film weakens its message by allowing even fostering unintended humour at places where it is not appropriate. The head engineer of statue construction falling to the ground and flailing in a tantrum when the chief glibly states the statue carved and transported with many months of tremendous labour is dismissed and ordered broken up as being too small and that chief when he complains to his obviously self serving and manipulative with doctoradviserI've been coughing up and vomiting blood lately.

	onyx:emotionText "The studios should be applauded when they take on a movie that involves an all new setting and topic and encouraged to do so more often. We have plenty of stupid eye candy car chase movies and murder mystery flicks for those who enjoy that stuff. Rapa Nui goes somewhere else entirely. The road less travelled as it were.Set on Easter Island isolated as it is literally thousands of nautical miles from its nearest neighbour the movie fleshes out the most pivital time in that islands history as we understand it from the archeological evidence available. The residents had every reason to believe they represented the only life in the universe. Those of the population with vision must have been appalled to watch their religeous zealots engineering the destruction of the only habitat in the world. The protagonist seems to be one of those who sees the folly and wants to prevent it. spoiler coming?I am not the first to note that this film weakens its message by allowing even fostering unintended humour at places where it is not appropriate. The head engineer of statue construction falling to the ground and flailing in a tantrum when the chief glibly states the statue carved and transported with many months of tremendous labour is dismissed and ordered broken up as being too small and that chief when he complains to his obviously self serving and manipulative with doctoradviserI've been coughing up and vomiting blood lately.

I've never even seen a decent presentation of this just an HBO recording from VCR then an old pan and scan used rental VHS and then finally a slapdash foreign DVD rudimentary transfer. Apparently Warner Bros Archive has released what may be a slightly improved presentation. Yet nevertheless it is blatantly magnificient in every incarnation.

	schema:reviewBody "The inhabitants of Rapa Nui forged one of the great cultures of antiquity. They settled a small utterly remote island in the South Pacific and developed a unique centuriesold way of life known worldwide for creating monumental stone statues to evoke and venerate their ancestors. There is nothing like their astonishing achievement in the annals of civilization.Writerdirector Kevin Reynolds distorts and insults the noble heritage of this island and its proud people with this tawdry epic. RAPA NUI seizes on lurid mythsecocide internecine warfare starvation cannibalism and genocideto depict past life on the isolated isle as a dismal dogeatdog existence of bottomless despair and cruelty. Not so. To wit There is no archaeological evidence of cannibalism on Easter Island.The Long Ears and the Short Ears supposedly separate races or clans probably never existed and thus never engaged in genocidal warfare. On the contrary Rapanui society must have been highly cooperative to carve transport and erect the colossal statues as well as to cultivate crops given the island's harsh winds and challenging growing conditions.The infamous cutting down of the 16 million trees that originally covered the island was to clear space for agriculture and grazing. Once cut wood was put to many uses. Rolling the gigantic statues on logs was not the sole or main purpose of clearcutting which took place over centuries.The religiouspolitical cult of the birdman replaced the veneration of ancestors when the prodigious feat of making statues was no longer sustainable.

Why do they put up with brutality and suffering to make statues for the priestly class? How accommodating they are! The Long Ears' power rests on the religious imperative to appease the ancestral spirits. But such moral suasion hardly offers a compelling motive for the Short Ears' elective servitude.Rapa Nui's troubles are often regarded as a microcosm for the dangers of reckless exploitation of the environment. But the film's depiction of class struggle within an enclosed society with finite resources so lacks subtlety that it is hard to take seriously as a cautionary tale for today's world.This picture contains one of the most preposterous deus ex machinas in film history. Everyone on the island wants to escape to sail over the horizon to find a better happier land. Ah but there is no wood left to build boats. The answer for the delusional high priest and his gullible followers? Board an iceberg that suddenly appears.An iceberg.Really.At latitude 27 degrees southnearly tropical watersthey might just as well have found mermaids to carry them away.As for the cast the acting is on the seeandsay level. Everyone runs around in skimpy costumes which at least makes for eye candy. Only Gordon Hatfield as the heroine's father creates a character with some depth who appears to possess emotions beyond rage fear and longing. His performance is the best part of the film along with the birdman race which seems quite authentic except historically the race was over when the first sooty tern egg was found on the offshore islet. The finder did have to bring it back up the cliff intact but doing so was not part of the race.Despite being filmed entirely on location there's a sense of artificiality about the statues. The bogus meter starts running early withthe opening credits as the camera tracks up the cliffs of the Ranu Kau volcano to three statues nonexistent in real life standing high on the narrow crater rim. Ridiculous. That's the last place the islanders would ever have dragged them. Statues stood on low ground facing inland on wide platforms. These Hollywood replicas teeter on lofty heights gazing out to sea. Makes for a dramatic shot but absurd archaeology.Statues the Short Ears carve in the film look fake big props lacking the contours and color of the originals. When the biggest one is vengefully toppled the film cuts away the instant before it crashes.

	onyx:emotionText "The inhabitants of Rapa Nui forged one of the great cultures of antiquity. They settled a small utterly remote island in the South Pacific and developed a unique centuriesold way of life known worldwide for creating monumental stone statues to evoke and venerate their ancestors. There is nothing like their astonishing achievement in the annals of civilization.Writerdirector Kevin Reynolds distorts and insults the noble heritage of this island and its proud people with this tawdry epic. RAPA NUI seizes on lurid mythsecocide internecine warfare starvation cannibalism and genocideto depict past life on the isolated isle as a dismal dogeatdog existence of bottomless despair and cruelty. Not so. To wit There is no archaeological evidence of cannibalism on Easter Island.The Long Ears and the Short Ears supposedly separate races or clans probably never existed and thus never engaged in genocidal warfare. On the contrary Rapanui society must have been highly cooperative to carve transport and erect the colossal statues as well as to cultivate crops given the island's harsh winds and challenging growing conditions.The infamous cutting down of the 16 million trees that originally covered the island was to clear space for agriculture and grazing. Once cut wood was put to many uses. Rolling the gigantic statues on logs was not the sole or main purpose of clearcutting which took place over centuries.The religiouspolitical cult of the birdman replaced the veneration of ancestors when the prodigious feat of making statues was no longer sustainable. Statuecarving and the birdman race were not contemporaneous.Likewise the statues were not being toppled as they were simultaneously being manufactured. Probably 200 years passed between the end of statue production and deposing statues in clan rivalries.Okay viewers may not care about historical accuracy but just want some rousing entertainment.

	schema:reviewBody "Sherlock Holmes has appeared in hundreds of movies but to my knowledge Sherlock Holmes has only ever DIED onscreen just once. Paramount on Parade 1930 features a comedy sketch in which Sherlock Holmes and Philo Vance are murdered by Fu Manchu. The actor who got to die as Sherlock Holmes was Clive Brook who also played the title role in Sherlock Holmes 1932 ... which sounds like the first film in a series but which is actually a sequel to The Return of Sherlock Holmes 1929 ... which sounds like a sequel but isn't. Sherlock Holmes should have died in THIS movie instead.Clive Brook's version of Sherlock Holmes is certainly nontraditional. He sports a tweed cap and long side whiskers. Even worse is this movie's version of Doctor Watson played by an inept English actor named Henry ReevesSmith. His performance in this movie must be the absolute worst portrayal of Doctor Watson ever. The Return of Sherlock Holmes was filmed on claustrophobic soundstages at the Paramount studio in Astoria Queens ... and not for one instant do we believe we're in England. This film is set in the present day 1929 when Conan Doyle was still alive. Doyle gets a script credit but he didn't actually work on this awful and unSherlockian film.Doctor Watson's daughter! Mary is engaged to Roger Longmore played by neuroticlooking effeminate actor Phillips Holmes who can't act but certainly knows how to flare his nostrils. Roger is a reformed criminal who used to work for none other than Professor Moriarty. Sherlock's archnemesis Moriarty is played by an inept American actor named Harry T. Morey who apparently got the job because Harry T. Morey sounds like Moriarty pronounced sideways he brings nothing else to this role. Conveniently Roger has a piece of paper printed on McGuffin stationery which contains the evidence exposing Moriarty's criminal dealings. Of course Moriarty wants the piece of paper. Of course Sherlock Holmes is sworn to stop him. Somehow Holmes Watson Moriarty Colonel Moran Watson's daughter uncle Tom Cobley and the piece of paper all end up aboard a transatlantic steamship. Meanwhile Roger Longmore has got himself murdered. Phillips Holmes is more convincing during the brief scene in which he plays a corpse than in the longer scenes in which he impersonates a living human being.Whilst he's investigating the murder of Watson's wouldbe soninlaw Holmes Sherlock not Phillips wears two different disguises on shipboard impersonating a German magician and a Cockney steward. I kept hoping Sherlock would get his disguises mixed up and he would impersonate a German steward and a Cockney magician.This movie is full of gimmicks gadgets and gizmos which might be appropriate for James Bond or Craig Kennedy or the Shadow but which simply don't belong in a Sherlock Holmes movie. Sherlock applies glowinthedark paint to Moran's boots so he can follow his footprints. Moriarty murders his victims with a cigarettecase containing a poisontipped needle. Which makes this the first Hollywood movie to admit that cigarettes CAN kill you. Quick Watson the needle!The absurdity reaches its nadir in a scene on board the steamship when Holmes and Moriarty sit down to dinner together all veddy sophisticated eh wot? I kept hoping one of the sailors would shout Iceberg right ahead! and this whole shipload would go down with all hands.This movie is rather dire without ever reaching the delirious depths of ineptitude that would make it bad enough to be hilarious. It mayn't be the worst Sherlock Holmes movie ever but it certainly comes close.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Man's River is a spaghetti western movie which I chose based on Lee Van Cleef being on the cover  I'm not a massive western fan but even I recognised Van Cleef as a fairly famous actor in the genre. Unfortunately this did not equate into a good movie. Van Cleef is I assume the character for the title song He's the baddest man in Bad Man's River where virtue is a sin.Does this movie have a good plot? No. It involves a complicated process of blowing things up and stealing a bank cheque but seems to revolve largely around Alicia  played by Gina Lollobrigida  who marries men and betrays them but for some reason they never think she'll do it again. I mean seriously after the third time a woman has sold you down the river to death or worse you've pretty much only yourself to blame if it happens again  and it does.However if we ignore the shoddy plot we have to ask ourselves if we're left with a good action movie. We ask that question and we receive a negative answer. I'm a keen believer in suspending disbelief in movies...you have to go with the flow and accept what the directors are trying to do. Yet there is a limit. This limit was not reached when the good buys never missed a shot and the bad guys aimed for the feet and never got a hit  even with a submachine gun  but the limit was reached and passed and left eating dust when a protagonist would fire his gun twice and four men would fall over. And who knew that a cheap mattress would provide better cover from bullets than an inch of solid oak? It's impossible to suspend disbelief for this movie the plot is appalling and the acting stilted. I rate it A bullet to the head. Oh one protagonist gets shot. At least he falls against a wall clutching his arm or shoulder or chest or something. It doesn't slow him down though in fact it doesn't even bleed.".

No. It involves a complicated process of blowing things up and stealing a bank cheque but seems to revolve largely around Alicia  played by Gina Lollobrigida  who marries men and betrays them but for some reason they never think she'll do it again. I mean seriously after the third time a woman has sold you down the river to death or worse you've pretty much only yourself to blame if it happens again  and it does.However if we ignore the shoddy plot we have to ask ourselves if we're left with a good action movie. We ask that question and we receive a negative answer. I'm a keen believer in suspending disbelief in movies...you have to go with the flow and accept what the directors are trying to do. Yet there is a limit. This limit was not reached when the good buys never missed a shot and the bad guys aimed for the feet and never got a hit  even with a submachine gun  but the limit was reached and passed and left eating dust when a protagonist would fire his gun twice and four men would fall over. And who knew that a cheap mattress would provide better cover from bullets than an inch of solid oak? It's impossible to suspend disbelief for this movie the plot is appalling and the acting stilted. I rate it A bullet to the head. Oh one protagonist gets shot. At least he falls against a wall clutching his arm or shoulder or chest or something. It doesn't slow him down though in fact it doesn't even bleed.";

Waldo de los Rios' easy listening score is bizarre at best and the Led Zeppelin style song performed by Jade Warrior during an otherwise atmospheric scene is completely inappropriate and terrible regardless. However it must be said that Bad Man's River is an extremely attractive film and the widely available Master Movies DVD is one of the better budget line discs you'll run across. Cinematographer Alejandro Ulloa clearly spent a lot of time on his set ups and some of the footageespecially the riverboat sequencesare superb. Additionally the action sequences are plentiful and quite well lensed. Bad Man's River is certainly a minor spaghetti but as long as you can see it in widescreen you'll be pleasantly surprised and reasonably entertained.".

In the beginning the movie is decidedly annoying with too many dopey songs and Martin overdoing it on use of freeze frames. While it's appreciable that Martin and Yordan were going for irreverence they make things just a little too silly.Adequate action sequences help and the filmmaking is technically fairly slick. There are some fun gags especially right at the start when two men are inside a bank vault.Lollobrigida and her costar Diana Lorys are fine scenery attractions and the former plays such a conniving character that she helps to keep things interesting.

It's a treat to see him in this kind of setting and he gives the story a real shot in the arm.The exemplary cast of familiar faces also includes Aldo Sambrell Lone Fleming Eduardo Fajardo and Sergio Fantoni.Admittedly if one is looking for a Lee Van Cleef fix they could do a lot better than this but Bad Man's River delivers some undemanding fun for 92 minutes.Six out of 10.".

Besieged and under fire from the Mexican army the rebel general is forced to offer King and his gang freedom if they can pull the rebel side through. And I only know that basic outline 'cause it's given in a slightly more in depth form on the packaging...Like I say Bad Man's River is unquestionably awful. It's simply not even worth seeing as a curiosity piece. I bought it in a 2 for 10 sale and now consider that to have been a waste of money.

	schema:headline " I got some really bad news for you. This movie is really bad man!";
	schema:reviewBody "Bad habits are hard to die hard for Lee Van Cleef. Once again he starred in a really horrible movie. Directed by Gene Martin AKA Eugenio Martn this eurowestern film also known as Hunt the Man down or Four Mercenaries from El Paso is a mess. The movie tells the story of bandit Roy King Lee Van Cleef and his gang. They were hired by a mysterious wealthy man Montero James Mason to blow up a Mexican Army munitions stockpile in Mexico using a luxury riverboat as a base of operations. The only problem is that they were lured into a bigger scheme that digs them even deeper into the troubles of the Mexican revolution. Can Roy King and his group dig themselves out of this hole or will the problems of this job become too much for them to handle? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the movie I think I would have more respect for this film if the movie flown right. Don't get me wrong the movie could had work with all the doublecrossing and twist turns but it got really annoying with all the repetitive. Seeing these dummies get duped time and time again got frustrated pretty fast. All the men in this film are portray as cartoony idiots! The main character that Lee Van Cleef plays is supposed to be smart and clever. Yet he even dumb himself down by marry a woman he only knew a few hours in the opening scene? Come on! Who does that! It didn't help that music that came with this film claims that Lee Van Cleef's character is supposed to be the meanest and scariest of the badmen of the old west! All we see as the audience is Ron King being afraid and goofing off. The worst twist had to be toward the end when the schemes stop making sense. The last twist comes out of nowhere and felt so damn confusing. The movie gets dumber when it comes to the music. Bad Man's River has a godawful soundtrack mixed with silly Barber shop quartet songs  out of place rock music by Jade Warrior. It's completely wrong. It doesn't match the Spaghetti Western feel at all. Another problem with the film is the way it was filmed. The dark blue color picture montage of Lee Van Cleef's face during the opening was really hard to see. I can barely notice what the picture slideshow was showing. The film quality is so washed out and faded. It gets worst as the movie starts to use freeze frame excessive! I really thought there was something wrong with my DVD copy at first! I thought the dish was skipping frames but I find out later that the film was doing this on purpose. I don't get why the director would chose to do this! It really ruins the feel of the film! Thank God it's only in the first bits of the film. Still the movie does have some bad editing chops toward the middle of the end that's hard not to notice. The pacing is a bit off as well. The movie starts out with a bank robbery being successful and the movie plays it off as if it was finishing up. It really seem like the movie is already over. Then somewhat Ron King end up in a mental asylum only for it to blow up minutes later! I know it's supposed to tell us that King has escape but it seem like he got killed by the explosion since the film doesn't show him escaping! Anyways the movie jumps around for the rest of the film from locations in both US  Mexico. Despite the locations haven't no rivers near it a steam boat somewhat connection them together. Honestly I don't know how Lee Van Cleef  his gang were able to move around so quick. It's really puzzling how they even got on the boat. Nothing about the boat's speed makes logically sense. I guess the boat is able to travel both quickly  slow. The movie really push the runtime to its limits due to this. There are lots of slow moments with barely any good humor or action. The movie has this weird cartoony feel to its action. Good guys are able to kill multiply bad guys while bad guys aimed for the feet and seem like they can't even hit. Even with a submachine gun no less! It's really impossible to suspend disbelief for this movie when a sixshooter is able to shot more than six bullets at a time! I really hate the moment when one of the villains receiving a cannon shot to his face and only appears scorched like a Looney Toon cartoon. It really makes this film appalling to watch! No wonder why James Mason feels so embarrassed taking this role. The acting is very stilted due to the awful dialogue given. It's clear that the audio English dubbing doesn't match the lips any more. While this movie is bad it's not the worst Lee Van Cleef's film I saw. He was somewhat alright in this film. I like that he cover his toupet with a bowler hat. James Mason looks like he's isn't have fun like Cleef. He looks so miserable being there. Eduardo Fajardo Sergio Fantoni  Aldo Sambrell as the villains were all funny at times. By far the worst character in the film had to be Alicia Gina Lollobrigida. I really don't get how the men in the film were able to stand her. Her acting was over the top. While her character is a bitch. The actress that played her was indeed a sexy sex symbol! Overall This movie belong in the 1 dollar bargain bins. I just glad I don't have to watch this movie ever again. Thank God all bad things must do come to an end.".

They were hired by a mysterious wealthy man Montero James Mason to blow up a Mexican Army munitions stockpile in Mexico using a luxury riverboat as a base of operations. The only problem is that they were lured into a bigger scheme that digs them even deeper into the troubles of the Mexican revolution. Can Roy King and his group dig themselves out of this hole or will the problems of this job become too much for them to handle? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the movie I think I would have more respect for this film if the movie flown right. Don't get me wrong the movie could had work with all the doublecrossing and twist turns but it got really annoying with all the repetitive. Seeing these dummies get duped time and time again got frustrated pretty fast. All the men in this film are portray as cartoony idiots! The main character that Lee Van Cleef plays is supposed to be smart and clever. Yet he even dumb himself down by marry a woman he only knew a few hours in the opening scene? Come on! Who does that! It didn't help that music that came with this film claims that Lee Van Cleef's character is supposed to be the meanest and scariest of the badmen of the old west! All we see as the audience is Ron King being afraid and goofing off. The worst twist had to be toward the end when the schemes stop making sense. The last twist comes out of nowhere and felt so damn confusing. The movie gets dumber when it comes to the music. Bad Man's River has a godawful soundtrack mixed with silly Barber shop quartet songs  out of place rock music by Jade Warrior. It's completely wrong. It doesn't match the Spaghetti Western feel at all. Another problem with the film is the way it was filmed. The dark blue color picture montage of Lee Van Cleef's face during the opening was really hard to see. I can barely notice what the picture slideshow was showing. The film quality is so washed out and faded. It gets worst as the movie starts to use freeze frame excessive! I really thought there was something wrong with my DVD copy at first! I thought the dish was skipping frames but I find out later that the film was doing this on purpose. I don't get why the director would chose to do this! It really ruins the feel of the film! Thank God it's only in the first bits of the film. Still the movie does have some bad editing chops toward the middle of the end that's hard not to notice. The pacing is a bit off as well. The movie starts out with a bank robbery being successful and the movie plays it off as if it was finishing up. It really seem like the movie is already over. Then somewhat Ron King end up in a mental asylum only for it to blow up minutes later! I know it's supposed to tell us that King has escape but it seem like he got killed by the explosion since the film doesn't show him escaping! Anyways the movie jumps around for the rest of the film from locations in both US  Mexico. Despite the locations haven't no rivers near it a steam boat somewhat connection them together. Honestly I don't know how Lee Van Cleef  his gang were able to move around so quick. It's really puzzling how they even got on the boat. Nothing about the boat's speed makes logically sense. I guess the boat is able to travel both quickly  slow. The movie really push the runtime to its limits due to this. There are lots of slow moments with barely any good humor or action. The movie has this weird cartoony feel to its action. Good guys are able to kill multiply bad guys while bad guys aimed for the feet and seem like they can't even hit. Even with a submachine gun no less! It's really impossible to suspend disbelief for this movie when a sixshooter is able to shot more than six bullets at a time! I really hate the moment when one of the villains receiving a cannon shot to his face and only appears scorched like a Looney Toon cartoon. It really makes this film appalling to watch! No wonder why James Mason feels so embarrassed taking this role. The acting is very stilted due to the awful dialogue given. It's clear that the audio English dubbing doesn't match the lips any more. While this movie is bad it's not the worst Lee Van Cleef's film I saw. He was somewhat alright in this film. I like that he cover his toupet with a bowler hat. James Mason looks like he's isn't have fun like Cleef. He looks so miserable being there. Eduardo Fajardo Sergio Fantoni  Aldo Sambrell as the villains were all funny at times. By far the worst character in the film had to be Alicia Gina Lollobrigida. I really don't get how the men in the film were able to stand her. Her acting was over the top. While her character is a bitch. The actress that played her was indeed a sexy sex symbol! Overall This movie belong in the 1 dollar bargain bins. I just glad I don't have to watch this movie ever again. Thank God all bad things must do come to an end.";

	schema:reviewBody "Wow did the soundtrack for this film stink...and I mean STINK! Imagine if the same person who scored some of the old RankinBass Christmas specials got together with a guy who produces elevator musicthat's what the music from this film sounds like! The horrible lyrics and music are completely wrong for an Italian Spaghetti Westernand are about as far removed from the great Ennio Morricone who scored all the greatest films of the genre scores as you can get. It's full of weird Lawrence Welkstyle singing weird European rock and whatever else they felt like haphazardly chucking into it. And sadly music is one of the biggest reasons you'd want to see one of these Italian westerns in the first place. Because of this I nominate this film for the most godawful soundtrack in film history. If there's a worse one I'd love to hear about it! Another big reason to see the films is the incredibly tough characters and style. This film stars the meanest and scariest of the badmen Lee Van Cleef. Yet inexplicably they decided to make this one a bit of a comedy!!! Lee Van Cleef in a western comedy?! That makes about as much sense as Richard Nixon becoming one of the backup singers for Diana Ross!! Van Cleef should NEVER EVER be in a comedy.The rest of the cast apart from the noname Italians who play most of the minor roles is pretty odd as well. None other than James Mason costars a guy who seemed totally out of place in the genre and sported a weird accent to say the least. And looking quite fetching Italian star Gina Lollobrigida.So at the outset this film had some pretty substantial strikes against it. Could the rest of the film overcome this goofiness?! Well not really. While there were a few good moments too much emphasis on bad comedy that fell flat was the film's undoing. One of the worst scenes that was supposed to be funny was the scene where the bad guys came to talk to the Federale commander and then began throwing dynamite aboutit was sloppy impossible to believe and not the lest bit entertaining. Overall a bad film that just didn't work the plot never gels and is clearly among the least interesting Italian westerns I've ever seen. Thank you Eugenio Martin for putting the BAD in Bad Man's River!".

The unlikely pairing of Van Cleef  Lollobrigida actually works well but Mason is miscast in his relatively small role. Director Gene Martin keeps the pace moving briskly. This is a spaghetti western with a real sense of humor. A fun comic western marred by some really insipid faux country rock ballads thrown into an otherwise fine incidental music score.

	schema:reviewBody "Probably the most influential of Robert Bresson's trio of masterpieces from the Fifties the other two being A Man Escaped and of course Diary of a Country Priest. Pickpocket sowed its seeds of influence in the minds of any number of film artists  JeanPierre Melville most notably who despised Bresson apparently whose Le Samourai was a mighty struggle against this film . . . and most completely writerdirector Paul Schrader who you'll recall wrote the Taxi Driver screenplay which was another story about a loner on the outside of societal norms. And it goes without saying that Schrader's American Gigolo which he also directed is a virtual rewrite of Pickpocket right down to the egregiously plagiarized finale.The subject of Bresson's film is not nearly as sexy a conception as Schrader's gigolo though the milieu is equally as sleazy. Instead of preening Richard Gere we get acting novice Martin LaSalle as the Pickpocket who wears one suit through the entire film. Schrader obviously thought he was being clever by giving Gere a large closet stuffed with designer suits. LaSalle lives in a crumbly walkup flat in Paris where his books gather dust and the baseboards hide his humble stash of francs and the occasional wristwatch. He has few friends and is too ashamed to visit his dying mother I won't spoil the reason why. The only pleasure he derives is from his compulsive work as a pickpocket and it is in these scenes that Bresson stuns us with his martinet control of both narrative pacing and camera placement. The director lovingly shows us the subtle skills of the street thief the creeping hands the splitsecond scams such as lifting a wallet from a man's suit breastpocket while standing next to him and pretending to read a newspaper the choreographed celerity of movement when the thief works with his partners in crime. There's one sequence that follows LaSalle and his two accomplices from a train station all the way to the train in which they lift about 15 wallets and the occasional purse. The camerawork and editing here is nothing less than sheer mastery  a ballet of thievery. And let it also be said that Bresson is no slouch when it comes to suspense. It's an intimate and sweaty suspense will LaSalle's fingers as they slowly reach into a purse be noticed?As might be expected from a French director of the period there's also plenty of philosophizing to be found here and in this case the philosophy is actually pretty interesting. The movie takes as its intellectual parents the ubermensch riff by Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. LaSalle asks the cop who's on his trail if society's supermen even if they choose to be thieves should not only be let alone but even respected as an overall benefit to society. Thus sprach Kenneth Lay! Obviously we can mull that over ourselves but in the meantime Bresson is not particularly impressed with the decent elements of society. The cop is a pompous blowhard who can offer LaSalle no alternative to his criminality. Bresson is more or less saying that modern society is contemptible your acceptance of that thesis and the importance you place on the occasional 100 francs getting lifted from an overfed bourgeois will ultimately determine your acceptance of this film.But perhaps its style will bog you down. As per usual Bresson breaks virtually every rule of the movies. The use of nonactors in the main roles engenders both assets and liabilities while the avoidance of the typical actors' nonsense is a definite asset the liabilities occur when Bresson asks his interpreters to finally well act. There are a few scenes here where the incompetence of LaSalle he eventually became a fine actor but he was virtually plucked off the street by Bresson in 1958 will make you cringe especially when LaSalle is supposed to be angry with someone. There IS something to be said for professionals  even professional actors. And if none of this puts you off perhaps Bresson's perverse narrative style  including scenes in which a character writes down on a piece of paper the following narrative action to be followed by the character READING what he has just written down and climaxed by the character DOING just what he wrote and said he was going to do  will make you scratch your head and mutter something about the arty pretensions of French directors.And your comments would certainly be justified in Bresson's later productions. But in Pickpocket I feel the narrative precision lack of bloat the movie is 75 minutes long and broader philosophical questions coalesce into a stringent masterpiece that must finally win your respect. Besides you gotta love a movie about a pickpocket who never bothers to lock or even close his own front door. See? Bresson can even be funny.8 stars out of 10.".

Very  but I don't like it to be lone !!It would be hard for a regular moviewatcher  some one who just watches for fun  to like the movies made by formalist  strictly stylist director  Robert Bresson . But when we are aware of his elaborate work and subtlety  we admire his skill  undoubtedly .Pickpocket  1959   is one his best and most thoughtful films and has a key role in recognizing both Bresson and his works .Pickpocket is about an alone and desperate writer who think of himself as a superior to the society  He thinks he is better than others and believes to be in the right of breaking the rules and neglecting the social Contract .He defines justice for himself as  some people have the privilege to break the laws  willingly  . He feels humiliated to do regular jobs and thus  begins pocket picking .And from one of the most basic elements of the story  i.e. main character  there is a gap  a distance  between us  audience  and the film . In fact  because of nonnaturalistic quality of the plot  we can't sympathize with him  and what makes him even more distant  is the Bresson's personal touch and fond of deadpan acting and not showing emotions  . Bresson says himself that  if possible  he prefers to utilize an image  a sound  and any other elements  and metaphors  instead of actors  . He wants the actors  as a matter of fact he uses nonprofessional actors after his second movie  to act deliberately and be aware of a witness called camera . In other words he wants them  not to act  .In this movie  the cast and specially the hero are totally flat and expressionless  even his walking style is sort of flat . But we can't reject his way of acting  in fact  not acting  . There is a deep coldness in this style of performance which makes it surprisingly and paradoxically acceptable and fits well in the world of the movie  particularly  sympathetic face of the main character which increases contributes in this plausibility .The cinematography  lighting and playing with shadows and lights in this movie is truly delicate and these factors in addition to a cold open and sort of suspension  forms the idea of a thriller movie . Yes ! Suspension is a key factor here  and not a regular kind of suspension  but a Bresson type .Even  some think that sound editing in this movie  decrease the suspension in some scenes and increase it in some other scenes . For example  in some occasions  a sound or noise  inform us of the occurrence of an incident  or repeating a sound in another scene can mitigate the effect of suspension . Also there is a scene in which the main character is walking anxiously in a crowded sidewalk  we can not hear the sounds  the street noise and even the cars  the only sound is his footsteps  which makes suspension .It is true that use of music is not considerable in this film  but we can't renounce the sound effects here .Another point is that Bresson never lets the main character to show fear and anxiety  unlike Hitchcock who loves to do so   instead he depends on images and sounds to supply the fear  sound of footsteps  images of shaking hands and cold faces  the opening scene   door handle turned quietly  and actually anything .There are some references to Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment  like the basic similarities between the heroes  Michel and Raskolnikov who both tend to commit crimes  both being lonely and isolated  and even the hole behind Michel's bed he use to hide the stolen valuable goods  like Dostoyevsky's hero  . Knowing these references  is a suspension itself  some kind of fear .Yes ! most of the times  we don't have music  the music remains silent  and waits   something unusual in those days of filmmaking   yet  this small appearance of music  is fitting and timely . There is no such a thing as spare scenes or excess dialog in this movie  everything is in its right place and for those who can't comprehend the non naturalistic structure of the film  and can not accept fears  anxiety  and emotional disturbances of this cold hero  Bresson arranges the famous final scene in which the main character redeems through love  with music !! Now  let us come back to the QA we had at the beginning of this article  we see Bresson  lonely like the hero of his film  selfconsciously tries to break the rules  another kind of rules   and has a style of his own  !

It is hard to appreciate this dimension of the film at first. But after seeing some extras from the excellent Criterion package I was able to understand better. How Bresson actually committed to cause these emotions in the viewer how he reshot several times various scenes until the actors just repeated their lines until no trait of emotions were left. Michel's narration voiceover is flat plain. These were nonprofessional actors set to work in a nonstandard way Bresson's way.

Michel lives alone in a garret in Paris with his books and his questions about whether certain superior people should be above the law. He seems to have answered that question in the affirmative for himself since he decides to be a professional pickpocket.

If the opening and closing of doors interests you the camera often lingers on a closed door or dwells on the entry to a doorway then you may like this. There is not enough about Michel to have kept my interest. He appeared to be devoted to his chosen profession in fact addicted to it but he was repelled by it at the same time. His behavior is paradoxical in many other ways. He claims to love his mother dearly but refuses to see her. The final scene came as quite a surprise to this ignorant viewer since Michel was so distant from his mother's young neighbor that I had not gotten the hint that he actually loved her nor she him as far as that goes. My reaction to the final scene was Huh?There is some interesting camera work but the cinematography is pedestrian except for certain highlights like when Michel comes down the stairs and emerges from darkness into light in stages. The details of how pickpockets work are interesting and those scenes provide pretty much the only action. Is Bresson trying to show us what a movie would be like if you take away most of the qualities unique to the art form?I would advise skipping the introduction by Paul Shrader on the Criterion Collection DVD until after you have seen the movie since he summarizes the entire film complete with clips including the final scene.There are those who venerate this film and I say more power to them but the value for me was only to expand my understanding of existential despair. However if that was the goal then I suppose I would have to give a higher rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Bresson's Pickpocket has many great moments even as it didn't quite do it for me on a first viewing as a 'masterpiece'some have said to see it twice perhaps I will. Bresson's use of the camera is often intoxicating in the most subdued subtle indirect distinctions at times it does take on the prowess of literature. But my only minor nitpick with the film is that it leaves a sort of cold viewing on a viewer with such simplicity and emotions stripped from the characters that it's hard to connect. And yet this is really made up tenfold with the sort of style that can be likely called Bressonian straightforward angles tense medium closeups serene editing and little to no music. Whatever it sets up for this actor to do it sets up well. Indeed the actor who plays the protagonist here is actually very good aside from the disconnection and provides an excellent way for us to get along his side. He is a decent person but there are certain things that get to him which is why he feels he must steal. At times I almost had a grin as he made some successful grabs by himself or his cohorts. Was I rooting for him or just pleased by the payoff of Bresson's suspense? Maybe both there is definitely one truly virtuoso sequence in the film when the pickpockets go on the train.Like A Man Escaped there is that sort of dissection quietly and without really digging too deep into what a man wants with his life or doesn't want. While the hero has only one determination in Man Escaped to get out Pickpocket has a man who doesn't know what to do with himself only coming to a genuine catharsis behind bars. I think I like Pickpocket a little more but I may like it even more on another viewing.".

When I said that Kassagi who plays first accomplice 1er complice was a 'reallife pickpocket who served as the film's technical consultant' I was not only inaccurate but the fact that Kassagi was actually a stage magician has some bearing on the film itself for although the scene in which the pickpockets rip off a series of train passengers is authentic in that it shows how pickpockets operate in terms of teamwork and speed nevertheless the moment when Kassagi ? 'neatly replaces the lightened wallet back in a man's pocket' is not something a real pickpocket would likely do it is however exactly what a stage magician would do. A real pickpocket has no audience or so he hopes whereas a magician wants the audience to see him make a monkey of the hapless volunteer from the audience. In this case Kassagi's idea as I am sure it was provides a brief moment of comic relief in the middle of a movie that is otherwise without a lot of humor. It is a welcome touch and Bresson was wise to keep it in. Now I also engaged in a fallacy when I said that 'American pickpockets traditionally prefer to steal from behind to avoid any chance of a mark seeing their faces.' In reality American pickpockets take from behind because of necessity even by 1959 when 'Pickpocket was released American men more and more carried their wallets in the hip pocket whereas European men as can be seen in this film continued to use the inside breast pocket. While the business about seeing the mark's face is part of the lore of American petty criminals it is not the cause of the American style of picking pockets but rather a rationalization after the fact.".

It would keep the City of Lights ablaze. Someone else suggested that France has three religions Catholicism Protestantism and Atheism. I wonder if the two proposals aren't in some way congruent. Look at it this way. The whole purpose of religion is to keep you feeling guilty enough to support it. The Atheists don't have that kind of guilt so they feel guilty about not having it. And all that existential spontaneity? Pure denial. Is it any wonder that Sartre bit his nails? I'd never seen any of Robert Bresson's work though I'd often seen it referred to and I was a little wary of watching this one. I thought it would turn out to be some highbrow allegory with no picking of pockets at all just a mutual picking of equally gloomy minds and all of it taking place in the rain.But actually Michel LaSalle is really a pickpocket. He's alienated from everyone else lives alone in a crummy flat visits his dying mother only reluctantly. He makes what I think is called a distant acquaintance of an alluring neighbor Marika Green who is tending Michel's mother out of compassion.Michel falls in with a couple of other pickpockets and there are several close ups of hands lifting wallets and unsnapping watches and slipping them into a confederate's pocket. The confederates aren't friends. They don't smile or laugh. Nobody laughs. They silently go about their routines like the pod people in Invasion of the Body Snatchers or guests at a Seder hosted by Lutherans.Michel has already been caught once by the cops who release him with a warning but they continue to taunt him following him around trapping him finally at a race track. At one point the Chief Inspector Jean Pelegri visits Michel and tells him the story of a boy who went bad. Who was it? Why it was you replies the inspector.Well Michel is a skinny sensitivelooking young guy who tortures himself over his criminal acts reads books and he and his neighbors are very poor and in other ways the endoskeleton of Crime and Punishment shows through the jailhouse pallor of the story. But that's okay.Still all the way through I kept trying to imagine how Michel with no other source of income except what he picks off others in public and what he earlier stole from his own mother could subsist at all especially after he starts having to split the take three ways with his two colleagues about whom he knows nothing of importance. I mean you can't WEAR half a dozen watches on your wrist. You have to hock them or fence them right? And then you get ten centimes on the dollar? And how much can you make lifting wallets from strangers on the Metro even if you're good at it? To prove it's a difficult way to make a living I now extract my own wallet from my right rear trouser pocket not from the easily picked breast pockets that Michel keeps sliding his fingertips in and how much do I have? Let me see. Eightytwo dollars! Wait a minute. Is this somebody ELSE'S wallet? Nope. Wow. Must have cashed a big check lately. You'll have to take my word for it that the usual amount only infrequently runs to double digits.The Introduction tells us that this movie is not a policier which the subtitles translate as thriller but a story of two souls finding each other. One soul of course is Michel. The other is Marika Green as Jeanne. Now Marika Green has the face  the cherubic lips and large bright eyes  of one of those oldfashioned dolls made of porcelain. Any man would happily throw himself at her feet and grovel though I'm not sure about Michel. But boy if this romance is supposed to be the heart of the story it is very clumsily handled. It's anything but organic. The two have exchanged only a few words before and I don't think they've ever touched yet at the end they go into a clinch and there is a big smooch. Maybe it's an existential act.Anyway if I tried hard enough I could find plenty of covert messages behind this slow dullish and rather uninvolving movie. But I'd never be sure I wasn't committing the Texas sharpshooter fallacy seeing clusters of meaning where none exist.In an introduction to the Criterion Edition Paul Schrader lauds the film because it violates the viewer's expectations regarding editing plot facial expressions emotional involvement and so forth. The usual movie conventions are discarded. He must have loved Andy Warhol's Empire which is a single shot of the Empire State Building from early evening until nearly 3 am the next day more than eight hours long. That'll violate your expectations for you.Worth watching once if only because it's widely recognized as an important film.".

Indeed the actors and actress express no sentiments and the plot is very weird. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Pickpocket";

It's a minimalist masterpiece only kiarostami's 10 has taken a step onwards and stripped cinema even closer to its essentials which has more than one moment of transcendence through a decisive act breaking the compulsive repetition felt both by protagonist and audience. the only point i have to add is that i found it very hard to stop comparing it to crime and punishment american gigolo and taxi driver. It's incredible how bresson makes the lesser crime of stealing seem just as immoral as a brutal murder and the film is sufficiently cinematic and different from its obvious thematic source that it is incomparable to dostoyevsky's novel which happens to be my favourite book. However i think the combination of schrader's identification with and admiration for both bresson and the russian master when combined the psychological mastery of scorsese and the uniformly excellent acting of taxi driver make it the better film. Is this perhaps because it gives the audience more sensation and therefore more to react to than pickpocket? In this it is closer in tone and style to crime and punishment and notes from the underground and also perfectly encapsulated a period of time and social mentality just as dostoyevsky did. however these points are largely irrelevant for without pickpocket these links would not exist and without bresson cinema would have been severely impoverished.".

	schema:reviewBody "A filmed adaptation of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment that not only fails to add anything to the interpretation of the source material but also fails to accomplish anything remotely interesting cinematically. Aside from the standard ideas of the new wave Bresson's main concept is the use of his cast not as actors but as models. He thought that classical Hollywood acting was histrionic and stagey and therefore uncinematic. What Bresson didn't get is that naturalist acting is not having your actors woodenly recite their lines and then stare at the floor. Also it doesn't help that the dialogue is plain awful. Maybe it's just the English subtitles that are bad but most of the dialogue sounds more like something from a second rate existentialist play than a realist film. Crime and Punishment hinges on Raskolnikov's detached dreamlike state throughout the book. The film however attempts to give the main character the same motivations as Raskolnikov without communicating his mania in any way. Taken alone without considering the source material the motivation for Michel's actions is totally incomprehensible.Pickpocket is notable mostly for terrible photography except in the train sequence mannequinlike acting and poor pacing that fails in less then an hour and a half to have half as much dramatic momentum as a six hundred page novel. A failed experiment.".

To those who are not professional film historians you should be aware that this is not a crime drama in any sense of the genre and really not a drama. That's because there is no attempt no attempt to have a plot. Pickpocket is an expression of pure naturalism in film. People simply are. There are no visible emotions no interaction no dramatic tension. There is only beautiful camera workthe loving caress of 35mm black and white touching the fascinating surface of Paris in the late 1950's. There are also endless lessons in how professional pickpockets operate...enough to scare you into hiding your traveling money in one of those weird tourist belt things! The film really belongs in a museum and I know that film lovers much more aesthetically attuned than I appreciate it as though it were a museum masterpiece. That's fine. But if you rent it or buy it in DVD or video thinking you're going to see one of those classic noirinspired late 50's French crime films you will be bored out of your mind waiting for the plot to happen.

	schema:headline " Pickpocket";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the things that sets humans apart from other species besides the thumb is their ego and the way it makes an individual usually a man believe he can rise above all the others by blazing a path of his own. Robert Bresson's masterwork tells the story of such a man. Although it's a movie that's easy to watch but difficult to like it certainly is memorable for the way it makes a seemingly indifferent person stick in the back of your head.The film's main character is Michel a regular looking guy who lives on his own in a small room full of books and dust. He's a loner and his only close contact is his pal Jacques. He has a soft spot for his mother but he avoids meeting with her face to face leaving her care to the hands of her beautiful young neighbor Jeanne. Michel wants to make something of himself but thinks he is too smart to follow the standard average procedures in life. He believes a man who is skilled enough to cheat without being caught should be rewarded by society. Here is a man who desperately wants to prove something not to himself his cleancut buddy or even some smart cop but to the women in his life his mother the one he's in debt to and Jeanne the one whose love he has to earn. He firmly believes in his right to skip the rules so he tries a type of crime through which he can outsmart them picking pockets. His first time gets him caught but it gives him pleasure the way he approaches his victim and works his way into her purse. Michel's facial expression may be almost nonexistent but between the act and the arrest he confesses feelings of superiority unknown to him before. After he's released due to inadequate proof Michel is right back on the wrong track trying to learn all the tricks of the trade and practicing with religious zeal to make his hands quick and agile.A while later a master pickpocket spots his talent and recruits him for his gang. In a tightly choreographed scene Bresson shows his admiration for the art of emptying people's pockets as an ensemble. The gang of three almost rips off a whole train before stepping out while in a rare humorous moment Michel puts an empty wallet back to the pocket where he took it from a minute before. But he's not so special anymore the other two being even more skillful than he is so when they are caught on the act he quickly leaves Paris in his sole logical decision of the whole film. This is probably the moment when Michel loses that arrogance that kept him so focused all along. After two successful years as a crook abroad he returns home. Almost accidentally as he puts it he falls in front of Jeanne's door. Earlier on he asks Jeanne if she believes all people will be judged. She says yes so he follows his question with another one Judged how? According to laws? What laws? But now Michel craves to be judged. By the laws cause he has to and by Jeanne cause he needs her acceptance.Bresson's underlying theme of redemption through selfaccusation and punishment for even daring to think bigger than you're allowed to is an obvious reference to Christianity since the director was known to be religious. But if you see it in a different light it's simply universally human. A man is not only afraid of failure but often enough he gets horrorchills from the very thought of success and the loneliness that goes with it Michel couldn't care less about losing to the system as long as he knows there may be no real point in winning after all. After going along with his vices the only thing that makes sense is coming back to another human being's warmth. That a smart cop sees through him early on gives him a sense of security rather than fear. It's a way out of his microcosm proof he still exists within the real world which he uses as an escape door when he decides to return there for Jeanne.As for the popular assumption of the sexuality beneath Michel's interaction with his victims and his peers it's an overplayed clich a case of wanting to see something so much it's bound to appear. The way I see it  every accomplishment or moment of tension potentially provides a substitute for sexual satisfaction. Michel watches a master pickpocket at work with admiration and discovers the other members of the caste he dreams about. It's got to be fulfilling at least before it all blows back to his face.Bresson's actors are nonprofessional. Plus they're overworked and it shows. Obviously the master wanted it that way to let the story be told by movements rather than expressions. Whether we like it or not it works minus a few moments of abnormal inertia. The dialogue is minimal and the firstperson narration provides information about the central character without overexplaining. In the end behind bars a redeemed Michel wonders Jeanne to reach you at last what a strange path I had to take. There are times in life when it's not the trip but the destination that counts most. Unfortunately that trip is usually inevitable.".

	onyx:emotionText "One of the things that sets humans apart from other species besides the thumb is their ego and the way it makes an individual usually a man believe he can rise above all the others by blazing a path of his own. Robert Bresson's masterwork tells the story of such a man. Although it's a movie that's easy to watch but difficult to like it certainly is memorable for the way it makes a seemingly indifferent person stick in the back of your head.The film's main character is Michel a regular looking guy who lives on his own in a small room full of books and dust. He's a loner and his only close contact is his pal Jacques. He has a soft spot for his mother but he avoids meeting with her face to face leaving her care to the hands of her beautiful young neighbor Jeanne. Michel wants to make something of himself but thinks he is too smart to follow the standard average procedures in life. He believes a man who is skilled enough to cheat without being caught should be rewarded by society. Here is a man who desperately wants to prove something not to himself his cleancut buddy or even some smart cop but to the women in his life his mother the one he's in debt to and Jeanne the one whose love he has to earn. He firmly believes in his right to skip the rules so he tries a type of crime through which he can outsmart them picking pockets. His first time gets him caught but it gives him pleasure the way he approaches his victim and works his way into her purse. Michel's facial expression may be almost nonexistent but between the act and the arrest he confesses feelings of superiority unknown to him before. After he's released due to inadequate proof Michel is right back on the wrong track trying to learn all the tricks of the trade and practicing with religious zeal to make his hands quick and agile.A while later a master pickpocket spots his talent and recruits him for his gang. In a tightly choreographed scene Bresson shows his admiration for the art of emptying people's pockets as an ensemble. The gang of three almost rips off a whole train before stepping out while in a rare humorous moment Michel puts an empty wallet back to the pocket where he took it from a minute before. But he's not so special anymore the other two being even more skillful than he is so when they are caught on the act he quickly leaves Paris in his sole logical decision of the whole film. This is probably the moment when Michel loses that arrogance that kept him so focused all along. After two successful years as a crook abroad he returns home. Almost accidentally as he puts it he falls in front of Jeanne's door. Earlier on he asks Jeanne if she believes all people will be judged. She says yes so he follows his question with another one Judged how? According to laws? What laws? But now Michel craves to be judged. By the laws cause he has to and by Jeanne cause he needs her acceptance.Bresson's underlying theme of redemption through selfaccusation and punishment for even daring to think bigger than you're allowed to is an obvious reference to Christianity since the director was known to be religious. But if you see it in a different light it's simply universally human. A man is not only afraid of failure but often enough he gets horrorchills from the very thought of success and the loneliness that goes with it Michel couldn't care less about losing to the system as long as he knows there may be no real point in winning after all. After going along with his vices the only thing that makes sense is coming back to another human being's warmth. That a smart cop sees through him early on gives him a sense of security rather than fear. It's a way out of his microcosm proof he still exists within the real world which he uses as an escape door when he decides to return there for Jeanne.As for the popular assumption of the sexuality beneath Michel's interaction with his victims and his peers it's an overplayed clich a case of wanting to see something so much it's bound to appear. The way I see it  every accomplishment or moment of tension potentially provides a substitute for sexual satisfaction. Michel watches a master pickpocket at work with admiration and discovers the other members of the caste he dreams about. It's got to be fulfilling at least before it all blows back to his face.Bresson's actors are nonprofessional. Plus they're overworked and it shows. Obviously the master wanted it that way to let the story be told by movements rather than expressions. Whether we like it or not it works minus a few moments of abnormal inertia. The dialogue is minimal and the firstperson narration provides information about the central character without overexplaining. In the end behind bars a redeemed Michel wonders Jeanne to reach you at last what a strange path I had to take. There are times in life when it's not the trip but the destination that counts most. Unfortunately that trip is usually inevitable.";

	schema:reviewBody "No doubt that this is a very well done film but it at the same time also isn't the best or most effective one within its genre.The movie has the same sort of story and approach as for instance the other European movies Ladri di biciclette and Umberto D. but big difference with those movies is that you never feel the same sort of desperateness that the main character must have had. I just never felt it was a necessity for the main character to be a pickpocket. Surely he could had gotten a straight job if he tried hard enough. It was just a way of life that he had picked for himself because it was one of the most easy things for him to do and felt more comfortable doing that than an actual normal job. The movie therefore felt kind of less involving and powerful to watch than the earlier mentioned similar type of movies.The main character also falls kind of flat due to the quite weak acting within the movie. Martin LaSalle's face remains basically the same throughout the entire movie so all of the emotions also already fall kind of flat due to all of this. Apparently this was a type of actingstyle that Robert Bresson liked but I'm just not much into it or impressed by it at all.And the story also just doesn't work out that interesting because of all of that. The story gets mostly saved by the fact that the movie is being an extremely short one and therefore never starts to drag. It's not like the story is dull but it's just the type of movie that tries to pick a more realistic approach with a more realistic and everyday type of story in which not always an awful lot interesting is happening.But oh well it's still a very well shot film so the movie remains for most part still a real pleasure to watch. All of the pickpocketing scene's are quite well done and show the art and skill that goes into it. No doubt some people with criminal intentions are taking notes from this movie just like the main character from this movie was taking notes from a book.A good watch but at the same time also a movie that you can easily do without.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This early Bresson piece is an interesting but ultimately flawed work.Clearly influenced by Italian neorealism nonprofessional actors are used throughout the film. Unlike in neorealist works though where a deep sympathy for the protoganist is established there is a cold distancing effect in this film that means one feels little sympathy. This disengagement also means the viewer quickly loses interest in the proceedings. Telling the story via the device of the character writing his memoirs from behind bars should have generated interest but he is so distant it is obvious the character does not really understand himself let alone anyone else.The main character however does have the potential to be a fascinating figure. Drawn to the life of a pickpocket through feelings of superiority and of being above society's laws he descends into paranoia as the law pursues him. He plays a cat and mouse game with the authorities though who will win is never in doubt to the observer.Likewise the scenes of pickpocketing lack suspense or interest. Indeed his existence seems all the more mundane for them he is no more interesting than a mere accountant going about his work. Whilst this may be potentially subversive for those expecting a traditional crimeheist suspense film indeed the audience is warned from the outset not to expect one they do not offer any more insight into the character. In addition to this his bouts of reclusivity also do nothing to offer invoke sympathy. This is a pity as recluses are rarely depicted on film and when they do so it is never in a positive light nor is little insight given into why they may reject or fear the callous world around them. As in this case they are merely shown to be paranoid.Aside from this descent into paranoia there is little character development until the film's end. The protagonist remains arrogant and aloof and his attempts at reforming are halfhearted until his final redemption after his period of reflection behind bars. The character of the law enforcer has little voice and is really just a personification of the forces of justice. Likewise the females invoke sympathy but are of little interest in their own right.Bresson's spartan style is not yet mature here and the religious themes for which he would become renowned do not show through. Ultimately though this film is a wasted opportunity. With a tightened screenplay and better evocation of the characters' emotions it could have been one of Bresson's masterpieces.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beverly Hills teen Bill Whitney Baywatch's Billy Warlock is good at sports and popular at his high school but he feels alienated from his upper crust family. His parents are indifferent towards him while lavishing favor upon his sister. Sometimes he even feels like they're conspiring against him but is he just paranoid?This was Brian Yuzna's first film as director and it's still his best. My love for this thing knows no boundaries. It's such a wonderfully unique mixture of social commentary the 90210 lifestyle and incredibly warped horror. Oh is the horror in Society ever warped! It's always fun showing this to firsttimers and seeing their reactions to what unfolds on the screen. Horror aside the film also works as both a joke on the rich and a scathing indictment regarding their tendency to leech off of the havenots.Even though it's pretty clear right from the start that things aren't what they seem there's a great sense of paranoia present in Society. Is Bill's rich family plotting against him? Are they even human? You wouldn't expect a former Baywatch star to be an alienated sort but in the context of the film it works. The pitch black humor works too though there are a few more juvenile attempts at comedy the kids on the beach that are admittedly lame. In a way however they do add to the film's bizarre tone. I used to see the weirdo mother character as another pointless attempt at lowbrow humor but the more I've thought about it she's likely there to represent a mishap through the shunt. Former Playboy centerfold Devin Devasquez plays her quirky daughter Clarissa Carlyn. She's very appealing in the role and it's refreshing to see a rich beauty portrayed as something other than an evil vixen for a change.The climactic scenes involving the big shunt are really something to behold. Words cannot do justice to the madness of this sequence. Spectacular glorious madness! Nope even those words don't do it justice.

I'd be hardpressed to come up with another horror film that comes close to rivaling Society's climax.I also can't go without mentioning the sinister reworking of the Eton Boating Song which plays over the film's opening credits.

	onyx:emotionText "Beverly Hills teen Bill Whitney Baywatch's Billy Warlock is good at sports and popular at his high school but he feels alienated from his upper crust family. His parents are indifferent towards him while lavishing favor upon his sister. Sometimes he even feels like they're conspiring against him but is he just paranoid?This was Brian Yuzna's first film as director and it's still his best. My love for this thing knows no boundaries. It's such a wonderfully unique mixture of social commentary the 90210 lifestyle and incredibly warped horror. Oh is the horror in Society ever warped! It's always fun showing this to firsttimers and seeing their reactions to what unfolds on the screen. Horror aside the film also works as both a joke on the rich and a scathing indictment regarding their tendency to leech off of the havenots.Even though it's pretty clear right from the start that things aren't what they seem there's a great sense of paranoia present in Society. Is Bill's rich family plotting against him? Are they even human? You wouldn't expect a former Baywatch star to be an alienated sort but in the context of the film it works. The pitch black humor works too though there are a few more juvenile attempts at comedy the kids on the beach that are admittedly lame. In a way however they do add to the film's bizarre tone. I used to see the weirdo mother character as another pointless attempt at lowbrow humor but the more I've thought about it she's likely there to represent a mishap through the shunt. Former Playboy centerfold Devin Devasquez plays her quirky daughter Clarissa Carlyn. She's very appealing in the role and it's refreshing to see a rich beauty portrayed as something other than an evil vixen for a change.The climactic scenes involving the big shunt are really something to behold. Words cannot do justice to the madness of this sequence. Spectacular glorious madness! Nope even those words don't do it justice. The very idea is quite perverse and the special effects by Screaming Mad George are jawdropping. I'd be hardpressed to come up with another horror film that comes close to rivaling Society's climax.I also can't go without mentioning the sinister reworking of the Eton Boating Song which plays over the film's opening credits.

	schema:reviewBody "Billy Whitney is a troubled kid who's seeing a shrink because of his fear of loved ones and those that are close which he has a hard time fitting in with his wealthy family as he feels he doesn't belong with them. He's also a student at Beverly Hills Academy who's running for president and is dating the head cheerleader so things aren't all bad. Although things suddenly change for the worse when Billy's Sister's exboyfriend convinces him there's something strange about his family. Now Billy gets pulled into a very frightening world that's filled with surreal images and where the paranoia is finally tearing him apart. But what's to come for Billy will be more shocking than what he can comprehend.After watching a horrormystery the day before I decided to put my teeth into another Yuzna's 'Society'. You'll think that Society comes across as usual pure 80's trash in the very cheesy kind. And it does look like that and actually descends into that pattern. But firstly the way it started off you might think otherwise as it does open proceedings rather eerily with an tight prologue and then a haunting tune through the opening credits but soon it takes a real sharp turn from its beginning and heads into familiar 80's horror territory with the usual corny dialogue gratuitous nudity camp performances and overthetop humour. Although when it comes to the final 20 minutes or so you totally are blown off your feet and possibly are in a state of bemusement. During this stage it turns disturbing and rather disgusting while there's classical music streaming along. I know that I was left with a bewildered impression on my face and I would be surprised if you don't get the same feeling too. Meaning it's a good idea to make sure your not eating when coming up towards the film's perverted climax.The odd but fun story does play out like a teen flick with nice amount of mystery and yep I say it satire. This story has more to it and that shows in the hidden agendas and subtle dialog that all seems to come together perfectly. On a second viewing you would easily pick up on these hints within the script. You got your sick injokes lame pun and plain wicked tone. Back onto the satire now which this story is an allegory on the rich looking down on the less privilege and finally screwing over the poor. These amusing potattacks are scattered across the story while also worked into the mystery side of the story with Billy trying to figure what's going on and what's this 'society' is. Some moments you see have you contemplating if what he sees is a figment of his imagination. The reason why you question this is because his seeing a shrink so is it just in his head or is this nightmare for real. This is presented in a very good manner and that's because of the man behind the camera. Brian Yuzna who produced the great 'Reanimator 1985' makes his directorial debut here and does an extraordinary job. No real atmosphere is generated but he paces it with such elasticity that there's no labouring about and he ups the suspense with assured handling and control. The humour and horror balance is a bit uneven at times it felt oddly out of place but it doesn't destroy the fun mood. Camera placement is rather sharp and well executed with a nice eye for shots and moods. Going with it all is a likable heroine played by Billy Warlock from 'Bay watch' fame. While the rest of the acting is nothing out of the norm for a film like this. Everyone was effective in their parts and contributed to the enjoyment that followed. The production is incredibly slick and that's evident by the locations and Screaming Mad George's mindblowing special effects. Those messed up effects that come out of the blue are what makes this film memorable in its inevitable outcome! There's nothing really creepy about this real jokey 80's horror flick but when it gets to the ending credits you'll be left with one real lasting impression I assure you!".

Tragic news is met with blank expressions and vacant smiles.

Indeed if it had this movie would have died a quick death and taken up residence in the discount PVT bin at Blockbuster Video cursed as it is with all the hideousness of the 1980s denim and synth music and helmets of bleached hair everywhere. But this movie is so odd and freaky with the most morbid sense of humor running all the way through it that it works and works pretty good. The special effects look a bit dated but they're so hilarious that you won't care. insert butthead scene here. The shunting scene is still difficult to watch for people like me who have a low tolerance for sadism and gore but I've seen gorier and the concept was so innovative that I had to appreciate it. If you ever wanted to see one of those sappy teen movies from the 80s preferably the ones that starred Michael J.

	schema:reviewBody "Brian Yuzna established himself within the horror genre by producing splatter flicks such as the masterpiece ReAnimator and the pretty damn good From Beyond but Society marks his first directorial project. It's a good one too! This film is unlike the likes of ReAnimator in that it doesn't work principally from lots of gore. There are some disgusting scenes on display but the main focus of the film is always on the surreal element of the story. It definitely shares a Lovecraftian influence with ReAnimator. Bill Whitney is pretty much the normal teenage boy but he's pretty sure his family aren't. He's paranoid that something unusual is going down with the society around him but his psychiatrist is having none of it and puts it down simply to teenage paranoia. This is something more than paranoia however and after reviewing a tape his friend made and having his friend die mysteriously Bill is now certain that his fears are real. But it's hard to stand out from society and society certainly isn't going to take his accusations lying down.Society starts out like one of those teen comedies from the eighties but somehow manages to build into a very surreal little film. I can definitely see why many didn't like it but it certainly clicked for me! There are a lot of things that don't make perfect sense the acting is terrible and the script is less than perfect  but it doesn't matter because the imagination and inventiveness is here and that is always the most important thing in horror. While there are films like this one in existence there aren't any that are really similar to it and that gives this film more standing in my view as originality should be rewarded. Another positive element about this film is the way that it handles itself. The first hour is mainly concerned with the mystery behind 'society' but unlike many mystery flicks this one always stays interesting. When it finally builds to it's effectsladen disgusting finale  the audience really gets paid off and if nothing else you'll be captivated by what is on display. This film is a spoof on real 'society' but it keeps it's points close to it's chest and doesn't hit the audience in the face with them thus giving this an element of intelligence. I warmly recommend this film!".

But the over all idea is quite good and fun at times and the gore is decent.A decent remake of this film with more humour better actors and a better script would make for a much better film.

His adoptive family and most of the town take part is weird 'orgies' where all their bodies morph in to all kinds or weird shapes. They also morph into each other.The final 15 minutes or so does kind of make up for some of the more boring parts in Society  focusing entirely on one of these orgies as Warlock tries to save himself and his friends from being 'assimilated'. The end death where Warlock literally pulls one of the characters inside out is an awesome moment and one of the great celluloid death scenes.

Certainly Bill Whitney has a strained and awkward relationship with his glossy preening patrician parents but at his age who doesn't? In the meantime Society is a stylish severely debauched possibly mentally insane little romp that entertains in spades. Chiefly due to Yuzna's skill with the camera sense of pacing spooky use of lighting and color and lavish setpieces the mansion the car wreck Society entertains on its own terms as a stylishly creepy horror film. Cinematographer Rick Fichter wields one mean camera! Fichter captures the high society ghoulishness with high style using colored lighting in a fashion reminiscent of Dario Argento. The acting is competent the casting inspired all the principals Warlock Patrice Jennings as Sis the parents work like troopers while Ben Slack as the silvertongued society shrink and David Wiley as the cigarchomping Judge Carter who has a talent for getting to the 'bottom' of any problem quite literally steal every scene they're in.This is the single piece that is the most disappointing. While the artwork isn't bad the story is and the characters don't really match up with their personalities in the film. Even though development in the film is very shallow it would have been nice if that carried over to the book. It also diminishes the end of the film and probably since it's a comic book would have been better suited if it was set right after the events of the movie not at least 15 years after.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

It seemed as though nothing was happening nothing beyond spending and watching TV. It was morning again in America but a kind of peculiarly false morning as though someone had reached out with a brush and painted false skies. You couldn't even trust it was day much less anything else. So something had to be happening that wasn't so clear at first sight had to. It had to be ugly since everything looked idyllic. It couldn't be that Watergate had been exposed and that was that.But it couldn't be a political cinema anymore either not in a convincing manner since the people seemed satisfied. So Taxi Driver transformed into Videodrome. Both films are about a helpless observer of a life awash with foulness but in the second case he's a corporate type and he's watching a TV broadcast a TV broadcast that reveals something malicious in the airwaves that transmit reality that is just gnarly and insane beyond belief. Both films perceptively suggest the damage is in the retina of the mind's eye and that damage is not a simple madness the images madden.This is much less strategic of course. It was made near the end of the decade so with enough hindsight to pass around buckets of paranoid blame. The satire is screamingly obvious because who'd believe something so simple anyway a conspiracy so pervasive so blatantly evil which is the clever little device used here the film delivers subversive blows in the same channel as the people consumed reality on TV the channel that played soap opera and assured life was something like it. Watching the rich and privileged for weeks on end engage with utmost seriousness in lachrimose trifles about sex and power is rendered here as a kind of goofy since it was a TV lifestyle malevolent conspiracy for sex and power over the viewer. This alone would make the film required 80's viewing. It's a lot of fun sunny increasingly unhinged. It's strongly anchored on this end by having a famous TV star of the time in the role of the paranoid observer.The icing on the cake is the unforgettable finale that parodies its own soapoperatic parody the sexual games mockingly turn into an actual orgy for power. You get to see an actual 'butthead' among other slimy things.".

And this is one of them.The movie's basically a vicious overthetop satire of what I think many people are afraid is secretly going on with those at the top tiers of society a covert culture of unimaginable depravity perversity exploitation and soulannihilating sociopathy. Kind of like Eyes Wide Shut. And that this Hell on earth going on behind the facade of these majestic mansions is in some mysterious alchemical way what keeps them on top.The plot is driven by this popular kid from an expensive Beverly Hills neighborhood who is obsessed with his fear that everyone in his life is not what they seem. And based on what we see this actually looks like it's true his family is wooden and distant and all his friends appear to regard him with veiled contempt  except the two whom his parents openly dislike of course.After a series of events which gradually make his world seem more suspicious it turns out that he was adopted into this family for the sole purpose of being a human sacrifice at one of their parties.After witnessing one of his friends basically getting turned into a tapestry of mangled flesh and witnessing bizarre body mutations he escapes with the help of his other friend  which seems a bit unlikely given how cunning and powerful that Society was portrayed as being. But I guess they needed to tack on a happy ending.But damn though  the movie symbolically taps into a LOT of effedup things that one's innermost heart fears is going on in secret.Like his high school debate for class president. What appeared at first to be the unpopular nerd vs. the popular athlete was really a fixed game where both sides were completely controlled by the same force... Like how I feel about every presidential election.Or the fact that in the end which one of his friends gets sacrificed? The relatively fat and unattractive one. It makes you think. Why do I just accept that as a movie clich? Are we on some level just like the awful Society that frivolously ruins and desecrates whom they regard as inferior? Would we enjoy doing the same if we were born into such a high caste? Is this Society at the end of the day just the natural order of things? very disquieting.Another symbol that I think most only see the surface of are the surreal body mutations. In the end the part where the protagonist witnesses his poor friend who happens to be Jewish... not sure what that means gets turned into a huge elastic abomination while getting fisted and eaten. It's not just weird man it MEANS something. It could be hallucinations brought on by the trauma of seeing your friend get murdered and this is the scariest thing it's simply the closest visual metaphor we can get for the unimaginably appallingly sadistic thing they do to people as part of their ritual. I think it's something like eating their soul not just raping someone but forcing your way into their deepest being and chewing it up like a damned wad of bubblegum before discarding it leaving the person an utterly devastated wreck.That's some ballsy sht man. And SCARY. There's like more going on in the heavens and the earth than we know. Some genius said that once. I appreciate this movie for being the few that makes me feel that way.".

Why do I just accept that as a movie clich? Are we on some level just like the awful Society that frivolously ruins and desecrates whom they regard as inferior? Would we enjoy doing the same if we were born into such a high caste? Is this Society at the end of the day just the natural order of things? very disquieting.Another symbol that I think most only see the surface of are the surreal body mutations. In the end the part where the protagonist witnesses his poor friend who happens to be Jewish... not sure what that means gets turned into a huge elastic abomination while getting fisted and eaten. It's not just weird man it MEANS something. It could be hallucinations brought on by the trauma of seeing your friend get murdered and this is the scariest thing it's simply the closest visual metaphor we can get for the unimaginably appallingly sadistic thing they do to people as part of their ritual. I think it's something like eating their soul not just raping someone but forcing your way into their deepest being and chewing it up like a damned wad of bubblegum before discarding it leaving the person an utterly devastated wreck.That's some ballsy sht man. And SCARY. There's like more going on in the heavens and the earth than we know. Some genius said that once. I appreciate this movie for being the few that makes me feel that way.";

	schema:reviewBody "Society is a bizarre horror experience that's for sure. It works on several levels actually. Nowhere near perfect but certainly a great effort and an overall amusing film. The whole thing starts out as a typical teenager movie. Almost like a TV soap opera with the handsome and rebellious Billy Billy Warlock as the boy who's estranged from his parents and neighborhood. But Society soon changes into a mysterious thriller in which Billyboy tries to discover the handling and rituals of Society before ending in a completely gore and splatter mess. The last half hour of this film goes beyond your wildest horror imaginationswhile it's making no sense at all this fairly disgusting sequence is a pure joy to observe. Society is in fact an absurd spoof that mocks the High Society of Beverly Hills tremendously. The characters are very stereotypical and the jokes are very clichbut it works. The screenplay contains a lot of very insane and wacky dialogues and quote material. Who do you like your tea Billy? Cream and sugaror do you want me to pee in it' or even stuff like Now now honey you know the rulesfirst we dine THAN we copulate'. I'm sure Yuzna and the scriptwriters had a lot of fun. As did special effects supervisor Screaming Mad George! Society is the first film that credits Brian Yuzna as a director but by that time he already had his name made in the field. He was the producer of some other terrific horror comedies like ReAnimator and From Beyond. He obviously feels at his best in this sub genre as he continued to direct and produce several more sinister spoofs with gruesome gore like the two sequels to ReAnimator and The Dentist which is also a parody on life in the upper class by the way. Society is certainly worth a look if your sense of humor is a bit twisted and your stomach isn't too weak.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing the trailer for this when I was about 9 and being freaked out. Nothing is shown only implied but a shot of Billy Warlock biting into an apple that is filled with worms stayed with me.Originally hacked to shreds by the BBFC on it's cinema release in the UK a shame as it performed much better here than in the US you'll quickly wonder what all of the fuss is about. I know I'm somewhat desensitized in my adulthood though cheap latex flesh wounds on Casuality still make me shudder and squirm but you'll struggle to find anything in Society to justify the 18rating. With barely a drop of blood to be had the film coasts as far as it can on themes and subtext. It doesn't get too far maybe to the end of the street.17yearold Bill Whitney played by 27yearold Warlock is a regular teenager in Beverly Hills who wants nothing more than a happy adolescence with his friends and to succeed at school. But his parents are weird his sister is provoking unusual feelings from him they appear to exclude him from their circle of privilege and he begins to suspect that his welltodo life is only surface deep and that something much much sinister is lurking beneath the facade. His shrink suggests that he is merely feeling alienated and needlessly paranoid but when a nervous outcast reveals a secret recording he quickly realizes that it's not all in his head.Nothing here really works. Brian Yuzna has great ideas but no clue of how to effectually execute them. The mystery is underdeveloped since there isn't much in the way of puzzlesolving or clue hunting. The gore is almost nonexistent much to my immense dismay. I do realize that horror can be at its most effective when it is merely being suggestive or offensive but the big reveal at the end is so pedestrian and blunt that they might as well have just announced it right at the beginning of the movie which kinda does happen thanks to the stupidly spoileriffic opening credits. Even during the shocking climax Yuzna shoots with that stupid pink lighting that Stuart Gordon used in abundance in From Beyond which just makes the scene look dumb. Worst of all is the score which honestly fits an episode of Chucklevision more than it does a hardcore 80s horror film with a reputation to uphold.Crucify me if you want but I say that Society really could do with a remake. If Cronenberg or Fincher were to redo this movie contextually more timely and dynamic in our polarizing and failing society of 2017 then I have no doubt that the rotten core of Society can have more relevance now than it did in 1989. The ideas are intriguing but Yuzna's amateurish direction and lack of focus spoil it.".

To call this film antidemocracy is to be antidemocracy and I wouldn't be surprised if that critique was written by Dick Cheney himself. Now that I've got that out of the way let's get to the actual film review. This is one of the freakiest films I've seen ever and it scared the bejeezus out of me. There aren't many movies that can do this but Society did the trick. I guess I really don't need to explain the plot because that's been done several times. I will say that it is one of the scariest most grotesque most bizarre horror films you will see and even if not each and every rich person in the world may or may not be a terrible person this nation is a system run for the rich and by the rich and so the satire is right on target. The FX are definitely amazing and I felt a sense of tension all throughout. The paranoia of the film is very effective and creepy and remember as someone famous once said Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you. Society is a horror film so wellmade that the somewhat cheezy parts You're right! I am a butthead! and lessthangreat acting jobs by a few people in the cast is made up for by everything else.".

He doesn't seem to fit in with their lifestyle or with anything they do.  And when an acquaintance his sister's exboyfriend plays him a recording of the sister's debutant party Billy begins to think he may not even be the same species as his family he's adopted as we come to see. It all comes down to an ohsooomessy orgy where Billy is the Guest of Honor.First things first  this is just a John Hughesish ComingofAge movie with yucky polymorphic mutants.  Even the clothes are the same and this movie is only 11 yrs old!.  Unfortunately adding high society mutants that eat the middle class doesn't make that type of movie any better.  It is not good. The only reason to remotely recommend this movie is the wetandwild orgy at the end where all the snobs come over to the house and turn into a big slimy pile of mush as they eat the exboyfriend.  Even Billy literally turning this rival inside out can't make up for the first hour of this movie which plays out like an Afterschool Special on alienation.

	schema:headline " A dystopian nightmare that effectively captures the essence of Orwell's novel";
	schema:reviewBody "In a recent review of Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' I confidently referred to the film as a weird twisted fantastical tale of the sheer absurdity of an Orwellian society. In all honesty at that time I wasn't even certain of what constituted an Orwellian society since I had never read the novel and was only repeating fragments which I had extracted from other sources. Not more than three weeks ago I decided to finally get my hands on George Orwell's famous dystopian story to see what it was all about and was somewhat surprised to discover that it was one of the most engaging pieces of literature I had ever read. Eager to find out how the film adaptations treated Orwell's themes I immediately tracked down copies of Michael Radford's timely version released in 1984 as well as Michael Anderson's hardertofind '1984' released in 1956.Michael Anderson's '1984' was not in fact the first adaptation of George Orwell's novel following a 1954 BBC television Sunday Night Theatre broadcast which I've heard is phenomenal. I had expected that a 1950s adaptation would sugarcoat some of the novel's darker and more pessimistic themes and yet I was pleasantly surprised to find that screenwriters Ralph Gilbert Bettison and William Templeton have followed Orwell's story quite closely. Edmond O'Brien plays Winston Smith a lowly member of the Outer Party at the Ministry of Truth where he works every day at revising history to correspond with Big Brother's most recent declarations. Winston secretly harbours a resentment towards Big Brother and his totalitarian government a crime that is punishable by death should he be observed by the allpowerful Thought Police. However Winston is not alone and he soon discovers that the beautiful young Julia Jan Sterling also shares his reservations and the two strike up a romantic relationship meeting in locations without surveillance and always toying with the risk of capture.Inevitably both are arrested by the dictatorial government and Winston falls into the hands of Gen. O'Connor changed from O'Brien in the novel possibly to avoid the name clash with the film's main star played by Michael Redgrave. Slowly but surely O'Connor sets about destroying Winston's will persisting with his torturous punishment not only until Winston obeys Big Brother but until he loves him. An alternative ending reportedly had Winston and Julia screaming Down with Big Brother as they fell before the firing squad a conclusion that I suspect would have infuriated George Orwell. Fortunately the version I saw stayed much truer to the spirit of the novel ending with a rehabilitated Winston proclaiming his genuine love for the almighty leader. There is also a brief tensecond epilogue in which the narrator practically spells out the film's moral  as if it wasn't clear enough already  but this minor slipup is easily forgiven.The performances in the film are very well done. Edmond O'Brien does not look how I had originally pictured Winston Smith  perhaps a bit plumper than expected  but he did an excellent job most impressive in the scenes of his torture. There is one brilliant longtake in which we see O'Connor pacing back and forth across the screen periodically holding up four fingers and trying to convince Winston that there are five. Winston pictured on a television monitor behind O'Connor vigilantly maintains that two and two equals four before the latter's persistent torture finally breaks him. The acting here from both parties is sublime and we can really feel the agony that poor Winston is enduring. Also notable is actor Donald Pleasence who plays R. Parsons an average workman who is hopelessly devoted to the Party and its leader even after he is arrested for alleged thoughtcrimes.Perhaps one of the few complaints that I can make about the film is how Room 101 was dealt with. Though I was most impressed with O'Brien's acting during this sequence it was all over much too quickly to be effective and we don't even see a thing treated only to the frantic squeaks of a mass of hungry rodents. Whilst it is often true that the less the audience sees the better here didn't seem to be one of those moments and the whole scene would have worked much better in my view had we been subjected to what Winston could see to be facetoface with the worst thing in the world. Other than this I can certainly recommend '1984' for its fine treatment of a challenging piece of dystopian literature. This one is well worth tracking down.".

I'm sure there was a lot left out of the book. But I get tired of hearing people moan and groan about the argument of literature vs. cinema. Come on people film is timebased and can't digress like novels can. The screenwriterdirector mainly extracts plot points and can't be bothered with too much exposition unless of course they have a whopping budget!. I've read many criticisms where more skeptical viewers complain that we don't get to know Big Brother's motives strategy etc... What?!! It's Big Brother  an enigmatic and probably nonexistent despot....you're not supposed to know his whole story! The love affair although brief is very empathetic. In lieu of all the paranoia Big Brothercheerleading etc.  the love between Winston and Julia is a good emotional oasis. Even though I watched a poor copy of this version it really did make an impression. One of the few criticisms I have is Room 101. I thought the rat shotscene was truncated and could've been dramatized more. That's where the John Hurt version trumps this one.".

Much like the BBC version of two years previously the movie ignores Orwell's descriptions of Airstrip One as a ruined and wartorn version of London for the most part and such places as the Ministry of Truth and the canteen look like every other 50s scifi movie's version of the 1980s. They even change Goldstein's name to something futuristicsounding and unmemorable though they may have been to avoid any hint of antiSemitism. No wonder Orwell's widow hated it so.It's also no surprise that both Julia and O'Brien oops sorry it's O'Connor here probably because of the lead actor's name being too close to O'Brien are able to spot Winston as different Edmund O'Brien plays Winston not as an intellectual stuck in a society antithetical to intellectual thought but as a bit of a gormless idiot a man who has to be told repeatedly That photo does not exist. Yes that one in your hand. Yes THAT one. It doesn't exist. What are you deaf? It's hard to imagine THIS Winston Smith lasting for very long in the actual novel let alone the 1984 version of the movie. This Winston is also enough of an idiot to believe that the steely vaudeville villaineqsue O'Connor could ever be sympathetic  though to be fair that's more to do with Michael Redgrave deciding to play the part without an ounce of subtlety and neither movie does a decent job of explaining why Winston trusts O'Brien in the first place. Of the three actors to play this part it's definitely Burton first then Andr Morell then Redgrave far in the rear. And don't even get me started about trying to do a movie in the 50s about a society trying to abolish the orgasm...And yet the movie gets some bits absolutely right. Winston's visit to O'Brien's quarters unlike the similar visit in the later version includes Julia and includes her objection to O'Connor's suggestion that they may someday have to separate. All these years I thought that scene occurred in the later version too but rewatching it the other night revealed that it doesn't. It also gets some of the broader strokes right too I hadn't expected the Two Minute Hate to work so well in this futuristic setting nor to have the torture scenes make any sense. Still give me the later version anyday over this one. This is definitely your grandfather's 1984 not Orwell's.".

In the Radio Times to celebrate the year of the setting did a large piece feature on the BBC TV adaptation from 1954 and the film version of 1956 starring Edmund O Brien and looked forward to seeing the BBC showing either version . The problem was that due to copyright issues by the Orwell estate there was no way either adaptation could be broadcast  instead the closest the BBC could do was broadcast a narrated version of the book for the Book For Bedtime slot In truth this version is hardly waiting for . There are some very good aspects to it . Best is the directing from Michael Anderson . I know Anderson is hated in some circles for  Having no love for the Scifi genre  but I've never had a problem . LOGAN'S RUN and THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES whilst not being classics of the genre are okay movies . Perhaps the problem might be that his films don't have too much of a futuristic look . Certainly he could thrown a massive spanner in the works by making everything look too futuristic which would have been a disaster . Here we see something recognisable as being both contemporary and futuristic which means nothing is too dated watching in 2012 The good points are however outweighed by the bad . Orwell's novel is unfilmable and only Nigel Kneale's teleplay despite being freely adapted does capture the feel and subtext of the original while this version doesn't . Instead the storytelling concentrates heavily on the romantic doomed love affair between Winston and Julia so much so it becomes more of a love story set in a communist tyranny rather than being about the failures of Marxism when it becomes hijacked by tyranny . It's certainly not a complex or sophisticated film and the ending has nothing in common with the novel The casting certainly doesn't help . You want an everyman type of actor playing the everyman character from the novel ? Well who worse than Edmund O Brien a very effective actor playing rough diamond types in film noir classics but hopelessly miscast here along with Jan Sterling who'd also be equally at home in a crime drama . Michael Redgrave is good enough in his role but gives an inferior performance if you've seen the 1954 BBC version with Andre Morell . It doesn't help that he's called O Connor which is another distraction as is the name change for Goldstein I can't say I was too disappointed by this film version . I went in not expecting much and came out of it having not seen much . Orwell was a writer who didn't make filmable novels and this is yet another film adaptation that once again proves it .".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been too long since I read the book so I'm just concerned with the movie as a movie. And what a downer the 90minutes is for the generally sunny 1950's. Hard to think of a grimmer storyline or more downbeat ending for that period. I take the film's anomalous presence as a useful Cold War commentary on the Soviet Union the rivalry then at its peak. Anyhow the sets are grim even the one outdoor scene is drained of any natural beauty while the photography remains dull gray as it should be given the dystopian subject matter. Then too the two leads O'Brien and Sterling are not exactly marquee names. However they are excellent actors as the storyline requiresyou don't want movie stars competing with the plotheavy symbolism. In short the production though clearly economical is pretty uncompromising. Storywise we're plunged into the middle of the dystopian society without much explanation of how it got that way or why. Instead the narrative emphasizes the tools of thought control among Party members who are subjected to all sorts of thought conditioning techniques such as the histrionic hate sessions. Just how the nonparty people live is not really portrayed. However love may be forbidden among Party members but I doubt that it was among the common people otherwise how would repopulation take place.Besides dwelling on Winston's O'Brien efforts at contacting the political underground the script dwells on the forbidden love affair between Winston and Julia Sterling. And I had to laugh when Julia sheds her shapeless Party uniform for a flowing white gown right out of the Loretta Young Show of the time. This may be the movie's one concession to 1950's norms. The film does manage a few twists one of which I didn't see coming. But if I have one complaint it's that Redgrave's high Party official lacks subtlety in pretty much a onenote performance. This can be seen as a defect if you think about his official's changing roles. Anyway the film remains a visual oddity for then as well as now. However its thought control message though crudely put may be more relevant in our digitalized age than it was then. At the same time this is one of the few subjects that I think needs a bigger budget remake to do it justice. I haven't seen the latest remake from 1984 so I can't comment on its worth. All in all this version maintains a grimly narrow but thoughtprovoking focus.In passinghaving seen the movie on first release I seem to remember the rat cage sequence as being longer more detailed with glowing eyes and much scarier than my DVD version. But then that was well over 50years ago.".

Even the cult classic movie Brazil in 1985 has an Orwell type features and themes through the entire fabric of the film. In fact the working title for for the highly futuristic Brazil was 1984 and a half.In the future the people of Oceania are in a endless living in a state of poverty fear and oppression. Even personal will and thought are monitored for the common good. Meals are rationed and virtually every move is monitored through video cameras and police agents. Winston has memories of when life was better and he expounds about it in a private journal that he keep hidden. Winston begins making eye contact with a younger woman named Julia it's not long afterward that they are part of the rebellion against the state.George Orwell published his book in 1949. The novel found fame because of its portrayal of everyone watching everyone else and loss of personal rights in the face of a oppressive government. He chose the year 1984 as the target date for Big Brother as he called it.There was a BBC version of the movie followed by the 1956 Edward O'Brien film. Together the movies were able to cause only a minor stir and that was for sending people back to the book to read the full story. This version was directed by Michael Anderson who did such films as Around the World in 80 Days and Logan's Run in 1976. This movie is just not well done it lacks timing and any degree of suspense. If you can find the BBC version try that one first. Even though there is some combining of characters Donald Pleasance is in it and does a pretty good job.".

In fact the working title for for the highly futuristic Brazil was 1984 and a half.In the future the people of Oceania are in a endless living in a state of poverty fear and oppression. Even personal will and thought are monitored for the common good. Meals are rationed and virtually every move is monitored through video cameras and police agents. Winston has memories of when life was better and he expounds about it in a private journal that he keep hidden. Winston begins making eye contact with a younger woman named Julia it's not long afterward that they are part of the rebellion against the state.George Orwell published his book in 1949. The novel found fame because of its portrayal of everyone watching everyone else and loss of personal rights in the face of a oppressive government. He chose the year 1984 as the target date for Big Brother as he called it.There was a BBC version of the movie followed by the 1956 Edward O'Brien film. Together the movies were able to cause only a minor stir and that was for sending people back to the book to read the full story. This version was directed by Michael Anderson who did such films as Around the World in 80 Days and Logan's Run in 1976. This movie is just not well done it lacks timing and any degree of suspense. If you can find the BBC version try that one first. Even though there is some combining of characters Donald Pleasance is in it and does a pretty good job.";

This dystopia is supposed to be colorless lifeless and grim and the film succeeds. And the actors do a good job in keeping to the spirit of the story.Instead of explaining the rather familiar plot I'll point out a few ways that it differs from Orwell's book. One of the most obvious is desexualizing the relationship between Winston Smith and Juilia. Films back in 1956 could only imply sexuality and the fact that the film talked about the 'antisex league' is actually a bit surprising. The film a handles the scene where Smith betrays his lover is sanitized a bitagain films in the 50s weren't about to be this graphicand they would not show Smith with a rat cage strapped to his face! However otherwise the film is pretty close to the book...apart from a totally unnecessary epilogue where the audience is admonished about the importance of freedom. Unnecessary as unless you are a blithering idiot you'll clearly get this message in the film! Very well made and I enjoyed it more than the much grimmer 1984 version with Richard Burton and John Hurt.".

I guess not to upset the audience since the ending the book gives is so dystopian and hopelessand excellent. The small change to the plot doesn't affect the movie that much and you really have to give the makers credit for being so accurate to most of the book. Many of the of the most memorable parts of the book can also be found in the movie such as 5 minute hate and the jail scene with the other prisonersif you've read the book you know what I mean. Even though slightly merrier then the novel its really not happy at all. Its very grim and the clinical look of the sets just creates a very convincing dystopian big brother future with no escape and no one to ask for help.Recommended for anyone into scifi or fans of Orwell.".

The only other thing I recall is that they raised the price of chocolate from 25 to 30 and Winston had to rewrite the history and state they're reducing the price from 50 to 30.I watched the 1984 version a few days ago and now this the 1956 version yesterday. This version is better for a few reasons. Simple film making like better actors screenplay sets cinematography music. You know stuff that makes it interesting to sit through a movie. As mentioned previously I have not read the book recently and will soon. And I cannot expect the movies to be like the book. They're a different medium. What I got from this version is it clearly explained the world we were entering into and the characters acted paranoid. With the 1984 version we are thrown right into the 2 minute hate. We have no idea what is going on.Edmond O'Brien was a much better actor than John Hurt. Hurt was fine in toward the end with the torture scene. But everything else that was a mostly boring film. Richard Burton was really the only shining star in the 1984 version and he was completely underused. All the acting in this version are great. It did slow down toward the end and the ending sucked.Rating is a B or 6 stars. Worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Geld oder Leber! is a West German Germanlanguage movie from 1986 so it has its 30th anniversary this year. The director is Dieter Prttel and he is also one of the writers. The name is probably not too familiar but he also worked on other films with Mike Krger and Thomas Gottschalk back then which shows that at least in terms of films you should not expect too much for me. This was the time of German trash movies to some extent and here we have another example. Mike Krger stars here and he is also one of the writers. The last writer is Christoph Treutwein and it's always pretty embarrassing to see so many writers for one film and then the outcome is really weak like in this case. Ursela Monn is the female colead next to Krger and Falco huge star back then has a cameo too. There is not a lot more to say. Even in the absence of Gottschalk this feels like a mostly uninspired little film that goes for cheap laughs in terms of plays on words or guys dressing up as females ugh.. But I still have to say that Krger's charisma and recognition value not really his range still elevate the material here. The problem is not the acting it is the script. The bank robbery parts were still among the better moments. Of course it's all in good fun and nothing along the lines of Dog Day Afternoon. We have a bank robber for example who allows people to move in front of him in the line as they have an important appointment etc. But is it really funny? I doubt it. Thumbs down from'me. I don't recommend the watch and I am glad it was over so quickly 80minute film only.".

	schema:headline " Toho cleans up their act after GODZILLA 2000 MILLENNIUM!";
	schema:reviewBody "Although I enjoyed GODZILLA 2000 MILLENNIUM released in the US as simply GODZILLA 2000 I thought that this inGodzillaonly followup GODZILLA X MEGAGUIRUS THE G ANNIHILATION STRATEGY was a vast improvement over its predecessor and I can see why!Although G2000 was an initial box office success in Japan it was a critical failure especially with the fans.  Although it had FX that improved over the films from 19891995 but didn't match up to the more successful Heisei Gamera Trilogy the story wasn't very well put together and audiences in both Japan and the US had a hard time figuring out what was going on unless you read the manga adaptation or the movie compendiums they had for every new Godzilla film.  Godzilla's reappearance remember the film was supposed to follow the first film from 1954 was not explained.  And keep in mind that G2000's director Takao Ookawara was not into Godzilla at all and just did his job.But at long last Toho hired Masaaki Tezuka who was assistant director for 1999's MOTHRA 3 who not only made his directorial debut with this film but is a big Godzilla fan!  He IMHO is the best director of a Godzilla film after Ishiro Honda along with Heisei Gamera Trilogy director Shusuke Kaneko who next directed the more successful GODZILLA MOTHRA KING GHIDORAH THE GIANT MONSTERS' GENERAL OFFENSIVE.  The story does not follow G2000 but Godzilla is exactly the same from that film because executive producer Shogo Tomiyama had planned to do a trilogy of standalone Godzilla films.  But in this entry Godzilla was not only much better explained but more delightfully protrayed as both the villain and antihero!  A good compromise of the Godzillas from the decades!  Godzilla's titular adversary Megaguirus the threephase hyperdragonfly monster the first stage is a remake of Meganuron the giant insect from the original 1956 RODAN looks like a cross between the final stage Battra from 1992's GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA and Scyther from POKEMON but made a very interesting foe giving Godzilla the trial of speed!  Kenji Suzuki's FX work is a vast improvement over his work in G2000 producing some of his best most breathtaking visuals such as the flood in Shibuya and the Meganeura dragonflies that flock through said city to buzz around on Godzilla like mosquitoes and the climactic battle between the two title monsters is one of the most vigorous monster fights I've seen!  There are nods to spaghetti westerns samurai flicks and Toei's Sentai Series as Godzilla suitmation actor Tsutomu Kitagawa does a tribute to his Sentai work by having Godzilla jump into the air on Megaguirus though it also recalls the 70s Godzilla but with the friends I saw it with this scene got as many laughs as it did cheers! Screenwriters Hiroshi Kashiwabara and Wataru Mimura have outdone themselves this time more than making up for their mixed work in G2000.  Their story does a better job in conveying emotion action and suspense and manages to stay away from the many plotholes that plagued the previous film with only one hilarious major plothole In one scene after the first Dimension Tide test the little boy Jun sneaks past the heavily secured site with the greatest of ease!  Tom Cruise has nothing on this tyke!  The music score by Michiru Ooshima the first female Godzilla composer is excellent and the best nonAkira Ifukube composer for a Godzilla film to date!  Very dark cataclysmic and suspenseful and her brooding theme for Godzilla fits him perfectly!  I also noticed that the theme music for the Gryphon the GGraspers' superjet vehicle recalls Barry Gray's famous THUNDERBIRDS theme!  But of course Toho tacks on two stock Ifukube tracks in the score to tell us that this is a Godzilla film.  And last but not least the human characters were much better done have more direction and better motivation! I actually felt for and liked the human characters here and that hasn't been done after 1975's TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA!  Misato Tanaka as the brooding heroine Kiriko Tsujimori is tough intense and sympathetic sort of reminding me of Carrie Anne Moss' Trinity character from THE MATRIX Shousuke Tanihara who was just in Shusuke Kaneko's CROSSFIRE portrays the hip inventor Hajime Kudo so perfectly and carefree as any hip GenX type should be Veteran actress Yuriko Hoshi from MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA and GHIDRAH THE THREE HEADED MONSTER is very wise and intelligent as Yoshino Yoshizawa For a kid actor Hiroyuki Suzuki did a very good job at playing the little boy Jun Hayakawa Desipte his limited screen time Toshiyuki Nagashima plays the key role of Tsujimori's late commander Takuji Miyagawa very flawlessly And actoranime voice performer Masato Ibu is likeable as the shady Motohiko Sugiura who organizes GGraspers.  Oh I noticed that this film emphasizes less on copying the latest Hollywood hit as the films since 1984 have done so blatantly!The plot in a nutshell Through the decades since 1954 Godzilla attacked Japan for its nuclear energy.  Even though government scientists Motohiko Sugiura Ibu and Yoshino Yoshizawa Hoshi develop a safe plasma power plant free of nuclear energy Godzilla attacks it anyway!  Army rangers led by Takuji Miyagawa tried to stop him but Godzilla killed them in his destructive wake and the only survivor of the team was Kiriko Tsujimori Tanaka whose hatred for the big green terror grew more bitter.  Five years later now as the commander of GGraspers and antiGodzilla task force Tsujimori enlists both Yoshino Yoshizawa and young inventor Hajime Kudo Shosuke Tanihara who come up with a Dimension Tide satellite which shoots an Artificial Black Hole on the sky of Earth to suck anything in its radius to oblivion.  This would make a perfect weapon against Godzilla and its test was successful but some residue from the Artificial Black Hole leaves a bunch of prehistoric insect eggs one of which is picked up by a little schoolboy named Jun Hayakawa Hiroyuki Suzuki.  When he is forced to dump it into a sewer a new terror begins as the egg hatches into a giant Meganuron insect that slaughters a teenage couple and then sheds its skin to reveal a dragonflylike insect stage called Meganeura.  While Tsujimori and the GGraspers are in pursuit of Godzilla she even manages to ride on Godzilla's back the Meganeuras reproduce heavily and swarm out of the Shibuya district to suck energy out of Godzilla so that they can inject it into their queen cocoon which hatches into a huge dragonfly monster called Megaguirus!  Now Megaguirus goes after Godzilla while the GGraspers prepare the Dimension Tide for him.  Which monster will win?  Will the Dimension Tide finally get rid of Godzilla?  And what IS Godzilla looking for in Shibuya . . .Even though GODZILLA X MEGAGUIRUS was a commercial failure in Japan the film had a weaker advertising campaign because of G2000's failure it was a critical success and the fans agreed!  IMHO this is the Godzilla film that should've been released to US theaters!  A fun fastpaced actionpacked and exciting film!Now I've GOT to see the next Godzilla film GODZILLA MOTHRA KING GHIDORAH THE GIANT MONSTERS' GENERAL OFFENSIVE!  From what I've seen and read about this looks to be the best Godzilla film yet!".

	onyx:emotionText "Although I enjoyed GODZILLA 2000 MILLENNIUM released in the US as simply GODZILLA 2000 I thought that this inGodzillaonly followup GODZILLA X MEGAGUIRUS THE G ANNIHILATION STRATEGY was a vast improvement over its predecessor and I can see why!Although G2000 was an initial box office success in Japan it was a critical failure especially with the fans.  Although it had FX that improved over the films from 19891995 but didn't match up to the more successful Heisei Gamera Trilogy the story wasn't very well put together and audiences in both Japan and the US had a hard time figuring out what was going on unless you read the manga adaptation or the movie compendiums they had for every new Godzilla film.  Godzilla's reappearance remember the film was supposed to follow the first film from 1954 was not explained.  And keep in mind that G2000's director Takao Ookawara was not into Godzilla at all and just did his job.But at long last Toho hired Masaaki Tezuka who was assistant director for 1999's MOTHRA 3 who not only made his directorial debut with this film but is a big Godzilla fan!  He IMHO is the best director of a Godzilla film after Ishiro Honda along with Heisei Gamera Trilogy director Shusuke Kaneko who next directed the more successful GODZILLA MOTHRA KING GHIDORAH THE GIANT MONSTERS' GENERAL OFFENSIVE.  The story does not follow G2000 but Godzilla is exactly the same from that film because executive producer Shogo Tomiyama had planned to do a trilogy of standalone Godzilla films.  But in this entry Godzilla was not only much better explained but more delightfully protrayed as both the villain and antihero!  A good compromise of the Godzillas from the decades!  Godzilla's titular adversary Megaguirus the threephase hyperdragonfly monster the first stage is a remake of Meganuron the giant insect from the original 1956 RODAN looks like a cross between the final stage Battra from 1992's GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA and Scyther from POKEMON but made a very interesting foe giving Godzilla the trial of speed!  Kenji Suzuki's FX work is a vast improvement over his work in G2000 producing some of his best most breathtaking visuals such as the flood in Shibuya and the Meganeura dragonflies that flock through said city to buzz around on Godzilla like mosquitoes and the climactic battle between the two title monsters is one of the most vigorous monster fights I've seen!  There are nods to spaghetti westerns samurai flicks and Toei's Sentai Series as Godzilla suitmation actor Tsutomu Kitagawa does a tribute to his Sentai work by having Godzilla jump into the air on Megaguirus though it also recalls the 70s Godzilla but with the friends I saw it with this scene got as many laughs as it did cheers! Screenwriters Hiroshi Kashiwabara and Wataru Mimura have outdone themselves this time more than making up for their mixed work in G2000.  Their story does a better job in conveying emotion action and suspense and manages to stay away from the many plotholes that plagued the previous film with only one hilarious major plothole In one scene after the first Dimension Tide test the little boy Jun sneaks past the heavily secured site with the greatest of ease!  Tom Cruise has nothing on this tyke!  The music score by Michiru Ooshima the first female Godzilla composer is excellent and the best nonAkira Ifukube composer for a Godzilla film to date!  Very dark cataclysmic and suspenseful and her brooding theme for Godzilla fits him perfectly!  I also noticed that the theme music for the Gryphon the GGraspers' superjet vehicle recalls Barry Gray's famous THUNDERBIRDS theme!  But of course Toho tacks on two stock Ifukube tracks in the score to tell us that this is a Godzilla film.  And last but not least the human characters were much better done have more direction and better motivation! I actually felt for and liked the human characters here and that hasn't been done after 1975's TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA!  Misato Tanaka as the brooding heroine Kiriko Tsujimori is tough intense and sympathetic sort of reminding me of Carrie Anne Moss' Trinity character from THE MATRIX Shousuke Tanihara who was just in Shusuke Kaneko's CROSSFIRE portrays the hip inventor Hajime Kudo so perfectly and carefree as any hip GenX type should be Veteran actress Yuriko Hoshi from MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA and GHIDRAH THE THREE HEADED MONSTER is very wise and intelligent as Yoshino Yoshizawa For a kid actor Hiroyuki Suzuki did a very good job at playing the little boy Jun Hayakawa Desipte his limited screen time Toshiyuki Nagashima plays the key role of Tsujimori's late commander Takuji Miyagawa very flawlessly And actoranime voice performer Masato Ibu is likeable as the shady Motohiko Sugiura who organizes GGraspers.

	schema:reviewBody "Just read all the IMDb reviews of this film going back years! so I'm going to confine my posting to things that HAVEN'T previously been mentioned by others. But to briefly recap this movie is great fun with a plot that adults as well as kids can find interesting. It definitely hearkens back to the early 1960s 'glory days' in both its epic feel and its portrayal of Godzilla as a serious menace to humanity.But you got all that out of the other reviews.I'm surprised no one else has commented on some rather unique photography techniques used in the SPFX sequences of this picture. I have seen nearly all the Godzilla films going back to 1954 with the exception of the very recent GMK and Final Wars.There are several things I found unique about GXM's photography vs nearly every other film in the franchise. This is the only time I have seen a sort of timedelay technique used in showing the monster. At some dramatic moments the action inexplicably and artfully freezes for just a moment. At other times Godzilla's lumbering advance is shown with a surreal technique that makes his movements kind of jerky in a strobelike effect. Rather than speeding up his movements which would look ridiculous this slows action into a 'flashcard' surrealistic style like a film made with for example 12 separate image frames per second rather than the usual 24.One thing I didn't care for as much that is very abundant in this film is a kind of unrealistic flight effect for Megaguiras. He hangs in the air as if suspended on strings OK he is suspended on strings but they obviously filmed it to emphasize rather than lessen this effect with wings moving too slowly to be convincing. I don't think this is a flaw so much as an intentional artistic choice but for me it hearkens back to some of the lesser Gfilms of the 1970s. I prefer the more realistic flight techniques from RODAN 1956. But that is just a personal bias. Unrealistic effects do not equate to bad effects. Too many American reviews of kaiju films make that mistake. Unrealistic is often an artistic choice.The ending of the movie is also unique and artistic in its own way. No other film from the series ends quite like this with the dialogue freezing midway through a human dialogue scene. It was a very interesting artistic choice and caught me by surprise. Like the director probably intended it left me wanting to know what would happen a heartbeat later. But then the credits were rolling.The big G's suit looks good in this film and his presence is powerfully portrayed. If I had to quibble about anything I would say that the face lacks animation in many closeups and tends more toward looking frozen and rubbery. Godzilla's face looked much more animated and 'alive' to me in films like 'VS Biolante' or the early 1990s VS King Ghidora.There are a number of water effects sequences that look great in GXM. The flooded Tokyo streets and the big G's spines surfacing out at sea come immediately to mind. Great entry in the series!".

As of now since I basically just gave you all the yea or nay of all of this you can skip this review if you don't care about Big G. All others stick around! Also since this film has yet to see US release and most of you may not have my video resources where else are you going to hear about this one?In this installment despite what Toho has set up in the previous entries of the current series it is revealed that Godzilla there is no longer a distinction between old and new has shown up a couple of times since 1954 when he was decisively killed by an oxygen destroyer but I won't go there in search of nuclear energy to feed off of. To curb the big critter's appetite to say nothing of his periodic rampages all over the country the Japanese government bans nuclear power and develops a plasmabased clean fuel system. For whatever reason this does absolutely nothing to thwart Godzilla.The government then implements a paramilitary group called the GGraspers Yes I'm serious who intend to put an end to the big guy once and for all using a focusable black hole generator called the Dimension Tide. The leader of the GGraspers is a young woman named Tsujimori a former ranger whose commanding officer was killed in an encounter with Godzilla five years previous and she is obsessed with avenging her commander's death. She recruits a humble nanotechnology ittybitty robots genius named Kudo to help on the Dimension Tide project by using his skills to create the ultimate computer system to guide it. Why he creates a superguidance system that can only be operated from his personal laptop computer is beyond me but I'll let that one goThe test of the Dimension Tide gun is a success sucking an abandoned test building into oblivion but there is evidence of residual dimensional distortion. Of course no one thinks anything of it and a little boy who accidentally witnesses the test finds a mysterious egg which he promptly takes home. His family is then transferred to Tokyo where he abandons the growing oozing egg in the city sewer system. At the same time a solar powered satellite is launched into orbit which houses the Dimension Tide gun and can be focused anywhere in the world. However it has been untested from such a great distance Meanwhile the egg has begun to replicate in the stagnant sewer water and soon there are thousands of the damned thingsIn the meantime Tsujimori and the GGraspers find Godzilla on his way to the mainland and Tsujimori plants a tracer on Godzilla while hitching a ride on him no less!!! making it easier for the GGraspers to track him with the orbiting black hole gun.A young couple walk into a back alley and are devoured very graphically for one of these movies! by what appears to be a giant dragonfly larva. Then for absolutely no reason Tokyo is flooded ??? creating a perfect environment for these giant dragonflies to mature in. Presently there is a swarm of them flying about in search of radioactive sustenance I know they ate people but what the hey? and by swarm I mean thousands. And what better radioactive snack than a 400foot tall guy in a rubber suit?Megaguirus proceeds to hand Godzilla the granddaddy of all asskickings in a scene which is truly painful to watch. This is without question the fight of Godzilla's career with a climax that made me feel like I haven't felt since that day back in 1977 when I first saw Luke Skywalker blow the Death Star out of the sky. For once Godzilla really earns his victory. Trust me Godzilla fans this is the stuff.Once Megaguirus is dryroasted Godzilla falls victim to the Dimension Tide's black hole. Or does he? Watch all the way through the credits for the answer to that question.As is apparent from my synopsis this movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense even by the somewhat dubious standards of the Godzilla series. To that I say who cares? This is one of the few times where I'm utterly willing to overlook such things because this is the rare Godzilla flick where the story with the humans is actually interesting and lively. If you like this kind of stuff definitely check it out!  FINAL EL BUNCHO GRADE A SOLID 9 OUT OF A POSSIBLE 10.".

Fans who complain that too many of the Big G's more recent battles have been decided by beam contests should delight in the wacky grappling on display here.The human characters have interesting motivations and are even allowed to be selfish which is a nice change of pace from the preachy and saintly types you usually get in these movies. There's even a cute kid who manages not to be annoying. In short it's all good  I like the silly monsters AND the incredibly earnest humans AND the totally insane visual effects.

	schema:reviewBody "Version Eastern Eye R4 DVD  Japanese English subtitlesGodzilla is back to stomp all over Japan but this time he has to fight a giant dragonfly... Sounds awesome yes no?In 1996 Japan has been running on clean renewable energy for thirty years and has not seen Godzilla since 1966. Clean energy can no longer provide enough power for Japan the government begins research into neutron energy. Naturally Godzilla takes the opportunity to announce his coming out of retirement and levels the neutron facility while decimating the antiGodzilla force 'GGrasper'. Obviously military's plan was to confuse Godzilla with a funny name and then fire a few missiles at him. Needless to say it doesn't work.Several years later Kiriko Tsujimori Misato Tanaka  a survivor of GGrasper's 1996 encounter with Godzilla  is now the GGrasper commander and has a grudge against Godzilla. Obviously GGrasper need a new weapon to take on Godzilla and so they turn to Japan's crazy scientists. The result is a cannon called the 'Dimension Tide' a weapon designed to shoot black holes which they intend to shoot at Godzilla from space to minimize the damage to Earth. Obviously no one thought of any possible negative consequences of shooting a black hole  from space mind you  towards a moving target Earth. The mad scientists have really gone off the deep end here. Of course they test it first and open up a rift to another dimension letting a swarm of Meganuron oversized dragonflies through.Essentially 'Godzilla vs Megaguirus' is a lighter happier version of both 'Godzilla vs Destroyer' and 'Gamera 2'. The Meganuron  Megaguirus greatly resembles the Legion from 'Gamera 2'. The shots of Godzilla being swarmed by the Meganuron look much like the shots of Gamera being swarmed by the Legion. However going one up on the other two movies 'Godzilla vs Megaguirus' has better special effects. The 'Alien' style Meganuron look a lot better than the 'Alien' style Destroyers from 'Godzilla vs Destroyer'. Also it has mad scientists. A big bonus. They might not look like mad scientists but they certainly think like them.There is some nice monster action even if it is heavily offset by the human characters running shooting black holes at things. The Tokyo showdown between Godzilla vs Megaguirus is fun. It may not come close to one of the best monster fight scenes but its funny and entertaining. Smart use of CGI ensures the monsters and fights look good but on the other hand for a giant dragonfly Megaguirus does not beat his wing that often.'Godzilla vs Megaguirus' is a fun Godzilla movie and should appeal to Godzilla fans. It does drag on a little though  710".

	onyx:emotionText "Version Eastern Eye R4 DVD  Japanese English subtitlesGodzilla is back to stomp all over Japan but this time he has to fight a giant dragonfly... Sounds awesome yes no?In 1996 Japan has been running on clean renewable energy for thirty years and has not seen Godzilla since 1966. Clean energy can no longer provide enough power for Japan the government begins research into neutron energy. Naturally Godzilla takes the opportunity to announce his coming out of retirement and levels the neutron facility while decimating the antiGodzilla force 'GGrasper'. Obviously military's plan was to confuse Godzilla with a funny name and then fire a few missiles at him. Needless to say it doesn't work.Several years later Kiriko Tsujimori Misato Tanaka  a survivor of GGrasper's 1996 encounter with Godzilla  is now the GGrasper commander and has a grudge against Godzilla.

	schema:reviewBody "...Hard to say. The original 1954 preRaymond Burr was always my favorite but having had the privilige of seeing it a couple of weeks ago I'm tempted to put this one at the top of my list. As good as GODZILLA 2000 was this one definitely blows that out of the water better acting storyline and special effects and more screen time for the Big G. The opening scene depicts Godzilla's 1954 attack on Tokyo not as stock footage from the classic original but a restaging of scenes done in newsreel stylevery well done but all too brief. The action then shifts to the year 1966 as the monster attacks a nuclear power plant which as the story goes forces the Japanese government to outlaw nuclear energy. After yet another attack on another Japanese city this time in 1996 a new weapon designed to create an artificial black hole is used against Godzilla with catastrophic results. During the initial testing a horde of prehistoric insects is released resulting in the creation of Megaguiris a mutated dragonflyscorpion creature.The battle scenes between Godzilla and Megaguiris are the finest I've ever seen in any Godzilla movie before or since  then again I've yet to see GMK ! .  Also the design of Megaguiris while not totally original works well here. One may even be reminded of the demon locusts from the Book of Revelation hideous insectlike creatures with scorpion tails and wings. Whether or not this inspired the design of Megagurius is anyone's guess. Still this is a much more worthy opponent than Orga from G2000.All in all for my money GxM was a worthwhile moviegoing experience. And for those whose only exposure to Godzilla was the awful GODZILLA'S REVENGE or Centropolis's Fraudzilla give this one a chance. You'll be glad you did.Rating   out of ".

	schema:headline " Better Than G2000 Much Better!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best Godzilla movies ever!!! The first Millennium Gfilm I ever saw  on SciFi. It is a huge improvement over Godzilla 2000 and in my opinion should've been released in American theaters instead. This movie gives the feeling of the classic Godzilla films but at the same time still has that modern awe that is much better than in disappointing Godzilla 2000.The characters are fantastic and deliver great performances. It was good to see Yuriko Hoshi return to the Gfranchise and Kirko and Kudo both kept the emotional side going with some actually funny humor. I LOVE the whole conspiracy idea with Sigiura all thanks to the marvelous screenplay. We can understand the characters and why they do what they do even Godzilla. Mazaaki Tezuka directs the film amazingly and I love the opening scene with the original Gojira footage but with the new Godzilla added to it. The plot was an excellent piece of writing by Wataru Mimura and Hiroshi Kashiwabara. Dimension Tide was a very cool new weapon that was nicely done. Kenji Suzuki's work is great and the flooded Tokyo is totally convincing. This leads to our spectacular monsters.Godzilla looks mostly the same but is much better characterized as the symbolic antihero. The nuclear message is a nice part of the story. Both the Meganulon and Meganula look incredible and the metamorphism scenes look just as good. One of the film's best shots is when the whole side of a building is covered in Meganula who metamorphize and begin to wreak havoc on Tokyo. Megaguirus is an excellent villain much better than Orga. We finally see a true battle of speed and the battle between Godzilla and Megaguirus is one of the best ever!! Megaguirus' energy vacuum needle was a clever attack and the fight is interesting because the Monster King is forced to fight without his heat ray. Another nice touch is the 'camp' that fits in great during the final battle. The island battle with the swarm of Meganula was an excellent display of modern Toho effects at work and the action is superb in this film. The dramatic final climatic showdown between Godzilla and GGraspers is a nice ending that  stay tuned after the credits gets even better! The film would be truly incomplete without Michuru Oshima's excellent score.All together this is one incredible Gfilm that I'm glad to have seen. If you haven't seen it you definitely need to buy yourself a copy. Now!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Masaaki Tezuka clearly understands the secret to making rubber monster movies  make 'em big and make 'em fun! GXM returns the element of spectacle to the series that had been missing in the later 90s entries. The battles are epic the monsters believably gigantic and menacing and the destruction sweeping. When crowds of extras run away in GXM they look genuinely terrified. The wonderful musical score and old school directorial style come as close to rivalling the best of HondaTsuburayaIfukube as anything Toho has done since their heyday. Perhaps most important the monsters have personalities without sacrificing menace. No more stiff slowmoving suits lumbering in a straight line toward one another for a battle consisting primarily of optical effects. Both Godzilla and Megaguiras are intelligent cunning combatants and their climactic war is among the best of its kind ever filmed. On a whole GXM is not as flashy or technically seamless as its followup 2001's GMKalso an outstanding film but I found it to be more fun. It reminded me of nothing so much as curling up on the floor on Saturday as a kid watching an AIP rubber monster epic on Shock Theatre or Son of Svengoolie. GODZILLA VS MEGAGUIRUS is a genuine classic!".

Michiru Oshima's score is great far better than Takayuki Hattori's limp work on G2K. Kenji Suzuki creates the best special effects in the history of the franchise. The combinations of suitimation and CGI on display are sublime rivaling Hollywood work and the characters interact with Godzilla with greater complexity than ever before. The heroine actually rides Godzilla through the ocean in one scene!Still the movie has less realistic grit than Godzilla 2000 did and the story and characters are much less engaging with the exception of the heroine's revenge motive. The movie plays less like a sequel to the original and more like an episode of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. But that's not necessarily all bad.".

Don't worry Gojira fans the movie's title is not Tom Boy kicks Gojira's ass so you know who's the boss. And this one's got a trick up its sleeve too! I'm sure you'll all fall for it. This movie has nothing to do with Gojira 2000 if you couldn't stand that little brat and the journalist or worse the guy who's last wishes were GOJIRAAAAAAA. I won't say action girl in here does better than Jean Reno in the infamous Godzilla but the monster she's fighting is more lovingly menacing. No raptor lookalikes running around here. Just the big G and her. The music also changed. Each movie in the new Gojira trilogy must have been made for different audiences. This one is for the wide moviegoing female audience between the kids for whom they made Gojira 2000 and the otakus and diehard fans for whom they've made Daikaiju Soukougeki.".

Where do I begin?Well let's start with the latest scheme by the Japanese to rid them of Godzilla once and for all. Shoot him with a black hole from outer space. Yup that is practically mishap proof. Now I know that dumping Oxy Clean into Tokyo harbor killed the first Godzilla and since then some fairly dubious scientific methods have been used to battle our green friend but a satellite that shoots black holes has to win some sort of award. I love the scene when the scientist asks the military man after we destroy Godzilla we destroy the satellite right? You can practically see visions of Pearl Harbor 2 in the general's head.To make matters even worse they already have a team battling Godzilla embarrassingly called GGrasper not to be confused with our satellite scheme Project Dimension Tide that sounds like a really bad futuristic laundry detergent. The GGraspers are lead by the all too cute Misato Tanaka who looks like Amelie joined the French Foreign Legion. GGraspers fight Godzilla by shooting RPGs at his ankles while dressed as FedEx deliverymen. Surprisingly this isn't effective. Now I can take miscast actors and silly story lines in a Godzilla film but at least the special effects are good right? Nope. Megaguirus is clearly on strings in one scene. The fights have groan inducing wrestling moves. Building destruction is surprisingly light. There is way too much bad CGI. In addition there a lot of underwater scenes which lets face it has never been a Godzilla strong suit.This is not excusable for new millennium Godzilla. On the plus side nice there is some nice Mimic action with bugs killing young lovers. But when you start feeling like apologizing to Matthew Broderick it's a sign of a bad Godzilla movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "After Tristar failed to impress with its infamous 1998 remake Toho wanted to redeem their beloved kaiju's honor by starting the Millennium films. This series started off pretty strong with Godzilla 2000 but then went downhill with this next installment. How so?Plot Set in an alternate history where Godzilla was never killed by the Oxygen Destroyer the King of the Monsters has Japan living in terror in his shadow for years. Fed up with his destructive antics the military force known as GGraspers recruits a few of the most brilliant minds to create the ultimate weapon Dimension Tide a cannon that fires miniature black holes. During one of DT's tests however a wormhole is formed causing giant prehistoric dragonflies to come forth chief among them being their parasitic queen Megaguirus. When Godzilla suddenly reappears it becomes a threeway struggle between man reptile and bug.Positives Godzilla retains his look from Godzilla 2000 a radical but cool design but this time he is actually green instead of charcoal greyblack. He's also given a bit of personality with simple but subtle movements giving the viewer an idea of what he is thinking. In an interesting move Toho brought back the insects Meganulons based on an actual extinct species called Meganeura from Rodan and gave them a modern update. They're legitimately creepy and Megaguirus is a nice foe for Godzilla being not only brutal but pretty sadistic. I have to admit using a black hole gun against Godzilla is creative proving once again that there is still room for imagination in a series about a giant citysmashing monsterbashing dinosaur. The film's central theme is an interesting one to say the least how man seeks newer and hopefully cleaner sources of power but somehow keeps failing with Godzilla and Megaguirus being dark parallelsantitheses of that concept. The music is also decent the main theme of which gets carried on in future films and the action is entertaining enough with a few unexpectedly funny moments.Where this film falls flat is ultimately the execution of every aspect of it. While some of the practical stuff looks fine a majority of the effects are terribly outdated especially when compared to other Godzilla films like Godzilla 2000 the predecessor manages to hide its flaws as most of the kaiju scenes happen at night while most of this film occurs during the day where the flaws are far more noticeable. The suitspuppets despite having decent range of motion tend to feel stiff and the CGIgreen screen are far too obvious and not wellrendered. The movie really does seem cheap because of these shortcomings. While some effort was put in the human characters most of them don't leave that big of an impression. Technician Kudo is at least amusing in that he's a bit egotistical in his talents but is still willing to help others especially his crush Major Kiriko. As the female lead an attempt was made in making Kiriko compelling but she fails to pull any heartstrings and almost comes off as a b plus her vendetta against Godzilla doesn't hold much weight when you really consider her choices within her backstory. Hell some of the human characters make decisions that don't have any legit sense of logic. Finally the film has many great ideas but doesn't go far enough with them especially when you get down to the insects which seem more of an inconvenience to the humans rather than a serious threat rivaling Godzilla therefore there's this lack of presence to them from time to time.This is by far the weakest of the Millennium films a good concept hampered by an underwhelming execution. This may be worth a watch but it would be best viewed with low expectations. Not the worst in the franchise cough Godzilla's Revenge but not the best either.".

	schema:reviewBody "Because Godzilla vs Megaguirus GxM hasn't been released in the U.S. I had to purchase a regionfree dvdrom for my PC purchase dvddecoder software download software to make the dvddecoder software regionfree and finally order the dvd itself from Hong Kong.  After assembling all the parts I crossed my fingers and hoped it would work!  Thankfully all the work paid off!Warning there may be a few spoilers here.Needless to say with all the effort that went into it I was very excited to finally see GxM.  I'd read so much about it that my anticipation level was high.  On top of that although many people were disappointed with Godzilla 2000 G2K I loved it and had high hopes that GxM would improve on its good points.  To me G2K was a welcome break from the Heisei series formula of a super elite Gfighting force with atleast one person with an axe to grind a super sophisticated scifi jet various outerspace scenes and a monster with plasticglowing eyes especially the bugmonsters with their jiggly legs.  Don't get me wrong I enjoyed all of the Heisei movies but G2K had a darker more serious tone and I hoped for more of same in GxM.Except for the Gsuit which I really like GxM wasn't what I expected at all.  Rather than a dark brooding angry Gmovie GxM is a step back into Heisei time.  Here's what I mean  The Griffon super jet is pretty much an updated Super X.  The GGraspers is yet another ultrasophisticated elite Gfighting force  how many are there now?  The ragtag stormchaser team in G2K was a slightly different take that seemed more interesting to me. And Megaguirus looked a lot like the bug monsters we've seen before  Battra comes to mind.   In addition as if to give a nod to Gamera the scene where the little dragonflies swarm Godzilla looked a little bit too much like the scene in Gamera 2 when the Legion swarmed Gamera.Also the pacing of GxM was a little bit slow to me.  Many people complained that G2K was slow and that Big G was missing for 40 minutes so I'm surprised that there aren't more complaints about this movie.  GxM opens with some Gaction footage and then there's a long span of time in which we learn all about the new scifi weapon and other things before G shows up again.  Again the Heisei comparison  the pacing was very similar to most of the Heisei movies.  I swear the folks who made this movie must have watched Godzilla and Mothra The Battle For Earth right before making this one. Anyway there's lots of action at the end of GxM but I don't care what anyone says  the ending in G2K is way better!Aside from those gripes I thought the movie was technically excellent and included some of the best spfx sequences I've seen in a Gmovie.  The scenes where the woman rides on G's back in the ocean and the minisub explores the partially submerged city were interesting and very convincing.   Also the scene where G walks up onto the beach on the island is a major spfx improvement over a similar beach landing scene in G2k.  Overall as compared to some of the rough around the edges spfx in G2K GxM looked more polished.  The makers obviously spent a lot of time on the details.Sorry Gfans I don't mean to be so supercritical.   Believe it or not I really liked GxM  it's an excellent addition to the Gcatalog and is a lot of fun to watch.  I would highly recommend it to all Gfans but don't expect anybody besides a true Gfan to really appreciate it  this may be why it hasn't been dubbed and released in the U.S.  I've heard the movie they made last year Godzilla Mothra and King Ghidorah GMK is even better and will be released on DVD this summer.  Also I hear a new version of Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla is being made now and they're going back to the G2KGxM style Gsuit!  So there's lots to look forward to!  And this time I'm regionfree and ready!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Godzilla series came to a dramatic end with the death of Godzilla after 22 films and 41 years in GODZILLA VS. DESTROYER spelled in the U.S. release as DESTOROYAH in 1995. The survival of little Godzilla grown up from Baby Godzilla in the two previous films paved the way for a sequel. Instead sequel plans were squelched by Sony's planned American version which came out in 1998 and Toho Pictures instead produced a series of three new Mothra movies. After Godzilla fans expressed supreme disappointment with the Hollywood remake Toho revived the franchise in Japan with GODZILLA 2000 which dispensed with all of the history and events of every Godzilla movie since the first one and was touted by Toho as a sequel to the very first Godzilla movie 1954. Some Godzilla fans bought this and some didn't causing great debate over the film's merits or lack thereof. Leaving aside the issue of where the film fits in the Godzilla timeline G2K still came up short in the areas of monster battles and urban destruction. MEGAGUIRUS is a halfhearted effort to keep the franchise alive until someone can come up with new ideas. It offers a bit more action and urban rampage than G2K and features a couple of nononsense women as the leading characters. It has no real relation to any other Godzilla movies and simply treats Godzilla as a monster menace who needs to be stopped at all costs. The military and government agencies charged with the task of stopping the Big G come up with a device called Dimension Tide that's designed to create a black hole that will presumably suck in Godzilla. In the course of testing it they somehow create giant dragonflies which morph into an awkward clunky flying insectoid monster dubbed Megaguirus by some handy old male scientist whose only role in the film is to tell us this. Before the morphing the dragonflies invade Tokyo causing a devastating flood which inundates the Shibuya district. What causes the dragonflies to transform into the monster is never explained. G and MegaG eventually battle it out in Tokyo to great destructive effect.The human cast is thankfully rather small and they keep to their assigned roles efficiently in contrast to the overbearing busybodies in G2K who kept getting into G's face sometimes literally!. Interestingly the two female lead characters one an officer Misato Tanaka devoted to neutralizing Godzilla and the other an older scientist Yuriko Hoshi overseeing the Dimension Tide project dominate the action with their resolute behavior and forceful personalities. The actresses are quite good and one wishes they'd been given a little more to do with their characters but not too much.While this film decidedly breaks no new ground it does offer enough action and destruction to please the less discriminating Godzilla fans. Although its effects are not sophisticated enough for the jaded palates of today's JURASSIC PARKweaned monster fans the film's bursts of imagination might well surprise them.".

	schema:headline " Acceptable but can't hold a candle to at least three of its Millennium series successors";
	schema:reviewBody "I was pleased that Toho was continuing to explorer new monsters with this film. In fact I really liked Megaguirus' origins. I also like that they tried for a slightly scarier experience particularly the alley scene.And yet I rate the film only 610. Outside of the monster action much of the rest of the movie is fairly dull as is the female lead. I also find the Dimension Tide piece of the plot almost too silly. A manmade mini black hole fired at Godzilla from a satellite in space? Oh come on! That's gotta be more outlandish than aliens. The special effects were only okay but with three notable bad points. The SGS looks like a small toy the Meganula on Godzilla's hide looked iffy and when Megaguirus first appears the wires are visible. But on the whole the effects were otherwise pretty good.This was the second installment of Godzilla's Millennium series and after watching these two you might not be inspired to watch the next four movies unless you're a major Japanese monster movie or Godzilla fan which I am. But rest assured the rest of the series picks up even Final Wars. As a final word if you don't really care how loony some of the plot is then you'll probably enjoy this movie more than a 610 no problem. If you want to give the Godzilla franchise a try though I'd check out GMK or Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla and Godzilla Tokyo SOS before this one.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was pleased that Toho was continuing to explorer new monsters with this film. In fact I really liked Megaguirus' origins. I also like that they tried for a slightly scarier experience particularly the alley scene.And yet I rate the film only 610. Outside of the monster action much of the rest of the movie is fairly dull as is the female lead. I also find the Dimension Tide piece of the plot almost too silly. A manmade mini black hole fired at Godzilla from a satellite in space? Oh come on! That's gotta be more outlandish than aliens. The special effects were only okay but with three notable bad points. The SGS looks like a small toy the Meganula on Godzilla's hide looked iffy and when Megaguirus first appears the wires are visible. But on the whole the effects were otherwise pretty good.This was the second installment of Godzilla's Millennium series and after watching these two you might not be inspired to watch the next four movies unless you're a major Japanese monster movie or Godzilla fan which I am. But rest assured the rest of the series picks up even Final Wars. As a final word if you don't really care how loony some of the plot is then you'll probably enjoy this movie more than a 610 no problem.

	schema:reviewBody "The Godzilla Millennium series is infamous for its lack of continuity. A majority of the six films in this series were each made as a direct sequel to the original Godzilla film like this one and almost none of the films connect except for Godzilla X Mechagodzilla and Godzilla Tokyo SOS. This film is about a female Japanese soldier who is out to avenge the death of her colleague who was killed by Godzilla. She is part of the project team that created the Gryphon a hightech ship and the Dimension Tide a device that creates artificial black holes. Once activated this black hole will suck in everything in its path and they hope they can vanquish Godzilla in this way. Unfortunately their testing mutates insect eggs that hatch into dragonflylike bugs called Meganurons. These creatures need water to grow and they feed on the energy of humans. After gathering enough energy they transform in to giant dragonfly monsters called Meganuras and eventually they bring enough energy to awaken their queen Megaguirus. When Megaguirus and Godzilla meet it is the usual monster battle in the heart of the city.The special effects were quite good. But the storyline is serviceable at best because this movie mainly focuses on the female lead and her quest for revenge rather than the monsters. Being a film that is supposed to be made as a direct sequel to the original 1954 Godzilla film more emphasis should have been placed on Godzilla his origins and his reason for returning to Japan after being killed off in the original Godzilla movie. Godzilla basically appears on cue in this film with only slight references of his passed attacks on Tokyo in 1954 and in the 1960s and 1990s. As a direct sequel to the original Godzilla the monster should have been given a more intriguing entrance which would generate more suspense like his entrance in the 1984 film The Return of Godzilla Godzilla 1985. With this and other films in the Millennium series too much attention was focused on the military and a character's personal vendetta against Godzilla. One notable mention for this film is the return of actress Yuriko Hoshi who played the photographer in Mothra vs. Godzilla 1964 and the reporter in Ghidrah the ThreeHeaded Monster 1964.One of the things I like about this film is that unlike most of the other movies in the Millennium series this one introduced a new monster. Megaguirus is one of the few monsters that were originally created for the Millennium series and I thought it was wellexecuted. The Meganurons attacking citizens with Michiru Ohshima's moving and catchy music score in the background is pretty intriguing. Overall there are plenty of monster and human action but overshadowed by a pretty dull plot and climax capping off what is a lackluster Godzilla film. Grade D".

They have not just improved their SPFX but their stories are well done with characters to match. 2000 saw the release of Godzilla vs. Megaguirus. The story In an effort to destroy the energyhungry Godzilla the GDefense Bureau has developed a miniature black hole that they hope will swallow Godzilla for good. After they test the weapon it opens a temporary tiny hole to the past. A young boy finds a large prehistoric egg at the test spot and brings it to his new home in Osaka. From there it winds up in their sewer system where a small egg colony grows. These hatch into 10 foot killer dragonflies. They feed upon Godzilla's blood and in turn feed it to a huge version of themselves. Naturally it takes an instant dislike to Godzilla. There are some great effects on show here both CGItype and miniature. As usual in this new series the people are well drawn and we care about them. It's a shame that this one hasn't come to America. I'm on the fence about releasing it here considering how they cut up Godzilla 1984 and Godzilla 2000. They should just leave them as is. Well worth tracking down. Rating 6 out of ten. Great for anyone over the age of 8 but with some adult concepts for those over 16 a hint of romance corruption in high places etc..".

There are very little complaints to be had in a matter of fact there is nothing I find bad about it. Even with all the comedic effects in the final fight it just adds to the enjoyment factor because you can laugh at the goofyness.I really like the time line this film has it's great to see recreated footage of the first film. I don't know why but I really like how Godzilla was portrayed in this. He wasn't random like he was every other film. He only came up to destroy stuff when he sensed radiation or plasma. If anything the humans are more aggressive than Godzilla. He's just chilling out in the middle of the ocean and uhoh there's the humans. Out of all the films this one you could make a commentary out of what he was thinking. It's funny how humans release a meganula because of their dimension tide machine. I want to know what's on the other side of the black hole there's a lot of possibilities. Anyway some dumb ass kid picks up it's egg and brings it with him to Tokyo. And he just ends up dumping it into the sewers because he had super human strength to lift up the man hole. So it hatches it eats some people and now there is about a thousand of them. When they swarm Godzilla it reminds me of mosquito's swarming me when ever I go out side. The final set looks great the fight is pretty good their was a lot of funny moments. So Godzilla saves humanity from being over run by a Megawhatever you call itguirus threat. And how do they repay him well trying to suck him up into a black hole. And there's also the plot about stupid humans being the only reason Godzilla keeps entering Japanese soil instead of just chilling out in the ocean. But luckily for Godzilla the dimension tide failed and he still walks free. The ending was very well done it puts a big smile on your face that Godzilla is truly unstoppable. And I should mention that the music is very good.So looking back this film was one the most well done in the series it just feels great to watch and it's a lot of fun.".

	schema:headline " Something of a letdown";
	schema:reviewBody "During an experiment with a hallucinogenic drug model Valentina Nieves Navarro aka Susan Scott sees a woman being brutally murdered by a man wearing a spiked iron glove. But when no body is found she can't seem to get anyone to believe her story. She begins to see the killer everywhere she goes. She's sure her life is in danger and is unable to convince her friends or the police that she's being stalked by a vicious murderer.I had high hopes for Death Walks at Midnight having just seen and enjoyed Death Walks on High Heels. The two movies have so much in common that it seemed like a sure thing. While not being a sequel the two movies share a director a number of actors and a convoluted plot. But while I found the twists and turns in Death Walks on High Heels a joy to watch unfold Death Walks at Midnight is a little too convoluted for its own good. Story lines are introduced and almost dropped immediately with no resolution. These story tangents have nothing to do with the plot other than muddying the waters. Characters are introduced with no background information and almost immediately forgotten about. Too many of the characters never seem real or fleshedout and are not effective red herrings. And I almost get the feeling that much of the movie is weird for the sake of being weird. There's no real purpose for many of the unusual events people places etc. in Death Walks at Midnight other than adding some bizarreness to the proceedings. For example why even have the asylum scene? It adds nothing to the film. The problems with the plot are really disappointing because not only did I enjoy the first movie but Death Walks at Midnight's screenplay was written by Sergio Corbucci. Corbucci directed some of my favorite Spaghetti Westerns. But here he's written what I'll describe as a spastic script that tries too hard to be different.That's not to say the movie was a total waste of time. There are a number of things I really enjoyed about Death Walks at Midnight. First would have to be Nieves Navarro. As I said when writing about Death Walk on High Heels Navarro is excellent in this kind of film. She's a natural playing the Woman in Distress. Navarro has a real undeniable screen presence. Second would have to be the spiked glove. It's as nasty a murder weapon as you'll see. Finally I like the overall look of the film. Ercoli had a real eye for some interesting visuals.In the end I can't wholeheartedly recommend Death Walks at Midnight to anyone other than a die hard Giallo fan. There are far better more entertaining examples of the genre that might appeal more to the casual fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "DEATH WALKS AT MIDNIGHT Luciano Ercoli  ItalySpain 1972.Before the DVDage the only English title for this film I know of is CRY OUT IN TERROR after the soundtrack released on LP and later on expanded edition CD. This is not mentioned on the IMDb as the film never got a proper release in Englishspeaking regions not even on video to my knowledge. Adding to the confusion this title was already hardly distinguishable from Ercoli's earlier DEATH WALKS ON HIGH HEELS 1970 largely the same theme cast and music and I've noticed that in reviews on some sites this is treated as a followup to Ercoli's first Giallo FORBIDDEN PHOTOS OF A LADY ABOVE SUSPICION 1970 clearly confusing this film with DEATH WALKS ON HIGH HEELS which is Ercoli's second Giallo.Written by six writers! among them Sergio Corbucci and Ernesto Gastaldi the film is set in Milan. Valentina Susan Scott or Nieves Navarro a successful model agrees to try a hallucinogenic drug as part of a scientific experiment. While under the influence she experiences some flashbacks of a man in sunglasses graphically murdering a woman with a spiked metal glove quite an original murder weapon. Strangely enough a woman was butchered in exactly the same manner in a vacant apartment. The killer lures Valentina into this apartment after which she narrowly escapes with her life. What follows are more attempts on her life and even more questions about the killer's identity. Mindbending drugs and outrageous fashions with plenty of tacky '70s dance floor scenes abound in this in this convoluted murder mystery. I might have been a bit harsh in my judgement on Ercoli's DEATH WALKS ON HIGH HEELS but no matter how many reservations I have regarding his output I've grown a bit fond of his work. This one is the weakest entry in his Giallocycle but I cannot dismiss it either. It's rather disappointing because of its confusing plot and ridiculous finale complete with a gang of giggling thugs. Gianno Ferrio's score is no patch on Morricone's scores in earlier Ercoli films but its sheer luridness makes for some reasonably tacky entertainment.Camera Obscura  610".

She then finds herself stalked by the killer and drawn into a complex web of shady goings on including drug trafficking and murder.This movie is quite disappointing when compared to its predecessor the effective Death Walks on High Heels. However it starts extremely well. The trip murder sequence is well handled. Its both visceral and dreamlike with a memorably creepy looking killer. Unfortunately this excellent opening is the highlight of the movie. There are a number of other effective setpieces but the movie gets bogged down a bit with excessively convoluted plot lines. There is a large cast of characters and it becomes difficult keeping track of who did what where. Everything is wrapped up when most of the remaining cast members get involved in a ridiculous but fun fight on a rooftop.This is not a great giallo however it is certainly likable. Susan Scott is as ever great value in the lead role. She carries the film through the less interesting phases ensuring that things never really get boring. Simn Andreu also is reliable. Ercoli shoots the film well and the decor is impressive. Overall this is a beautiful looking well acted but somewhat silly giallo. Its not one of the best from the genre but it is fun in a camp sort of way.".

Anyway perhaps I'm a little slow on the ol' rebop but I had to watch this picture almost three full times before it began to make a bit of sense to me. The plot is a bit convoluted to say the least and whereas in most gialli I make an attempt usually a fruitless one to spot the killer here I was hard pressed just to barely keep up. Still brain twisting as the film is it did ultimately kinda sorta make sense to me just don't ask me to explain it out loud!. And the picture does have a lot going for it stylish direction beautiful photography of the city of Milan and its countryside yet another supersexy performance from Susan Scott a catchy score by Gianni Ferrio several not overly gory homicides and a furious rooftop dukeout to cap off the film.

The movie also features a very unique murder weapona giant spiked metal glove or armored fist as Navarro keeps calling itwhich makes mincemeat of the faces of the various female victims like many gialli this film is a strange mixture of feminism and misogyny. Finally there is the upbeat score which probably should be in a better movie but does serve to keep things rolling along. I wouldn't go through the expense and trouble of buying the imported British DVD like I did but I guess this is worth watching if you get a chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "It would seem that many fans don't consider 'Death Walks at Midnight' to be a good film and while it's not a first class addition to the Giallo subgenre I rather liked it. The film is far less graphic than many Giallo fans will be used to and there aren't many murders. The first and central murder leads you to believe that this film will feature more bloodshed as the film goes on but the plot veers offcourse often and the film doesn't always focus on the murder themed plot. The first murder is so striking largely because of the murder weapon used I've never seen a spiked glove before and the murder scene is stylishly shot and gives the odd murder weapon a good environment to operate in. The plot is coscripted by two prominent forces in Italian films Sergio Corbucci 'Django' and more importantly Ernesto Gastaldi who has a number of important Giallo classics under his belt most notably Sergio Martino films such as Your Vice and The Case of the Scorpion's Tail. It follows a woman who tries out an experimental drug and while under its influence witnesses the aforementioned graphic murder.The plot seems like an all too obvious excuse for a different perspective on the common Giallo theme of someone witnessing a murder and as it isn't given explanation it doesn't come off as being very credible. Director Luciano Ercoli makes up for this however with a constant stream of odd events and a good eye for striking cinematography and although the plot soon becomes convoluted and often relies on coincidence it's always engaging and there's a lot of good ideas on display. The beautiful Susan Scott a.k.a. Nieves Navarro who has worked with Ercoli on films such as Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion and Death Walks on High Heels heads an interesting cast and does a good job of holding the film together. The fact that we know who the murderer is from the beginning ensures that there isn't a lot of mystery but this is made up for by the way that there's always something new lurking just around the corner and the script does a good job of implementing red herrings into the plot. The final twist can be seen coming a mile off but the rooftop finale is a treat and overall I've got to say that there's a lot to like about this not often seen Giallo.".

Valentina only participated on condition that her identity is kept secret but the journalist publishes the whole story and now Valentina's life is in danger from the killer.Valentina is then plagued by the killer every where she goes but unfortunately for her nobody else sees the killer.This trend continues as the body count rises the corpses that she sees disappear before the police get there and so nobody believes her fantastic story. One reason the police don't believe Valentina is that there was such a killing but the killer was caught and has been in a mental institution for six months and fob her off as a nut.Valentina goes to check out the killer but when she gets there the killer is not the man in her vision.Is she going mad ?Is she still feeling the effects of the drugs? is she being set up? Beautifully shot with a nice but sparsely used score this Giallo is a huge disappointment from the offset we are lead to believe this might just be a classic of the genre with the opening kill but this film dies a death after its opening gambit.The beautiful Navarro and Simn Andreu have a little chemistry but its not enough to save the film from being quite dull and unimaginative there are no spectacular kills or set pieces to excite us and the distinct lack of suspense puts the final nail in this baby's coffin added to that a propensity for silly comic characters in silly situations is just plain annoying.The sound on the Mondo Macabro DVD is also patchy and quite tinny and with a lot of hiss at times which is infuriating.I do hope the No Shame release next year is better.For Giallo completists only.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rather disappointing and overly ambitious giallo that never is as compelling or exhilarating as it looks. Director Luciano Ercoli Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion has several great ideas and a talented eye for cinematographic elegance but his complex film never really succeeds in delivering genuine frights or commitment with the characters. I as well as my fellow reviewers on this site refer to Death Walks at Midnight as being a giallo but I'm not totally sure if that's what it is in fact. The terrific opening sequences in which heroine Valentina visions a brutal murder whilst under the influence of a new drug definitely are giallomaterial! Mysterious and violent images of murder committed with an unusual weapon in this case a vile looking spiked glove and an unfortunate beauty whose life is in danger because she saw too much. Judging by this fantastic intro it feel like you're about to see a giallo that can easily compete with the best efforts in this superior Italian horror sub genre like for example the earlier work of Dario Argento Bird with the Crystal Plumage The Cat O'Nine Tales Sergio Martino Torso All the Colors of the Dark and even Mario Bava The Girl Who Knew Too Much Blood and Black Lace. But as the plot evolves further the film seems to change into a textbook example of yet another typically Italian exploitation sub genre namely the Krimi which is the European equivalent of complex crimedetective stories. As the plot develops more Valentina finds herself caught in a web of drugtraffic smuggling and doublecrossing and all of a sudden the search for the malevolent killer's identity is put to the background. Bloody murders change into shootouts and horror settings like an asylum or a cemetery suddenly become hectic machofights on rooftops and overlong chases. The inevitable final result is a semigiallo without morbidity andor a semikrimi without rawness.That being said I would like to stress that Death Walks at Midnight still is worth watching especially for people who appreciate a more complex and demanding substance. Although it contains too many unnecessary story lines and underdeveloped characterdrawings this film is often beautiful to look at and the camerawork is handled with flair and style. Susan Scott is a rather good actress and capable of carrying an entirely complex structure that revolves around her. She receives good feedback from the congested supportive cast. Many little gimmicks and details featuring in this story are so ingenious that it could easily be split over two  or maybe three  separate movies.".

Crazy black gloved killer sex and or lots of nudity and violence or at least some 70s psychedelic action and weirdness. It does have an OK plot line a few good bloody scenes and great music from Gianni Ferrio. Still reminds me of a more modern Sherlock Holmes episode and even has a few comedic elements which is not what I look for in a giallo. The basic plot is about Valentina Susan Scott who is stalked by a killer after he finds out that she witnessed a murder while on an experimental drug. The actorsactresses in this movie are boring the fight scenes are boring the killings are boring and Valentinas Susan Scott attitude during the whole movie is very annoying as she has a very smart mouth and seems to have a bad attitude towards men in general. You just can't help but hope she will be the killers next victim and I was happy to see her get smacked around a little in one scene. It took me two times of trying to watch this movie to finally finish it. The movie is still worth having in your collection if you are a gialli collector and Noshame released a great DVD of it and Death Walks in High Heels which came with a 3rd disc titled THE SONGS OF LOVE AND DEATH with music from the great STELVIO CIPRIANI. You should get it if you see it but don't spend too much time and money on it as you will be a bit disappointed if you do.".

I was pleasantly surprised by the former but hugely disappointed by the latter anyway here's my take on both films.The meaninglesslytitled followup DEATH WALKS AT MIDNIGHT was pretty silly and tedious by comparison making use of dreary plot mechanics and wasting its two leads  Navarro Scott and Andreu.The film's most intriguing elements  violent images from the past materializing as druginduced hallucinations and the murder method itself the spiked glove  are thrown away as red herrings in an attempt to liven up a pretty tired formula crimethriller i.e. it's more than just a giallo but unfortunately in this case the whole emerges to be a good deal less than the sum of its parts!Unlike DEATH WALKS ON HIGH HEELS the supporting characters of this one are often sleazeballs and therefore we are never involved in their actions and the motive behind them. A subplot involving a couple of oriental kids is once again irrelevant  padding the story for no reason at all  and the almost farcical fight sequence at the climax is not merely out of place but also rather badly staged! The music score this time around composed by Gianni Ferrio is OK under the circumstances but still nothing special in my opinion.I don't think having watched the film pannedandscanned as opposed to DEATH WALKS ON HIGH HEELS' original Technsicope format had anything to do with my low estimation of DEATH WALKS AT MIDNIGHT actually I'm surprised that Mondo Macabro decided to release this on DVD albeit in a compromised version as it is both dubbed in English and cropped! over its vastly superior  if still basically unremarkable  predecessor which in view of its plentiful nudity of which this has none! and a far more engaging plot I think would have made for a more popular title!In any case I'm interested in catching up with more obscure giallos now and as such I especially regret having missed out on Sergio Pastore's SETTE SCIALLI DI SETA GIALLA aka CRIMES OF THE BLACK CAT 1972 just a couple of days ago!

	schema:reviewBody "Valentina a beautiful fashion model takes an experimental drug as part of a scientific experiment. While influenced by the drug Valentina has a vision of a young woman being brutally murdered with a viciously spiked glove. It turns out that a woman was killed in exactly the same way not long ago and soon Valentina finds herself stalked by the same killer...We should note that other than the lack of Frank Wolff this film very much has the same cast as Death Walks on High Heels. In fact this was the third collaboration between director Luciano Ercoli and legendary screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi. This makes the similar title appropriate and even more appropriate still that Arrow Video has decided to bundle the films together.Midnight draws inspiration from Mario Bava's Girl Who Knew Too Much and both would be precursors to John Carpenter's underappreciated Eyes of Laura Mars. Another scene is clearly an homage to Hitchcock's Rear Window. Tim Lucas points out that this further makes the case for Ercoli being the Italian Brian DePalma as DePalma is seen by many as the American successor to Hitchcock.Lucas notes that the film unusually visually conservative for a giallo due very much to Ercoli's preference for script over image. Lucas calls him a carpenter in his approach. Indeed it is interesting to see how Ercoli works compared to say Dario Argento who filled every inch with color. Ercoli who was above all else concerned with producing keeps it all very simple very sparse. this is not to say he is without the clever shot here and there but it is not the visual feast we might expect.Stuart Galbraith has written that Midnight has a stronger lesspredictable screenplay and a bit more visual flair than its companion film High Heels. I would say he is spot on with this assessment. Although both are great films and High Heels probably has the better killer and soundtrack Midnight seems to be overall the stronger of the two and has more complex characters.Arrow Video has blessed the genre community yet again with their Death Walks twice set. As noted in my separate review Death Walks on High Heels is packed with extras and so is this one! Another very informative Tim Lucas audio commentary really sells it for me but we also have a brand new interview in which Gastaldi discusses Death Walks at Midnight and a career scriptwriting crime films. Oh and a visual essay by Michael Mackenzie exploring the distinctive giallo collaborations between director Luciano Ercoli and star Nieves Navarro. Amazing!".

Valentina is a fashion model this is a giallo after all whose journalist boyfriend manages to talk her into taking an experimental LSDlike drug for the sake of a magazine article. He assures her she'll be wearing a mask and a doctor will administer the drug but once she's high as a kite he takes the mask off and starts taking pictures of her. While she's ripped to the nines and well muntered larging it the 'nth' degree and chewing her cheeks she also has some sort of vision where she sees a man punching a woman in the face over and over again with a spiked glove. Thinking it was all part of the trip the next day she gets sacked from her job and finds her face plastered all over her boyfriend's magazine. She also finds out the 'doctor' was a doorman goes mental and throws a brick through her boyfriend's window. Then she starts seeing that killer around the place and it seems that not only did she not hallucinate a murder but the drug might have triggered a repressed memory of murder she may have witnessed six months before  and it gets even more complicated than that!We know the killer right from the start but we have no idea who he is what he's up to or why someone is in a loony bin for a murder he seemingly committed! Many other characters turn up to badger Valentino and two very shifty gentlemen including a knife throwing giggling Luciano Rossi roll into town for some reason too. The police are pretty much useless in this one so can she turn to one of her two boyfriends for help? That's right two and one of them is a sculptor looking after two Japanese kids for good measure.Just like Ercoli's previous film Death Walks on High Heels this one is a bit too long but the payoff is well worth it! Just about every character that makes it to the end of the film ends up on the roof of an apartment block for a final fightpunch upstabbinggun fight and this is where Ercoli finally unleashes the nastiness. One character even ends up splattered across the pavement with his brains lying next to his head and his cigarette holder poking through his face. Kinds of wakes you up a bit when that happens in a film.So then another good solid beautiful looking giallo from Ercoli. I can't wait to watch the next one Open the Door Get on the Floor Death Walks the Dinosaur!".

	schema:reviewBody "Within only two years director Luciano Ercoli directed two Gialli with a title beginning with La Morte...Death Walks... and starring cultcinema beauty Nieves Navarro  the nearbrilliant La Morte cammina con i tracci alti aka. Death Walks On Highheels 1971 and this one. To be precise he made three Gialli with Nieves Navarro the first being Forbidden Fotos of a Lady Above Suspicion of 1970. I cannot deny that La Morte accarezza a mezzanotte aka. Death Walks at Midnight 1972 is a bit disappointing especially if compared to the aforementioned film from a year earlier. Death Walks At Midnight also raises high hopes due to the two magnificent men who wrote the screenplay Ernesto Gastraldi who penned many great Gialli including Death Walks With Highheels and Sergio Martino's masterpieces and SpaghettiWestern deity Sergio Corbucci director of Django and The Great Silence. While the convoluted plot definitely has its highs and even several downright ingenious moments however it is undeniable that it also has its lows and that the film can't hold up to Ercoli's other Gialli.While testing a new drug in the presence of her journalist boyfriend Gio Simon Andreu sexy model Valentina Nieves Navarro credited here as Susan Scott witnesses an exceptionally brutal murder from the window of her apartment. When she reports the crime the incident is dismissed as a hallucination in a drugged state. By becoming a witness however the beautiful young woman has put her own life at risk... The storyline is nicely convoluted though it has its lengths and is sometimes a bit too confused. The film has many rewarding elements such as the usual nice visual style and great score of early 70s Gialli a likable protagonist played by the ravishing Miss Navarro a highly original murderweapon and lots of red herrings and flashbacks. It is also a bit annoying in some parts the film is full of mostly painful 'jokes' it gets a bit boring in the middle and the investigating police are a bit too stupid and stubborn to be believed. The plot also has some logical holes but overall it is interesting enough for a Giallofan. Personally I didn't much like the first half of the film but it really catches up later. Nieves Navarro is beautiful and great as always Simn Andreu is cool enough as her journalist boyfriend and the other castmembers all fit in well. Regular 'ugly psycho' cultactor Luciano Rossi is once again typecast in a demented role. Overall this is a recommendable film for my fellow Giallofans though I would recommend Death Walks On High Heels ten times over this one.".

I really hoped I wasn't going to be asked to believe in him as any kind of hero. The best of this rotten bunch is probably Gio Simn Andreu another chain smoker notable for constantly running out of matches.Valentina with her incredible mane of red hair whilst under the influence of an experimental drug has a vision of a young woman being brutally murdered by a villainouslooking character with a spiked glove. This shadessporting felon appears to her from then on many times. Is it a product of her addled mind as boneheaded Stefano arrogantly suggests or is the truth more sinister? One thing is certain  any answers don't come easily in this convoluted beautifully shot Italian thriller.In a way you hope that the villain is purely in her mind. The alternative of a highly suspicious macwearing effeminate looking man in outsize sunglasses always lurking in an almost pantomime manner not being seen by anyone but Valentina becomes absurd.Also absurd in a thoroughly appealing way is the somewhat formulaic way the villain or villains when unmasked then take the time to gloat and explain how they got away with their fiendish plan. Here these revelations precipitate a glorious climactic physical fight that only ends after a series of lastminute lifesaving shocks and surprises.A little slow in places and possessing some appallingly chauvinistic behaviour this is nevertheless great fun and another pleasing addition to the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Decent Movie. However slow and convoluted story brings this down.Good Acting Cinematography LightingSets Editing Kills and Music. But the story is so convoluted that it brings the whole movie down. I saw this on youtube so cost was only time. Best parts were the beginning with the first kill then a woman was found with a knife in her chest the fight scene on the roof was good and the guy falling off the building and then they show him splattered on the ground with brain matter good stuff. Rating because of this is a C or 5. If that was missing we are in loser territory with a 4 or 3 and not worth seeing. As is it's worth checking out. Not a great movie but to check out on youtube it's worth it.As a side note I would rather see this movie 10 more times than see Dario Argento's Suspiria or Four Flies on Grey Velvet both garbage movies made by an untalented guy who somehow got into the movie business and somehow got funding and somehow a cult following. Argento sucks. Crap lighting crap cinematography crap music crap killings crap story. Go watch Susperia and try to call it good acting story or cinematography. Crap cartoon lighting. I just watched Four Flies the story is trash even for giallo standards. The acting should be tested for wood particles. I have similar feeling for Mario Bava. Planet of Vampires is trash all around. It's been a while since watching Blood and Black Lace but I was not impressed. Here's one more crap movie Star Wars VII Force Awakens. This is movie is currently being studied as a social experiment. It represents to a certain degree a segment of the population that loves sugar fat and lazy culture. Nonthinking. Nonworking. Everyone want a quick fix.Death Walks at Midnight Is not a great movie. But it is a decent movie. At least it breaths. And is made by people with talent.".

	onyx:emotionText "Decent Movie. However slow and convoluted story brings this down.Good Acting Cinematography LightingSets Editing Kills and Music. But the story is so convoluted that it brings the whole movie down. I saw this on youtube so cost was only time. Best parts were the beginning with the first kill then a woman was found with a knife in her chest the fight scene on the roof was good and the guy falling off the building and then they show him splattered on the ground with brain matter good stuff. Rating because of this is a C or 5. If that was missing we are in loser territory with a 4 or 3 and not worth seeing. As is it's worth checking out. Not a great movie but to check out on youtube it's worth it.As a side note I would rather see this movie 10 more times than see Dario Argento's Suspiria or Four Flies on Grey Velvet both garbage movies made by an untalented guy who somehow got into the movie business and somehow got funding and somehow a cult following. Argento sucks. Crap lighting crap cinematography crap music crap killings crap story. Go watch Susperia and try to call it good acting story or cinematography. Crap cartoon lighting.

	schema:headline " Giallo Walks";
	schema:reviewBody "This review is of the box set of two Luciano Ercoli films DEATH WALKS ON HIGH HEELS and DEATH WALKS AT MIDNIGHT This box set from Arrow Film combines two films by director Luciano Ercoli an Italian director with little output in that role and only double that as a producer. While his output wasn't significant the quality of these two films shows much potential and the fact that had he chosen to do more he would have left a larger legacy behind for others to follow. As it is both films offer wellmade giallo films that fans of the genre will want to add to their collections.The first of the two is DEATH WALKS ON HIGH HEELS and is the better of the two films. The film stars the director's wife Nieves Navarro as Nicole Rochard a wellknown and much sought after striptease artists in France. Nicole's father was a renowned jewel thief and when he's killed someone calls her asking if she has his last score something she knows nothing about.A fan of Nicole's Dr. Robert Matthews attends nearly every performance she has no matter where she's working. After Nicole has an argument with her boyfriend over his drinking due being jealous of her success she finds friendship and love in the arms of Matthews. After a quick romance heads home to England and she accompanies him. He sets her up in a house in the country a place his wife knows nothing about. With promises of leaving her to set up his own practice things begin to happen.Murders of various side characters occur with startling frequency. An attack on Matthews happens his wife the main suspect. Nicole's boyfriend shows in England trying to find her. And a twist near the middle of the film comes completely out of nowhere and sends the film off in a new direction. While this may seem like a brief synopsis to reveal any more would be to spoil the surprises the film has in store.The movie works best as a mystery with clues being presented for the viewer to decipher but all doesn't become clear until the end of the film. What makes it work is that they all make sense and were there for the most part to be seen throughout the film. What makes it even better is the fact that even the most jaded mystery fan might have a difficult time knowing who did what to whom something few mysteries can accomplish these days.The second film DEATH WALKS AT MIDNIGHT once again stars Navarro this time as super model Valentina. Valentina tries an experimental drug in the presence of a reporter friend and while on the drug sees images of a murder taking place. The fact she took the drug ends up in his article and she loses work because of it. It also discusses her visions and suddenly she begins seeing the murderer tracking her. When he makes an attempt on her life only she has seen him. Is there someone out to kill her or is she simply hallucinating it all? Characters appear for no reason with no background only to take center stage at various parts of the film. As viewers even we aren't sure of Valentina's mental state at first. While the film starts with a decent premise it becomes a are you kidding me film as stupid decisions are made from start to finish. An example is after having been attacked by someone she doesn't see Valentina is asked to get in the car of a woman she has never met to talk and go for a drive. Not the smartest thing to do. When the woman abandons her in a mental institution where the convicted killer of the victim she saw in her drugged state is at who is also supposed to be the sister of this woman Valentina leaves only to go with the same woman to another location later on. With enough moments like this the movie became frustrating for me as a viewer.But good or bad the main thing here is that two movies that may have been lost to the world have been rediscovered and brought out in the best possible transfer possible. Arrow once again goes above and beyond to deliver a package that fans will clamor to and others may want to see to get a taste of what giallo is all about if for no other reason than the first film. Both display great cinematography that I've not come to expect in Italian made films from the time. Another plus.Keeping in mind that this is an Arrow Films release you know there will be plenty of extras on hand for those that enjoy them. Included in the box set is a limited edition 60 page booklet with writings from authors Danny Shipka Troy Howarth and Leonard Jacobs all nonfiction writers about the giallo genre that includes stills and posters for both films. For the first film you'll find extras like an introduction by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi an archive interview with Ercoli and Navarro an interview with Gastaldi an interview with composer Stelvio Cipriani the original Italian trailer and an English trailer. On the second film you'll find another introduction by Gastaldi an audio commentary track by film critic Tim Lucas and extended TV version an interview with Gastaldi and a visual essay by Michael Mackenzie discussing the collaborations between Ercoli and Navarro.Fans of giallo will find this a must have. The same for collectors of Italian cinema of that time period. Fortunately for both Arrow Film has done a marvelous job on this one making it one worth owning as well as worth watching for those new to the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "A full action spirited finale cannot make up for the fact that for the previous 100 minutes this has been pretty dire. The lovely Nieves Navarro Susan Scott does well with much screaming and wide eyed horror but barley removes her coat let alone anything else. The dialogue is a real let down and until the very end there seemed to be little of interest at all. The visuals are nothing special the music par for the course and for a giallo this is certainly lacking the sleaze element. Perhaps though this was intended more as a thriller certainly the drug ring theme would seem to suggest this and viewed as such perhaps my comments are harsh. This certainly has it's moments especially the weird penultimate scene in the flat with the crazies and the noose and then of course the marvellous rooftop fight but is slow and unnecessarily confusing along the way.".

The one responsible for talking her into taking HDS was journalist for a rag mag Novello 2000 Gia Valentina's onagain  offagain lover. Gia got a great article out of her revelations regarding the sickening violent attack of a maniac with big black shades and an overcoat burying his iron glove with spikes into the skull of a brunette. Gia reckons she read about sometime ago a similar murder of a stripper named Hlne and is pulling his chain about actually seeing the act take place in vivid detail as it was being carried out..although his suggestion that she possibly saw it happen selfcensored the act in her subconscious with the drug reawakening the memory is probably a more accurate assessment. When the killer discovers her article in the magazine Valentina's life is in danger but the plot doesn't stop here..it's far more complex and stretches it's tentacles beyond what she could possibly have imagined.You get everything a Giallo fan is accustomed to here and then some. The fashions the exotic Milan setting luxurious apartments restaurants and clubs a positively gorgeous lead actress insanely convoluted plot with a plethora of characters coming out of the woodwork a really nasty murder weapon which does some serious damage to a victim's face a series of questionable suspects and colorful villains..including a drugdealing psycho who giggles well orchestrated finale where Gia comes to Valentina's rescue engaging in fisticuffs on top of an apartment complex with those planning to set her up in a murder  suicide scenario with some fabulous setpieces including methods of how Ercoli captures facial reflections and action up close and personal as bodies..and blood as the iron glove stabs the screen fly toward the screen when characters are fighting. The twist is a good one.The plot really places poor Valentina in a difficult predicament for everyone doubts her as she tries her best to get the truth across to Inspector SerinoCarlo Gentiliwho believes she's staging a publicity stunt with Gia sculptor boyfriend StefanoPietro Martellanzawho always dismisses her rantings as a whole bunch of hullabaloo and GiaSimn Andreuwho believes she's seeking revenge against him for the HDS incident and for restitution. After the article is published Valentina is inadvertently involved with a mysterious woman named VerushkaClaudie Langewhose sister was Hlne Verushka's odd asylum doctor husband OttoIvano Staccioliwhose role in the grand scheme of things is of consequence PepitoFabrizio Morescoa pale skinned weirdo with a red scarf often confronting Valentino about their lives being in grave danger and two drug dealers who are tied to a secret mastermind whose operating within Milan. Henri VelaqClaudio Pellegrini the infamous killer of the film is only a piece in a larger puzzle regarding rival drug dealing groups. The empty apartment across from Valentina's pad where Delores was brutally slain is of great importance to the overall story and figures highly into how Valentina become..and remainsinvolved in the story.Navarro proves to be quite a find for me as I make my way through the Giallo genre her elegance and beauty certainly enchanting as is her strength and tenacity when confronting those that question her validity regarding what she knows..as Velaq stalks her no one will take her seriously when she informs them of his actions not to mention the other people who start entering the picture.".

The climax also is rather weak and drawn out lapsing into a violent battle of fist and cuffs that is very much over the top.Despite this the characterizations are better than what is usually expected for the genre and the film does make you want to keep watching if only to see how all the multitude of story elements work together in the end even if it is preposterous.

	schema:headline " Preserving a national treasure";
	schema:reviewBody "Miracle of the White Stallions is a story set in the final days of World War II in Europe. Robert Taylor plays an Austrian Colonel in the German army. Back in his civilian days he was the head of the famous Spanish Riding School in Vienna which featured the famous Lippazaner breed of specially trained horses. The school had been operating in Vienna for four hundred years and its future in doubt with both the American and Russian armies closing in and the Lippazaner mares over in Czechoslovakia. The performances of these horses had entertained Viennese natives and visitors for generations and they were and are considered a national treasure. The film concerns Robert Taylor's efforts to save the horses aided of course by Lilli Palmer playing his wife.The criticism of this film is that Taylor's performance is too wooden. But I think the point is missed that he was a single minded man on a mission and apparently flunked out of diplomacy school. Fortunately he's married to Lilli Palmer who smooths a lot of rough edges out during the film. I think that's what was intended in this script.As the German surrender and Taylor fortunately falls into the hands of the Americans instead of the Russians he manages to interest an American major played by James Franciscus in his quest. Who then in turn interests the theater commander who is George S. Patton.As we learned in the movie Patton George was an old horse cavalry man and even rode in the 1912 Olympics for the United States. Good thing he was in charge instead of Montgomery. Patton is nicely played by character actor John Larch.Others in the cast of this very nice family film are Eddie Albert as Taylor's aide and Curt Jurgens as a weary German general who helps Taylor in his hour of need.Nice piece of family entertainment from the Walt Disney studio.".

	schema:headline " Great Disney film about the White Stallion's of Vienna";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite a rather slow start this film is absolutely classic Disney and well worth the time spent.  Everyone should know the story of the Lipizzaner stallions and Col. Podhajsky the man who risked everything to save them. The stallion's flight from Vienna at the tail end of WWII and the fact that General Patton and the 3rd Army were heavily involved in their rescue is exciting stuff and has achieved almost legendary proportions.  It's to the film's credit that the viewer eventually gets wrapped up in the Colonel's crusade and begins to feel a sense of wonder as random chance and pure luck conspire to save the Lipizzaner breed.I would not have put Robert Taylor in the lead role of Col. Podhajsky though.  As he grew older he got stonelike in his acting and this is one of his more granitefaced performances.  Luckily for us they also cast Curt Jurgens who plays a good Nazi for once.  He is the standout in this production human standout that is the horses are the real stars.  He gives a bravura performance as a German General caught up in the atrocities of war with no idea how he could have ever gone along with the Nazis as long as he has.  His eyes seem to bleed pain and he gives the film a welcome dose of humanity as well as the viewpoint of a person who normally follows orders but who has had enough of doing what he doesn't believe in.  Lilli Palmer plays the Colonel's wife and she is more than adequate to the role.Eddie Albert is used mostly for comic relief as a horse trainer even singing a Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman song for us fortunately he's good no matter what he does.  And an extremely young James Franciscus is an Army Major who plays a big role in interesting Patton in the horses and also in liberating the mares and foals from a Russian onslaught in Czechoslovakia and also a huge lot of American GI's being held prisoner in the same place his 1000watt smile is a welcome addition.Bottom line this is a wonderful film for the entire family if you can get the kids to sit still through the slow beginning the older they are the easier it will be.  It's a film about a littlepublicized event in WWII and shows how the two sides worked sidebyside to save a treasured piece of Viennese history.  The horses are gorgeous and we don't see near enough of them which is the only real detriment to this fine film about the marvelous White Stallions of Vienna and the Spanish Riding School.".

The film works the familyoriented animal interest of the Lippizan horses into the framework of a dramatic and often suspenseful wartime adventure. One needn't be a horselover to be caught up in the story and end up caring about the animals which in this film are symbols of art grace and beauty surviving a wartorn world. The audience is teased with glimpses of the stallions at play and in training and learns to appreciate their value so that the fullblown horseshow finale comes as a welcome joy. The wellproduced movie was filmed on location in Austria and is handsomely photographed. There is a gripping battle scene and adults will be impressed with the maturity of the entire project.".

This is a stirring piece of history and gallantry by an assortment of real life men and women from Germany Austria and the US. The film was released less than 20 years after the actual events depicted. I have to say upon just seeing it again 50 years later that it more than holds up. Other reviewers here have more than amply explained the plot and my contribution if you will goes like this With all of the varied Disney films through the decades I cannot recall any that was as majestic and carefully produced as this one. Filmed on an obviously healthy budget it is an opulently told story running just under 2 hours. Robert Taylor as the director of the school and Lilli Palmer as his supportive wife are both outstanding. Their commitment to save their beloved horses is not only conveyed convincingly it is realistic with what was going on at the end of WW2 in Europe. Curt Jurgens as a worldweary German officer who movingly laments his self contempt for his recent past as he takes small comfort having provided aid to the imperiled Riding School going against Nazi orders. There are several characters who point that there existed more lifethreatening concerns than saving horses. It was pointed out that a Russian unit did not share horse lovers' concerns and destroyed the Hungarian Riding School's horses when their food supply was running out. The great true story was that the American forces were able to blend the rescue of Allied soldiers and liberation with the expedient but daunting task of rounding up hundreds of horses so that experts could later separate the breeds and care for them accordingly. Many Disney filmseven the most cherishedrarely established such a mature unsweetened film. In no uncertain terms we are shown and explained the formidable liferisking task of preserving a centuries old tradition and magnificent animals when a terrible war's final end threatened their existence.".

Near the beginning of the film she receives a vision of her sister Rama Sabeeha being killed so she desperately tries to stop what she believes is inevitable. Before she can take action her sister disappears. We move five years into the future. After accidentally ending up at the wrong wedding Ram Kumar Jackie Shroff sees Devi and falls in love. He buys the bungalow next to Devi's and courts her. Soon after Devi begins receiving another vision of a woman being murderedonly this time she doesn't know the identity of the victim. Can she find out who the woman is before it is too late? For a film that is occasionally very schizophrenic 100 Days holds together extremely well even seeming tightly focused overall. The disparate elements come by way of the typical range of genres in a Bollywood film. For example in the middle of the opening thriller material all of a sudden director Parto Ghosh breaks out into goofy musical number complete with fauxactionadventurecrime elements interspersed with pie throwing and a fashion display that's right out of a Kajagoogoo videoin other words heavy 1980s style ala leg warmers big hair skinny ties and so on. Then for much of the first hour or so 100 Days becomes more of a light romantic comedy. The thriller material returns stronger in the second half although the musical numbers still tend to lighten the mood more than they ideally should.The tone of the film then is a strong contrast to some of the work of other Indian horrorthriller directors such as Ram Gopal Varma who has famously forgone musical numbers in films such as Raat 1992 as has Guddu Dhanoa in films such as Hawa 2003. But Ghosh manages to tie everything together so that the romantic elements musical numbers and comic relief especially in characters such as Balam played by Laxmikrant Berde not only provide a balance for the more intense material but seem integral to the film100 Days wouldn't be quite as good as it is in absence of any of its varied moods. Heck Ghosh even makes repeated footage seem as if it's necessary rather than just being padding.And of course these different elements help set 100 Days apart from its precursor on the horrorthriller end Lucio Fulci's Sette note in nero 1977 which also has elements of Edgar Allan Poe's short story The Black Cat originally published in 1843. Ghosh also adds a number of interesting recurring motifs such as the pervasive conch shells the statuestaxidermy specimens and the water symbolism which helps bring to mind later films with a relation to The Black Cat such as Byeongki Ahn's Phone 2002.The performances throughout are very good. Of course it's primarily up to Dixit to help tie all of the threads together but she receives a lot of help from Shroff Berde Javed Jaffrey as Devi's friend Sunil and Jay Kalgutar as Jagmohan. At first I was lamenting Berde's relative absence later in the film but as he's strictly comic relief this was necessary. By the end Ghosh is only concerned with increasing a roller coasterlike intensity which he does effectively. Rather than continuing comic relief he adds other elements to the overarching thriller atmosphere such as a big action scene set in a junkyard that showcases some impressive stunts.Anyone who is a fan of the average Bollywood film and who also likes western thrillers should enjoy 100 Days.".

Years later she batters down the wall and finds the skeletal remains. She with the help of a parapsychologist friend try to solve the mystery of who the victim is and if the killer is still out there. The first hour more or less drags along with the woman Deva being introduced and meeting her future husband and after a nice courtship they get married. Only during the second half does the movie really take off with the discovery of the body.In the similarities between the Fulci film and this are many with few differences. In the Fulci movie the heroine has her fragmented disjointed visions while driving through a road tunnel here she has the visions while swimming in her backyard swimming pool. The yellow French cigarette burning in the ashtray in the Fulci film is replaced here by a light cigar. The magazine with a photo a young woman on the cover the murder victim is replaced by a photo of a racehorse. Also the incriminating letter detailing who the killer in The Psychic is replaced here by a videotape with the English title '100 Days' showing the killing. But basically the plotlines are all the same with the climatic chase the murders and even the now memorable wristwatch the heroine wears midway through the film which makes a loud beeping sound on the hour which gives away her hiding place as the killer is chasing her and reveals her location when she's incapitated. In the Lucio Fulci film the watch instead plays a haunting tune rather than a loud beeping. In addition to the long dramatic opening hour also added was an extended version of the climax which brings on a more upbeat ending. A fan of international films I found this to be quite enjoying not just for Indian citizens but any fans of mysteryhorrorthrillers regardless of their country of origin. Fans of Lucio Fulci who have seen The Psychic check this one out.".

	schema:headline " Madhuri Dixit Having ExtraSensory Perception ?";
	schema:reviewBody "I am writing a review of this two decades old movie simply because I am a mystery fan. This is the only suspense thriller acted by the screen goddess of bollywood Madhuri Dixit. It was released in 1991 and due to my fancy for mysteries I did not waste much time in heading towards the theatre with my friend Sanjay Laddha in Kolkata then Calcutta. It's a murder mystery on the theme of extrasensory perception or ESP.I do believe that there is actually something like premonition or extrasensory perception as I have experienced it to a very small level in my own life seeing future events in dreams or imagination. And that's why the reason of my belief that actually certain persons might be having such a quality at some higher level too. However our bollywood filmwallas are always ready to exaggerate anything to the dizzy heights for the sake of their cinematic liberty to present the intended story. So this movie presents premonition or ESP in an unbelievably exaggerated form.The person possessing this quality in the movie is none else than Madhuri Dixit. She is studying in a college in boarding and her elder sister Munmun Sen and her uncle Ajeet Vachchhani are living away. Javed Jafferey and Sabeeha are her college mates and Javed loves her in his heart. While playing Tennis with Sabeeha she suddenly gets the ESP of the murder of a woman. Later on the same scene comes before her eyes with the face of the victim also visible. And she is Munmun Sen. However she is still not able to see the face of the murderer able to see only his back. But the murder actually takes place however the dead body of Munmun Sen is not found.Some years later Madhuri comes into contact with Jackie Shroff and love blossoms between them culminating into eventual marriage. Jackie wins the court case of the ownership of a house and when he is out of town for some work Madhuri moves to that house to clean it and bring it into a worthliving shape for the purpose of their residence. However there she sees many things already perceived by her in the visions coming upon her because of her ESP. And further the vision of a woman's murder starts coming upon her courtesy her ESP only. She decides to save the life of that woman and seeks help of her old mate Javed Jafferey in her bid for this noble cause. After a lot of chill and thrill the murder mystery gets resolved.Actually the name of the movie is Sau Din and it appears in the credits also written as such on the posters too when the movie had got released but in English it is mentioned as100 Days. I don't know whether the plot is original or plagiarized from some Hollywood movie. But the thing is that the screenplay has been excellently written. Had the writers and the directors avoided the temptation of some songs and heroheroine romance the movie would have been very crisp and thoroughly engrossing. However despite these regular bollywood formulae including college life pranks and some comedy by Laxmikant Berde the movie more or less keeps its focus on the real plot only and that's why it's so interesting. The editor could have made it shorter by 1520 minutes and at least one song could have been avoided. All the same the heartbeatincreasing thrills and the breathtaking suspense keep the viewers glued to the screen without any diversion.The needle of suspicion points towards at least three characters and it's not easy to guess the murderer. I had tried to guess in the interval while watching it in theatre but my guess failed. It's a highly admirable murder mystery no doubt. For this the director Partho Ghosh deserves a pat on his back.The songs composed by Ramlaxman are good. Especially the song of college boys and girls  Gabbar Singh Ye Kehkar Gaya and the duet of Lata and S.P. Balasubrahmanium  Sun Beliya Shukriya Meherbaani are praiseworthy.Technically the movie is good. Production value is high. The narrative grips the viewer from the very first scene and the curiosity factor remains alive till the very end of the movie. Many scenes are simply spinechilling if seen in theatre.Performances are praiseworthy. Dancing queen and extremely beautiful Madhuri has carried this movie on her shoulders alone though she has got able support from others. This is the only movie in which the dancing and action talent of Javed Jafferey has got ample footage. He is awesome and so is the everin hiscontrols Jackie Shroff. Laxmikant Berde has generated good laughters.100 Days or Sau Din is a very good suspensethriller with the mystery remaining unresolved till the very climax. Good narrative good performances good music good comedy. A perfect entertainment spanning more than two and half hours full of suspense thrill and chill. Strongly recommended for all in general and mystery fans in particular.".

	schema:headline " One of the best during its time ... or any time!";
	schema:reviewBody "I am going to rate this movie very high mainly because it delivered what it promised. It was one of the best thrillersmurder mysteries that released in the 1990s probably even till date though now it may appear dated in terms of costumes and gadgets etc. Partho Ghosh hasn't always made good films but this one is easily his best. The film is inspired just like his other hit coming a close second to this one Agnisaakshi but let's give him credit for making a really good strong thriller.I remember how I had shut my eyes at the age of 10 while watching some of the scenes in this film. It was truly fascinating. One of the key strengths of the film was its background music that added to the mystery.Madhuri Dixit was another highpoint of this film. She was brilliantly cast as Devi and did complete justice to her role. That's why she is what she is today. I'm a huge Dixit fan so won't go on about her lest i sound prejudiced. Moon Moon sen in a small role was alright. Neelam Mehera did a decent job and so did Sabeeha.Of the men Jackie Shroff had to settle for a less meaty role when compared to his lead heroine but he was good. Jay Kalghuta who was introduced in this film as Jagmohan not only looked menacing and terrifying but enacted his role convincingly as well. A good debut that sadly did not get too many roles post this film. Laxmikant Berde as Baalam provided the laughs may seem over the top when viewed today but did tickle back then. And lastly Javed Jaffery was well cast as Sunil. It was a pleasure to see Madhuri and Javed shake a leg in the popular song De De Dil.Although Dixit and Shroff had appeared in films like Parinda Raam Lakhan Tridev Uttar Dakshin and Vardi before this onenot sure if I missed any this is probably the only film where they romanced one another that emerged successful.Raam Laxman's music was not chart busting which was required for a suspense film. But the songs are melodious especially Sun Beliya which stood out.Partho Ghosh managed to maintain the suspense till the end. No cheap thrills just good old suspense and drama. Brilliant stuff.It wasn't like those films that had a new twist in the plot after every 15 minutes thus introducing a new dimension to the story. It had a concrete plot to follow with layers unfolding.Overall 100 days is one of the best thrillers I have seen in Indian cinema or any cinema. Copied or not this film is a great watch even today.".

It had a concrete plot to follow with layers unfolding.Overall 100 days is one of the best thrillers I have seen in Indian cinema or any cinema. Copied or not this film is a great watch even today.";

The film has a very sly and often languid buildup to various shocks as it unfolds. I'm not going to spoil those for anyone by saying too much here.The film's setup is that a man Wit who runs a restaurant in America and his wife Dang a former well known actress are returning to Thailand after an absence of 10 years to attend a funeral. They are staying at a Bangkok hotel and while the wife settles into their room the husband goes down to the bar for cigarettes. There he meets a backpacking teenager named Ploy who evokes his sympathy she has a black eye possibly from an abusive boyfriend and she is also from his hometown of Phuket and without any apparent sexual scheming he simply invites the girl back up to the hotel room to rest up while she awaits her mother's arrival.The wife doesn't take kindly to this intrusion and the teenager is taken aback as well You didn't tell me your girlfriend was going to be here!. The comic absurdity of this setup gradually starts taking a darker turn with petty theft suspicions of adultery and possible murders and rapes entering the storyline before we're done. Meanwhile a maid and bartender at the hotel are having a mysterious sexy assignation simultaneous to the main plot line and Dang's former acting history also attracts the attentions of a stalker. How these different plot strands intertwine and tangle and then untangle and resolve themselves was a pleasure to watch. The film started with the most basic of elements and then let you think you knew where it is going before it pulled the rug out from under you several times.Actress Lalita Panyopas from 1999's Ruang talok 69 makes a welcome return in the role of Dang to director Ratanaruang's ensemble. I was also happy to see a bright clear picture in the print of Ploy after last year's TIFF print of Invisible Waves was muddy and dark.".

Essentially a quite thoughtful and insightful film with little storyline but half a dozen characters that totally fascinate. A husband and wife check into a Bangkok hotel in the early hours and in that nevernever land of jet lag and an unfamiliar room a strange state develops. In reality that is as well as in this movie. In fact we are not far into this little tale before we realize it is not easy to tell what is reality fantasy or dream. Sometimes this can be irritating but here it is irrelevant. We are so drawn into this tale that even little details such as whether it is 'real' seem not to matter. I have not experienced anything quite like this since 'Celine and Julie Go Boating' and that was many years ago. Beautifully shot we find ourselves at one moment gazing at an entwined couple and at the next the sunlight dancing on the floor below a set of hotel room curtains. With plenty of space between 'action' there is time for us to reflect as the characters do and this magical and inspiring film is a most rewarding experience.".

Ploy is actually one of the best Thai movies i've seen in a long time. it's good. it's got good story good dialog maybe not so good on subtitled but if you understand Thai the dialog was actually pretty great. The directing was very very slowly but very moving anyhow. i personally love this movie. one of the reasons is because it's totally alienated from the typical Thai ghost comedy movies. Ploy is really touching. I'm not going out with anyone now but this movie really made me think about 'LOVE' and relationships.

While we still cannot avoid sudden acts of violence they are kept to a minimum and as you may find out as I did they are quite tolerable.

The cinematography is nothing less than stunning  using space and depth to their full sensuous effect. Adding to the elegant atmosphere is the script economical precise and at the same time general enough to be universally appealing.

Invisible waves 2006 is mainly artsy but is also blended with commercial thriller elements. Ploy follows the same approach but ends up being a little bit of neither here nor there.The story takes place mostly in a hotel in Thailand in two rooms to be exact. One is occupied by a middleaged couple Nut a restaurant owner and Daeng an exmovie star immigrants in the US for a decade coming home to attend a funeral. Right away the audience is intimated to the situation that the 7year marriage has problems. In the wee hours of the morning having coffee and cigarette in the hotel's caf to kill time Nut has a chance encounter with tobe19tomorrow rebelliouslooking but sweetatheart Ploy waiting for her mother's arrival in a few hours' time from Sweden. A decent and kind fellow Daeng offers to let the girl freshen up and take a nap in his room until the mother arrives. You can imagine how much a clever director can do with this material  the trio stuck in a room for a few hours.In the other room a few steps down the hall a chambermaid and a bartender both presumably off duty are making out.

What follows is a scene not unlike what you saw with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson lying in bed in Lost in translation similar maybe even more innocent. After Ploy has left the scene having served as the catalyst that brings to the surface the marital problem we see how it is finally resolved through a thrillertype development of events. Happy ending.Coming back to the other room as I watched the continually escalating erotic scenes that don't seem to have anything to do with the main plot I couldn't help but wonder if they were just put there for commercial reasons. It was in the final absurdity ironically that I saw or think I saw some senses of what director Ratanaruang was doing. After the bartender has left the maid tying in bed suddenly burst out in a sensuous joyful song oozing with the joy she experiences after a satisfying sexual experience. This scene in the other room then is there to serve as a sharp contrast to accentuate even more the frustration in Nut and Daeng's marriage.Ploy is not such a bad movie but is less appealing than Ratanaruang's other movies mentioned about. It is well acted and touched a few things for empathy. The girl in the title role is very sweet.".

Side stories branch off some action may be fantasy and other plot developments seem to terminate without resolution.Though it all the central action that takes place in the couple's hotel room is filmed very deliberately. The camera lingers on vacated spaces. It traces the lines of architectural elements rendering them cubist abstractions. It captures inactivity. The result is the film becomes a kind of meditation. The film did not lose my attention. Although the storyline was ambiguous I was still engaged.Clearly the central theme has something to do with the shelf life of married relationships. Wit says Everyone is lonely. Most people don't know it because they're too busy. The film is named after the young girl's character presumably because she is the catalyst that sparks the couple's imaginations and fears.".

It's a novel concept for an indie short film and the homage is loving to the point of being innocuous.

	schema:headline " Very Good and Inventive short film!";
	schema:reviewBody "Director George Lucas is without a doubt one of the most important filmmakers of the 70s as while his body of work is often considered of lesser quality then the work of other members of his generation it is by far the most influential in the field of science fiction thanks to the creation of Star Wars the epic saga of fantasy and scifi that changed the way people looked at scifi movies. With Star Wars Lucas created not only one of the most bankable franchises in history but also a story that has inspired countless scifi aficionados across the world. Since Star Wars is nowadays a defining element of pop culture it is not a surprise that it is often referenced in other works sometimes as a homage others as a parody and sometimes as both. Joe Nussbaum's short film George Lucas in Love is probably among the best of the homagesparodies Star Wars has received across its history.Set in 1967 George Lucas in Love is the fictional story about how Lucas created Star Wars during his last year as a student at USC. Lucas Martin Hynes is suffering from writer's block as he tries to shape his still unnamed space opera. Lucas has only three days to finish it or he won't graduate but he is unable to begin writing as he can't make it work. He tries desperately to find inspiration in college and even asks for advice to his odd professor Patrick Kerr but nothing seems to work until he meets Marion Lisa Jakub. Marion is a young girl with a strangely familiar hairdo who admires Lucas' previous shorts and thinks that he is talented. Lucas finds his muse in Marion as she encourages him to write about what he feels and just follow his inspiration.Written by Nussbaum himself along with Daniel Shere and Timothy Dowling the film is of course a spoof on the premise of 1998 film Shakespeare in Love a movie detailing William Shakespeare struggle with writer's block. Filled with countless references to Star Wars' first film as well as other works by Lucas the screenplay is very welldeveloped for an 8 minutes short movie. While of course there are a couple of plot holes in the story they are devised that way to be more funny references to Lucas' legendary space opera. The story unfolds nicely in its short time and always remains focused on its spoofed themes. Unlike most similar parodies it never relays on cheap attacks and takes its subject with a very fresh intelligence.It is worth to point out that director Joe Nussbaum shows his love for the Star Wars movies without being too respectful and staying true to his comedy roots. Working nicely with both visual gags and jokes referencing Lucas' biography and future filmography Nussbaum creates a very creative movie and showcases his very promising talent for comedy. He also knows the limitations of his medium and exploits the joke to the most without making it boring or tiresome and always keeping that light hearted approach that gives the movie a really appropriate touch of sweetness. True the film shows some of the common problems of short films but the movie shows that Nussbaum truly put a lot of work in this calling card that it's not a surprise to discover that he has started a career as director of comedies. To tell the truth Nussbaum manage to do more in 8 short minutes than many filmmakers do in 90. The cast if truly effective and one of the reasons the movie works so nicely. Martin Hynes is excellent as George playing him as an intelligent writer but lacking a bit in his social skills without a doubt a play on the stereotype of Star Wars fans. Lisa Jakub is not only beautiful as Marion but also adds a lot as one of the most experienced members among the cast. The rest of the cast appears briefly but most tend to leave a lasting impression as not only the script allows them to shine they truly make the most of their small roles. Particularly funny is Patrick Kerr another of the experienced members of the cast as Lucas' professor who may be the inspiration for a character famous for its odd way of speak.George Lucas in Love is definitely not the work of a genius but it's truly amazing when one considers it was conceived as a student film. Nussbaum finally began his professional career as a director in 2004 with the teen comedy Sleepover. Story says that the success of this modest short film played a major part in he being hired by Dreamworks and personally I wouldn't be surprised if that were true as this movie is definitely something special. Hopefully Nussbaum will deliver another comedy as good as this short as George Lucas in Love seems to be only the beginning of a very promising career. 810".

	schema:headline " I'm in love with George Lucas in Love. It's a charming little film.";
	schema:reviewBody "May the farce be with you! This short film is a very good spoof of two blockbusters movies 1998's Shakespeare in Love which won the Academy Award Best Picture of that year and the original Star Wars trilogy 19771983 which won multiplies awards. Not only that the movie even mentions some of George Lucas's other works such as the original Indiana Jones trilogy 19811989 1973's American Graffiti and even his odd film 1971's THX 1138. The funniest references had to be about George Lucas's odd choice of having number titles for student films such as 1966's 142.08  1967's 61867. I thought it was a joke until I realize those were really the names of some of his early works. I do remember when this short film came out. To correspond with the 20th anniversary of Star Wars George Lucas released Special Editions of the better edited versions of the Star Wars trilogy to theater. It was a massive hit so George Lucas decide that the time was right for a new set of films to come out the Prequels 19992004 to capitalize on the new growing technology and ever growing fanbase. A lot of people were stoke for anything Star Wars relate. So when this short movie came out. It was got a lot of attention. Not only was it passed around Hollywood offices as a filmmaker's calling card but it was one of the first short film to become widely distributed on the Internet and became a media sensation for a short time. It is generally thought of as one of if not the first viral film property. The film was directed by Joe Nussbaum it tells the story of a young George Lucas Martin Hynes a USC college student in 1967 suffering from writer's block as he tries to write a script about space agriculture. It wasn't until he met his muse Marion Lisa Jakub that he started to get ideas from the people around him. It's a very fun watch. Everywhere he goes we get to see characters that either resemble or will influence the creation of his future works. It has a lot of pretty clever comedy. I love how his professor has a weird speech syntax that George at first couldn't understand. The twist toward the end was laugh out funny. While the short movie is play off as laughs. There are some truths in this film. I love how the Jedi Knights concept came from the drug culture of the time and the opening of new wave thinking. The whole Rebel Alliance idea came from the student protest of the 1960s of the Vietnam War. The whole evil Galactic Empire stigma came from bureaucracy corporate greed within the film industry. The movie even touch George Lucas's love for carracing. For an 8 minute film you really get to know and understand the times in which George Lucas grew up in. I just wish it was longer and had more references or characters cameos such as Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Spielberg. After all he did kinda met him toward the end of 1967beginning of 1968. One big mistake that the film kinda got wrong was the whole Howard the Duck gag. This urban legend is kinda false. In truth Steve Gerber and Val Mayerik were the actual creators of the Howard the Duck comic not Lucas. George Lucas only served as a producer for the movie adaption and had no involvement with the creation of the character. The movie was beautiful shot. You find a lot of George Lucas's Easter eggs style of filmmaking here. A good example is the Wilhelm Scream when the fielder get his hand slice. Another one is the overused of wipe transitions. The acting is pretty good. The guy that plays George Lucas does look the part. It's so surreal. I have always love Lisa Jakub. I love her work in 1996's Independence Day  1993's Mrs. Doubtfire. She's so cute. I'm really surprise that none of the main actors were on to bigger wellknown films after this. I really shock that this movie never got a sequel after the prequels. It would have been nice to see a short film of George Luca's later life in the style of 1941's Citizen Kane. The film is somewhat dated. Star Wars has since expand to ever more films since Disney got the rights in 2013. It's weird watching this movie in today's world where George Lucas doesn't get so much praise. Don't get me wrong there are tons of fans that still love George Lucas but a lot of them have really went overboard on the Lucas hating. Many of them fans blame the perceived faults of the series on Lucas's refusal to accept creative input from others his infamous cheesy writing his overmarketing greed and his ever wanting altering of his previous works. While they're somewhat right. I do believe that they're letting their hatedom destroy how much good George Lucas has done for film lovers. Call me nostalgia but I wish for a time where the hatred for the man wasn't that strong. After watching this film you can't help seeing how much the fanboys who made this movie endure the man. In the end I kinda wish that would return. George Lucas shouldn't be hated. Overall He's deserve more respect than what some fans are treating him with. I glad that Lucas is a fan of this movie having sent a congratulatory letter to the filmmakers which they show in a hidden easter egg on the DVD. The movie is easy to find on the internet. If you're a fan of George Lucas go see this movie. I recommended it. You wouldn't be disappointed.".

	onyx:emotionText "May the farce be with you! This short film is a very good spoof of two blockbusters movies 1998's Shakespeare in Love which won the Academy Award Best Picture of that year and the original Star Wars trilogy 19771983 which won multiplies awards. Not only that the movie even mentions some of George Lucas's other works such as the original Indiana Jones trilogy 19811989 1973's American Graffiti and even his odd film 1971's THX 1138. The funniest references had to be about George Lucas's odd choice of having number titles for student films such as 1966's 142.08  1967's 61867. I thought it was a joke until I realize those were really the names of some of his early works. I do remember when this short film came out. To correspond with the 20th anniversary of Star Wars George Lucas released Special Editions of the better edited versions of the Star Wars trilogy to theater. It was a massive hit so George Lucas decide that the time was right for a new set of films to come out the Prequels 19992004 to capitalize on the new growing technology and ever growing fanbase. A lot of people were stoke for anything Star Wars relate. So when this short movie came out. It was got a lot of attention. Not only was it passed around Hollywood offices as a filmmaker's calling card but it was one of the first short film to become widely distributed on the Internet and became a media sensation for a short time. It is generally thought of as one of if not the first viral film property. The film was directed by Joe Nussbaum it tells the story of a young George Lucas Martin Hynes a USC college student in 1967 suffering from writer's block as he tries to write a script about space agriculture. It wasn't until he met his muse Marion Lisa Jakub that he started to get ideas from the people around him. It's a very fun watch. Everywhere he goes we get to see characters that either resemble or will influence the creation of his future works. It has a lot of pretty clever comedy. I love how his professor has a weird speech syntax that George at first couldn't understand. The twist toward the end was laugh out funny. While the short movie is play off as laughs.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Timothy Hutton together with an ensemble of right on performances turns what could be a weepy tale of friendship between a retarded man and an 11 year old girl into a deeply moving story on the power of love the need for human connection. Evan Rachel Wood is without a false note in her portrayal of Harriet a little girl who searches for escape from her dreary life into an elaborate and eccentric fantasy world. She is looked at as slightly goofy by her classmates a spirited handful by her alcoholic 'mother' and a major pain in the butt by her promiscuous older 'sister'. It isn't until Ricky played by Kevin Bacon and his mother come to stay at the family's motel cabins on their way to bringing Ricky to an institution that Harriet finds a real kindred spirit. After Harriet's 'mother' is killed suddenly in an auto accident she had a tendency to drive on the wrong side of the highway a crucial family secret is revealed. The friendship between these two outsiders begins to deepen. Despite the obvious obstacles of age and mental condition each provides a connection which the other needs a relationship which allows Harriet's imagination to flourish and Ricky to feel valued and fully human for the first time. As the two other women in Harriet's family who all look surprisingly alike enough to be a family Cathy Moriarty and Mary Stuart Masterson are beautifully understated in their performances. Despite the problems in lives of these women each is characterized with the same indomitable spirit. We see the same spark in each of their personalities each at a different stage of defeat and resignation. The struggle for them is not to let life's circumstances defeat them. For Harriet and for Ricky there develops a real love and friendship which is unique and wonderful but as the title suggests it is a relationship which is both dangerous and inevitably hopeless. First time director Timothy Hutton brings the same intelligence and thoughtfulness to his directing that he brings to his acting. He has created a great looking film and helped create some marvelous and honest performances. The visual scheme of the film effectively captures many its themes of connection entrapment secrecy and fantasy. His camera also tends to sit low giving us a child's eye view. He sometimes allows the camera to literally participate in the world through Harriet's imagination. By not burdening us with extraneous details concerning the women's relationships with male characters except for Ricky the characters to exist in their own emotional space. The music is artfully chosen. Digging to China captures the struggles of coming of age as well as to make our connections to one another richer and stronger. It is a carefully conceived powerfully acted and beautifully directed film. It goes beyond the familiar territory with style and grace. Take the kids and transcend the cynical. This is one of the best films I've seen all year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Timothy Hutton together with an ensemble of right on performances turns what could be a weepy tale of friendship between a retarded man and an 11 year old girl into a deeply moving story on the power of love and on the need for human connection. Evan Rachel Wood is without a false note in her portrayal of Harriet a little girl who searches for escape from her dreary life into an elaborate and eccentric fantasy world. She is looked at as slightly goofy by her classmates a spirited handful by her alcoholic 'mother' and a major pain in the  butt by her promiscuous older 'sister'. It isn 't until Ricky played by Kevin Bacon and his mother come to stay at the family's motel cabins on their way to bringing Ricky to an institution that Harriet finds a real kindred spirit. After Harriet's 'mother' is killed suddenly in an auto accident she had a tendency to drive on the wrong side of the highway a crucial family secret is revealed. The freindship between these two outsiders begins to deepen. Despite the obvious obstacles of age and mental condition each provides a connection which the other needs a relationship which allows Harriet's imagination to florish and Ricky to feel valued and fully human for the first time. As the the two other women in Harriet's family who all look surprisingly alike enough to be a family Cathy Moriarty and Mary Stuart Masterson are beautifully understated in their performances. Despite the problems in lives of these women each is characterized with the same indominatable spirit. We see the same spark in each of their personalities each at a different stage of defeat and resignation. The struggle for them is not to let life's circumstances defeat them. For Harriet and for Ricky there develops a real love and freindship which is unique and wonderful but as the title suggests it is a relationship which is both dangerous and inevitably hopeless. First time director Timothy Hutton brings the same intellegence and thoughtfulness to his directing that he brings to his acting. He has created a great looking film and helped create some marvelous and honest performances. The visual scheme of the film effectivly captures many its themes of connection entrapment secrecy and fantasy in a way that is rare in American commercial moviemaking. His camera also tends to sit low giving us a child's eye view. He sometimes even allows the camera to literally participate in the world through Harriet's imagination. By not burdening us with extraneous details concerning the women's relationships with male characters except for Ricky he allows these characters to exist in their own emotional space. The music is artfully chosen. Digging to China captures the struggles of coming of age as well as the power of love and of the imagination to make our connections to one another richer and stronger. It is a carefully conceived powerfully acted and beautifully directed film. It transcends its familiar territory with style and grace. Take the kids and trancend the cynical. This is one of the best films I've seen all year.".

Get it at Amazon.You're going to grow up and I'm not.This is what Ricky Schroth Kevin Bacon says to Harriet Frankovitz Evan Rachel Wood near the end of the film expressing both the promise of her life and the tragedy of his. It is precisely because of the potential of this sharp spoken sharp witted beautiful little girl with a mind of her own that we are mesmerized by her as we are by our own children and why we are so deeply saddened by the young man who is not a man and never will be.This is a film that discovers itself after a clumsy start and develops until at the end we see the beauty and the tragedy of its story as an affirmation of life. Kevin Bacon starts awkwardly and has to work hard to conquer a demanding role. But so does Wood who in the beginning at times seemed unsure of who she is and how she should feel and react. But both actors grow into their characters and become stronger and stronger as the film progresses. However I think Director Timothy Hutton Best Supporting Actor for Ordinary People in 1980 might have profited by reshooting some of the earlier scenes.It is interesting to compare Bacon's performance with that of other actors who have attempted to play mentally retarded or mentally challenged charactersI'm thinking here of Dustin Hoffman in The Rain Man 1988 and Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade 1996. Dustin Hoffman was of course something close to brilliant in his Academy Award winning role. He had a charming script and because he played alongside Tom Cruise he benefited from not having to carry the picture by himself. This was not the case for Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade where too much was attempted without enough help so that Thornton ended up too much in front of the camera and that was not always to his benefit. Here Bacon is wonderfully supported not only by Miss Wood but by Mary Stuart Masterson who plays Harriet's sister Gwen. Some people have criticized Masterson's performance but I think they are reacting to her nonsympathetic character a woman who as Harriet says should have been a nurse. She's always making some guy feel better.I think Masterson was very subtle in a unrefined role and touching as a woman who had a lot to learn. Also excellent and completely believable in a limited role was Marian Seldes as Ricky's mother.I was surprised that such an original and deeply lived script was not adapted from a novel. No writer could have just dreamed up this story. It had to have been lived in some sense. Part of it was dreamed up of course. So I guess Karen Janszen who wrote the script must have lived it. At any rate she is to be commended for such an original conception. The setting in North Carolina at a rural motel Mom won it in a divorce and the three who ran Mac's Indian Cabins was perfect for the tale. Her celebration of the spirit of a tenyearold who thinks she can dig to China was precious and warm. Some of the lines were so perfect. I am thinking of Harriet's voice over after it is revealed that she and Ricky got married baptized is more like it!. The tenyearold says Gwen was mostly upset cause I got married before her.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw it on Netflix streaming movies. I really only sought out this movie for one reason I was curious to see a very young Evan Rachel Wood as I had only seen her in roles after she had grown up. Well sort of grown up she is still in her early 20s. In the opening credits they write and introducing Evan Rachel Wood. She is originally from North Carolina this was filmed in North Carolina.Evan Rachel Wood is Harriet Frankovitz 10yearold daughter of a single mom who runs a type of motel campground. Harriet is very smart precocious and very inquisitive. In fact her attempt to dig to China gave the movie its title. She gets on the bus every day to go to school but always seems bored there.Her life changes when a car breaks down and the mother and son have to stay at the campground for a while. The son is Kevin Bacon as Ricky Schroth a mildly retarded young man who is on his way to a group home because his mother will not live much longer. Harriet takes to Ricky right away and they become fast friends almost inseparable. Because of Ricky's handicap they are like two 10yearolds. They get into bits of trouble here and there but seemingly for the first time in his life Ricky is experiencing things and Harriet just doesn't dwell on his handicap.One of my favorite actresses over the years and in way too few good roles is Mary Stuart Masterson. She is good here as Harriet's older sister Gwen who helps mom run the campground and keep the rooms clean but always seems disapproving of Harriet.Good small movie about life and relationships. Wood was such a good natural actress at 10 and really does carry this movie. In fact she may have been at her best at 10.SPOILERS Their mom is a bit carefree and not always careful like an early scene where she is driving the wrong way on a divided highway. Later in the story she is driving alone and ends up in a ditch killed instantly. This throws the two girls into a bit of turmoil and when Gwen says I am your mother now she clarifies that she really is her mother she was a young 15 when Harriet was born. So as the movie ends and Ricky is off to the home in the evening Harriet is calling out to Gewn outside telling her what she must do for Harriet's bedtime it appears she will become a real mother to the girl.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Timothy Hutton's 1997 directorial debut last night called Digging to China. It's an obscure limited release lowbudget film made from a great little script by Karen Janszen. I had never heard of it but the review in my film guide made it sound intriguing. Kevin Bacon is usually highly watchable and I've always liked him and his work. It costars Mary Stuart Masterson of whom we never see enough these days and best of all it was Evan Rachel Wood's first film.Timothy Hutton's direction was fine for the most part. It was understated and lighthanded allowing the actors to breathe in their roles and bring the characters to life themselves. At times it felt a little too light and left the film feeling essentially directionless. And occasionally it seemed as though the actors had run out of things to say or do in a shot and were just hanging around waiting for the director to remember to shout Cut! Despite being a fan of the man and his work unfortunately I found Kevin Bacon's performance to be somewhat disappointing. In the first act he seemed to be working too hard at the character of Ricky a mentally retarded man who stays over at a cabin motel run by the family of Evan Rachel Wood's character Harriet. I don't think he did as well with it as other actors have in similar roles. The performances by Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man Leo DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? Cuba Gooding Jr in Radio Sean Penn in I Am Sam and Brendan Fletcher in Tideland were all far better in my opinion. It's only once he gets further into the role and the story settles down a bit that he seems to become comfortable and more convincing in it and by the end his performance was reaching deeply to bring out the emotions in the character.Mary Stuart Masterson does a competent job of portraying Harriet's elder sister Gwen. She was convincing in a role which largely consisted of acting as a foil and an antagonist to Harriet. They seemed as contrary and hateful towards one another as only real sisters can be and the circumstances they suddenly find themselves in made it hard for Gwen to cope.But what lifted the film and made it well worth every one of the seven stars I've given it was young Evan Rachel Wood's portrayal of the tenyearold Harriet. Digging to China is absolutely and completely her film. Everyone else was really only contributing a supporting role to her great performance. Harriet is endearing and sweet a solemn and lonely little girl with knobbly knees and long blonde hair who is left to her own devices in order to keep herself amused in her small world of make believe. She's played convincingly and seriously by Evan occasionally showing some of her future self confidence as she portrays a lonely child a child whose inventiveness while she plays amuses us even as we realise these are not just games she's playing they're attempts at escape from her lonely existence. It's Harriet and Ricky's deepening friendship in her life of desperation which gives the film its emotional depth and real poignancy.The film won the Children's Jury Award at the Chicago International Children's Film Festival. Evan remembers the role of Harriet as initially being hard but she said that it eventually led to her decision that acting is something she might never want to stop doing. It's not always easy to find but it will reward the effort of hunting up a copy if you're looking to see something a little different.".

At times it felt a little too light and left the film feeling essentially directionless. And occasionally it seemed as though the actors had run out of things to say or do in a shot and were just hanging around waiting for the director to remember to shout Cut! Despite being a fan of the man and his work unfortunately I found Kevin Bacon's performance to be somewhat disappointing. In the first act he seemed to be working too hard at the character of Ricky a mentally retarded man who stays over at a cabin motel run by the family of Evan Rachel Wood's character Harriet. I don't think he did as well with it as other actors have in similar roles. The performances by Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man Leo DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? Cuba Gooding Jr in Radio Sean Penn in I Am Sam and Brendan Fletcher in Tideland were all far better in my opinion. It's only once he gets further into the role and the story settles down a bit that he seems to become comfortable and more convincing in it and by the end his performance was reaching deeply to bring out the emotions in the character.Mary Stuart Masterson does a competent job of portraying Harriet's elder sister Gwen. She was convincing in a role which largely consisted of acting as a foil and an antagonist to Harriet. They seemed as contrary and hateful towards one another as only real sisters can be and the circumstances they suddenly find themselves in made it hard for Gwen to cope.But what lifted the film and made it well worth every one of the seven stars I've given it was young Evan Rachel Wood's portrayal of the tenyearold Harriet. Digging to China is absolutely and completely her film. Everyone else was really only contributing a supporting role to her great performance. Harriet is endearing and sweet a solemn and lonely little girl with knobbly knees and long blonde hair who is left to her own devices in order to keep herself amused in her small world of make believe. She's played convincingly and seriously by Evan occasionally showing some of her future self confidence as she portrays a lonely child a child whose inventiveness while she plays amuses us even as we realise these are not just games she's playing they're attempts at escape from her lonely existence. It's Harriet and Ricky's deepening friendship in her life of desperation which gives the film its emotional depth and real poignancy.The film won the Children's Jury Award at the Chicago International Children's Film Festival. Evan remembers the role of Harriet as initially being hard but she said that it eventually led to her decision that acting is something she might never want to stop doing. It's not always easy to find but it will reward the effort of hunting up a copy if you're looking to see something a little different.";

The chips fall where the chips fall with just enough miraculous survival to be credible.The experience is harrowing and full of adventure.

While the two films are close to being the same film the first in English and the other in German they are NOT exact copied of the other film. Instead the films were made as a joint project with Universal and their German counterpart. Many of the scenes were identical and much of the cast were in both films however many plot points and the ending were quite different. Seeing both films one after the other was an unusual experience and I am thrilled that both were packaged together.Here are some ways that both films differ 1. The German version has Dr. Lorenz alone in Greenland. Apparently he was separated from the rest of his party because he's stupid though the film never exactly said this. Then a meeting is held some time later to discuss the recent failed rescue attempt as well as to plan the next. In the American version all the characters in the film meet at a meeting about Arctic exploration at a club. The entire group goes but Dr. Lawrence wanders off and much of the film is spend looking for him. Both Lorenz and Lawrence are played by a German and an American actor respectively.2. The film involving the initial trek across Greenland is quite different as well as the scene where LawrenceLorenz is discovered.3. Gibson Gowland dies slightly differently and at different times in the two films.4. Gowland shows his unstable and evil side far earlier in the American version. There's less suspense this way but his actions later make a bit more sense this way.5. The American film at least in its current version is about 10 minutes shorter.6. The breakup of the iceberg occurred at a different time and was more dramatically placed in the American version.Regardless which version you see the main plot is still basically the same and the cinematography is likewise wonderful in both films. It really appears that some of the differences are simply due to the film being assembled slightly differentlylike they shot a lot of film at one time and divvied up some of the scenes to each filmthen included a few identical scenes with mostly the same actors.So which is better? Well neither is that much better or worse. But if I only were to see one I might suggest the American oneespecially if English is your first language. Not only that but it being shorter is NOT a bad thingthe German version drags a bit more because more scenes of the men crossing the barren ice are included. You really get bored by this after a biteven if the scenes were incredibly difficult to make and looked amazing. As for me I'm a nut and watched them both!By the way take note of the actors Ernst Udet and Leni Reifenstahl in the film. Udet was a top WWI fighter ace with 62 victories. He also was Hitler's choice for head of the Luftwaffe during WWII. However after he and Goering blew the Battle of Britain Udet killed himself in 1941. As for Reifenstahl she was one of Hitler's BFFs and directed some of the most technically astute and impressive proNazi propaganda films such as Olympia and Triumph of the Will. Following the war Reifenstahl apparently told reporters and war crimes tribunals that she'd been away from Germany on vacation from 1933 to 1945 and was angry someone had been impersonating her all those years and saying all these nasty things about heran 'innocent' lady!".

	schema:headline " A bit of everything not enough of anything";
	schema:reviewBody "S.O.S. Eisberg is a German blackandwhite film from 1933 so this one is already almost 85 years old. It runs for roughly 1.5 hours and was written and directed by Arnold Fanck a German filmmaker who was pretty famous back then and is still known today for his dramatic nature films with focus on ice and mountains. He worked with Luis Trenker for example too. Or with Leni Riefenstahl like in this movie here. It is one of her last performances in front of the camera as Riefenstahl focused more on making films when the Nazis came into power which was at pretty much the same time when this film came out. There also is an Englishlanguage version of this movie that came out the same time but stars American actors like Rod La Rocque playing Lorenz' part and the director is also not Fanck in that version. But Riefenstahl plays in both and so do other actors. But back to this one here. it is a film from the very early days of sound film. Pay attention to how there really isn't a whole lot of dialogue in here. The premise isn't bad. A polar expedition goes on a voyage looking for the members of another polar expedition that they lost contact to. Sadly what they made of it in detail is not really convincing at all. I almost never felt wellentertained watching this one. If there is one main problem you can probably say it is the script in general. The random nature recordings aren't even bad here I think but the characters and story around them never feels really interesting unfortunately. I would not even blame the actors they tried their best even if I am not really sold like everybody else when it comes to Riefenstahl's alleged charisma and range. Oh yeah legendary German pilot Ernst Udet plays himself in here too which is pretty interesting. But still the bad outweighs the good and I give this film a thumbsdown ultimately. Not recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "S.O.S. Eisberg is a German blackandwhite film from 1933 so this one is already almost 85 years old. It runs for roughly 1.5 hours and was written and directed by Arnold Fanck a German filmmaker who was pretty famous back then and is still known today for his dramatic nature films with focus on ice and mountains. He worked with Luis Trenker for example too. Or with Leni Riefenstahl like in this movie here. It is one of her last performances in front of the camera as Riefenstahl focused more on making films when the Nazis came into power which was at pretty much the same time when this film came out. There also is an Englishlanguage version of this movie that came out the same time but stars American actors like Rod La Rocque playing Lorenz' part and the director is also not Fanck in that version. But Riefenstahl plays in both and so do other actors. But back to this one here. it is a film from the very early days of sound film. Pay attention to how there really isn't a whole lot of dialogue in here. The premise isn't bad. A polar expedition goes on a voyage looking for the members of another polar expedition that they lost contact to. Sadly what they made of it in detail is not really convincing at all. I almost never felt wellentertained watching this one. If there is one main problem you can probably say it is the script in general. The random nature recordings aren't even bad here I think but the characters and story around them never feels really interesting unfortunately. I would not even blame the actors they tried their best even if I am not really sold like everybody else when it comes to Riefenstahl's alleged charisma and range. Oh yeah legendary German pilot Ernst Udet plays himself in here too which is pretty interesting. But still the bad outweighs the good and I give this film a thumbsdown ultimately. Not recommended.";

This is the story of Anna Wimschneider a woman who really existed and we find out about her life as a young woman during the days of Nazi Germany how she met Albert and how the two worked together on a farm trying to keep Nazi influence out as much as they could.Vilsmaier was one of the most influential German filmmakers in the 1990s and his name is still known to many today probably because he is still making new films despite approaching his 80th birthday. His movies often have a connection to Bavaria which is something I don't really like that much as I am from another region in Germany and never cared much about Munich or the Alps. Anyway Autumn Milk was his very first work as a director and for that it is an okay achievement. Still I personally never really felt for the main character or cared for her and I am not sure if she was relevant enough to get her own movie. The film moves very slowly and not a whole lot happens for a film of that runtime. I also did not find the main character too likable. I am not sure if that is because of Vvrov's acting or because of the writing maybe a mix of both. As a whole I don't think this one stands out from the grey mass of uncountable films made about the dark days of Nazi Germany and World War II. There is nothing new or innovative about it and I am surprised to see all the awards recognition it received. I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since Who Framed Roger Rabbit hit theaters in 1988 Hollywood has tried to replicate the formula of placing animated characters in the real world and viceversa. Space Jam was loved when first released but now seems like a feature length commercial for Michael Jordan's career. The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle worked on a spotthecameo level but little else. Cool World has for the most part blissfully faded from memory.Then along comes Looney Tunes Back in Action and does the impossible  it manages to be funny entertaining and lively while still slowing things down at times to be insightful. Loaded with numerous celebrities mugging for the camera satirical jabs at Hollywood and pop cultural references out the yingyang the movie has the true frantic nature of a cartoon.Daffy Duck voice of Joe Alaskey has become fed up by constantly playing second banana to Bugs Bunny also Alaskey for the past six decades. He makes an ultimatum  either he gets equal billing and pay alongside Bugs or he's out of there. Warner Bros. Vice President Kate Houghton Jenna Elfman promptly gives the duck the boot and while vindictively wrecking havoc on the studio lot Daffy hooks up with ne'er do well security guard D.J. Drake Brendan Fraser who happens to be the son of famous movie spy Damian Drake Timothy Dalton.D.J. is fired as well for not be able to stop Daffy's rampage and reluctantly goes home with the duck in tow. However things go crazy when he discovers that his father really is a spy and has been captured by the evil President of the ACME Corporation Steve Martin. D.J must take up his father's mission of seeking the Blue Monkey Diamond a mystical jewel that  like all mystical items in such movies  can be deadly in the wrong hands. Daffy's eyes naturally light up with greed at the sound of the word diamond and joins D.J.Meanwhile Kate is facing her own dismissal following less then stellar studio reviews of the latest Bugs cartoon without Daffy and must track down the duck with Bugs' help to convince him to return.

	onyx:emotionText "Ever since Who Framed Roger Rabbit hit theaters in 1988 Hollywood has tried to replicate the formula of placing animated characters in the real world and viceversa. Space Jam was loved when first released but now seems like a feature length commercial for Michael Jordan's career. The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle worked on a spotthecameo level but little else. Cool World has for the most part blissfully faded from memory.Then along comes Looney Tunes Back in Action and does the impossible  it manages to be funny entertaining and lively while still slowing things down at times to be insightful. Loaded with numerous celebrities mugging for the camera satirical jabs at Hollywood and pop cultural references out the yingyang the movie has the true frantic nature of a cartoon.Daffy Duck voice of Joe Alaskey has become fed up by constantly playing second banana to Bugs Bunny also Alaskey for the past six decades. He makes an ultimatum  either he gets equal billing and pay alongside Bugs or he's out of there. Warner Bros. Vice President Kate Houghton Jenna Elfman promptly gives the duck the boot and while vindictively wrecking havoc on the studio lot Daffy hooks up with ne'er do well security guard D.J. Drake Brendan Fraser who happens to be the son of famous movie spy Damian Drake Timothy Dalton.D.J. is fired as well for not be able to stop Daffy's rampage and reluctantly goes home with the duck in tow. However things go crazy when he discovers that his father really is a spy and has been captured by the evil President of the ACME Corporation Steve Martin. D.J must take up his father's mission of seeking the Blue Monkey Diamond a mystical jewel that  like all mystical items in such movies  can be deadly in the wrong hands. Daffy's eyes naturally light up with greed at the sound of the word diamond and joins D.J.Meanwhile Kate is facing her own dismissal following less then stellar studio reviews of the latest Bugs cartoon without Daffy and must track down the duck with Bugs' help to convince him to return. The four unlikely heroes team up to stop ACME save Damian Drake and patch up Bugs and Daffy's fractured partnership.A lot of love went into this product and it shows.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit having approached this movie with as much trepidation as anticipation. After all Mel Blanc is gone Chuck Jones is gone and the hallowed Looney Tunes franchise now resides in the hands of younger players.Think about all the things that could have gone wrong. The voices might not be quite the same. The animation might be done on the cheap like a lot of modern cartoons. The writers might opt for the kind of witless humor that seems to be in vogue today.Happily all my fears were unfounded. Looney Tunes  Back in Action is EXACTLY as good as I hoped it would be. Not only are the animation and voices superb the latter being indistinguishable from the originals but Looney Tunes turns out to be a veritable showcase of variations on all those goofy gags you remember from the old cartoons. Characters walking into paintings horribly defective ACME products the running rabbit seasonduck season feud...they're all here with every bit of comic timing and inventiveness that you remember and then some.Fans of the old cartoons will have a field day catching glimpses of all sorts of minor players in the background. Watch for Sam and Ralph the sheepdog and wolf who pummel each other  but only between 9 and 5  in the background of the cafeteria scene. The writer Larry Doyle miraculously manages to cram dozens of minor Looney Tunes characters into the story yet without making it seem awkward or contrived.Of course for the human characters one needs actors almost as cartoony as the venerable WB rabbit and duck and Brendan Fraser Jenna Elfman and Steve Martin work beautifully in their roles. Fraser of course already has George of the Jungle and Dudley DoRight under his belt Jenna Elfman always WAS something of a cartoon and after so many movies that underutilize his comic talents what a joy it is to see Steve Martin turned loose to perform the wild and crazy kind of comedy we haven't seen since the beginning of his career!There are also gag appearances by Timothy Dalton as a James Bondish spy hmmm... and Heather Locklear as one of his covert cohorts. Both actors show a nice flair for comedy. Casting directors please note. There are also a few surprise cameos which I wouldn't dare to spoil. The plot for those who apparently weren't paying attention involves the head of the evil ACME corporation Martin and his attempt to find a magical diamond which can change humans into monkeys. Recentlyfired Fraser and Daffy are hot on the trail of Fraser's father a spy who was captured while attempting to stop Martin's diabolical plot. Elfman and Bugs follow. The trail leads the foursome to clues in Las Vegas and Paris before reaching its climax in outer space. It's pretty much your standard James Bond plot except that it's scads wittier. For those who expected something meatier please check the IMDb for the following references KUBRICK STANLEY...WELLES ORSON...and BERGMAN INGMAR.Half the fun comes from seeing the various operatives that ACME throws up against our heroes Yosemite Sam Elmer Fudd Marvin the Martian Wile E. Coyote et. al. And if that wasn't enough there's a secret lab wherein Robby the Robot Kevin McCarthy They're coming! Beware! and an assortment of recognizable 1950s bugeyed monsters reside.There's even a nice subtext involving Daffy's frustration at always playing straight man to Bugs and the whole lovehate relationship between the two characters. Clearly writer Doyle knows this material inside and out. There are inherent dangers in taking characters that were after all short subjects and expanding them into a 90minute movie. Doyle overcomes these nicely thank you by moving Bugs Daffy Fraser and Elfman from one setpiece to another. He also eschews the alltoocommon tendency nowadays to make an action movie fastfastfast without any change of pace so we can catch our breaths. But no matter whether the characters are involved in an action sequence or just standing around talking the gags come thick and fast.Everything is rounded out with some nice special effects and a zippy music score by the everreliable Jerry Goldsmith who manages to beautifully integrate several classic Carl Stalling and Raymond Scott cues. Yeah you remember Scott. His music was that piece they played whenever they showed some sort of giant conveyor belt or monstrous contraption.As for those who didn't find this movie funny all I can do is quote Bugs ...If you don't find a rabbit wearing lipstick amusing then we ain't got nothing' to say to each other.Or in the words of Daffy Youuuuuuuuuu're despicable!".

The loudest may have been Daffy Duck who is a major player in this film. The female lead Jenna Elman is too hardlooking and just not likable to me.The positives outweigh the negatives however.

Dante really knows this territory and his affection for the material is very apparent. He is the ONLY logical choice for the director watch his older films for countless references to the Looney Tune gang. The humans are all game but never upstage the real stars Bugs and the Gang of course rather they simply add to the film and give us at least a few flesh and blood characters for us to relate to. Fraser is once again both heroic and likablegoofy Elfman is sexy and a bit cynical in fresh change of pace from her more docile Dharma character  from t.v. and Martin is like a human cartoon character himself. He hasn't been this out there and unpredictable since his celebrated standup days. He does anything but play it safe and ends up with a memorable if not a little eccentric performance. Timothy Dalton as Fraser's Dad is a real standout both referencing and spoofing his 007 past without scuffing up himself or the good Bond name. The fact he plays it so straight really adds to the quality of his scenes and jokes love the slapping himself scene!. There are some really inspired bits here funny and clever. The scene in the Louvre was both gorgeous to watch and so funny I laughed harder than I have at the theaters for a while. The entire outer space sequence is also just jammed packed with so many great bits you'll need to see it twice just to take it all in. It's unfortunate this little gem of a flick has been gobbled up in the busy holiday release schedule but fans should be pleased this film was made at all and will be able to own and enjoy it in the near future. I loved it as did my 12 year old sister my girlfriend and the theater I saw it with. Sad there will probably not be another large scale Looney production after this but we have this one to treasure. I believe over time and certainly on home video  DVD Back in Action will find it's audience. Like all great cult films it will probably take some time for it to be discovered but fans will keep it alive. examples? Big Trouble in Little China Tron Buckaroo Banzai Austin Powers Swingers and FX are just a handful of films that did very poor or just ok at the box office but went on to great success on home video and in many cases garnered RABID cult followings that have made them favorites with fans even today.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!! DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS!!!I like so much of America's population grew up watching Looney Tunes. Those old classic cartoons are just about the only thing that I find just as funny now as I did when I was three if not more so. When I walked into Looney Tunes Back In Action I realized that the people behind it were mere pretenders to the Chuck Jones throne. I braced myself for the fact that it might suck. Didn't matter. I consider myself an animation buff and this was a Looney Tunes movie a tribute to the funniest cartoons ever made.I sat down suffered through what seemed like three hours worth of ads this was an AMC theater and then when the film began I proceeded to grin like a loon for ninety minutes.The film had everything. Terrific animation direction and special effects that combined the live action and animation seamlessly a breakneck speed that almost topped the original cartoons and most of all great writing. When Jenna Elfman's character reminds Warner execs that her combined movies have grossed 950000 their Simpsonian response is That's not a billion. In a restaurant scene Porky Pig and Speedy Gonzales lament the need to be PC while Shaggy and Scooby give Matthew Lilliard a deserved chewingout. And having the villain be the head of the ACME corporation was a brilliant touch and casting Steve Martin for the role was icing on the cake.Brendan Fraser and Elfman do what they're there for no more no less. They set up the comedic pins for Bugs and Daffy to knock down. The cartoons are the true stars here especially Daffy who after decades of getting his beak blown off finally gets the chance to play the hero. I loved that the writers were able to find the perfect blend between the Bob Clampett WooHoo WhooHoo duck and the Chuck Jones You're Dithpicable duck. And the voices are as deadon as possible with Mel Blanc dead. I still slightly prefer Billy West's Bugs voice in Space Jam to Joe Alaskey's but this is a minor quibble.Early on when I heard that Eric Goldberg would be directing the animation my trust in the project skyrocketed. Goldberg was the supervising animator of the Genie in Aladdin a film which Jones himself called the funniest feature ever made. If there's anyone up to the job of remaking the Tunes for the new milloonium it's him.The film's piece de resistance however is a sequence that takes place in the Louvre in Paris in which Elmer Fudd chases Bugs and Daffy through all the paintings and as they run they take on the styles of Dali Munch and Seurat among others. The scene's cultural knowledge recalls Chuck Jones in the best way.With the exception of this scene and perhaps without even that exception the film does not aspire to be high art. It merely aspires to be fun and succeeds triumphantly. It's definitely the best classic cartoon characters interacting with live actors movie since Roger Rabbit it's far funnier and more focused than Space Jam and it contains none of the saccharine lessonlearning that ruined The Adventures of Rocky And Bullwinkle. It's just plain fun.There is the mandatory product placement but even that is given its due for the film's neverending speil of mockery It was sure nice of WalMart to give us all this free WalMart stuff in return for saying WalMart so much. Some people have complained about this but I say that the filmmakers are simply having their cake and eating it too. These same complainers pointed out that the film is chock full of crossreferences to other Warner products like Scooby Doo and Batman. The fact is after seeing this film I didn't want to see the next Batman movie or suffer through the Scooby Doo sequel or shudder shop at WalMart any more than I did before the previews ended. Maybe I'm the exception rather than the rule but I think companies who pay to have their products in movies are for the most part wasting their money.This leads me to the bane of my existence Bloody Critics or BCs. Some of these reviews are from people who just didn't get it and those reviews I can brush off. But the worst ones are from those who claim to be animation buffs who for the most part rallied against the cheapening of the great works of art that were the original Chuck Jones cartoons. The kinds of people who took college courses that study these cartoons because they were too lazy for a real literature course. The people who hold Chuck Jones to be sacred who consider it blasphemy to leave What's Opera Doc off the recent DVD set.I say these BCs have lost sight of something very important. Even though Chuck Jones would occasionally make a cartoon which made you think as well as laugh Duck Amuck What's Opera Doc One Froggy Evening I would say at least 75 of his output did not have such high aspirations and was simply meant to be entertaining and fun. Occasionally they would make cartoons that spoofed Wagner and other classics but more often they would spoof then current popcultural entities like Buck Rogers and Errol Flynn. Look at those Road Runner cartoons they're pretty much all the same! But does it matter? Of course not. What matters is how fun they are and how much you laugh. I say the same principle applies to this film. The film contains innumerable references to recent pop culture and perhaps the best one of all is a shot of Bugs catching a fish and saying Hey whaddaya know  I found Nemo! If you can't just sit back and laugh at that and yet you consider yourself an animation buff I shake my head and wonder why.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!! DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS!!!I like so much of America's population grew up watching Looney Tunes. Those old classic cartoons are just about the only thing that I find just as funny now as I did when I was three if not more so. When I walked into Looney Tunes Back In Action I realized that the people behind it were mere pretenders to the Chuck Jones throne. I braced myself for the fact that it might suck. Didn't matter. I consider myself an animation buff and this was a Looney Tunes movie a tribute to the funniest cartoons ever made.I sat down suffered through what seemed like three hours worth of ads this was an AMC theater and then when the film began I proceeded to grin like a loon for ninety minutes.The film had everything. Terrific animation direction and special effects that combined the live action and animation seamlessly a breakneck speed that almost topped the original cartoons and most of all great writing. When Jenna Elfman's character reminds Warner execs that her combined movies have grossed 950000 their Simpsonian response is That's not a billion. In a restaurant scene Porky Pig and Speedy Gonzales lament the need to be PC while Shaggy and Scooby give Matthew Lilliard a deserved chewingout. And having the villain be the head of the ACME corporation was a brilliant touch and casting Steve Martin for the role was icing on the cake.Brendan Fraser and Elfman do what they're there for no more no less. They set up the comedic pins for Bugs and Daffy to knock down. The cartoons are the true stars here especially Daffy who after decades of getting his beak blown off finally gets the chance to play the hero. I loved that the writers were able to find the perfect blend between the Bob Clampett WooHoo WhooHoo duck and the Chuck Jones You're Dithpicable duck. And the voices are as deadon as possible with Mel Blanc dead.

This was released in '03 not many people were interested in Looney Tunes anymore. Besides it had to go up against Finding Nemo. However this film has found it's audience on DVD. What do I think of it? Meh.Some things are good like the old school gags the FX the animation Brendan Fraser was good and I like the cartoony look.Now here are things I hate about it The pacing is TOO FAST! The opening is really hard to take in when the film is moving at 250 mph. SLOW DOWN! It's like Moulin Rogue were everything moves by so fast you can't follow what's going on.Jenna Elfman is TERRIBLE! She doesn't even try to give a good performance. I think she knew this film was going to flop and didn't care.Too many jokes are happening at once! It's hard to concentrate on one joke when there's something in the background you're meant to be looking at too. It's like the equivalent of having two friends talk to you at the same time and you don't know which one to talk to.Steve Martin is dreadful. I know he's overacting for the sake of being funny. But there's overacting in a good way and there's overacting in a bad way. Sadly this is the latter. I'm surprised him and Jenna didn't get any Razzie Nominations. The scene where Ron Perlman gets eaten by Taz and there's just his skeleton left was just too much. Sure it's done in a non gory way but....... it's just creepy.The Rabbit Season Duck Season gag has been done a million times. ENOUGH!Overall this film is okay. Worth watching if you're a Looney Tunes fan. But maybe if the pacing was slowed down a bit it would've been better.".

	schema:reviewBody "I bow to no one in my love and admiration for those classic Warner Brothers cartoons of the 1940's and 1950's. Like so many of my generation I was virtually raised on these works from infancy on up. Yet for those of us who are diehard aficionados 'Looney Tunes Back in Action' is a decidedly depressing experience proving once again that when it comes to revisiting one's childhood a person truly can't go home again.This is not of course a revisitation in its purest form since 'Back in Action' like 1996's 'Space Jam' is actually a modernized hybrid combining live action with animation. And that perhaps is the single greatest problem with this film. Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck Elmer Fudd the Road Runner and the rest of the gang clearly feel more at home in their own twodimensional world in which the laws of nature have no jurisdiction. Yank them out of that context and stick them into the 'real world' with a bunch of overacting humans and their unique charm begins to drain away and dissipate. Unfortunately both the cartoon characters and the humans with whom they are interacting are stuck with a dreary largely unfunny script that substitutes pandemonium and movement for cleverness and wit qualities the original cartoons had in abundance. The spy tale writer Larry Doyle has come up with is stultifying in its stupidity and reminds us of just why the Warner Brother originals which were masterpieces of minimalist storytelling ran for ten or fifteen minutes and no longer. Expanding the story to almost ten times that length stretches the already flimsy material far past the breaking point.There are a few moments of inspired fun such as when Bugs and Daffy followed by an irate Elmer Fudd jump in and out of art masterpieces in the Louvre wreaking havoc as they go or when our intrepid band of heroes encounters a secret Area 51type government project in the desert inhabited by a coterie of creatures from 1950's 'B' movie classics. In fact the movie has quite a bit of fun with 'in' movie references that adults are far more likely to get than the children who clearly make up the bulk of this movie's audience. But those moments of inspiration are few and far between and most of the time we are stuck in a fairly dismal comedy overall. The blending of live action and animation under the guidance of director Joe Dante is pretty much stateoftheart though these particular cartoon characters have more charm when they are two rather than three dimensional in form.Brendan Fraser as a stunt man who goes in search of his kidnapped father with Bugs and Daffy along for the ride makes an appealing hero although the usually likable Jenna Elfman succeeds mainly in being annoying. Timothy Dalton has a nothing part as Fraser's dad a legendary movie actor who turns out to be a spy off screen as well as on. Heather Locklear Joan Cusack Roger Corman and Kevin McCarthy also make brief appearances but the single worst job of acting is turned in by an overwrought and overwound Steve Martin who as the diabolical head of the Acme Corporation delivers a ham handed performance of monumental badness.Lovers of The WB cartoons had best stick with the originals.".

This movie doesn't have the greatest special effects and it is sometimes plainly obvious that the real life characters are acting with an empty space but special effects and realism were never the point of a good cartoon.  Like any good cartoon this movie doesn't really worry about technical issues or the plot rather it focuses on the entertainment value. I feel that this movie really sticks to the looney tunes formula in that it has jokes designed to keep all ages amused.  As a bond fan I found Timothy Dalton to be the most likable character and I really liked the posters that were in the background everywhere which were just rewritten Bond posters. There were many references and gags to other movies which I found to be great.This movie can get a little tiresome with the slapstick like comedy but overall it's pretty good.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to entertain their children while getting a laugh themselves.  This movie is so much better than any of those movies that have annoying children actor in them so if you are like me and want an alternative I suggest this one.".

Some of the cast deliver truly lousy performances Jenna Elfman and Steve Martin tied for the worst and the Looney Tunes are not really given anything funny to do.

Well that just makes the film more obnoxious.I don't know. This film is O.K. but just doesn't do justice to the Looney Tunes.

Second I thought that the cartoons themselves were great. Bugs Daffy Porky Yosemite Sam Foghorn Speedy Gonzales Elmer... they all stuck to the same characteristics that I grew to love watching Bugs Bunny cartoons on Saturday morning.  The only real drawback of this movie was without a doubt the liveaction actors.  Brendan Fraser is good but he can't live up to his past movies especially The Mummy saga.  The same goes to Jenna Elfman who's talent is severly wasted as she comes across as the most serious character in the whole movie.  Timothy Dalton as usual is flawless and if you look closely you can actually see how closely Fraser and Dalton look alike.  Steve Martin meanwhile makes one of the worst performances of his career and acts WAY too over the top even for an eccentric villain.  The movie is good but only is you are a truly devoted cartoonlover if you are then you'll get a huge kick out of the opening sequence alone. Overall come for Bugs leave for Martin.".

	schema:headline " Quite frankly the BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Well it took over 4 years but I finally have a new best movie. And not only that but it's the funniest movie ever also. It's quite possible you'll die of oxygen deficiency you'll be laughing so hard.Taking place in what is essentially the same universe as Who Framed Roger Rabbit the movie begins with both Daffy Duck and DJ Drake Brendan Fraser who also plays himself as well as Taz getting kicked off the Warner Brothers lot at the same time. Daffy follows Fraser home only for both of them to make the astonishing discovery that Brendan's movie star dad Damian Drake Timothy Dalton who doesn't appear to have aged a day since License to Kill is a REAL secret agent as well as playing one in the movies. He's been kidnapped by the Chairman of the evil Acme corporation in an attempt to find a mysterious diamond called the Blue Monkey and Brendan and Daffy team up to rescue him.But the Warner Brothers soon realize that without Daffy the Bugs Bunny cartoons are not worth anything. So Bugs and the Head of Animated Comedy Jenna Elfman go looking for him inadvertently getting dragged into the Blue Monkey plot.It's not only a wild collection of increasingly insane setpieces. Looney Tunes Back In Action is quite possibly the most intelligent and brilliantly crafted film of 2003.It's devastating that cheap nonsense such as Scary Movie 3 makes over 100 million while Looney Tunes barely scrapes 20 million. I blame the marketing.The trailer for this film was absolutely awful. And even I thought it looked really bad. Only my dedication to the Looney Tunes made me see it out of obligation. Thank God I didn't judge it by the trailer. I'm assuming most of the potential audience did. Plus it did have to go up against stiff holiday competition such as Return of the King and Elf !. Both of those movies had stronger marketing campaigns which is the only explanation I can offer for Elf doing so well.A few critics blasted Looney Tunes for being no more than an exersize in boosting sales for the Warner Brothers catalogue of characters. This is in no way true. While it's true that merchandise follows this movie as does every family film I simply do not see how it's pure exploitation. Space Jam was pure exploitation and an unashamed merchandise excuse. Back in Action fixes everything that went wrong with Space Jam. So much so that Joe Dante nicknamed this the 'AntiSpace Jam movie'. Back in Action is good oldfashioned Looney Tunes mayhem.I can't think of a more perfect director for this movie. Joe Dante is the most underappreciated director in recent history. It's obvious from his previous movies that he just loves the Looney Tunes and Back In Action surpasses even Gremlins 2 in terms out wall to wall madness and correct me if I am wrong but didn't the Looney Tunes run riot in that movie too. This is his most perfect movie to date and I am sure it will be appreciated by a wider audience once it hits DVD.The best thing about this movie? The fact that Daffy Duck gets the most amount of screen time. And his outrageous anarchic antics never fail to amuse. At one point Daffy and Bugs are chased by Elmer Fudd through a bunch of paintings in the Louvre art museum. It's a crazy sequence in which you simply cannot deny the movie's genius.The merging of live action and animation is seamless. It looks like Brendan Fraser and Daffy really are acting together and for all we know they are. Their chemistry is perfect and when Bugs joins the team there's so much going on that just one viewing isn't enough.There's hundreds of injokes as you would expect from a Joe Dante movie and none of them are of the cheap postmodern kind. Looney Tunes Back In Action has more class and more genius than any other comedy in the past few years. Even Steve Martin's performance as the manchild chairman of the Acme Corporation is a return to his edgier roles in movies like The Jerk and is far better than the 'family man' trash he's been doing for the past 10 years. He's practically an animation himself in this wonderful movie that's bursting at the seams with madness.".

	onyx:emotionText "Well it took over 4 years but I finally have a new best movie. And not only that but it's the funniest movie ever also. It's quite possible you'll die of oxygen deficiency you'll be laughing so hard.Taking place in what is essentially the same universe as Who Framed Roger Rabbit the movie begins with both Daffy Duck and DJ Drake Brendan Fraser who also plays himself as well as Taz getting kicked off the Warner Brothers lot at the same time. Daffy follows Fraser home only for both of them to make the astonishing discovery that Brendan's movie star dad Damian Drake Timothy Dalton who doesn't appear to have aged a day since License to Kill is a REAL secret agent as well as playing one in the movies. He's been kidnapped by the Chairman of the evil Acme corporation in an attempt to find a mysterious diamond called the Blue Monkey and Brendan and Daffy team up to rescue him.But the Warner Brothers soon realize that without Daffy the Bugs Bunny cartoons are not worth anything. So Bugs and the Head of Animated Comedy Jenna Elfman go looking for him inadvertently getting dragged into the Blue Monkey plot.It's not only a wild collection of increasingly insane setpieces. Looney Tunes Back In Action is quite possibly the most intelligent and brilliantly crafted film of 2003.It's devastating that cheap nonsense such as Scary Movie 3 makes over 100 million while Looney Tunes barely scrapes 20 million. I blame the marketing.The trailer for this film was absolutely awful. And even I thought it looked really bad. Only my dedication to the Looney Tunes made me see it out of obligation. Thank God I didn't judge it by the trailer. I'm assuming most of the potential audience did. Plus it did have to go up against stiff holiday competition such as Return of the King and Elf !.

The Trygon Factor is no exception to this rule as the film being together several different plot elements and manages to spin a very intriguing tale of crime and murder out of it! Like most all? of the genre the film is based on a book by Edgar Wallace and puts it's main focus on a monastery inhabited by both a group of nuns and a strange family. There has been some strange happenings going on in the area including murder and this leads Scotland Yard detective CooperSmith to investigate. It's not long before his investigation leads him to the monastery but gaining a search warrant is a difficult task considering that the centre of it all is a place lived in by nuns. The detective therefore has to try and gather some 'real evidence' on the crimes which will allow him to gain the warrant and crack the case!On paper it really sounds like this film will be a disaster as there's a great deal of little subplots and characters yet somehow the story comes together and despite a few moments of confusion actually is quite coherent. The style of the film is great director Cyril Frankel delivers a great colour scheme and the look of the film really suits its wayward plot line. The acting is very decent too and the film features a standout performance from Stewart Granger in the lead role. It's clear that the film is not meant to be taken entirely seriously and this is to its benefit as a truly serious tone would have ruined it. There's plenty to chuckle at in this movie! The atmosphere is great and the monastery at the centre of the movie provides some nice locations for the action to take place in. The murder scenes are not gory but they are entertaining to watch  the final one is not to be missed! Overall the Krimi genre on the whole certainly takes a bit of getting used to but it's great fun and this film is no exception. Highly recommended viewing!".

	schema:reviewBody "THE TRYGON FACTOR is an odd little addition to the German cycle of krimi movies aka Edgar Wallace adaptations that were made throughout the 1960s. This one is more of a UK production although it's still listed as a UKWest German collaboration. Certainly the setting and cast are all British so this feels like a low budget British thriller and despite the odd appearance of a blackclad murderer in a creepy mask it doesn't really feel like a Wallace movie at all.In fact I'm not really sure what it does feel like. THE TRYGON FACTOR is a film with a bit of everything including a surprisingly lightness of touch that makes it feel like a comedy in places. In essence a cast of British notables go through their paces in a wacky story about the mysterious goingson at a nunnery of all places. An aristocratic family are implicated in a recent crime spree so a Scotland Yard detective is sent to investigate.This low budget movie is directed by Cyril Frankel who had recently made NEVER TAKE SWEETS FROM A STRANGER and THE WITCHES for Hammer. It's better than THE WITCHES I'll give it that. Stewart Granger headlines the cast and does his best Cary Grant impersonation. Allan Cuthbertson is present in the arresting opening sequence as an investigating detective. Hammer starlet Diane Clare PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES is also around as a nun on the run quite literally. The likes of Susan Hampshire James Robertson Justice and Robert Morley all play sinister suspects. Russian hardman Yuri Borienko ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE has a fine if clichd part as a tough henchman and there's a great fight scene involving his character. At times THE TRYGON FACTOR feels like a random sequence of outlandish moments strung together by the barest of plots but it's quite watchable and the ending is a memorable one.".

Certainly the setting and cast are all British so this feels like a low budget British thriller and despite the odd appearance of a blackclad murderer in a creepy mask it doesn't really feel like a Wallace movie at all.In fact I'm not really sure what it does feel like. THE TRYGON FACTOR is a film with a bit of everything including a surprisingly lightness of touch that makes it feel like a comedy in places. In essence a cast of British notables go through their paces in a wacky story about the mysterious goingson at a nunnery of all places. An aristocratic family are implicated in a recent crime spree so a Scotland Yard detective is sent to investigate.This low budget movie is directed by Cyril Frankel who had recently made NEVER TAKE SWEETS FROM A STRANGER and THE WITCHES for Hammer. It's better than THE WITCHES I'll give it that. Stewart Granger headlines the cast and does his best Cary Grant impersonation. Allan Cuthbertson is present in the arresting opening sequence as an investigating detective. Hammer starlet Diane Clare PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES is also around as a nun on the run quite literally. The likes of Susan Hampshire James Robertson Justice and Robert Morley all play sinister suspects. Russian hardman Yuri Borienko ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE has a fine if clichd part as a tough henchman and there's a great fight scene involving his character. At times THE TRYGON FACTOR feels like a random sequence of outlandish moments strung together by the barest of plots but it's quite watchable and the ending is a memorable one.";

As Dyrbusch leader of the pack and Bogatsch the executive power continue torturing Leibnitz he voluntarily endures because he's unable to dispose of his tormentors on one hand being afraid to lose their friendship and on the other hand due to potential consequences which may arise from his parents.

Though all four drunk after bathing nude threaten a girl called Vaneska Stephanie Schnfeld with possible rape Konstantin and Von Leibnitz have second thoughts and from then on a dangerous dynamic of conflict arises. Plainly two of the bad boys aren't bad enough to suit the other two. Von Leibnitz becomes the alltoowilling torture object of the two boldest and most psychopathic boys Konstantin having second thoughts wants to opt out.A big paunchy but nicely dressed teachermentor Michael Schweighfer is the only authority figure seen. He tries by a show of ease and self confidence to mask the fact that among these moneyed delinquents he may not have the last word. Events do turn tragic and in an unexpected and ironic manner.The story has familiar elements the outline has strong echoes of 'Young Torless.' But the telling has a raw contemporary feel. There's a fresh sense of danger and nearhysteria about many scenes  something tricky to create and trickier to keep from overwhelming the narrative. Director Thomas Stuber who was only 26 when he made this film but had six years of apprenticeship behind him gets intense performances out of his actors. In some of the group sequences especially the nearrape you may forget anyone is acting yet to balance that the setup is classically cinematic. The economical editing maintains the nice balance between chaos and order. Stuber shows a lot of promise. The writing of Holger Jckle is praiseworthy too.'Teenage Angst' is a recent release by Picture This! the indie distributor of mostly foreign coming of age and gayrelated films e.g. 'Garcon Stupide' 'Come Undone''Aimee and Jaguar''Before the Fall' that as of Nov. 2009 has closed its doors after 13 years. 'Angst and Angelina Maccarone's 2006 also German 'Punish Me' 'Verfogt' are examples that Picture This! is a niche loss that will be felt both by viewers and by the industry. This comes on top of the greater loss of preeminent foreign film distributor New Yorker Films which shut down earlier this year after 44 years and was responsible for the US release of many foreign classics.".

The director is Thomas Stuber recently very successful with Herbert and after some short film work this his his very first full feature film at slightly over 60 minutes including credits a really short one though. Maybe that is the reason the film lacks in the storytelling department quite a bit. We have a group of four young men and we see what the advantages of their parents' wealth turned them into sadists criminals masochists indifferent followers but the humanity is pretty much gone in all of these. Admittedly the grownup characters in here are not helping matters i.e. the boys either. Nonetheless the film delivers really as nothing but a story of shock value and humiliation. You don't care for any of the characters or their wellbeing really. In terms of the character study component it is really an underwhelming outcome I must say. The young actors are nothing special either and I don't really see promise in them. Or perspective. For a decent and especially for a long career in the industry they need to step things up. Same for the duo who wrote this. Then again it's been almost 10 years since this came out so here's hoping they managed to improve already. For daddy Schweighfer all hope is lost though perhaps agewise. Then again he probably isn't any worse in here than his equally untalented and horribly overrated son. This film offers almost nothing below the surface and I give it a thumbsdown. It's not a failure but also miles away from being a good movie. I am glad it was this short. Not recommended. Oh yeah final note This film is also known as Spieltrieb and you should not mistake it for the other later title by Gregor Schnitzler with that name because that one is actually fairly decent.".

It is directed by written by and starring Luis Trenker a World War I veteran who was born in today's Italy. In the center of the film is mountain climbing Matterhorn an issue about which Trenker made several movies. It fits that he was an avid climber himself. And he must have lead a healthy life as he became almost 100 years old. The rest of the cast is not really known. The most interesting thing about this film is probably not really the main plot but all the references in retrospective looking at how this was made during Hitler's reign. The propaganda ministry planned on making Trenker their big star but he was fairly unpolitical which they did not like.Anyway apart from the climbing part there is a bit more in here love stories an alleged? murder and a bit more. As a whole I did not really enjoy this film sadly. The worst thing in my opinion was possibly the ending which was just too showy and 100 in your face. A bit subtlety would not have hurt. Not recommended. Finally a little sidenote This is already the second movie about Carl Haensel's novel centered on the first climbing of the Matterhorn starring Luis Trenker. The first is from 1928.".

	schema:headline " Jigsaw says Vote Yes on Healthcare Reform";
	schema:reviewBody "Saw was never a franchise that was designed to last. The first film made a point of killing off every main character save one who was already dying of an inoperable brain tumor. But when a movie grosses 100 times its budget filmmakers tend to find untapped wells of ingenuity. Saw VI tells a story that is almost certainly incomprehensible to those who have not seen the previous five films. The entire plot hinges on the reveal of an element first introduced in Saw III and details the rise of a character who made his debut as a glorified extra. The entire twist ending is predicated upon one's memory of a secondary character who is never even on screen during this feature except during a brief flashback. It's some straight up Star Trek level minutia. Because of this a plot summary is useless. You either know what to expect in which case it is best to see the movie completely cold or you've already determined that you don't care. Suffice it to say John Jigsaw Kramer and Amanda Young are still dead as they have been since part three and Agent Hoffman is still on the loose trying to teach more people to appreciate life. Then things get complicated.Saw has always worked under a strange moral code espousing a bizarre brand of carpe diem philosophy spoken by serial killer who seems to think that he is saving people by throwing them in pits of used needles or forcing them to cut off their feet. This philosophy has long been an albatross for the series because Jigsaw's ideas are to put it bluntly completely idiotic. The result of these tests would likely be a crippling case of posttraumatic stress disorder not a moment of truth. Saw VI works hard to solve this problem. For the first time in series history Jigsaw is shown to be maybe the slightest bit mentally unsound. This is a small but important step as the series makes infinitely more sense and is far more chilling if Jigsaw is taken as a David Berkowitz type instead of some sort of blood and guts Buddha. Simultaneous to this the filmmakers have finally created a cast of victims who might well deserve their fate. Thinking back it's actually quite surprising that it took five sequels to get to a trap where loan sharks are forced to contend with Shylock's infamous demand of A pound of Flesh. While many have anticipated a jump to the supernatural for several entries few if any guessed that Saw would ever become a political story. You see Saw VI is just as much about the current healthcare reform debate as it is about soap opera plot twists. In one scene Jigsaw literally says the words Medical decisions should be made by Doctors and patients before going on to equate HMO's with murderous thugs. And while the political polemic elements are perhaps a bit overcooked they do imply a level of effort on the part of the filmmakers that goes beyond the call of duty. The social consciousness of Jason Voorhees' sixth outing began and ended with a happy face symbol made of blood.Longtime series editor Kevin Greutert moves to the director's chair for this entry and his experience with the franchise shines through. He has clearly been planning for this opportunity for quite some time and he makes the most of it combining the indie grunge of the original with the flashy scene transitions of the sequels all while expanding the color palette steadying the ADHD afflicted cinematography and toning down the ultraviolence.. This is almost certainly the best looking part six the horror genre has ever seen. Keeping pace with the direction is a slick fast and occasionally inventive screenplay by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton who handedly outdo their work on the previous two films.Everything that was wrong with the five previous films is still wrong here. The sets still look like those of a movie made for about a million dollars the actors are mostly second rate and the logic is tenuous within a real world scenario. The dialogue is occasionally as cringe inducing as the gory set pieces and the script makes excessive use of expository tape recordings in place of legitimate character development. And yet I had a damn good time. This film is easily the best since part two and somehow actually made me want to see part seven. For those already invested in the series Saw VI is a Halloween treat. It's smarter than the previous three and it features some of the series most interesting traps. It even gives you a little something to talk about after the credits roll. Most will hate it sight unseen but those who show up to watch Saw VI is better than it has any right to be.".

Saw 6 is not only just a good sequel but its actual a great movie on its own. The moral dilemma William faces as part of his game throughout the movie... real powerful choices.

I wont spoil it but my GOD.. You thought agent Straham had a powerful will to live in that intro scene to 5 You ain't seen nothing yet.Mainly though.. The story.. One thing this chronicle of the series does nicely as well is tie up SO many questions that have been still hanging from way back to even Saw 3 with a couple of new ones added just for the next ones... I found that even though i thought 4 and 5 were average on their own... After seeing this one it amplified and made them.. i don't know.. make sense.Just like a jigsaw.. as each piece is layed down... the entire picture starts to make sense. Bring on Saw 7!!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I am going to say it up front. The Saw series is a guilty pleasure of mine. That being said the last couple have not really engaged me all that much. After this one though consider me back in the fold. Longtime series editor turned first time director Kevin Greutert has recharged the series and injected something these films have lacked since the beginning humor.Saw VI starts with a bang. You know right off the bat that this isn't the same dead serious almost somber type of Saw film you're used to. I'm going to give Greutert and company the benefit of the doubt here and assume that this is by design. You know when Jigsaw is putting people in traps for smoking too much that your tongue should be firmly planted in cheek. This film is also much more open and colorful than previous films. After the claustrophobic Saw V that seemed to take place in only three different rooms this is a welcome change of pace. Also the traps here are much more inventive than V and maybe even IV nothing will best III in my mind for sheer over the topness. The amount of twists and surprises is also plentiful and really do help bring the game full circle. This is definitely not the transition film that the last one was and it really left me to wonder where exactly they can go from here. The twists and turns of the plot are not something I want to give away as its part of the fun but suffice to say if you've stuck with the series up until now you won't feel gipped as you walk out of the theater. The film follows Hoffman as he tries to stay one step ahead of the FBI while conducting a game involving John Kramer's insurance broker William who is put through a series of tests involving his coworkers. The film moves at a breakneck pace cutting back and forth between the two main plot threads while also throwing in the now famous Saw flashbacks to fill in the gaps of all the past movies. I was never bored and special mention has to be given to Greutert for really keeping this thing from getting bogged down in the procedural aspects that really plagued the last few films. This is balls to the wall entertainment and it delivers while also winking and nodding along the way. Saw also gets extremely topical here for the first time and the main thrust and theme of this film will hit home to anyone who even has a passing knowledge of current affairs in this country. The only negatives I can really point out in the film is some of the suspect acting but again this might be done on purpose through the director's eyes to inject some humor without resorting to having Jigsaw or Hoffman crack jokes Freddy Krueger style while they dispense moral justice. We haven't gotten there yet maybe Saw X. The other problem I had was that some of the back story really pushed the suspension of disbelief but I guess I shouldn't nitpick because that has been a problem as far back as Saw II and is needed to stretch out this far anyway. All in all this is easily the best Saw since the 2nd one and I am glad to see the series get back on track after the CSI elements of the last two films. This is Saw how I like it down and dirty and over the top. Bring on Saw VII!".

All in all this is easily the best Saw since the 2nd one and I am glad to see the series get back on track after the CSI elements of the last two films. This is Saw how I like it down and dirty and over the top. Bring on Saw VII!";

The story was more interesting and the twists and turns were quite intriguing. One little problem i have with this film is that they went way too overboard with the blood and gore in this one but i suppose that nowadays thats what the Saw films are all about which is a shame considering the first film started off as a psychological thriller.Apart from that the film was quite enjoyable and there's definitely some little secrets that they will be able to use for more sequels.

	schema:reviewBody "I can remember walking out of Saw V last year and I hate to say it...but I was pretty disappointed. The film just didn't deliver the goods. It's narrative and so called twist made the walk to my car a living hell and I thought to myself They're going to mess up Saw VI. In my review for Saw V I stated that the Saw blade was getting rusty and dull. It just wasn't the same as it used to be and the shock factor that made the films so suspenseful was absolutely gone.Here I am a year later. After waiting for what seems to be decades I finally got out of the midnight opening of Saw VI. It's difficult to give a sentence that accurately describes what I'm feeling right now so I'll just say this HOLY FING ST!!! It seems as if the yearwait paid off because Saw VI is easily the best of the 'second trilogy' in the Saw series.What makes Saw VI such a smarter film is it's ability to play off the strengths of its predecessors. The film knows its destination so we get a much more solid story this time around. There has been a lot of buildup in the previous installments and it's happened for a reason The payoff is in this one. It's really incredible how everything in the plot came together so perfectly. All of the events that have occurred thus far have demonstrated a Domino Effect  every character in the series is relevant and one character's actions can change the entire course of the story and lead to something else. Any questions brought up in the previous installments are cleared up in VI so we finally get a solid conclusion I really don't know what the hell they're going to do for Saw VII. When you look up the plot for Saw VI it seems so simple Special Agent Strahm is dead and Detective Hoffman has emerged as the unchallenged successor to Jigsaw's legacy. However when the FBI draws closer to Hoffman he is forced to set a game into motion and Jigsaw's grand scheme is finally understood.Trust me there's a lot more going on in this film than this. But one thing's for sure Jigsaw's grand scheme is finally understood and that's what mattered most. All of the pieces of the puzzle come together and you remain on the edge of your seat because you have no idea what's going to happen to these characters. The plot takes dramatic twists and turns that will have your jaw hit the floor. If you're like me and you're a fan of these films because of the stories then Saw VI will go beyond your expectations.As for the hardcore Saw fans who are in it for the traps don't worry Saw VI is without a doubt the most gruesome of them all. They really raised the bar with this one in terms of the amount of violence shown on the screen. I'm amazed the MPAA didn't give this film an NC17 rating because the traps along with the cinematography really bring out the gore. The film received an 'X' rating in Spain though so I'll let you imagine how violent this one is.Overall Saw VI was incredibly well done. The story and pacing was perfect. The acting from the main cast Tobin Bell Betsy Russell Costas Mandylor Shawnee Smith and Peter Outerbridge was great. The traps were disturbing as hell. And most importantly a hardcore Saw fan left the theater with a smile on his face. Saw VI Director Kevin Greutert editor of the first five installments really did an astounding job and while I don't like the fact the series is continuing next year I hope he's involved with the future installments.".

Digging deeper though afterwards I realized how much was wrong. This time however several friends came along avid fans of disliking the newer installments. Well I am happy to say they finally did something right.The very first thing I noticed that was different was the pacing of the movie. The opening scene is a trap. I will not reveal who or why for that matter you pay good money to find out after all. Though after that the movie takes a very different tone. While everyone probably is used to the nature of SAW not wasting any time they took a different approach for the sixth installment. We begin to follow where SAW V left off Hoffman emerging victorious or so it may seem. And soon enough the introduction of our newest test subject William. It's hard to get into the character without spoiling anything so if I seem vague you know why. William is an insurance agent the vice president of his company as a matter of fact. In that he made a formula on how to determine who should be eligible for health insurance. Needless to say John Kramer was a former associate of his.Jill the exwife of the infamous Jigsaw Killer was also presented a box. The box plays a large role this time around and again I will not spoil it. Her role in the grand scheme of things is further explained and finally understood. Everything between her past with John her present with Hoffman and if she truly is part of the scheme or just another person wanting to escape it all.The story is nice refresher from the original pace and nicely executed. Acting this time around as well was great.My only complaint is how even though the ending will surprise you there has been so much exposed through previous installments you feel less than shocked. Those who remember previous SAW's will understand what I mean by shock. There is a lot answered this time around near everything actually. Be it the letter from SAW III Hoffman's true intentions Jill's involvement and Jigsaw's grand scheme everything will be fully explained this time around. I highly recommenced this SAW especially if you want to give it that one last chance to see if it can be saved. Personally I find it redeeming and if they continue with refreshing courses such as this SAW could go on forever.".

I really hope they decide to have Kevin Gretuert sP do Saw VII instead of Hackl no offense. I don't know if it was Hackl's fault or the screenwriter's for Saw V being such a weak entry but all I know is Gretuert knows what he's doing and is a much more decisive and talented director. I hope he does more than Saw films in the future! The only thing that disappointed me was no mentioning of the events with the exception of Hoffman as the new Jigsaw and Strahm's death from Saw V...For instance what was the point of the people in the traps in V? I know that was more than likely intentional to keep the suspense going for future sequels but DAMNIT I want to know what happened to Julie Benz's character and why that game was so important.Overall I give saw 9.510".

While watching the movie I found myself comparing it to the episode of ordinary TV show. Flashbacks from previous episodes cheap effects by the way worse than some of the TV series weak performance by actors and the plot line that no longer can surprise you. All that brings down the movie value to almost a bare minimum saving that last star or two for the next Saw movie in 2010. Next year's Halloween again. Say...commerce? Speaking of which the future is pretty grim for the Jigsaw according to the interest that has been shown to the Saw 6. The message is clear cow is dry and the glue factory awaits. There's only Lionsgate left to understand this simple truth.".

While watching the movie I found myself comparing it to the episode of ordinary TV show. Flashbacks from previous episodes cheap effects by the way worse than some of the TV series weak performance by actors and the plot line that no longer can surprise you. All that brings down the movie value to almost a bare minimum saving that last star or two for the next Saw movie in 2010. Next year's Halloween again. Say...commerce? Speaking of which the future is pretty grim for the Jigsaw according to the interest that has been shown to the Saw 6. The message is clear cow is dry and the glue factory awaits. There's only Lionsgate left to understand this simple truth.";

I keep stating writing and promising to give up on bad filmsseries and especially stop supporting them financially that is so Hollywood finally gets back on track with better made films. The more people see trash like 2012 for example the more crp we'll be subjected to.That all being said surprisingly enough 'Saw VI' was better than the previous entry. Of course that's not saying much. This latest installment was trash of course with horrid acting a zillion flashbacks and as a series trend flashbacks within flashbacks and a million crossovers from previous chapters. When I finished watching this knowing this is probably geared towards the young male audience I laughed thinking they've been duped into watching a soap opera.Yep the Saw series is now a soap opera albeit an extremely gory one  probably what Dark Shadows wanted to be but in no way could attempt decades ago. I haven't even seen too many soaps in my time to know the transition scenes from one flashback or plot twist to the next is the exact techniques they use in the daytime dramas. They even have spoiler the blond be the backstabbing btch in one of probably 37 subplots.Though it's oldschool now by part VI they bring back Jigsaw again through yep you guessed it more flashbacks and videos he made prior to death. Side Note I guess by using this method they think they're clever on spinning the old Friday the 13th or Halloween psycho rebirths in their opening segments but in reality it's just stale by now.Does this guy have more recorded videos than Blockbuster? Does this guy have about 1 billion dollars and enough real estate to pull off about 16 dozen traps? I'm guessing they explain everything but you begin to wonder by now if this guy owned half the city and no one ever wondered why he was always converting old disgusting warehouses into death traps.It's really irrelevant to describe the plot this time but here goes the new ideas they came up with two companies one financial one insurance apparently pssed off Jigsaw when he was alive and from the grave Jigsaw uses his newest accomplice one of many in the series to set the traps of the employees in motion. Only this time a lot of people need to decide on who lives and who dies. This is a change from the original traps where people only had their own fate to worry about.While the previous two Saw movies toned down the gore mercifully what originally made the movies good in the beginning was them focusing on the story over gore again they stepped it back up again almost from minute one. Now Saw III still is the leader in gore in the series and the 1 goriest movie I have ever seen this one breaks in the top 5. Sincerely I've got to listen to myself and avoid the next two in the franchise supposedly the final two.Honestly by this point I just don't care how the series pans out. I've said this before they should've ended with 3 with the death of Jigsaw. What possible conclusion could there be? Jigsaw never died it was his slightly less evil twin? It was all a dream but when Jigsaw wakes up he smiles indicating the series is getting a reboot? Or best yet no one truly died a la April Fool's Day and everyone turns to the audience says Thank you all for coming and remember to appreciate life! while holding hands and bowing?I see the torture prn movies are finally dying out while the reboots of the 198070s slashers increase and hopefully this series will as well.".

Over the past five years a tricksy critically acclaimed crime thriller has morphed into a sprawling daytime soap with added gloop a guaranteed annual cash cow for bargainbasement distributors Lionsgate who cattily insist that film critics shell out for their own screenings. Oddly these films don't tend to pick up very good reviews.The biggest surprise then is that Saw VI isn't totally terrible. I mean it's still a load of number 2's obviously. Just not enough to block the toilet. This has been achieved in one very simple stroke. Understanding that some of the best horror films utilise contemporary events to add a powerful frisson of credibility director and former series editor Kevin Greutert has decided to lend the hermiticallysealed franchise some immediate and wonderfully mischievous relevancy.Saw's gamers have never exactly been sympathetic that's why they've been forced to crawl though those fiendish fleshflaying traps in the first place. But for Saw IV the filmmakers have made them universal objects of scorn and loathing from the outset nobody's going to mourn these guys. For this time round the hapless game playerscumvictims are insurance executives and lenders. Hooray! Thus by ensuring its executions are almost cheerfully retributive and by jettisoning the tedious police procedurals that have recently capsized the series this one gives the audience more of what it really wants lowlifes being dispatched in ingeniously sick and overthetop ways such as being forced to hack out their own body fat or being injected with hydrofluoric acid melted from the inside out.Even better it sets them on each other after health insurance man William Peter Outerbridge turns the cancerridden John Kramer  Jigsaw's coverage down he's abducted and forced to kill off his fellow Noughties whippingboys and girls in a mockery of the mathematical system he uses to determine who's paid out and who isn't. In a sense you get to choose who lives and who dies... muses an appalled John  Jiggy Tobin Bell in flashback making the lender  'monster' analogy explicit.The best and funniest scene sees a bunch of William's fellow insurers strapped around a revolving playground carousel. William must shoot them in turn to save his own skin  though two are allowed to live. What follows is essentially satire as the horrid little mercenaries alternately plead with him to spare their lives while verbally ripping each other to shreds accusing one another of being worthless liars.Satire suits Saw. It's not like we're asking for yet another sequel exactly and Saw VII  in 3D!  is already in the works in any case but this definitely hints at some interesting new directions.".

Thus by ensuring its executions are almost cheerfully retributive and by jettisoning the tedious police procedurals that have recently capsized the series this one gives the audience more of what it really wants lowlifes being dispatched in ingeniously sick and overthetop ways such as being forced to hack out their own body fat or being injected with hydrofluoric acid melted from the inside out.Even better it sets them on each other after health insurance man William Peter Outerbridge turns the cancerridden John Kramer  Jigsaw's coverage down he's abducted and forced to kill off his fellow Noughties whippingboys and girls in a mockery of the mathematical system he uses to determine who's paid out and who isn't. In a sense you get to choose who lives and who dies... muses an appalled John  Jiggy Tobin Bell in flashback making the lender  'monster' analogy explicit.The best and funniest scene sees a bunch of William's fellow insurers strapped around a revolving playground carousel. William must shoot them in turn to save his own skin  though two are allowed to live. What follows is essentially satire as the horrid little mercenaries alternately plead with him to spare their lives while verbally ripping each other to shreds accusing one another of being worthless liars.Satire suits Saw. It's not like we're asking for yet another sequel exactly and Saw VII  in 3D!  is already in the works in any case but this definitely hints at some interesting new directions.";

The violence and gore that Saw has brought to us continues but this time a well thought plot with meaning and character development is attached. The way everything comes together is mindblowing and yes......my mind is literally blown. This movie was so outstanding that it has redeemed this failing series.If your not a fan of Saw do NOT let that turn you away because you will NOT be disappointed. This is nothing like the others. It takes a completely different approach for the good. Wow.......just wow was this ever good. While I would not give most of the other sequels over a 5 I give this movie 10 because of the fact of how I could not think of any way this movie could have been better.

I liked the overall look of the movie and the gore was realistic looking too not the CG crap like in Saw IV and V. That is unfortunately where it stops. None of the traps are creative at all the janitor trap? WTF. The movie was 75 flashbacks which bored the hell out of me. The acting was bad as usual but then again with the exception of Jigsawwhen has the acting ever been good in a Saw movie. And that ending.Total bullshit! The second it was over I thought What the hell was that????.In short will I see Saw VII? Yes but only because I just wanna see how the series will end up.

You'll find answers on questions from SAW 3 and SAW 5 and also from the hole series there is a question remaining about the medical care... and no this don't have anything in common with Dr. Gordon  although he appears in a discussion only named by someone. By the way... all the critics from the board must ask appologies from the SAW fans... the real fans... As in SAW 5 we have two twists. Both at the end... There is a fine remake of the Hello Zep Theme by Charles Clouser at the beginning of the first twist and the unforgettable Hello Zep at the end God I love this song !!!. Some of you will say that the ending was to be expected. I tell you that it isn't so but 50. The last image before de credits roll over the screen just blew me away... A perfect ending for the second trilogy. Also the second favorite part in the series  you'll see that is better than the rest of them. I just can't wait for the seventh part...

This is the first ever film that has actually had me breathing heavily and twitching on the edge of my seat almost all of the way through.The main plot concerning detective Hoffman has twists that you never would have expected. Things that date back to the first and third films. Even if you tried to figure it out as hard as you could it hits you brilliantly just like the majority of the other films. The subplot is well thought out and displays a sense of 'irony vs resolution' similar to Jeff's game in Saw III. Things tend to lack a little creativity especially the carousel trap that you might have seen in the trailers...still the other traps within the film compensate in terms of originality...and anatomy.Very nasty things happen in the film. The amount of blood and gutwrenching violence puts this film up to the same standard of Saw 3 4 and 5. More than enough to satisfy any gore junkies. The amount of thought put into some of these traps make you think that the writers are psychopaths for thinking of them...and you start to think you're a psychopath for loving them.I've read reviews here about the previous films and people said they were looking forward to the film with high expectations that were not met. I couldn't help but get excited about Saw VI about three weeks before it came out  and was a little conscious about whether or not the expectations were going to be met.They were met. If you haven't seen it yet and you feel the same way you will be far from disappointed. Looking forward to Saw VII already I wanna see how this all ends.".

Sy Lerner is the quintessential movie producer when he makes a bet that he can take any kid off the street and turn him into a superstar overnight using the universal language of the festival hype. He meets Frank Rhinoslavsky and turns him into 'Frank Rhino one of the hottest screenwriters to hit Cannes since Faulkner and Hemingway.' It's not long before celebrities and producers are lining up to meet this hot young star.

	schema:reviewBody "Cannes Man is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen as it pokes fun as the selfindulgent Hollywod movie industry exposing how full of crap some of the industry people are and that includes more than just promoters and producers but actors and directors as well.Filmed entirely at the Cannes Film Festival in Cannes France is something of a story that models the success of Chauncy of that old Peter Sellers classic 'Being There.' Frank Rhinoslavasky Francesco Quinn kind of a dumb guy and parttime New York cab driver wants to break into the movie business. He doesn't have anything to offer and just thinks that he can start at the top as a writer. Opportunity knocks on Frank's door when he goes to the Cannes Film Festival to deliver some props to Troma Inc.There Frank meets Sy Lerner Seymor Cassell perhaps the biggest bullshitter in the business and as each person interviewed in this mockumentary he has made a fool out of a lot of industry executives and cost them plenty of money. Sy Lerner makes a bet with his friend that he can take any shmoe off the street and turn them into the biggest success around. And Frank is his shmoe. Like Chauncy Peter Seller's dimwitted character in Being There who was haled as a genius by those who only saw what they wanted to see in Chauncy and the kicker is that they eventually nominate him President Frank Rhino is going to create the same success by letting others do all the work. Sy Lerner takes on Frank as his pet project. He shows Frank how to dress and behave though Frank doesn't drop much of his idiotic conversation habits tells him how to respond when being interviewed such as never saying too much and always being ambiguous. Then Lerner comes up with the vehicle for Frank's reputation by naming him the writer of a new movie. Only the movie doesn't exist and Frank isn't a writer. And even knowing Lerner's reputation people buy into the garbage. And now everyone wants a piece of that action. Lerner and Frank now given a fitting industry name of Frank Rhino have everyone knocking down their door hot directors big name producers and big shot actors including some great scenes with Johnny Depp and Jim Jarmusch. Interviews press opportunities everything Frank is the Cannes Man and he didn't have to do much to get it.Even funnier than the fact that everyone is falling for all the garbage Lerner and Rhino hand them is the intermittent interviews with members of the industry who initially started talking about how Lerner suckered them out of money and then gradually change their tune about wanting a piece of the new hot action Frank Rhino and his movie. They went full circle.I imagine the filmmakers went around Cannes and just asked people to take part in it improvising most of it like Frank Whaley Peter Gallagher and Laura Flynn Boyle most obviously do promoting Cafe Society trying to sound very important but only coming off as total idiots and suckers for just another one of Lerner's moneymaking schemes. There are many other cameos by John Malchovich Jon Cryer promoting 'Heads' and Del Toro and Kevin Pollack promoting the 'Usual Suspects' and so forth. And everyone is outrageously funny. This is definitely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and one that I highly recommend.Lerner definitely makes a fool out of Hollywood and I wonder if this isn't how the real industry operates 80 percent of the time.".

Perhaps the difference with Best in Show and Spinal Tap is that their makers had a firmer idea of what each scene was meant to cover before it was improvised and from the outset they had a stronger scriptstructure  this film seemed to lack a little in that regard as well as having some average acting. I thought Sy Lerner's character was a bit confusing too  at the start he seems to be a bit of a schmuck past his best days yet he still seems to carry a lot of clout and when he starts wheeling and dealing.".

What I can say is that Looking for Alibrandi is a wonderful movie. Australian's have finally made a truly excellent teen movie and we have beat the American's at their own game. This was a true breath of fresh air from the typical American high school movie filled with jocks nerds and cheerleaders. For once the heroine does not win the boy by changing her hairstyle or clothes. Pia Miranda is increadible as Josie Alibrandi and plays her role almost flawlessly she  steals the entire show. Josie has the right mix of strength and vulnerability and shows herself to be a fantastic role model for young girls. Miranda is supported by an equally talented cast who all perform excellently. Kick Gurry Jacob and Matthew Newton John are outstanding in their roles as are the entire AlibrandiAndretti family.   It also has to be said that the movie's handling of the issue of teen suicide was mature and eyeopening thankyou for not lecturing us.  Looking for Alibrandi is a story about life love and finding yourself and it is a credit to all those involved in it.".

What I can say is that Looking for Alibrandi is a wonderful movie. Australian's have finally made a truly excellent teen movie and we have beat the American's at their own game. This was a true breath of fresh air from the typical American high school movie filled with jocks nerds and cheerleaders. For once the heroine does not win the boy by changing her hairstyle or clothes. Pia Miranda is increadible as Josie Alibrandi and plays her role almost flawlessly she  steals the entire show. Josie has the right mix of strength and vulnerability and shows herself to be a fantastic role model for young girls. Miranda is supported by an equally talented cast who all perform excellently. Kick Gurry Jacob and Matthew Newton John are outstanding in their roles as are the entire AlibrandiAndretti family.   It also has to be said that the movie's handling of the issue of teen suicide was mature and eyeopening thankyou for not lecturing us.  Looking for Alibrandi is a story about life love and finding yourself and it is a credit to all those involved in it.";

	schema:reviewBody "A film treatment of a wellloved  despite being prescribed school reading children's story is always a delicate matter but here the makers have captured most of the spirit of the original possibly helped by the fact that Melina Marchetta the original author also wrote the screenplay. Josie is the daughter of a single mother of Sicilian background who attends an exclusive Catholic girls' school on a scholarship. Her father who she has never known turns up out of the blue as a successful lawyer and she and her mother both have to cope with this not entirely welcome event. Josie being 17 is also interested in boys two in particular. One is a nice but insecure kid from the establishment the other self confident and sexy from a single parent home on the other side of the tracks. Also in the story is Josie's Nona Grandma long widowed after a loveless marriage who lives nearby and keeps a close check on Josie's doings. Josie's occasional voiceovers and her lapses into fantasy give the film a slightly Adrian Moleish atmosphere but Josie's family and friends are not grotesque just human.Women who haven't had a father while growing up are supposed to find it more difficult to handle adult males and Josie has to learn to deal with a father and boyfriends at the same time. She also has to handle to snobbery at school not to mention the burden of the dreaded HSC exam in her final year. She is aiming high law at a prestigious university so that she can escape from little Italy and the annual tomato sauce bottling. She learns of course that you cannot escape from what made you you can only make it work for you. As in real life nothing quite works out according to plan but at the end she's a year older and wiser. It's Pia Miranda's film. Her Josie is assertive vulnerable and warm. A raft of good supporting actors back her up. Greta Scacchi often cast as a sex bomb is a blowsy but loving Mum. Anthony La Paglia is a bit of a stock character as the newfound father but has a couple of good scenes. Elena Cotta as Nono and Matthew Newton and Kick Gurry as the silvertail and rough trade boyfriends also do good work. Kerry Walker so often cast as a female monster puts in a restrained performance as a firm but sympathetic schoolteacher. I also liked Josie's two girlfriends Anna and Sara the 'wog chicks' in the old Merc and their noholds barred approach to enjoying life despite the HSC and demanding parents. Sydney city vistas are also used to good effect  the bridges the harbour Bondi Beach and there was even a school debate in the foyer of the Opera Theatre. It was nice to get away from the grunge Sydney seen in 'Two Hands' etc.I noticed that though I could hardly be described as being in the target audience for this film I was smiling most of the way through and emerged from the cinema with a reasonably cheerful feeling. It's not a particularly dramatic story but it's easy to warm to the characters. A film adaption that works it seems.".

And THEN my teacher pulls the TV into the classroom. HOwever long it was later the TV was switched off and I immediately started ranting about how bad it was. I wasn't the only one.First off the acting wasn't bad it was reasonable. The music was good too except for one instance which I will rant about later and the cinematography was decent too.BUT these things don't really matter if you don't have characters you care about or a decent plot!!!The book at least attempts to make you care about the characters it shows little scenes between some of them to show that they are actually human. The movie however just dumps you right in the middle of it and expects you to love all the characters instantly which is especially hard for the main character who I think is a horrible person. What about the character John Barton? He spends the entire time he's in the film smiling joking and running around flirting with Josie he's depressed for thirty seconds there's a 'tense' moment and then he kills himself. And are we supposed to care? Yes. Do we? NO!!! Because the movie didn't build up his character didn't make him realistic OR likable. But this actually brings me to the only compliment I can really give this movie. The funeral scene was well done. Well shot it was reasonably moving. And the song choice was brilliant. U2's 'With Or Without You' is an amazing song and was perfect for that scene. Sadly they had it sung by tone deaf cats with laryngitis. The singer whoever it was I don't care about him enough to look up his name was HORRENDOUS!!!! Horrible!!!! I just couldn't believe they would let someone ruin one of the best songs ever like that! I hope they didn't pay him because I would definitely be asking HIM to give ME money. And yes I know I've spent a paragraph complaining about a song in the movie but I had to get it out there.Another thing that bothered me was the ending. The book had a rather realistic ending not everything was sunshine and smiles. The movie however made it ENTIRELY sunshine and smiles everyone was happy everything was perfect. It kinda ruined the entire thing although it was ruined anyway just by making it a movie.All in all this movie was worth the one star I gave it purely because of the funeral scene. I couldn't stand any more of it. The only thing that could get me through it was the fact that I want to do well in English and this counted towards the grade.".

I saw it first when it came out in the cinemas and again on Showtime recently and I couldn't help but appreciate the way the characters were portrayed in the filmespecially Nonna.The music used in the film gave the film a more textured flavour especially during the scene with the...uh how can I say it without spoiling people...the uh procession. The song With or Without You by U2 just expressed everything that wasn't said.The movie was great and the tension between Josie and Nonna was done with a humorous sort of...uncomfortability. You just don't get that from words printed on paper.Read the book watch the movie. If you like slightly dramatic slightly romantic slightly comedic movies then this is the movie for you.

The opening volley of firstperson narration put me in a sour mood from which I never really emerged  partly because there was a second volley after the first and a third and a fourth  in short WHENEVER director Kate Woods could think of nothing better to do which was often Pia Miranda's voice over cut across the soundtrack like a closemiked violin.  It's a clumsy device.  Instead of bringing us closer to Josie it actually distances us.  When will directors and screenwriters get the idea?  Firstperson narration cannot go far wrong as a literary device and it can raise a book to heights the author could not otherwise have reached  Great Expectations is a good example of the magic spell a firstperson narrator can cast.  But it's usually a DISASTROUS device in a film.  It's disastrous here.  And not content with overusing the firstperson voice over Woods also overuses the SECOND clumsiest clich of film the pop song interlude.  Gargh.There are fleeting moments  a moment of silent communication between Josie and her father in the headmaster's office a wounding remark made by Josie's boyfriend  in which the film springs to life promising to cast off its firstperson cocoon and take flight.  At such moments I WANTED the film to become good.  I really did.  My hopes were always dashed.  Usually within seconds I might add.The trouble with Looking for Alibrandi is that one can smell the very pages of the book on which it was based.  I haven't read the book but I know the type.  It's one of those ghastly young adult novels.  I think I could have felt the prose even without hearing it glib scientifically crafted to meet the carefully researched needs of a particular age group careless of the concerns of those who lie outside that age group by so much as a month.  Books of this kind have not so much a story as a synthetic tomtom beat of Relevant Issues.  Their absence of aesthetic merit is so complete it must be deliberate.  And they are oh so insular.  In the entire history of mankind has there ever been or will there ever be a young adult novel that's also a good book?  Hah.  Oh there may be good books that are by and large READ by teenagers like The Lord of the Rings.  That book attracted a teenage audience by accident.  Looking for Alibrandi attracted a teenage audience by design.  The difference is crucial.As I say I haven't read the book.  I could be wrong about it and I apologise to Melina Marchetta if I am.

	schema:reviewBody "Looking for Alibrandi is an outstanding novel written by Melina Marchetta and published by Penguin Books in 1992. It is a story full of love and passion hatred of foe and tragic sadness. This novel is so excellent with its sensational ideas that in 2000 the novel was made into a hit movie starring Pia Miranda as Josephine Alibrandi.Seventeenyearold Josephine Alibrandi is in her last year at St. Martha's a wealthy Catholic secondary school for girls whose fathers treat them like princesses. Josephine feels that she doesn't fit in anywhere for the following reasons. She is an Italian whose grandmother moved out to Sydney when she got married. She is on a scholarship at St Martha's and is surrounded by rich snobbish girls who already have modeling careers. Josie has been called a bastard all her life due to the fact that she has never met her father. But for Josie this year everything changes for the better and for worse. This is the year that she will meet her father Michael Andretti for the first time in her life but not in the way she had imagined. The year she finds out about her Nonna Katia's affair with an Australian man called Marcus Sandford. He is Josie's mum's real dad because Nonna Katia's husband Francesco couldn't have children of his own. It also the year that Josie tries to make the man of her dreams fall in love with her. He goes to St Anthony's and is the son of a Member of Parliament his name is John Barton and in Josie's opinion he is the greatest debater who ever lived popular and good looking. Josie and John are very good friends and hang out a lot. Josie thinks that John is perfect and wants to be part of his world but when John suicides she realizes that not even he belonged in his world.It takes Josie a long time to get over John but soon starts going out with a boy called Jacob Coote. Jacob is school captain of Cook High and Josie and Jacob are always on and off together throughout the novel. Not only does Josie have all of this happening but she also has her HS the Higher School Certificate to worry about because she wants to study law at University. However once HS is over Josephine realizes that everything is going to be fine when she looks back on the year and knows who she is. Josephine is Nonna Katia's Granddaughter and Michael and Christina's daughter. She is not an Italian and not an Australian but an individual. It's not a bad effort even if the first half of Looking for Alibrandi demonstrates a good crackling pace and the second a rather flattened pace. But that is generalizing  it's quite a bumping ride as we follow the domestic life of Italian born Josephine who is undertaking her final level of high school. The guy she wants is just out of her reach then lately way out of her reach and the guy who wants her is keen for the feelings to be reciprocated. The mixture of two possible love interests gives Looking for Alibrandi a slight edge on other squishy little heartthrob dramas and it gets a nod of appreciation from me for not flat lining its characters into their social stereotypes. Some of the last few monologues lost my interest completely but that's a minor quibble in the scheme of things. A lot of the film is quite enjoyable. It just doesn't quite handle the complexities of its selfnarration in a method that can sustain itself as an engrossing picture. Instead it's a bumpy ride which in a way reflects the life of its teenage protagonist.".

The conversion of Novel to Screenplay by the same author fits with each other and does resonate with the Audiences and People who have gone through tough times and stressful situations. The backdrops of Sydney City Eastern Suburbs and 'Little Italy' give the feeling of displacement from where Josie actually is from and the difference in people from each area. The Eastern Suburbs is where her school is and the area is quite 'snobby' while in 'little Italy' everyone knows your business because everyone knows each other. Looking for Alibrandi is aimed as a general audience while focusing on late teens and viewers in their early twenties.

Still she's meant to be a teenage girl and I'm fairly sure that 'real' teenage girls can be pretty surly at times too!Overall Looking for Alibrandi is a coming of age film that features strong performances for the most part.

	schema:reviewBody "In a country that consists almost entirely of generation after generation of immigrants the concept of alienation and culturalethnic identity is one often discussed by 'Australians'  as is the notion of the loose class structure that coexists alongside this. Essentially we all want to remember where we have come from or are forced to acknowledge this by the generation preceding us and at the same time have an idea of where we are going to. Australian literature and film has covered the topic often  from the 60's adaptation of John O'Grady's novel They're a weird mob to the more recent Anna Kokkinos adaptation of Christos Tsiolkas' novel Loaded entitled Head On.Josie Alibrandi Miranda comes third in line of the 'cursed' Alibrandi women preceded by her mother Christina Scacchi and Nona Katia Cotta. It is her final year at school and as if this isn't difficult enough to get through she has to contend with the appearance of her long lost father Michael Andretti La Paglia a 'suitor' from the local high school Jacob Gurry ongoing racial and class based abuse from schoolmate Carly Bishop Carlow and a tragedy involving one of her close friends no spoilers!.Melina Marchetta's book was published back in 1992 and has received wide critical acclaim. To her credit she has adapted this quite well for film although at times there is a sense of trying to cram just a little too much into an hour and half of film. While all the issues and sub plots are important to the story as a whole the film often skims over some of these without fully fleshing them out a good example being the relationship between Josie and Jacob which shifts in and out of prominence and is a little under baked.Kate Woods first chance at directing a feature has been quite successful despite this and she manages to get some nice work from her actors. Miranda in the lead role is fresh and believable as troubled teen about to have a truckload of adulthood dumped on her. Scaachi and La Paglia are both credible in their respective roles funny but genuine reconciliation scene between father and daughter although possibly slightly miscast in terms of supposedly being around the age of 34  both seem much older. Cotta is superb as Nona Katia   she embodies the sicilian grandmother with near perfection. Gurry Walsman and Newton do well in terms of capturing the class differences although this does become a little pushed at times eg the speech at the Opera House scene and Newton although admittedly in a difficult role could have played his character down a little.Loads of nice touches  the dream sequences especially the Nona Patrol scene the 'home movie feel' in the 'la famiglia' gatherings and a definite sense of believing in the relationships that are developed between the characters. On top of this we have some good cinematography from Toby Oliver who manages to make Sydney seem a truly international city and shows it off well to the world.The thing that makes this movie above average in the end is that I think most will be able to relate to it in some way which to me means that the cast writer and director have mostly successfully done their jobs. A good film especially for anyone still in the throes of a large ethnic family or who has completed or is soon to go through that oh so crucial final year of secondary school. Bottom line philosophy  life wasn't meant to be easy but we all get through somehow.".

So what if it's not the same as the book though? How many movies are? There WAS one scene that they should've left in though.. the bit after finishing her takeaway job late at night.. read the book and find out what happened.. but overall a thoroughly enjoyable film. It's funny but not such a complete comedy that you spend the whole time groaning. It shows great places of Sydney which everyone living here can recognise and was very moving especially one part in the middle. Matthew Newton was excellent as John Barton. I want to see it again! I rate it 910. One more thing it reminded me of girly chick flicks like Steel magnolias fried green tomatoes The joy luck club How to make an american quilt.. etc etc.. it's essent".

That's how you would imagine but it's much more complex. It's a way out of problems and situations involving a familyA way to show what happens when a family is separated for a long time and meets again.I decided to watch this movie mainly because I saw Leticia Brdice's name somewhere. She's probably my favorite Argentinean actress and I love to see her in movies because she also works in television. I considered that reason enough but I was glad I found Leonardo Sbaraglia too. He's an excellent character actor that was born in Argentina but like many others tried luck in Spain and did many movies in both countries.En la ciudad sin lmites is a coproduction between Spain and ArgentinaThis coproductions fail almost all the times because the writers have to invent plot elements to set locations in any of those countries. But not this movieThis movie is set mostly in FranceIt includes characters living in Argentina in Spain but once the family is reunited it's France.Director Antonio Hernndez takes great advantage of this and his camera travels through Paris' streets from building to building from house to house from hotel to hotel even when the main situations occur in a hospital floorLess a hospital room. In this room Max Fernando Fernn Gmez is dying and this joins the whole family together. Spanish and French words are spoken all over by different and peculiar characters in an objective demonstration of how life goes round and round. It happens with my family today. I have family in France in Peru in Venezuela in ArgentinaSometimes it happens that events join us.I won't expand on the things that all the characters experience each of them has at least one magical moment because in the end even when there's a main event there's a treatment and for every person of the familyThat's what the movie makes us watch and hear. Vctor Leonardo Sbaraglia is Max's son and has to secretly help him find a person Rancel Alfredo Alcn that probably doesn't even exists because Max is probably going crazy or back to the past. Vctor is married to Eileen Leticia Brdice and meets in the reunion with Pilar Adriana Ozores his brother's Alberto lex Casanovas wife and his own old lover. Luis Roberto lvarez was married to Carmen Ana Fernndez and had to children but now they're separated and in Paris for different reasons when Luis' girlfriend Beatriz Mnica Estarreado gives a surprise visit...Marie Geraldine Chaplin Max's wife and the boys' mother is quiet and lonely also keeping something hidden.Writing is outstandingly correct with the director and his collaborator coming up with an interesting and emotional story mixing emotions with mysteryAnd that's probably the film's dilemma. It has a side where it wants to work as a suspense movie thriller and it could have gone wrong but it didn't because the elements are correctly combined and I managed myself to put all together in my mind as a powerful movie with all its things. In the movie's intent for the thriller genre and the mix I'm talking about it was difficult for the team to get the right structure. Luckily it all came out fine indeed with a score by Vctor Reyes that has its totally strange moments but at the same time powerful and moving moments with inspiring melodies.The acting by the entire ensemble is decent. Sbaraglia highlights as Vctor in a very natural performance with a lot of commitment. Adriana Ozores also highlights as Pilar and carries some powerful scenes in her shoulders. The pros Gmez and Alcn are lovable in their characters Chaplin gives strength to a simple Marie lvarez generates laughs with his Luis Fernndez goes crazy as Carmen Casanovas makes everything look easy through Alberto's eyes Estarreado looks as she needs to but does little as Beatriz and Brdice wellShe's still the Leticia I love to see.The film deals with some fresh strong issues in its dramatic moments but don't be fooled. This is not a movie about prejudices and opinions about people. It's about what each human being thinks is best for it deciding in order to get that and those decisions can cause lots of troubles.".

Then movie starts turning around as some truths come up and finally a very unexpected ending. Thought it is a very slow an moody picture it has a nice rhythm novelesque type. Acting is good specially by the leading roles The father Max and his son Victor. Music's really good and adequate for each scene.

It left me trembling with emotion and swallowing my tears and I can assure you that I'm not the type that cries in movies.";

	schema:reviewBody "Maximillian Martin Fernando Fernan Gomez is an old man dying of a brain tumour. His wife Marie Geraldine Chaplin and two eldest sons have brought him to Paris following his wish. They insist on a complex brain operation even though it's rather risky and will not cure the patient but only prolong his life a little. The family is depressed it seems that they have accepted the verdict and don't even try to encourage Max a little bit. They are also occupied with selling the family business and the two sons have their own family problems. The youngest son Victor Leonardo Sbaraglia an intelligent and charming guy comes from Argentina with his fiance Eilin Leticia Bredice. Victor has been estranged from his family but he comes out to be the only person whom his father trusts.Max is behaving very strangely. He doesn't want to take his medicines and seems to be paranoid and scared of the nurses in the hospital. He regularly attempts to escape secretly as if it's a prison and not a hospital and find a man called Rancel in order to warn him against some danger that awaits him if he gets on the train. Victor doesn't understand whether this Rancel actually exists or the tumour has affected his father's sanity. Then he asks his mother Marie if she knows who Rancel is but Marie says that she has never heard this name. Victor doesn't really believe her and her behaviour seems to him suspicious.Marie is a controlling mother a woman with a quiet voice and emaciated look. She guards a dark family secret that poisons her from the inside. Victor insists on her revealing to him who this Rancel is and she tells her son a story a long time ago Rancel and Max were together in a communist cell but Max betrayed his comrade. Rancel was arrested and soon died in jail and Max cannot forgive himself because of it. The truth is however that Rancel is alive he is about to meet Victor and to reveal to him the whole terrible secret Marie is hiding. Marie tries to explain herself to Victor and says that their family owes its very existence to her lie she is very probably right and Victor has to admit it.It is a very good and strong film about a feeling of guilt that destroys one's soul. It has some especially memorable scenes. One of them is on the train station near the end when Max is looking at the passersby trying to recognize Rancel and Victor sits by his father's side and cannot tell him that Rancel won't come. The other moment is when Rancel comes to Max's funeral and faces Marie a very strong scene that needs no words. The acting is very good especially the one of Leonardo Sbaraglia Geraldine Chaplin and Fernando Fernan Gomez his characters are always so memorable. I recommend this film to everyone.".

It can be described as a thriller because the viewer is kept in constant suspense about Max's mystery. Even the subplots like Carmen and Victor's romance adds to the characterization. Antonio Hernndez is a competent director and the way he sets the premise and tells the story is compelling. There are some nice scenic shots of Paris but that seems to add more to the mystery and complexities of the story. Victor Reyes's sometimes soft and sometimes erratic score works well. It reminded me of Philip Glass's work. The cinematography works adequately. The performances are solid with Fernando Fernn Gmez and Leonardo Sbaraglia owning the film. Of the supporting cast the beautiful Ana Fernndez shines while Geraldine Chaplin is convincing as the cold hearted Marie. 'En La Ciudad Sin Lmites' is a product of excellent storytelling fine acting very good direction and money well put by Spanish and Argentinian production teams.".

His father Max Fernando Fernn Gmez superb is dying  and losing his mind so the three sons and their mom Marie Chaplin have to decide what to do with the family business. It doesn't take too long though for Victor to find out that Max's socalled delusions are based on secrets buried in his past so the estranged son embarks on a desperate journey to uncover the whole story to allow his father to die in peace  even if it means he has to go against the rest of the family.SOUNDS good? Well not actually...En la ciudad sin lmites's score might be one of if not THE worst in the history of moviemaking. Seriously it exaggerates the moods creates or at least tries to create emotions which are totally different from the ones the images and script pass...a total disaster. But if you can get past that you won't be disappointed given that the subplots are also very very interesting and the ending though not entirely unpredictable fits like a glove the critic to the traditional high society.I saw Les invasions barbares The barbarian invasions a few weeks after En la ciudad sin lmites and the two have lots of similarities though the Canadian film exchanges the suspensemystery factor for a political tone. I know a lot of people will want to kill me but if it wasn't for the terrible music I'd say the Spanish movie's better 'cos quite frankly I don't know what's all the fuss about Invasions seriously. I'm 21 but a friend of mine who's the same age thought it was amazing and on the other hand my mom who's 47 didn't think much of it  that proves it has nothing to do with age. I don't know for me it just didn't bring anything new...but I shouldn't be talking about it here...Well anyway I say go see En la ciudad sin lmites if you have a chance. I gave it a 7 out of 10 because of the score but the movie itself is a solid 8 or even a 9. Two thumbs up.".

The romantic subplots work nicely to enhance the theme of betrayal. My only criticism was that I didn't think the gay theme worked and felt inserted into the plot. I personally found the relationship between the two men more profound as purely a political one. I think Marie's jealousy would have been more poignant if she had felt threatened by that side of the men's friendship and not the sexual. But overall an excellent film well worth seeing.

After watching this film again just yesterday I can say that this film is also a masterpiece and ranks on the same lines of the previous films.Silent Movie is deceptively simple in plot. A washed up movie director Brooks comes up with an idea to make a silent movie to help save the studio that once employed him. Once given the okay by studio chief Sid Caesar Brooks and his sidekicks Marty Feldman and Dom DeLuise set out to find five superstars to help make the movie a hit. And that's all there is to it  plot wise. What Brooks does is fill every single scene with great ideas. Shots that have absolutely nothing to do with the story are thrown in to get a laugh. Brooks hits the bullseye most of the time. I don't think I went more then a minute without laughing throughout.Another master stroke is John Morris' rousing score that fills the movie from beginning to end. Without it the movie would have failed. And yes it truly is a silent movie save for one spoken word which most people probably are aware of anyway. It's another classic Mel Brooks moment.Silent Movie followed Young Frankenstein which followed Blazing Saddles. It's safe to say Brooks was at his peak during this period. His quality of films began to dip after Silent Movie starting with the amusing but overblown High Anxiety. But we still have this time period to savor when Brooks may have been the best if not then equal to Woody Allen comedy director of his time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mel Brooks plays a hasbeen director named Mel Funn in this spoof of Hollywood and silent movies. The film is set in some alternate universe era that is an amalgamation of 1930s through 1970s Hollywood. In the film's world it's the age of the talkies which have apparently been around for some time. Funn's latest script what he's banking on as his comeback is retrohe's written a silent movie. Naturally he's having problems selling his script. Shortly after the film begins Funn who is making the rounds with his two questionable companions Marty Eggs Marty Feldman and Dom Bell Dom DeLuise shops his script to one last big studio head played by Sid Caesar. Caesar's studio is about to go under if they can't produce a blockbuster. He initially tries to throw Funn out but when Funn promises he can get big stars for his film Caesar gives him a chance. If he can get the stars he's got a deal. Silent Movie is primarily the story of Funn Eggs and Bell trying to get stars to do their film.Of course the irony of Silent Movie is that it's a silent movie about how silent movies would be ridiculous to produce in a later age in Hollywood. The Mel Brooks film itself is ridiculous film in many ways not the least of which is that it is silent. Brooks also embraces another fading conventionhumor based on slapstick and vaudeville.To a large extent Silent Movie exists to enable a series of gags mostly centered on various extended cameos. Often the gags are like a classic comedy compilationwe get Sid Caesar doing his facial tick schtick Charlie Callas doing some blind man slapstick Henny Youngman with a fly in his soup and so on. Marty Feldman's Eggs might cause us to ask where the ham isthese classic routines are it.There are also longer scenes with potential stars of the film. These include Burt Reynolds James Caan Bernadette Peters Liza Minelli Paul Newman Anne Bancroft and Marcel Marceau. Sometimes they spoof themselves sometimes they play roles in new gags and sometimes they come pretty close to their actual public personae.Maybe Twentieth Century Fox told Brooks in reality that if he wanted to do a silent film spoof they'd only bankroll it if he had a lot of stars attached. So he got them working them into the film without really working them into the fabric of the film they're present as cameos not as stars. But there's also a conceit in Silent Movie as a fiction that we're not watching the actual film but a film about getting ready to make a film maybe echoing what happened in real life in preparing to make the film. If you want complex selfreferential layers focused on blurring the distinctions between art and reality Silent Movie definitely provides that. In many respects the layering is similar to the more recent Incident at Loch Ness 2004.Maybe such depth is surprising given that the surface aim of Silent Movie is to provide absurdities so you can laugh. The contrast to those easier to decipher surface qualities underscores interesting facts both about the public perception of Mel Brooks and the history of his career. Brooks has often been perceived as aiming for a kind of modernization of the Three Stooges. While his films have qualities that allow for that comparison it is far from telling the whole story.Brooks' films as director at least through 1981's History of the World Part I all have a strong postmodernism beneath the veneer. He's not just making us laugh through slapstick and clever punfilled dialogue he's also saying a lot of very intelligent things about the medium of film as well as the relationship between films and reality and between films and the audience. A lot of his humor rests on toying with the typical filmic or narrative conventions. For example he routinely breaks through the fourth wall and he routinely breaks the implicit genre contracts he makes. It's just as intellectual as anything Monty Python didat least until 1987's Spaceballs which can be seen as the turning point from Brooks' earlier works of genius to a much more straightforward way of storytelling. It's not that Spaceballs and what followed weren't good but they do not have the same sense of postmodernist play to them as is present in Silent Movie.In addition to all of the fictionreality layering the film breaks the genre contracts of silent films in that once in awhile a character says something and we hear their voice on the soundtrack. The music is also frequently synced to the action this wasn't possible with actual silent filmsthe technical solution that allowed synced music also allowed synced dialogue and occasionally there is foley sound effects that are supposed to be the sound of character actions like walking synced on the audio track as well. It underscores that this is a faux silent movie despite the many other apparent cues of authenticity. This is a relatively minor example of postmodernism in the film perhaps but nevertheless illustrative of Brooks' goals and interesting to note while watching.As interesting as all of that is Silent Movie isn't a complete success. Sometimes it's just a bit too hokey or uneventful for its own good. But it's still an important entry in Brooks' early oeuvre which is his most significant period in my view.".

	schema:headline " Is Slapstick Dead? NON!'";
	schema:reviewBody "Slapstick is dead! shouts Sid Caesar the anxious producer before sliding across the floor and hit the wall. You would think that indeed slapstick is dead that this kind of dated humor wouldn't work with today's audience but that it worked during the postWatergate pessimistic 70's is the best guarantee of timelessness... and Mel Brooks' Silent Movie is not only one of the most underrated comedies but his best film in my opinion.It's interesting to note that the movie came out in 1976 the infamous year where the success of the cheerful Rocky over the more realistic Taxi Driver the cynical Network or the political thriller All the President's Men proved that the audience needed something new but since the 70's revolutionized cinema the newness could only be inspired from the past the Golden Age. Rocky as the triumph of the underdog over the adversity was a celebration of the faith in human spirit  la Frank Capra and in the same vein Silent Movie is a return to the roots of comedy the heritage of Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton and silent era's comedic treasures. Even the fans of Mel Brooks will notice the absence of explicitly raunchy humor and delightful vulgarity used to be his trademark. Silent Movie never exceeds a certain level of naughtiness and the general tone carries the sweetness of a deliberate innocence drawing a big smile in our face.Silent Movie is indeed a charming Family film that I had the pleasure to discover at the age of eight I couldn't finish it but the least I saw was enough to keep intact in my memories. I remembered I laughed a lot and even when i didn't get the jokes I was smiling. I remembered the hysterical part in a shower the funny sound effects and more than anything that skinny little guy with a race driver outfit who shared a vague resemblance with Jackie Wright the little bald guy from The Benny Hill Show and it was not until I finally watched the film entirely that I put the name 'Marty Feldman' in his face. What a performance he carries 50 of the fun if only for him the movie is a mustsee and never has the word 'see' be so relevant. Silent Movie is a visual delight in every meaning of the word. I even wonder why it hasn't been nominated for Best ArtDirection or Best Costume Design the film's use of color creates a wonderful atmosphere making us wish that Keaton or Chaplin could have benefited from the use of Technicolor at least once.I mentioned the slapstick pioneers but the movie still has a modern feel beyond the homage to a classic genre. It's a masterpiece of adaptation in the way it keeps its relevance for a modern audience in three distinct ways. First the gags to name a few there's one scene implying that a group of gentlemen are having a sensitive reaction toward a sexy picture I won't spoil it to you but the way it's suggested is extremely well done and shows how tactfully Mel Brooks handles a cruder form of humor to paraphrase one of the character Sex would have indeed killed Funn. The second aspect is the way Brooks stills uses the cardboards to feature verbal jokes cheating with the virtuosity of an iconoclast after all being silent doesn't prevent a movie from having a good script. And ultimately there's the selfreferential element  Mel Brooks plays the role of Mel Funn a director who wants to make a silent movie and with his two acolytes Dom Bell and Marty Eggs played by the namesakes De Luise and Feldman they will propose to reallife stars to participate to the film. This is the genius plot device that provided the film's most memorable moments and some extra publicity.Burt Reynolds James Caan Liza Minelli Anne Bancroft Marcel Marceau Paul Newman ... all these guest stars parody themselves in irresistible cameos that give the film an episodic feel without denaturing the narrative.

	onyx:emotionText "Slapstick is dead! shouts Sid Caesar the anxious producer before sliding across the floor and hit the wall. You would think that indeed slapstick is dead that this kind of dated humor wouldn't work with today's audience but that it worked during the postWatergate pessimistic 70's is the best guarantee of timelessness... and Mel Brooks' Silent Movie is not only one of the most underrated comedies but his best film in my opinion.It's interesting to note that the movie came out in 1976 the infamous year where the success of the cheerful Rocky over the more realistic Taxi Driver the cynical Network or the political thriller All the President's Men proved that the audience needed something new but since the 70's revolutionized cinema the newness could only be inspired from the past the Golden Age. Rocky as the triumph of the underdog over the adversity was a celebration of the faith in human spirit  la Frank Capra and in the same vein Silent Movie is a return to the roots of comedy the heritage of Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton and silent era's comedic treasures. Even the fans of Mel Brooks will notice the absence of explicitly raunchy humor and delightful vulgarity used to be his trademark. Silent Movie never exceeds a certain level of naughtiness and the general tone carries the sweetness of a deliberate innocence drawing a big smile in our face.Silent Movie is indeed a charming Family film that I had the pleasure to discover at the age of eight I couldn't finish it but the least I saw was enough to keep intact in my memories. I remembered I laughed a lot and even when i didn't get the jokes I was smiling. I remembered the hysterical part in a shower the funny sound effects and more than anything that skinny little guy with a race driver outfit who shared a vague resemblance with Jackie Wright the little bald guy from The Benny Hill Show and it was not until I finally watched the film entirely that I put the name 'Marty Feldman' in his face. What a performance he carries 50 of the fun if only for him the movie is a mustsee and never has the word 'see' be so relevant. Silent Movie is a visual delight in every meaning of the word. I even wonder why it hasn't been nominated for Best ArtDirection or Best Costume Design the film's use of color creates a wonderful atmosphere making us wish that Keaton or Chaplin could have benefited from the use of Technicolor at least once.I mentioned the slapstick pioneers but the movie still has a modern feel beyond the homage to a classic genre. It's a masterpiece of adaptation in the way it keeps its relevance for a modern audience in three distinct ways. First the gags to name a few there's one scene implying that a group of gentlemen are having a sensitive reaction toward a sexy picture I won't spoil it to you but the way it's suggested is extremely well done and shows how tactfully Mel Brooks handles a cruder form of humor to paraphrase one of the character Sex would have indeed killed Funn. The second aspect is the way Brooks stills uses the cardboards to feature verbal jokes cheating with the virtuosity of an iconoclast after all being silent doesn't prevent a movie from having a good script. And ultimately there's the selfreferential element  Mel Brooks plays the role of Mel Funn a director who wants to make a silent movie and with his two acolytes Dom Bell and Marty Eggs played by the namesakes De Luise and Feldman they will propose to reallife stars to participate to the film. This is the genius plot device that provided the film's most memorable moments and some extra publicity.Burt Reynolds James Caan Liza Minelli Anne Bancroft Marcel Marceau Paul Newman ... all these guest stars parody themselves in irresistible cameos that give the film an episodic feel without denaturing the narrative. Silent Movie is less a series of funny sketches than a selfreflexive depiction of the film.

The only way Funn gets his studio boss Sid Ceasar to agree to the project is if the picture is loaded with stars! So the primary plot of the movie is Funn and his friends chasing stars around town trying to get them to sign.

The man who should actually make a silent comedy is Rowan Atkinson  best physical comic since the masters.So i guess my main regret is that this will not probably win any fans for silent movies let alone encourage people to check them out.

Enter Mel Funn guess who a hasbeen director whose career was stopped cold by drunkenness who pledges to salvage the studio by persuading Hollywood's biggest stars to make a silent movie.

He shakes hands with the Chief and the Chief's fingers are crossed rather than Mel's. The Chief then passes this crossed state to his secretary's fingers the same way. Another running gag is obvious discrepancy between the title cards and what the characters are really saying. The spoken lines are inaudible as it is indeed a silent movie but they can be clearly lipread. At one point Brooks asserts misgivings about DeLuise's idea of a silent movie by shouting That's crazy! as well as an agitated mouthful but the screen says Maybe you're right. In another scene Marty hits on a nurse but gets slapped. When he gets back in the car Mel obviously mouths a curse word although the screen says You bad boy! And then there's the scene where Feldman and DeLuise haphazardly unplug and plug in his heart monitor various times winding up changing the screen to a ping pong game and playing while the Chief flatlines and recovers over and over. Brooks stands outside the majority of Jewish comics and filmmakers in his lack of selfderision and in the success of his main characters but still humor is his own defense mechanism against the world and he goes for broke.".

	schema:headline " Minor Mel Worth A Chuckle";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't expect too much from this Mel Brooks sendup of silent comedy and well you'll probably still be disappointed. Just not as much.Mel Funn Brooks is an outofwork movie director who has an idea for how to get back in the business Make the first silent movie in over 40 years. To get the backing of Big Picture Studios Mel and partners Marty Eggs Marty Feldman and Dom Bell Dom DeLuise set about signing Hollywood stars to the project. Can Mel stay off the sauce long enough to see it through?Silent Movie was Brooks' first film after owning 1974 with Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein as a result he could do pretty much whatever he wanted. You want to do a silent movie Mel? Sure why not? Well maybe because Brooks' type of comedy was more verbal than visual. Silent Movie too often plays like a movie whose maker thinks it's funnier than it really is.Take the cameo appearances of several bigname stars another sign of Brooks' clout. Burt Reynolds has fun playing up his own ego and so we do too while mime Marcel Marceau gets the funniest line in the picture also the only line. But the other stars brought in  Paul Newman James Caan Liza Minnelli and Anne Bancroft  showcase their amiability more than their comedy potential.The physical comedy gets really labored and obvious at times not what you got watching the silent clowns or even Blazing Saddles. When Mel and his two buddies try to recruit Liza for example they dress as knights in bulky suits of armor. Instead of engaging Minnelli in conversation while trying to look natural in their odd attire the three just bumble around in a commissary knocking down tables and chairs until Liza pulls a face recognizes Mel and asks to be in his movie.

I love her big entrance on stage inside a giant banana from which she is peeled to deliver her silent catchphrase BaBaLoo! Both Marty and Dom make for enjoyable company throughout although they don't do much more than ogle ladies Marty or eat Dom. In the technical department John Morris's score and Paul Lohmann's cinematography are nondistractingly enjoyable.The big negative in this film as with High Anxiety is Brooks. There is no funnier white person in living history but he doesn't work as an actor even in a farce. He's always smiling too much pressing too hard to show us what a nice guy he is. Of course it doesn't help that he's his own director here. Brooks did better work as the lead in the 1983 remake of To Be Or Not To Be which he didn't direct.Silent Movie is funny enough in spots and has enough of that old Brooks magic to make it pleasant if forgettable viewing. You can't help wanting more but if you are like me you're almost satisfied to get what you do.".

	onyx:emotionText "Don't expect too much from this Mel Brooks sendup of silent comedy and well you'll probably still be disappointed. Just not as much.Mel Funn Brooks is an outofwork movie director who has an idea for how to get back in the business Make the first silent movie in over 40 years. To get the backing of Big Picture Studios Mel and partners Marty Eggs Marty Feldman and Dom Bell Dom DeLuise set about signing Hollywood stars to the project. Can Mel stay off the sauce long enough to see it through?Silent Movie was Brooks' first film after owning 1974 with Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein as a result he could do pretty much whatever he wanted. You want to do a silent movie Mel? Sure why not? Well maybe because Brooks' type of comedy was more verbal than visual. Silent Movie too often plays like a movie whose maker thinks it's funnier than it really is.Take the cameo appearances of several bigname stars another sign of Brooks' clout. Burt Reynolds has fun playing up his own ego and so we do too while mime Marcel Marceau gets the funniest line in the picture also the only line. But the other stars brought in  Paul Newman James Caan Liza Minnelli and Anne Bancroft  showcase their amiability more than their comedy potential.The physical comedy gets really labored and obvious at times not what you got watching the silent clowns or even Blazing Saddles. When Mel and his two buddies try to recruit Liza for example they dress as knights in bulky suits of armor. Instead of engaging Minnelli in conversation while trying to look natural in their odd attire the three just bumble around in a commissary knocking down tables and chairs until Liza pulls a face recognizes Mel and asks to be in his movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm half way through this and it's awful. What was Brooks thinking? The silent comics had grown up making slapstick on stage and on film. Laurel and Hardy were both in their thirties with dozens of two reelers each before they were teamed up. Buster Keaton had been doing slapstick since the age of 3. I can say this because I'm currently in the middle of watching a whole load of silents from LH Keaton Charlie Chase Harold Lloyd and so on. Those two reelers work because they only have 20 minutes to tell a full story. Scenes are either full on slapstick or 10 seconds long to move the story on. Moreover slapstick is the comedy of pain and embarrassment and to make it work you have to sell that  through overacting if need be.Brooks completely fails to understand this. About 15 minutes into the film Dom Deluise has a door slammed on his foot. Although the joke is blatantly set up at first I didn't even realise that the slam had occurred. Deluise barely reacts. All I can think about is how Oliver Hardy would have sold the same gag  as I've literally just watched him do it several times over. Compare the two. No contest.Mel Brooks has written a completely normal film and then simply taken all the sound out and replaced it with captions. The only reason to watch this is for the cameos. Paul Newman James Caan Burt Reynolds Liza Minelli Marcel Marceau and Anne Bancroft gamely send themselves up. Paul Newman in his racing wheelchair is clearly enjoying himself and gives the best scene of the movie. As for the rest Marty Feldman acts everyone else off the screen  when he's actually given something to do that is  thanks to his British physical comedy training.".

	schema:reviewBody "Following he and Gene Wilder's cinematic love letter to James Whale's Frankenstein films Mel Brooks wrote and directed a film hearkening back to an even earlier era with SILENT MOVIE. The film for those who haven't seen it is exactly what it claims to be a silent comedy. Well almost silent. There's a single spoken line in the entire movie and it's spoken by the one person whose delivery should guarantee a chuckle. The premise of SILENT MOVIE is as I understand it basically a comedic depiction of the trials and tribulations Brooks endured in trying to get the movie made in the first place. At the center of the film is our trio of filmmakers Mel Funn Brooks Dom Bell Dom DeLuise and Marty Eggs Marty Feldman. Mel Funn is a former Hollywood director whose career tanked when he fell into alcoholism. He has dreams of reviving his career with the first silent film in decades and his friends Dom and Marty are coming along to help him see it through. The studio is obviously more than a little hesitant at first but they've got the evil east coast conglomerate Engulf  Devour breathing down their necks in hopes of acquiring the company. When Mel promises to fill his picture with the biggest stars the studio chief Sid Caesar gives him a shot. SILENT MOVIE is then a race against time for Mel to collect some of the biggest names the mid70s has to offer and save the studio.SILENT MOVIE is slapstick fun in the vein of the classics like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. I'm a fan of Chaplin and need to make time to watch some Keaton and dig the goofball comedies of early cinema and Brooks pulls from his love for the era to fill this movie to the brim with classic gags. There's loads of fun to be had here but it starts to drag after a while. Those early Chaplin films run about fifteen to twenty minutes apiece and while some of them do run longer they work best in those smaller easily digested doses. I think the longest Chaplin film I've seen was about 70 minutes and even then it lost some of its fun by the end. SILENT MOVIE is just under ninety minutes and regardless of how much fun the bits are it runs a little long for me. I'm not adverse to silent film. I loved THE ARTIST which brought the genre back again in 2011 to great success. But that had better storytelling and didn't have to rely on pratfalls and funny faces to fill out a featurelength runtime. I was thoroughly enjoying SILENT MOVIE up until around the halfway mark when my attention began to wander. A large section of the movie follows Funn as he tracks down Hollywood stars to convince him to join his movie and it doesn't switch things up until the last twenty five minutes or so when we head into the final act.Just as the characters in the film need to bolster interest in their silent film with the inclusion of big stars so does SILENT MOVIE itself. Half of the movie is a string of cameos from the likes of Burt Reynolds Liza Minnelli James Caan etc. If nothing else it's fun to watch these big name stars get in on the cornier slapstick the movie brings to the table. I suppose my favorite cameo bit would be Caan's. It felt the most like a classic silent film comedy scenario with Caan inviting Funn and his buddies into his trailer for lunch to discuss their movie. Of course the trailer has poor suspension so the four of them are teetering around inside as the trailer lurches from one side to the other with the slightest gesture. It was definitely one of the funnier scenes as opposed to their courting of Liza Minnelli which involved arduous minutes of Funn and the gang toppling over each other in suits of medieval armor in the studio commissary. The bits are hit and miss but I can at least say that most of them register on the positive end of the spectrum. At minimum they'll elicit a smile. I can't be too harsh overall because I see what Brooks was aiming for and I appreciate the sentiment. Those early silent shorts get little to no attention anymore and Mel Brooks has done his part in shining the spotlight on them once again for newer generations.SILENT MOVIE probably isn't going to have you laughing your head off but if nothing else it's ninety minutes of harmless fun. There's nothing overtly racy in the film so it's a nice piece anyone of any age can enjoy. It's comedy fluff that I can't imagine will find itself atop many top comedy lists or even top Brooks comedy lists but it's good for some chuckles and people who know more about that early era of Chaplin and Keaton than I will probably find even more to appreciate.".

I guess the concept was lacking any reason to exist. I can give it a six because of the characters' names a lot of one liners and a Brooksian bit of panache. It has an allstar cast with wonderful cameos but it has little if any center to it. If we want to see silent films we should watch Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd. But there are some rather nice moments and it comes across in a polished way. And of course there's the bit with Marcel Marceau. Not enough however to save the film.".

In those days people were in love with big colorful modern films so it must have come as a pretty big shock to discover that suddenly somebody had made an oldfashioned silent film. There are so many things about this film that will make you just crack your teeth laughing but most of the funniest of them are thanks to the comic genius of the actor Marty Feldman. Also in this film are some fantastic cameos by all sorts of stars. This is certainly one of Mel Brooks' best films and should be put next to his many other great films like The Producers and Spaceballs. Enjoy! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Silent Movie is often called Mel Brooks' worst film  it's certainly not on par with his masterpieces Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein but keep in mind that it's also his most ambitious work the concept of the movie  the story of a film director trying to make a silent movie in the 1970's told itself as a silent movie  is certainly his boldest and it wasn't easy to make it work but it's as good as it should and could have been  as only Brooks could have done it. Even though the real Silent Movie was not a surprise hit like its fictional counterpart  in fact it bombed in the box office not quite unexpectedly  it's an essential part of the Mel Brooks classic catalog and deserves much from attention than it got it's also unbelievably funny.Mel Brooks Marty Feldman and Dom Deluis are Silent Movie's stooges and they play their parts with every bit of love and respect for the classic silent comedies of the 20's and 30's. Like in Young Frankenstein Mel's intention was first and foremost to revive the genre but with self parody and self awareness therefore Silent Movie is mainly slapstick and physical humor and these three comedians make it work especially Feldman who in himself proves to be a natural silent film comic born several decades too late. The humor is often as crude and simplistic as those films really were but it works in this modern context much better than could be expected. The excellent cast also includes Sid Caesar and Bernadette Peters in excellent and hilarious performances and a series of the biggest stars of the time playing themselves as the actors Mel is scouting for for his movie  Burt Reynolds James Caan Liza Minnelli Anne Bancroft and Paul Newman each of whom grants an unforgettable scene filled with slapstick and goodnatured self parody the film's most memorable moment and only spoken word is granted by pantomime legend Marcel Marceau.My only complaint for Mr. Brooks is this  as long as he had the balls to make a film as bold as this one that was almost certainly doomed to be a financial and critical failure he might as well have gone all the way and made it in black and white  that was after all one of Young Frankenstein's most striking features. Other than this Silent Movie is a very funny movie and an essential to fans of Mel Brooks' early material. It's not his best and it's not perfect but it's one of a kind.".

Additionally Mel Brooks movies were coming out frequently and each were very hot commodities.

	schema:reviewBody "Of course only Mel Brooks could have the idea to make a silent movie in today's Hollywood. And silent it isthis isn't one of those films like City LightsModern TimesBean or Playtime that uses background noises and dialogue. No aside from the brilliant John Morris score the film is completely silent. Being that this is a Mel Brooks comedy this COULD be considered a downside. It is filled with sight gags from a pregnant woman upsetting the balance of the back of the car the reaction of the executives to Vilma Kaplan the sultry spy the video ponggame on the life support machine and of course the fly in the soup. Unfortunately there are stretches where the action moves very slowly without sufficient explanation. Also the music score occasionally has very unpleasant loud drum crashes to indicate when there is action and these can be an unpleasant contrast to the surprisingly quietly recorded music score. If you want to hear the music score you'd best buy the soundtrack where it is clear of the drumcymbal crashes. The soundtrack mixes bits and pieces of The Emperor's WaltzStrauss and JalousieBloomGade as well as BabaluLecuonaRussell. The cast includes six main guest stars as well as character actors like Chuck McCann Jack Riley Howard Hesseman and Fritz Feld. On top of this Harry Ritz of the Ritz Brothers Henny Youngman and even Barry Levinson DINERHOMICIDELIFE ON THE STREETS as a movie executive. All in all it makes for genial entertainment and if nothing else should be seen to gain an appreciation of silent comedy. As a movie it gets a 810. For a Mel Brooks film it gets 710 on the Laff scale.".
