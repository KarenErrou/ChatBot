Ken plans to study abroad with his girlfriend Amy Bong Qiu Ting but his plans are derailed by NS. After being chided by Amy for his childishness Ken takes it out on a nearby rubbish bin to be apprehended by two policemen in the vicinity. A disappointed and embarrassed Amy looked very sad and angry.Back home after being driven back by his father Richard Low Ken confides to his parents about his fears of National Service. His overprotective mother Irene Ang decides to help him think of ways to defer but to no avail. Eventually they are all forced to ...";

	schema:reviewBody "Many years ago prescandal director Jack Neo scored one of his hugest hits with I Not Stupid a poignant intelligent movie about the trials and tribulations mostly trials of growing up under Singapore's rigorous education system. That film remains my favourite local movie because it so wonderfully encapsulates the Singaporean experience it's true to life featuring characters and situations we will all recognise and it boasts an awful lot of heart and home truths. I was hoping that Neo would make a longawaited return to form with Ah Boys To Men following a string of increasingly commercialistic films that have drawn flack for their shameless product placement.As I Not Stupid did with our schools and students Ah Boys has in its crosshairs the National Service NS scheme that's been in place in our little island republic for fortyfive years now. Joshua Tan plays Ken Chow the spoiled scion of a wealthy family  and self absorbed vaguely ungrateful son to a father who just wants him to make the most of his time in NS Liu Qianyi and a desperately over protective indulgent mother who tries all ways and means to get her son off the proverbial hook Irene Ang. When he's enlisted against his will he meets his bunkmates wellconnected buddy 'Lobang' Wang Weiliang ang mor pai aspiring officertobe Aloysius Maxi Lim. But Ken just wants to be with his girlfriend who's due to go overseas to study and he starts plotting ways and means to get off his enforced sequestration on the training island of Pulau Tekong.How does Neo's Ah Boys measure up to Michael Chiang's oftrevived play Army Daze? Ah Boys updates the circumstances in which the boys find themselves  so there's some talk of camera phones and the occasional use of Skype for notsoromantic tteattes. But strip that all away and the two stories are broadly similar. Both feature a tongueincheek look at the enlisting process and then the training period  following a group of very different kids who start out as strangers but find that friendships can be bred in the literal trenches. Neither film is a fierce political statement decrying mandatory conscription. There is some mocking of the institution but for the most part NS is accepted as a fact of life and celebrated as something that brings a mismatched group of boys together and forces them to become men.In that sense Neo's movie doesn't mean to be inoffensive though it may annoy some people with its largely benign nostalgic depiction of a military stint that they personally didn't enjoy or value. There is a whiff of chestthumping to this film that could prove annoying after a while Ken's father is a lonely advocate for NS in the film begging to be heard above the jokes that constitute the memories and narratives of those who look less charitably on the army  but he's presented as the voice of reason the one who should be respected. It certainly doesn't help matters or impressions that the director received the Ministry of Defence's full cooperation in terms of loans of machinery equipment weaponry and access to Tekong although he firmly maintains that Mindef did not invest in the project.That's not to say Neo's depiction of NS and a possible wartime scenario don't impress on occasion. They do  any young man will recognise the days when they were hazed mercilessly by their platoon sergeants and forced to drop twenty for insolence or disobedience. My favourite parts of the film are probably the nostalgiatinged flashback segments that are scattered throughout Ken's uncle reminisces about his time in the army when hazing was twenty times worse and those moments serve as funny surprisingly sweet counterpoints to our more regulated modern times.As for the vaunted wartime scenario  for which Neo famously scored special permission to shut off parts of the busy business district  it's fun enough to watch and the CGI doesn't look too bad though it looks rather too shiny and perfect to be quite real. It serves as a framing device for the rest of the film it's intended to drive home the real stakes our army boys are playing for that there might well be blood and death and sacrifice in their futures however impossible that appears in the safety of their bunks and the lack of a military threat against Singapore. The concept works well enough  but the execution leaves a little to be desired when it becomes clear that the blood bombs and destruction were less serious simulation and more silly gameplay.As for what can be expected from the rest of the film Neo goes into it with his standard bag of filmmaking tricks. His humour is sly and subversive but only a little bit so his characters manage that difficult trick of being both caricatures and real people and he crafts sneaky emotional hooks into his stories which would cynically be called emotionally manipulative. Ken Lobang Aloysius and even Ken's parents come close to being stereotypes we've seen before but their concerns still come through in a way that's occasionally affecting.For anyone who's watched a Jack Neo movie or two there are two possible ways to respond to Ah Boys it could be a comfortingly familiar experience as it feels just exactly like the kind of movie he's made many times before. It even hits some of the same farreaching emotional notes as I Not Stupid reminding every boy of his own experience with NS whether it lies behind or ahead of him while every girl will have known someone who's enlisted. The other way lies frustration annoyance that Neo is pulling the same old cards out of his sleeve for a movie that's bloated with padding so that he can slice off another two hours to make the sequel which follows in February next year.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is second of Pasolini's so called 'Trilogy of Love' Il Decameron I Racconti di Canterbury Il fiore di mille e una notte 19701974. All these movies are quite specific there are said not to be that provocative or intriguing. They are greatly influenced by the fact that while directing them Pasolini was contented because of his intimate relationship with the 'innocent barbarian' actor Ninetto Davoli. It is also said that in 'Trilogy of Love' Pasolini became resigned to the present time world by escaping to the past. However I don't think it's true. In these movies Pasolini introduces to the audience an incorrupt world where people don't care about 'material aspects of life' they try to live at the full stretch they seek love and of course sex and they do not respect 'the repressive limits imposed by religious and bourgeois morality' Gino Moliterno. This is probably why Pasolini later declared that these three films were most ideological of his career in his famous and long interview with Massimo Fini. I suppose Pasolini tried to confront such 'primitive' world with the world he had lived in and which he had hated so much this confrontation is present all the time especially by the contrast between the love and the death by the contrast between the first tales in which the human naked body dominates and the last two tales in which pursuit of money causes death and perdition. Because of such end it is also suggested that I Racconti di Canterbury are very close to Pasolini's disillusioned last movie Sal.It is common to hear that Chaucer must have rolled over in his grave after this movie was released. But if you try to understand The Canterbury Tales in the context of Chaucer's attitude towards love in his other literary works you will probably find that Chaucer would resemble to Pasolini alias Mr Chaucer ends the film with writing 'Here end the Canterbury Tales told for the mere pleasure of their telling Amen'.".

Pasolini's perverted humor as well as some of his usual actors are here. There's full nudity both male and female. Maybe here the erotic element is more intense so its less humorous I am not sure. I suppose it will satisfy those who like Pasolini's humour like say IL DECAMERON. The copy I saw had awful dubbing  Italian language maybe it's bad sychronisation or something else... As far as I am concerned it is worth it alone for this special absurd perverted surrealistic last scene taking place in hell. It rulez! Some others scenes are awesome too! And of course there'e Pasolini evident dislike of churchreligious dogmas.If you're not easily offended and like old films specially European ones give it a try IL DECAMERON as well.".

The point iswe believe every single thing we see on the screen. Of course it's because Pasolini uses natural lightning unprofessional actors and partly because when there is fucking on the screen it's not simulation it's real fking what other film can be classified as porn and also have Oscarwinning costume designer in its credits?. But it's not the reason. I always admired Pasolini because he was one of those people who make others respect them who have remained hip even twenty years after they are dead. And being this incredibly fascinating person he could put part of the magic that made him the person he was into his movies.".

Pasolini brings life to Chaucer in a way my poor teachers at school could never have dared. In the film Pasolini casts himself as Chaucer daydreaming laughing at his own tales being berated by his wife. And therein lies the clue to this film. It's not just an interpretation of the Canterbury Tales it's a portrayal of its author. For all claims of smut see above I can honestly say that your imagination must be pretty dull not to laugh at certain earthy dreamlike scenes. Absolutely non of the scenes in this movie can be branded as badtaste. They're absolutely accurate. Pasolini showed deep understanding of the English psyche throughout the examples are too numerous to mention. If you're looking for an explanation of The Canterbury Tales you won't find it in this film. But if you're looking for how to go about interpreting it for yourself you'll find no better. This movie is one that I will keep and you can bet my kids are going to see it when they get a little older too.".

And Nicholas is branded on the bum And God bring all of us to Kingdom Come in Coghill's cheerful popular translation becomes something more like the execution of Edward II. Not just on but in. And the execution of a sodomite too poor to bribe his way off the griddle seems drawn out just to make a bad joke about the seller of griddle cakes frittelli plying his trade in the crowd.He is one of the more than fair share of handsome young men in the film and there's more than a fair share of closeups of their middle regions front and back in tightfitting breeches not that I'm complaining.One feature that is almost entirely absent is any sense of pilgrimage. The storytellers appear only at the beginning and end of the tale. Instead we cut back to Chaucer himself Pasolini himself and very handsome he is too writing the tales at a snail's pace. There are also long by 2006 standards tracking shots over indifferent scenery. Yet other scenes jump disconcertingly the start of one tale used to mark the end of the previous one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently rented Canterbury Tales because I started reading the Chaucer book and also because I liked Pasolinis final film Salo. However I was very much disappointed with the results. To be sure the film begins strongly as the first tale presented about a young woman cheating on her elderly temporarily blind husband has an enjoyable sense of playfulness and brilliant camera work especially the ambiguous naturalistic shots of sloppy facial expressions which are usually always a strong point for Pasolini.  Even the 2 tales that followed had their merits.  The story of the tax collectors played like an interesting poetic riddle and the tale of the Charlie Chaplin style reveler  was fun in how it combined Chaplinesque innocence with things like gambling and group sex. However after this my appreciation of the film soon went down as the stories that followed lacked virtually anything that could be called likable. It was mostly just wooden superficial characters hysterically shouting at each other so cartoonishly that even a seven year old would complain about bad acting while watching it and lots of cheap bodily function jokes that were done better hundreds of times elsewhere. And it also has plenty of completely unerotic sex scenes that belong in 70s Italian gross out soft porn rather than in any movie thats meant to be taken seriously. And the infamous hell scene at the end feels like bad childrens television e.g. Santa Claus Conquers the Martians with its cheap looking paper costumes and sloppy claymation. While scholars or people  who lived in Italy during the 60s and 70s could probably spot intellectual criticisms of societys hypocrisy in the movie they really do not save it much  especially not from completely butchering the intelligence humanity and depth of Chaucers original work. In any case Canterbury Tales shows that no matter how artistic you make your visuals if your movie lacks plot and characterization they will be badly missed.".

Personally I think that it's a shame that the same director of great cinematic masterpieces as Mamma Roma Accattone and The Gospel According to St. Matthew ended his career as director doing movies like this.Just like the other two films from the Trilogy of Life The Decameron and Arabian Nights directed by Pasolini this movie has almost nothing to do with the literary source in which it was inspired being terrible as an adaptation but even worse as a completely independent movie lacking of any artistic or entertainment value. This movie is a big waste of time from beginning to end. It's dumb it's unfunny it's not enjoyable at all and it's not interesting from any kind of perspective. The Canterbury Tales is one of the most disappointing movies that I've seen in my entire life. This film doesn't any justice to the book in which it is supposedly inspired.".

This movie is a big waste of time from beginning to end. It's dumb it's unfunny it's not enjoyable at all and it's not interesting from any kind of perspective. The Canterbury Tales is one of the most disappointing movies that I've seen in my entire life. This film doesn't any justice to the book in which it is supposedly inspired.";

	schema:reviewBody "Pier Paolo Pasolini to my estimation so far from films I've seen which have been most of his oeuvre wasn't a genius at least not entirely. He could fall flat on his face or just stick his pretentious tail out too far into the wind. But he was an artist and with his subjects he had something to say whether you liked it or not. So is the way with The Canterbury Tales which I've been told is apart of a trilogy of life along with the good Decameron and the nearmasterpiece Arabian Nights and like those films it's a narrative that is precisely loose and episodic and the subject matter is like a Monty Python film that takes its craft seriously but still knows when to go in for the bizarre humor. Or sometimes not. Or sometimes it just doesn't work.I never read the Chaucer Tales that are so renown to scholars and schoolkids alike but the stories in the film seem to reflect as much of its filmmaker as it does its author if not more so. We get stories of lust and adultery and greed and ignorance in medieval rural England. Not much time for a lot of the mythical aspects though from time to time they are there and there's a boatload of time for bawdy and crude comedy. One of the highlights is a scene where a young man has just finished sleeping with a woman both very nude it is NC17 England and all and the guy's friend is standing outside the window to get a kiss. She decides to give him one her ass and a big fart right at his face. But he returns with a red hot poker and asks so nicely to get a kiss again this time his friend's turn to give a fart and thus get a red hot poker at his private area. So yeah comedy like that.Some scenes kind of meld into others as the stories continue on with middle aged fat men who want their women and are joyful and mean in equal measure one guy sings and amuses his woman though she'd rather have the company of a younger man while another man keeps trying to have his way with another maiden a big phallus sticking right in his pants again NC17. The downside to a lot of the film is that Pasolini for all of his elegant artistry in composing shots in these rundown and rural places and in the fields of England with DP Tonini Delli Colli he can't really direct most of his cast well. Sometimes his use of nonprofessionals can work but it doesn't help in this case that a large majority of the cast speak English and are dubbed Pasolini's films in general don't have live sound recorded and some of the actors like the Fool who impresses with his capability of outrunning authorities and spilling eggs that don't break are just smiling idiots that can't act well.That is with some exceptions. Or rather a bizarre exception. Tom Baker who some of you may recall or love from his stint as a Doctor Who in the 1970's appears in one of the stories. It's kind of a shock to even see him he appears completely naked as a sexually frustrated housewife looks through a peephole and he appears we haven't seen his face until then in a full 70's porno mustache and his usual wideeyed demeanor. He also gets some other 'pleasure' in a field scene which is also rather crazy to see if only from the only former association with him being Doctor Who and then another scene where he gets to overact reading from a book to the sexually frustrated housewife. It's a remarkably wild story and featuring the actor becomes more than just a curio. Ditto to the finale of the film where we see Chaucer who also appears during the film sometimes as the 'author' of these stories delight in showing Satan and his minions defecating all over the place. It's like the South Park answer to Salo.It's a film that is loaded with creative visuals some striking Ennio Morricone music and some really juvenile humor not to mention the bad dubbing and hitormiss acting by the mostly nonprofessionals. But what carries it is the director's dedication to his vision and the fun he's having with Chaucer and his own view on the decay and rampant sexual energy of the populous.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you consider exactly who would ever consider sitting down and making Canterbury tales into a movie and this should be a small number a lot of the tales are too subtle to be represented in any form other than text you would usually think that the maker of the movie would be trying to stay faithful to the stories in themes plot and characterization.It is in this regard that Pasolini fails utterly miserably.The tellers of the tales are completely left out. You do not know who's telling a tale. There is little to no segue between tales. Often times you do not even realize that the tale is over. So for the first part you do not know who is telling a tale or when or even if a tale is even going on.The few segues that occur consist of a grimy Chaucer sitting around lazily eventually being prodded into work by his waspish wife. Why this is included baffles anyone who knows anything about Chaucer or even anyone at all.The dubbing on the movie makes low budget martial arts films look like great pillars of art. At times characters shout for minutes on end for no discernible reason. Other characters are entirely unintelligible.The most appalling thing though is the inclusion of graphic graphic sex. I am uncertain what Pasolini was trying to say with this. Why he felt Chaucer was the best source to draw on for such obscenity is beyond me. Indeed there are sex scenes in the tales. However Pasolini often goes far far over the limit. Many male characters seem to do nothing but masturbate whenever they are on screen. There is one sequence that is no tale that I recall which involved a man peeking through holes in doors watching other men have gay anal sex. This I do no recall from any part of Chaucer. Later one of the homosexuals is burned alive while the apparent protagonist sells bagles to the crowd. Another instance is that the Pardoner's tale begins in a tavern but Pasolini felt compelled to begin it in a brothel where hideous men force the whores there to have sex with them. Later one of the men urinates on a dining table while people are trying to eat and yes it is very graphic. It is actual urine.The movie ends ? with a scene in one tale where the devil farts and wildly defecates feces that turn into demons for possibly five minutes overthetop cartoon noises included.If you're into Pasolini for whatever reason I guess you might like this movie. I've never seen any of his other work. However as a fan and scholar of the Tales this probably is the worst thing you could have possible done it. Basically this was lowquality porn with bad lighting and horrific sound effects with a vague medieval background claiming to be one of the greatest works in the English language. Whoever later murdered Pasolini deserves a medal. No wait scratch that a dozen medals.".

	schema:reviewBody "Continuing his 'Trilogy of Life' cycle exploring medieval literature The Canterbury Tales by Pier Paolo Pasolini delves into some of the tales weaved within Geoffrey Chaucer's famous stories. It explores the myriad sexual depravities and allusions with bawdy gusto featuring almost every perversion known from voyeurism flagellation homosexuality to even the love of a watermelon. The disparate prurient tales are interwoven with Pasolini plays Chaucer here at his writing desk imaging his lasciviousness upon villagers. There is even a strange comic interlude paying homage to Charlie Chaplin in the form of Pasolini regular Ninetto Davoli.Whilst the visual style is similar to The Decameron 1970  Dante Feretti again is art director the stories do not intertwine as well here which could create some confusion in the viewer. With a largely British cast including Tom Baker Hugh Griffith Jeeny Runacre and even Robin Askwith the film film sometimes feels like a slightly less repressed 1970's British sex comedy Carry On Canterbury if you like. With its delight in sexual promiscuity and perversion it is certainly one of Pasolini's less than intellectual affairs and even fails to humour. Unless of course your funny bone is easily pleased by fart jokes.With a bizarre finale set in hell its visual design clearly inspired by the painting of Hieronymus Bosch we see an oversized Satan shitting out some plebeian folks to the obscene delight of those scattered round the pits. Whilst this incredibly short ending is disgustingly joyous it fails to save a very scatological film that vies more towards the crass than the enlightening.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

There is even a strange comic interlude paying homage to Charlie Chaplin in the form of Pasolini regular Ninetto Davoli.Whilst the visual style is similar to The Decameron 1970  Dante Feretti again is art director the stories do not intertwine as well here which could create some confusion in the viewer. With a largely British cast including Tom Baker Hugh Griffith Jeeny Runacre and even Robin Askwith the film film sometimes feels like a slightly less repressed 1970's British sex comedy Carry On Canterbury if you like. With its delight in sexual promiscuity and perversion it is certainly one of Pasolini's less than intellectual affairs and even fails to humour. Unless of course your funny bone is easily pleased by fart jokes.With a bizarre finale set in hell its visual design clearly inspired by the painting of Hieronymus Bosch we see an oversized Satan shitting out some plebeian folks to the obscene delight of those scattered round the pits. Whilst this incredibly short ending is disgustingly joyous it fails to save a very scatological film that vies more towards the crass than the enlightening.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com";

	schema:reviewBody "The Italian movie I racconti di Canterbury 1972 was shown in the U.S. with the translated title The Canterbury Tales. It was written and directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini who adapted it for the screen from the original work by Geoffrey Chaucer.What this movie has in abundance is male and female full frontal nudity. This was a big deal 45 years ago but it's not noteworthy now. Once you accept the fact that there's endless full frontal nudity the rest of the film has very little to offer. Chaucer is one of the greatest English language authors. It's hard to believe that an experienced director couldn't make these stories come alive. However for me nothing came alive in the entire two hours.For example the movie is dubbed and the dubbing doesn't work. There's no shortage of medieval crowd scenespigs dogs urchins beggars etc. but they are confusing and don't really move the action forward. I have to give credit to Pasolini for using an extraordinary number of extras. Of course to a certain extent he saved on costume expenses. There are also some great shots of Wells Cathedral. Not much else. Chaucer's strength is that he brings the people who tell the tales to life. Here we just get the tales. Also Pasolini has added some material with no obvious purpose. In fact the last tale looks like something out of a Bosch painting not something written by Chaucer. Did Pasolini really think The Canterbury Tales needed improvement?We saw this film at the wonderful Dryden Theatre in Rochester's George Eastman Museum. It's the best venue for movies that I know. Not only is the auditorium perfect for films but the Dryden shows movies that are hard to find and sometimes controversial. The program director knows that not every film will appeal to every person. He takes chances and that's great. However that sets up a situation where you win some and lose some. This movie was a loser. Don't waste your time and money on it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know much about Claude Chabrol's cinema. I've seen seven or eight of his dozens of films but I remember them quite well especially Violette Nozire Le boucher and La rupture. Many years after these La crmonie is a serene work the construction of a mature man who avoids making artificial judgments or explaining motivations of his characters and tending traps to his audiences to keep them interested in what he's narrating. In an economic way with wellchosen details he gives us everything needed in a story that deals with psychological disturbances and profound social disparity. I do not see this movie as a thriller nor do I see the connection with Alfred Hitchcock. While Hitchcock could almost ruin his forays into psychological landscapes like Simon Oakland explaining Norman Bates' behavior in Psycho or placing clues that led to nowhere and very rarely treated social issues Chabrol prevents from recurring to psychological clichs and gives us subtle gestures to illustrate the class struggle the way the rich daughter returns the handkerchief to the postoffice clerk after cleaning her filthy hands the way the postoffice clerk throws back an envelope to the bourgeois father. A few times Chabrol is not so subtle and he shows tension even between persons of the same class the way the poor maid and the postoffice clerk despise the miserly charity of an old Catholic couple the way the rich father protests when giving his son a ride to school... Using this strategy all the portraits are compassionate the members of the rich family seem as pleasant as the two poor women when they share the little they have. When the climax arrives the daughter of the bourgeois family discovers part of the maid's secret and in return the maid reveals she also knows something about the young woman there is little else Chabrol can add but only guide us to the conclusion. Maybe it is a much too obvious cut from the two women with no food at home to the dinner table where the rich family finished a tasty meal. But that's all we need in case we want an explanation of the way the two women act in the last scenes. All the elements are there for us to find answers or make interpretations if we want to do so. Not too many filmmakers today treat audiences as intelligent human beings and invite them to participate in the creative process adding the absent information with the benefit of more than a century of cinematic tradition and if we care reflections on the way things are today in imbalanced societies. When La crmonie was over I was very pleased not only did I watch a movie directed with brains but I felt treated with respect by Claude Chabrol. Not frequent in much of today's cinema a respectful film has great merit.".

Using this strategy all the portraits are compassionate the members of the rich family seem as pleasant as the two poor women when they share the little they have. When the climax arrives the daughter of the bourgeois family discovers part of the maid's secret and in return the maid reveals she also knows something about the young woman there is little else Chabrol can add but only guide us to the conclusion. Maybe it is a much too obvious cut from the two women with no food at home to the dinner table where the rich family finished a tasty meal. But that's all we need in case we want an explanation of the way the two women act in the last scenes. All the elements are there for us to find answers or make interpretations if we want to do so. Not too many filmmakers today treat audiences as intelligent human beings and invite them to participate in the creative process adding the absent information with the benefit of more than a century of cinematic tradition and if we care reflections on the way things are today in imbalanced societies. When La crmonie was over I was very pleased not only did I watch a movie directed with brains but I felt treated with respect by Claude Chabrol. Not frequent in much of today's cinema a respectful film has great merit.";

They both it transpires have potentially murderous secrets in their past involving the incineration of unwanted relatives a child and a father.

This is because primarily though Jeanne's obsessive class angst and Sophie's obsessive paranois they justify their stance and actions with an us against them the world selfrighteous fervour. Jeanne describes all her  increasingly erratic  behaviour as a good deed and the equaly unstable Sophie believes her.Every role is acted impeccably by some of the leading lights of French cinema. Along with Bonnaire and Huppert arguably the best French actresses working today  Jacqueline Bisset plays the bourgeouse lady of the house for whom Jeanne works. She sees herself as a kind and understanding employer providing glasses and a television for her taciturn domestic. However this gesture is interpreted as patronising by the illiterate Jeanne.It's through minot details such as this that character exposition arises .

This intentional disparity brings us uncomfortably closer to the unhinged worlds of Jeanne and Sophie. Worlds which are revealed slowly subtly and manipulatively.La Ceremonie is based of a Ruth Rendell novel Judgement in Stone. Rendell is an archetypal British writer and I think that if  La Ceremonie was a British film with British actors and a skilful British director it would have been a very different darker and more disturbing movie. Having said this Chabrol with his distinctly French sensibilities and post nouvelle vague expertise brings other qualities to the story and makes this a remarkable film. Chabrol avoided darkness for the sake of it in favour of a highly sophisticated level of characterisation and buildup. The climax however it was filmed could never be anything less than shocking.Ultimately la Ceremonie presents a pessimistic view of humanity bleak depressing and disturbing. Even Bisset's family don't come off well with their selfishly consumereist and blinkered middle class lifestyles.This and the high degree of audience manipulation means the film leaves a bad taste in the mouth but there's no denying it's an egregious work of art.".

Huppert plays the other vital role.A rich family is looking for a housekeeper. They choose Sophie Sandrine Bonnaire a slightly cold woman. Much sooner than the family we find out why she's so cold she can't read. Her employers are Georges Lelivre and his second wife. They have a son and from his previous marriage a daughter Melinda played by Virginie. Melinda looks at Sophie as somebody who helps around the house rather than 'the maid' as her parents call Sophie. Every now and then Melinda tells Sophie she shouldn't let her father walk over her. Melinda likes her father but thinks of him as a fascist. She isn't the only one the lady from the postal office Jeanne Huppert's role thinks so too. But soon we find out she hates all the people with money. Georges hates Jeanne too he's sure she opens and reads his mail. He also mistrusts her because her child was badly burnt even though Jeanne was cleared  because there was no proof she wounded her child on purpose.But wait there's more Sophie's father died in a fire. Sophie was interrogated but soon dropped off the suspects' list. Sophie and Jeanne feel there's a bond between them because of their past nobody could prove we had anything to do with it. The longer Sophie knows Jeanne the ruder she becomes.Director Claude Chabrol doesn't pass judgment. He doesn't tell us whether Jeanne and Sophie are guilty or not. He only shows them how this affects the rest of their lives and of the lives of the Lelivre family. Because it soon becomes clear that Jeanne wants revenge and tries to get Sophie on her side. Jeanne is revengeful and full of contempt Sophie gets ruder all the time Georges expects too much of Sophie and his wife is incredibly posh. You don't get angels in this movie. But it is Melinda who is crucial to how you watch this film she's the most 'normal' character. Melinda is the bridge between her parents and Sophie. It's Melinda who finds out Sophie's secret. And Melinda is the person responsible for the crescendo and denouement of the film.Chabrol films this in his usual style the camera likes to slide around the house. It observes. The viewer is the one who can decide who's to blame more for what happens. The viewer is always right. Wait a second... no I'll take that back.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that by the end of this film there can be no doubt that both women carry homicidal tendencies. Their 'revenge' on the family was brutal and thoroughly undeserved in my opinion.The family themselves are a paradigm of a modern loving unit. The parents are happy to let their children drive smoke and have boyfriends back to the house they dine together and occasionally sit down together to watch opera on their enormous television. They are well off and bourgeois but they do not treat Sophie with disrespect. Even upon discovering her illiteracy Melinda is sympathetic and offers help although it could have been perceived as patronising by the ever victimised Sophie. If there has to be a villain within the family then it is the father. He complains about her once or twice and tries to ban Jeanne from the house. It is he also who fires her in the end but this decision is justified in my opinion after her underhanded behaviour towards Melinda.If the family are innocent then Jeanne and Sophie certainly are not. At first Sophie is presented sympathetically struggling to pronounce 'pouvez' alone in her room with a children's' reading book and we share in her relief when the note she is agonising over is read aloud. This sympathy is instantly lost however when she is discovered and tries to blackmail Melinda.It appears to be Jeanne's influence which turns her into such a rebel. It is Jeanne who instigates the ridiculous purging of people's donations in the name of the 'Secours Catholiques' and it is in reference to Jeanne's ban from the house that Sophie remarks 'Je ne vais pas l'obeyir' I am not going to obey him. They also ransack the house at the end as a pair. They are capable of acting as rebels alone Jeanne's reaction to the father's complaint at the post office Sophie eavesdropping on Melinda's conversation but the end proves that it is when they are together that they become the most extreme. It is Sophie who fires the first shot suggesting that she is not just under Jeanne's influence but that she is also a driving force in the couple's actions.As regards an 'us vs them' ideology possibly alluring to some sort of socialist revolutionary slant on the film there is some evidence certainly the contrast between her rickety 2CV and the cars that the family drive and the fact that Sophie is under their employ to begin with shows a level of social hierarchy. But as for the oppression of the proletariat there is no evidence that Sophie is shown any disrespect their revolution to me is more of a cold blooded massacre. In order to have an us versus them scenario there has to be some opposition on each side this situation appears more of an 'us ambushing them unprovoked'. The fact that Jeanne is killed and that the tape recorder is found is not to show the plight of a futile revolution but instead to provide justice to show that shooting a whole family for no good reason does not go unpunished.Instead of the idea of an 'us vs them' struggle I saw the film as a played out inferiority complex. Sophie was convinced they were out to get her because of her illiteracy and she built up such a victimised view of the world that it was impossible to conceive of that people were prepared to look past it. Although obviously capable of violence on her own given her suspect past it is the meeting with Jeanne who has an irrational hatred of the rich and a similar paranoia that they hate her back that acts as the catalyst for the blood bath finale.".

But as for the oppression of the proletariat there is no evidence that Sophie is shown any disrespect their revolution to me is more of a cold blooded massacre. In order to have an us versus them scenario there has to be some opposition on each side this situation appears more of an 'us ambushing them unprovoked'. The fact that Jeanne is killed and that the tape recorder is found is not to show the plight of a futile revolution but instead to provide justice to show that shooting a whole family for no good reason does not go unpunished.Instead of the idea of an 'us vs them' struggle I saw the film as a played out inferiority complex. Sophie was convinced they were out to get her because of her illiteracy and she built up such a victimised view of the world that it was impossible to conceive of that people were prepared to look past it. Although obviously capable of violence on her own given her suspect past it is the meeting with Jeanne who has an irrational hatred of the rich and a similar paranoia that they hate her back that acts as the catalyst for the blood bath finale.";

Towards the end things became ominous as Sophie and Jeanne the maid and the postal clerk happened to have both been coincidentally accused of crimes and were acquitted. This coincidence just wasn't believable and was a contrived plot twist that didn't belong. it spoiled the nice characterization in the early part of the movie which I found thoroughly enjoyable. There was no judgment on the characters initially just the tension between the household and the servant which is pretty marked in a French household apparently. Sophie was intermittently treated as if she were not even there and then as if she were a distant poor relation. That the movie degenerated quickly into a disturbing usversus them joke was extremely disappointing. Unfortunately many writers seem to think that readers or audiences will not be satisfied without lurid exploitive plots.The acting was good but again actors should be careful not to choose roles that are so stereotyped and really ridiculously prejudiced.".

Maybe it's the editing. Anyway this is more like his quietly brilliant Une affaire de femmes 1988 with a fine script and striking performances by Sandrine Bonnaire and Isabelle Huppert handsomely supported by Jacqueline Bisset Jean Pierre Cassel and the very pretty Virginie Ledoyen.Bonnaire plays Sophie an intense taciturn woman harboring dark secrets whom the Lelivres have hired to cook and keep house at their country home. Bisset is Catherine Lelivre and Cassel her husband. They exist in bourgeois heaven avec matrimonial bliss with two teenagers a family so closely knit and so charmingly together that they watch a twopart production of Mozart's Don Giovanni on TV just the four of them cosily on the couch.Well this sort of unobtainable happiness doesn't sit well with Jeanne Huppert who is a lowly postal clerk living alone whose past includes the accidental? killing of her fouryearold daughter. Jeanne takes a fancy to the Lelivre's strange new maid with the idea of showing her something besides work. They strike up a fateful friendship that we know is leading to something horrible.Huppert is as good as I've seen her which is very good indeed. She is particularly striking here in an uncharacteristic role as a spiteful working class woman with a heart of vengeance against anybody better off than she is. There is just a touch of sly irony in her performance suggesting that she is having a particularly good time playing the nasty. Bonnaire's stark performance as the unbalanced and humorless reclusive Sophie will remain etched in your brain. Apart they are like inert harmless chemicals. Together they catalyze one another and become brazen and explosive. The story filled with little foreshadowing of the tragedy to come gilds the lily of our tristesse by making the Lelivres so very very nice. We are reminded of the violent hatred by the proletariat toward the privileged classes in this case acted out by two loonies against an innocent but representative family echoing not only the Russian Revolution but even more so the French Revolution now two hundred years old.What I am trying to figure out why this is called La Crmonie. Maybe it is a ceremony of execution.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "Did anyone see Murderous Maids? I saw that before I saw this and felt it had the same sinister undertones. Murderous Maids also French and yet a true story came out a few years ago in 2002 I think and La Ceremonie came out in 1995. I honestly felt extremely disturbed when I watched this moviemaybe because I saw the aforementioned one first! esp. when the two women went back collect Sophie's things from her former employer after she was fired for both women to become this Thelma  Louise to get revenge on the family. That is the product of good acting of course and the rest of the cast was perfect. Jacqueline Bisset spoke French like a native speaker.

Murderous Maids also French and yet a true story came out a few years ago in 2002 I think and La Ceremonie came out in 1995. I honestly felt extremely disturbed when I watched this moviemaybe because I saw the aforementioned one first! esp. when the two women went back collect Sophie's things from her former employer after she was fired for both women to become this Thelma  Louise to get revenge on the family. That is the product of good acting of course and the rest of the cast was perfect. Jacqueline Bisset spoke French like a native speaker.

No not even close though the viewer might wonder throughout most of the film what possible point the film might have. I do not mean that in a necessarily negative way. Truly the director's point of view which might be revealed in the film's resolution remains shrouded in mystery throughout mostly because the film's story centers on two young women whose personalities appear to be monolithically hateful and purposeless respectively.Then there are the film's views on socialeconomic classes. Whatever message Chabrol hoped to deliver about disparity between the classes and the moralities inherent in those distinctions is undercut and betrayed by his depiction of the two main characters who have no moral viewpoint. A much better film for exploring the morality of class strata is Lina Wertmuller's Swept Away.Maybe Chabrol's other films come closer to Hitchcock's canon of suspense but this one shares non of the master's touches. Hitchcock's Rope has a pair of antisocial protagonists but they have purpose and a point of view and that film is an intellectual game of wits. La Ceremonie is antiintellectual and its inspiration for rebellion comes via a criminal misanthrope and her witless sidekick.".

Georges overacts a bit but is so funny one forgives him. Jacqueline Bisset we all know it is one of the most elegant women on earth which makes her fit to her role like a comfortable glove or one of her splendid dresses worn by her. Just as beautiful Virginie Ledoyen from En plein coeur among others plays here a character completely different from the aforementioned film a rebellious daughter with a social conscience. Dr. Cleckley on his famous treatise on psychopathy Mask of sanity writes about how a schizophrenic can be used predated by a psychopath who uses her as a muscle to do the criminal acts while she masterminds everything. Having watched the film again it is my contention we witness an alliance of the sort in this film. Use of classical music is intelligent you'll never listen to Mozart's Don Giovanni or Britten's Cello Concerto again without remembering this film and probably feeling some tension if you're like me at least.My favourite character is the Priest. Like in most Chabrol's films you can expect his portrayal of the church to be far from unbiased but in this case at least it's so ridiculous it's funny. Watch his spectacles and pompous way of talking and you can almost see old man Chabrol winking at us. I agree with IMDb reviewer epeck15 that Sandrine's jerky and stiff physical mannerisms plus that we can also feel her almost childlike panic creates a bond that's hard to forget afterwards. He she mentions sociopathy twice in the review too.Watch twice at least leaving some time in between. Like a sip of fine Indian tea this film only gets better each time you view it.".

	schema:reviewBody "La Crmonie is a strange film and difficult to pigeonhole. The film is directed by the great Claude Chabrol and based on the novel 'A Judgement in Stone' by Ruth Rendell. The location for the film has been moved from the UK to Chabrol's native France and most of the film takes place in a small isolated village. The film is a rather slow burning drama but the interest is kept up by the intriguing characters and social study. The story itself really allows the director to do what he does best as it provides a handful of intriguing characters that are able to manipulate their situation into a thrilling climax. The film focuses on the welloff Lelievre family. They hire Sophie as a maid. She's a strange and quiet woman and is harbouring a dark secret her illiteracy. While out in the village one day she meets Jeanne a post office worker jealous of anyone who is of a higher social standing than herself and the two strikes up a friendship that eventually has a tragic result.The setting that Chabrol has chosen for the film really benefits the story as the isolation allows the director to focus purely on the characters. Sandrine Bonnaire is suitably strange in the lead role and while we are never allowed to learn a great deal about her character the actress plays a very good part. Isabelle Huppert costars and really steals the show with her anarchistic character that provides a catalyst to all the mayhem. The film is very much of the slow burning variety but it's interesting throughout and we do get a good payoff at the end. The film has a point although it does have to be said that it can become a little muddled at times. Chabrol does do a good job of showing the characters for who they are and getting the audience on the side of the right characters to allow a strong ending. It has often been said that this film isn't among the director's best work and when a director has previously directed films such as The Breach This Man Must Die and Wedding in Blood it would be rather difficult for anything to break into that pack. La Crmonie is a very good film however and certainly is recommended to Chabrol fans.".

Derek's friend Sam a leather wearing tomboy on a motorcycle on whom he has a notsosecret crush is talked into going along. On their way to the cabin the teenagers meet a local who warns them to stay away from the cabin but of course the warning is unheeded. It doesn't take long before animal passions are running wild and I don't just mean the sex crazed teenagers.Once the initial action and gore is over something unusual for a direct to video movie happened... an interesting and engaging story broke out about Derek's abusive stepdad Mitchell the effect on his mother his relationship with Sam and the truth about his father's death. A visit from Uncle Charley leads Sam into a situation that jeopardizes her relationship with Derek while uncovering the truth about Mitchell and putting all their lives in danger. Don't get me wrong you won't see this picture mentioned at the Oscars but the acting and direction are competently done and the special effects are really fantastic. Even more amazing when you learn what a short timespan they had to put everything together and learn their roles. Just because some of you will want to know... the girls are cute and all but one have real breasts.I would recommend this highly to fans of campy horror like Feast Slither and Shaun of the Dead. Don't expect to be scared or particularly grossed out unless you have a weak stomach but do expect to be entertained.".

The beginning with teenagers going to an isolated cabin and finding a monster is not original but the sadistic attack of the werewolf specially the virgin girl is hilarious. The situation of Sam collecting DNA sample is also funny. The special effects are great for a Bmovie and in the end Big Bad Wolf is a very entertaining movie and recommended for fans of the genre.

Eli Roth can go suck an egg. Tension shock and screams make a story chilling and though this movie has its fair share of goopygore it does not dominate the movie. Kinky sex nudity lust and some humor along with sidesplitting bestiality is what the film is about. This film was made for adults  not preteen tweens or couch potato sixteen year old boys.Fun! Fun! Fun!Kimberly J. Brown has grown from her Disney efforts into a fine actress and Trevor Duke does justice to his role. Richard Tyson's delivery of his funnier lines is a hoot.

Even though there's some innovative but corny scenes it doesn't save the fact that it's not believable. It tries hard to be believable but f.e. the whole marriage abuse thing...c'mon. There is gore and its good at times. There is a werewolf cracking black jokes. And there's teens in trouble. The plot is somewhat mediocre and I can believe that the writers have worked it. But it always amazes me why they tend to forget the police forces from this kind of movies. And you'll understand what I mean if you watch this movie. Acting is at time to time good but the main character is really really one dimensional. So 5 stars and thats because of two reasons. First of all werewolfmovies are a rare breed in 21century so i'm kind of supporting the fact that these are even made and second of all the gore is fine.".

While it does fall prey to some of the cheesy pitfalls of many horror movies it is surprisingly entertaining and able to hold your attention throughout. It may also be the first time I've ever seen a werewolf that engages in witty banter with his victims so props for originality.

The two lie about what happened at the cabin to the local sheriff David Naughton of American Werewolf in London thinking that no one will believe that a werewolf was responsible for the killings.Derek and Sam have suspicions about Mitch but don't know how to prove them. Enter Uncle Charlie who has suspicions of his own ever since the Africa trip. He and the kids set out to prove that Mitch is the werewolf. A clever cat and mouse game ensues that leads to a final confrontation back at the cabin.This was well written for a relatively low budget horror flick. There is some actual character development and some welcome bits of black humor. The directing and acting are uniformly good also unusual for a teen oriented film and the characters are all pretty likable and behave in an intelligent manner to deal with the problem for the most part. Richard Tyson shines in an admittedly limited role as the sinister stepdadbeast. Trevor Duke as Derek fares less well as the wishy washy ineffective hero for the bulk of the movie. The gore special effects are more than adequate though the werewolf transformation sequences leave something to be desired.All in all Big Bad Wolf moved along at a good pace was interesting if nothing new or special and had a good conclusion. Maybe not in the same league as the Universal Wolfman or Brotherhood of the Wolf it's still way better than most of the recent crop of werewolf flicks.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed this movie. It's professionally made well paced shot and edited with proper actors of decent quality. Richard Tyson as the bad guy step dadwerewolf is actually rather good as is Kimberley Brown as Sam.I thought the story was pretty good and didn't quite go the way I was expecting it to. I imagined it was just another 'teens go to a cabin in the woods and get killed one by one' movie but it isn't. There is actually a plot and some subtext here. The director says this film is an attempt to use the beast as a metaphor for struggling with addiction and as a representation of the id and the beast within. This is why this werewolf can talk and likes to taunt people and why he doesn't just kill but enjoys a spot of rape and torture  and it works just fine in the context of the film. It's also a retelling of the classic mythological story of the son having to confront the father figure to finally become a man. The director acknowledges major story elements owe a lot to the movie The Stepfather the sheriff is named after that films director Joe Rubin and even Shakespeare's Hamlet. The film is also filled with homage's to great movies by Hitchcock Spielberg and Landis. I won't say what they are but see if you can spot them or just listen to the interesting and informative commentary.Having said all that there is still plenty of gratuitous nudity humour and some nice gore. The make up and CG FX are actually quite good. The wolf is of a decent design and about as well done as you get with standard makeup FX no animatronics  just man in suit.What I liked most about this film was its take on the werewolf as a representation of the darkest nastiest and innermost human desires. The villain while always a pretty nasty guy had been struggling to control his 'problem' and had actually been quite successful until the daft teens got involved.This is of course a very low budget film. What makes this far superior to similar low budget efforts is that the writerdirector had a clear vision of the type of story he wanted to tell and actually spent time on the script and in casting some decent actors.Not brilliant or a classic but much better than I expected.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a few excellent movies in the eighties such as An American Werewolf in London and The Howling the werewolf genre seemed to take a fall in the nineties. Then movies such as Dog Soldiers and Ginger Snaps came along making me believe the genre was making a comeback. Then Cursed came along and ruined every hope.Big Bad Wolf has been depicted as a 'Bmovie' people warning not to expect too much of it. It's scheduled to be released on DVD in the US in June. Abominable is another movie which was released on DVD and one I'd very much like to see. I'm still waiting for Abominable to come out here the Netherlands on DVD but I decided not to wait with Big Bad Wolf don't worry if it does come out I'll buy it.To cut it short I certainly wasn't disappointed. The movie has a good gloomy atmosphere one looks for with movies such as this. Also in my opinion it takes a certain individual to portray the werewolf in human form who  basically  can be put into two categories the sad cursed victim like in An American Werewolf or the sadistic willing victim like in The Howling. Richard Tyson plays one hell of a werewolf and his character can definitely be placed under the second category.Not only as a werewolf but in human form as well Mitchell Toblat is one nasty character. The werewolf too is somewhat different than we've seen before.Like with many I had my doubts about a talking werewolf but I believe it has worked out nicely. In this movie the werewolf truly is a well sexual predator as well representing the animal side of human nature call it ID if you'd like but it worked out well. Blood gore and sadism all around nicely done though and not too much. The movie also had humour in places as with An American Werewolf in London not overly done and welltimed.None of the other cast members annoyed me most were even likable unlike several recent werewolf movies. The story has a few nice turns and most of them weren't overly predictable. The ending didn't hold too many surprises and is perhaps even a tad disappointing sequel perhaps? but all in all this is worth watching.Call it a 'Bmovie' but in my opinion being the werewolf freak that I am it's a hell of a lot better than Cursed and yes I dare say better than many mainstream horror movies of recent years.".

The ending didn't hold too many surprises and is perhaps even a tad disappointing sequel perhaps? but all in all this is worth watching.Call it a 'Bmovie' but in my opinion being the werewolf freak that I am it's a hell of a lot better than Cursed and yes I dare say better than many mainstream horror movies of recent years.";

It has his problems the teenagers are annoying as always the dialoguse have major problems and the werewolf is not done very good but you can surely pass over. The very good points 1. The werewolf is quite crazy. He tears apart his victims he IS a beast. 2. The werewolf is talking! This is ingenious indeed I never saw it before and I saw a lot of werewolf movies. You may think at first it is inappropriate but I assure you the effect overall is very good. 3. There are pleasant nudity scenes great tits and the werewolf even rapes one of the teengirls in her perfect ass in front of her boyfriend. While rather disturbing the scene is quite good and adds to the story. 4. The atmosphere is nicely done quite dark quite 80's and there IS suspense. I am surely recommend the movie as one of the few werewolf movies made good in the last decades with Ginger Snaps Unleashed and Dog Soldiers being other two examples in the same vein.".

The actors were obviously there for a paycheck and to get through it as quickly as possible. Who can blame them certainly no one who read the script beforehand. The special effects were lame the plot absurd with no suspense or one decent scare. As I was watching it what came to mind was this would be a good candidate for that show where they would lampoon the worst science fiction and horror movies made.

The gore in this film was pretty good. Nothing really jumps out at me I've seen most of it before teen cast gore some jumps some funny parts sometimes I didn't think they were supposed to be taken as funny though but overall i enjoyed it.Bad Parts This film was extremely cheesy but i like that kinda thing but some others may not. EG. The wolf talks! he does things like I'll huff and i'll puff and i'll RIP YOUR GUTS OUT! I did like the wolf costume but his lips didn't really move when it was talking and the cgi when he was turning in a wolf was pretty bad.Spoilers Ahead  LOOK AWAY NOW IF YOU Don't WANT TO SEE .You can pretty much guess whats going to happen throughout the whole film. I you know who would survive and die by the first 5 minutes in. They have the typical characters who you know are going to get picked off. Sluts jocks drunken teens but I really don't mind it as it's the same in every horror film. One part I remember the most is the sort of gold digging slutty virgin girl gets humped by the wolf Laughing into myself as i type and her boyfriends says She was a virgin... and the wolf replies Well she ain't' anymore!With things like that happening you know your gonna have a pretty fun and time passing little film thats completely forgettable but really enjoyable. So thats why i would give big bad wolf 6 out of 10. For good gore effects and some laughable moments big bag wolf would be a perfect film for watching on Halloween night with some friends.Jordan DI recently bought Big Bad Wolf in HMV for 4 Not in the sale its also on play.com for 2.99 in the price massacre collection so if you want to see this little cool film its not gonna break the bank.".

Spoiler Alertahead if you want to check out the move and wonder if you should allow me to answer If you like werewolf movies chock full of graphic bloody effects this might appeal to you Are their any redeeming values? I thought soUnderneath all the horrorSlasherWerewolf trappings there was a tongue in cheek aspect that gave the film any wit it might have. The large and varied cast are all lambs led to the slaughter. Leading the lineup is our Teenage hero named Derek played by Trevor DukeMoretz . His chopper ridding auto mechanic loner girlfriend named Sam is played by Kimberly Brown. The wicked stepfather here is played by Richard Tyson The remainder of the large cast are for the most part disposed of. For a lone werewolf killing spree this one has a high body count. Bloody as they were designed to be there was always an air of dispersion of belief particularly when the Monster starts cracking wise. That's right a Wild and Woolly Big Bad Wolf as in Who's Afraid of? and the hair of your chinney chin chin. A paradox is set in play The Stepfather is the monster and we are watching Dr. Hyde and Mr Wolfman Monster by day Monster by moonlight or any other time it seems. Why Derick's poor suffering mother played by Sarah Aldrich hooked up with this guy is a literary mystery.Horror movie conventions are played with by the Director Take the horror movie clich noting how Black actors get knocked off first. Take note it happens here within the first fifteen seconds folks.! and from within the clichs' emerges unexpected originality. Expect lowbrow humor and some nudity add some implied sex and buckets of prosthetic violence and we have a great teen movie. Good sound Music Editing and all technical issues refreshingly good for a your tube viewing. Seven and a half out of Ten you get what you expect stars.".

Unfortunately others subvert his song into The Mighty Quinn disturbing the atmosphere somewhat but that's all part of the plot.Quinn's serious cop is the straight man to another worthy character Maubee Robert Townsend an impish rascal loved by everyone on the island.The Mighty Quinn makes me want to go to the island and party with everyone there but alas it's only a movie.".

I loved this movie because of it's wonderful characters and the things they deal with over the course of this movie. The film may not be actionpacked or even contain a gripping plot but I assure any readers this movie will not dissapoint you. Denzel Washington is delightful as the sherrif trying to prove his friends innosennce and Robert Townsend plays the downandout drifter Maubee in an equaly pleasing role.

Robert Townsend shows his amazing versatility as the childhood friend of Washington and the chief suspect in a murder. Mimi Rogers is just luscious as the philandering spouse of James Fox the man who wants Washington to go away and stop doing his job. M. Emmet Walsh makes the perfect government hit man who is after missing 10000 bills. Then there is Sheryl Lee Ralph as Washington's wife. When she sings I'm Hurting Inside you know it's true.

Robert Townsend is great as the wily Maubee Mimi Rogers is convincing as a damsel in distress and Sheryl Lee Ralph showcases her talents as both an actress and a singer. But perhaps the best part of this movie in my opinion is Denzel's character Xavier. Oh yes he looks sexy as he always does. But more that that it's the way he embodies a role so much so that by the end of the movie you can't tell him from smooth tongued Jamaican police officer that he's playing.

This film was made in 1989 during a black cultural rebirth that included Spike Lee films and the political rap band Public Enemy. This film fits into that category and is unapologetic in its portrayals. If you can't handle the reality of colonialism and intervention then you cant handle this film.

Halfway through Washington begins to believe that there is more to the case than meets the eye and that his buddy will be no more than a scapegoat.Very nice location shooting in Jamaica. If you like reggae you will LOVE this film's score. There are lots of shots of the beautiful beach. Hey mon why you jomp in dee wahtah faw? The more desperately seedy areas of Kingston are avoided as they would be in one of Hitchcock's movies set in an exotic locale. The viewpoint is that of the tourist used to saying in nice hotels the kind with jacuzzis but no venomous snakes.Denzel Washington handles the accent pretty well without quite shedding his own phones. Sometimes it fades more than others. The other performers don't really have too much to do. Everyone seems to be enjoying himself as if on vacation.The movie is rather goodnatured considering the plot. The white guys tend to be bad while the local people of color are at worst raffish. Is there still such racial friction in Jamaica? I don't know but in the Bahamas the races get along well with one another as they do in much of the Caribbean. Maybe big cities breed animosities spontaneously.There's nothing truly outstanding about this routine flick except as I've noted the score. It's not especially exciting mysterious amusing or engaging in any other way. It's not a bad flick if you're prepared to let it take you by the hand and lead you along the colorful streets pointing out sites of interest suggesting you taste the jerky and try one of those pink drinks in a tall glass with a flower and a paper umbrella sticking out of it. We call it Captain Bluebeard's Mango Flavored Rum Punch. Mind the umbrella. One of awah tourists lost an eye last year. Don't drink? Fine bad faw the health. Care for one of awah Jahmaycan cigars?

We call it Captain Bluebeard's Mango Flavored Rum Punch. Mind the umbrella. One of awah tourists lost an eye last year. Don't drink? Fine bad faw the health. Care for one of awah Jahmaycan cigars? You might not remember much of it later but you won't object to having watched it.";

He's very dashing in his formal uniform and while out of favour with his wife he's still not short of admirers. His notsosmooth life is then even more disturbed by a murder at a smart local hotel. The powers that be seem rather too keen to close down the investigation fast and pin the blame on Maubee  a colourful ne'erdowell who was also Quinn's childhood friend. A role that gives Robert Townsend plenty of scope to enjoy himself. Denzel himself though is perhaps at his 46th best. What in later his roles becomes a cool stillness here sometimes just looks a little stiff. His Jamaican accent also occasionally wanders and his singing is a departure.Don't be totally put off though.

The victim has had his throat cut so it is clearly murder. Plenty of people are keen to point the finger of blame at Maubee a local ne'erdowell who was also a childhood friend of Quinn. There is also an unseemly desire to wrap the case up as quickly as possible the owner of the hotel complex where the man was killed doesn't want his other guests upset and the island's governor doesn't want the tourist industry damaged. Quinn however is determined to properly investigate the case properly and as he does so he crosses paths with a Central American hitman a dodgy CIA operative and a case full of US 10000 bills.If you are looking for a gritty cop drama then this isn't the film for you however if you want a fun fairly light mystery then you could do a lot worse. The film nicely captures the feel of island life all the locals appear to know each other the pace of life is more relaxed the scenery looks great and the sea inviting. The central mystery is interesting and while somethings can be guessed others are not too obvious. Denzel Washington does a solid job as Quinn any time his accent slips slightly can be explained since we are told he spent three years in the US military and a year studying at Quantico. Also notable are James Fox who plays the obnoxious hotel owner Mimi Rogers who plays his wife M. Emmet Walsh who plays the dodgy CIA man and Norman Beaton who plays the governor. Robert Townsend is also great as the elusive Maubee he steals every scene he is in as this larger than life character. The film has a good soundtrack that adds to the Caribbean feel and some solid if mostly unspectacular action not that it is the sort of film that demands lots of action. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting an undemanding mystery set in a scenic location.".

The mystery is too dense with too many suspicious characters. The movie is filled with hardboiled stereotype characters. It is so over the top that it does get tiring. M.

Tom Hanks meets a difficult challenge here  to convincingly show us how a twelveyear old boy would act if he were trapped in an adult's body and had to pass in a grownup world. He meets the challenge in spades aided by a script that is by turns witty clever insightful and touching and by Penny Marshall's able direction. Much is added by Robert Loggia's sympathetic portrayal of TomJosh's boss and by Jared Rushton as his friend Billy. The movie is much more than an exercise in slapstick or farce it is really a disquisition on the wonder of childhood. In the end it is quite touching if not moving reminding us all of the innocence of youth and the aching sadness of recalling its loss. Too early to tell but the film might very well be destined to become a classic.".

It speaks to you as a child because it's completely realistic everything is just the way a kid would see it. Most of the time when adults try to simulate what it's like to be a child they fail miserably see all the 80's antidrug propaganda ads as an example. It takes an immense amount of creativity and sensitivity to be able to write something like this. But then when I see this movie as an adult it speaks to me on a completely different level. This film is a lesson to adults as well as children. Don't miss out on the fun and spirit of life! Don't get to wrapped up in your petty concerns of status and materialism just try to enjoy every moment the most that you can because you'll never get another chance to relive each moment of your life.

Superbly written scenes follow each other not to mention Tom Hanks' performance which should have been awarded. He seems to me the only contemporary actor who was able to play the role of a 13yearold teenager who becomes an adult from one day to another. Elizabeth Perkins and especially John Heard form a strong supporting cast and this time they really support Hanks' work. This film bothers to talk about more important things like the loss of innocence friendship and the first love not just tells a story about a boy in the big city. This was Hanks' starmaking role after a string of stupid comedies in the middle 80s and he deservedly became one of the biggest stars of the 90s. And don't forget this was his first film in his outsider series he made his biggest successes playing somehow outsider figures Sleepless in Seattle Philadelphia Forrest Gump or the Cast Away. Go and see it you won't be disappointed even if you think you've lost the child inside you...with the help of this film you will find it. Believe me.".

	schema:reviewBody "I often wonder why it's so damn hard to just be a big kid no matter how old you are. Big is a movie about hanging on to that carefree child even when you grow up. It's about not getting caught up in stringent rules and routines remembering those things that made being young so great the outlook on life especially when facing the mundane world of adulthood. Big strikes the balance between the two.This is one of those movies that nearly everyone has seen. And I suppose it's the precursor to that movie 13 Going on 30 despite some differences in how the metamorphosis occurs and the result and everything.Big is the story of 13 yearold Josh Baskin who is tired of missing out on all the privileges of being an adult. He's tired of simply being a kid. One night he makes a drastic wish at a carnival arcade machine and in the next day he wakes up 30 yearsold or so. So the kid gets his wish and while trying to return to normal is a 13 yearold kid faced with a 30year old's responsibilities. And it's a lot of fun. He works at a toy manufacturer. He gets the most excellent loft. I remember wanting a place like that when I was a teenager. Eventually the 13yearold must balance with the responsibilities of being a 30 yearold when Josh falls seriously in love with Susan Perkins. Big is one of the greatest movies ever simply because of the idea of a kid trying to be an adult and an adult still trying to hang on to being a kid and all that things that Josh Baskins gets to experience while doing that.As one of Penny Marshall's most notable production this is enjoyable for nearly any age group. Everyone in it is fantasticHanks Perkins Loggia Heard Rheul Moscow and Rushton. It's a tough thing trying to hang to being young when you get older but Big's a good reminder to keep trying.".

He is perfect as Josh a boy at heart with no malice. Elizabeth Perkins makes a good Susan. Jared Rushton plays Billy the loyal friend. Robert Loggia is the owner of the firm. John Heard appears as Paul an executive who sees his star downgraded by the arrival of Josh.Highlights of the film have to be the F.A.O.

Hanks  Perkins give outstanding performances instead of playing a 12 year old Hanks actually becomes one. His innocence is totally believable. Perkins plays the part of the ambitious Susan to perfection and she is the perfect love interest for Hanks. Talk about chemistry here! The acting was great and the entire cast did an superb job. The movie is definitely a feelgood piece but it's more than just fluff. If you think about some of the messages it's telling us just to take things at face value and enjoy life. Josh succeeds because he has no ulterior motives. We are regularly reminded about the importance of friendship and how events in our lives can sometimes threaten our relationships with established friends when we find something or someone new that we think deserves our full attention. Of course a good friend will forgive you for such indulgences.Overall the movie deserves more stars for it's clever laughs amazing acting magnitude of imagination and nostalgia. Nonetheless when the ending came along I was left in shock wondering what just happened. Is that it? What happens next? There has to be additional footage. It cannot end like this. It called for a sequel perhaps but I don't know if it ever came out. If you never watched this movie and would like to experience 80's nostalgia it is highly recommended! My Ratings 9 out of 10.".

When Josh's own mother doesn't know him his best friend helps him relocate in New York City while his family thinks he's been kidnapped.

A young woman in the company Elizabeth Perkins falls in love with him. When he brings her to his new gorgeous apartment she sees his bunk bed soda machine and trampoline.This movie was remade as 13 Going on 30 which was also a delightful movie but not nearly as memorable as Big. As we watch Hanks spitting out Beluga caviar at the office party eating his way through the buffet and dressing in what can only be called a white Elvis tuxedo we realize how far we all are from our child within and that sense of wonder and freedom that brings with it original thoughts and creativity. As the boy Josh starts identifying more with his external appearance and discovers sex and the pressures of work he realizes that something is missing.Everyone in the film is excellent including Josh's adult love interest Elizabeth Perkins John Heard Robert Loggia Mercedes Ruehl and Jared Rushton as Billy Josh's best friend. The end is adorable and worthy of some tears  which I shed. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Hanks earned his first Oscar nomination in the late 1980s with the Penny Marshall comedyfantasy Big. I saw it for the first time when I was about 9 and have loved it ever since. I like how it is aimed at both the kid and adult in all of us! Young Josh Baskin David Moscow goes with his family to a carnival one evening and sees the girl of his dreams. When he finally works up the nerve to talk to her her date appears with her. Then he does not meet the height requirement for the roller coaster ride he wants to go on. So off he goes to a deserted part of the carnival to the Zoltar machine a devil's head encased in glass to make his wish. He wishes he were big. Suffice it to say Josh wakes up the next morning to discover he is an adult Tom Hanks. Mom Mercedes Ruehl thinks he kidnapped her son and calls the police. Josh eventually convinces best friend Billy Jared Rushton that he Josh is his true 13yearold self trapped in a man's body. They take off to New York where Josh manages to get a job as a product tester for a large toy company. He befriends the boss Robert Loggia who likes Josh's understanding of the toys kids really like. However Josh finds himself at odds with Paul John Heard vice president of marketing who perceives Josh's simplistic views as an invasion of Paul's more experienced competitive ways. Never fear as successful coworker Susan Lawerence Elizabeth Perkins finds comfort in Josh's views and company and falls in love with him. But the more Josh experiences the privileges and responsibilities of adulthood the more he longs for his youth again. Should he stay with Susan or find the Zoltar machine and wish to be a kid again?An impressive film about growing up and making wishes. When you're a kid you can't wait to grow up. But when you're an adult you have to make sacrifices and accept responsibility ideal and notsoideal. Also be careful what you wish for as you might get it! A Broadway musical version of Big opened in the mid1990s. The piano dancing sequence is its trademark. I had the privilege to play the role of Paul the John Heard character in a summer musical production and loved it! I highly recommend both the film and the musical!".

	schema:reviewBody "The only thing you need to do to succeed as an adult is act more like a kid.Or so the makers of Big would have you believe. In real life there's a good reason we don't go around playing with toys and dropping water balloons on people. But that doesn't really matter. Big is still an enjoyable indeed magical movie experience.Big is about a 13yearold boy Josh who still plays with toys is not mature enough for girls to take him seriously and not even tall enough to get on a carnival ride. He comes across a mysterious Zoltar machine and wishes to be big. The next day he wakes up to find himself in Tom Hanks's 30yearold body. Josh makes the best of the situation by pretending to be kidnapped and then joining adult society.The only complaint I have about this film is the level of willful suspension of disbelief the audience is expected to suspend. I will buy that a Zoltar machine will grant a kid's wish to become an adult overnight. But when the 13yearold adult goes to apply for a job he only has to fill out a onepage application using a madeup social security number has no resume no references and is hired after stumbling through a 30second interview. Then after a couple chance encounters with the company's owner he is promoted to vicepresident. The kid accomplishes more in a week thanks to his adult body than I have my whole life. Maybe it was just easier to get a job in the '80s.On top of that Josh dates one of his coworkers and manages to get to second base on camera probably to home plate off camera. He will be the only boy in the seventh grade who won't be lying when he says he's gone all the way. Eventually Josh learns that being an adult isn't all fun and games and yearns to be a kid again.The movie is better if you don't think too hard. It's still a fun movie and a minor classic in its own way. Tom Hanks is great in his role. He never seems to forget that he is a kid and all his mannerisms have the nuances of a young boy. The scene where Josh plays a giant keyboard with his boss is one of those iconic moments in cinema that will stick with you your whole life.Big works as a fantasy. It has the charm of an old Frank Capra film. As long as you go with the flow and don't question the movie's logic you will find it thoroughly enjoyable.".

Also his nervousness and restlessness during a marketing meeting and the way he holds up his hand and waits to be called on before making a comment are all childlike actions.

The support acting of Elizabeth Perkins as Joshes love interest Robert Loggia as his boss and farther figure Jared Rushton as Joshes best mate and somewhat more street wise character than Josh and last but not least a brilliant performance from John Heard as Joshes nemesis.

They are witty intelligent and have very original and intriguing ideas Groundhog Day Memento It's a Wonderful Life. Then there are some that have good premises but become tiresome after a while Brewster's Millions The Man with Two Brains and Delirious to some extent. Big fits in the category Good Idea Good Premise Good Actors Intelligent Script and Boring After an Hour.Our story begins with a short teen named Josh who dreams of girls girls sports being older so he can impress girls and girls. So one day at a carnival after being shrugged off by guess who? a girl a miserable and sad Josh makes a wish at a fortune telling machine which slides out a card after your wish that says if it's been granted or not if I remember correctly. So Josh goes home mopes about goes to sleep and when he wakes up he is a thirtysomethingyearold Tom Hanks wonderful if in his part even if he acts like a toddler more than a teenager. After his mother thinks Big Josh is a crazy loon she chases him out of the house with a knife. Later she thinks Josh has been kidnappedkilled after he disappears from home.So Josh with the help of his friend retreats into New York City where he lives in a seedy apartment great scene involving that and being a child is scared witless. After a few days or one day? Josh again with the help of his friend gets a job at a toy company only because the employer likes his goofiness so much. Josh shows up in a cheap disgusting suit and says he went to college at his Middle School.Of course being a child Josh soon beats badman John Heard in toy ideas he comes up with wacky inventions because he is a kid and he knows what kids really like and he unintentionally criticizes Heard's toys. He comes up with all kinds of ideas for toys not out of greed but because he innocently wants to create good toys for kids.Tom Hanks plays his character well if a bit too childish. Let's face it Thirteenyearold boys are old enough to know that when women say they want to sleep over they don't mean they want to have a sleep over party. But aside from the fact that he doesn't act like a thirteenyearold Hanks hits the nail on the head and gives a tremendously innocent and sweet performance. It's just too bad that the main character had to be thirteen or fourteen because Hanks doesn't act thirteen or fourteen. It's still a great performance though.Nowadays this film would probably tag a PG13 rating because not only does a teenager much less an adult use the Fword which was startling to hear in a Tom Hanks PGrated movie but there are also sexual situations involving teenagers. At one point Hanks sleeps with a business associate in her thirties Elizabeth Perkins. Of course this means that since Hanks' character is really a teenager it means the teenager had sex with herwhich implies some controversial subjects. In fact spoiler ahead when Josh Hanks tells the woman he is a teenager she doesn't seem to show any surprise that she has slept with a thirteenyearold though it is implied they have slept together many many times during the course of the film. They even live together at one point. She just seems to be surprised overall not at anything ahem in particular.Sometimes Big seems like it was written by teenagers thinking of cool things they would do if they happened to become adults one day. I guess this works to the film's advantage in a way because if it was written by real adults who have forgotten childhood yearning the film would end up with Josh doing too many adult things and not enough childish things.But right there I contradict myself because I have found that at one point in the film when in a matter of seconds Josh puts behind his childhood and seems to grow up very suddenlysomething I think was done a bit too quickthe film seems to lose its charm. If Josh is a child at heart how could he suddenly in a matter of minutes gain the knowledge of a collegegraduate in business economics if he didn't even finish middle school? I think that bit is done to be symbolicthat all of us have seemed to lose our innocence at a certain age out of expectations of doing so or because of a ruthless world that beats down upon our childish soulsbut it doesn't all fit together too well.The film is funny but like many films with great premises they outstay their welcome ultimately ending in a funny if not memorable film. I really expected a lot from Big because of the big deal everyone made about it but I would say that after a while the gags become too worn out. There's only so many things you can have a teenager do in a grown man's body and unfortunately Big ranking in at about 90 minutes only uses half of what it could have. It seems to search for gags in the latter half but can't find them when they're right in front of them. Perhaps some of this is because Hanks acted too immature in his role even though he gave a tremendous performance or perhaps it is because the writers gave up on the film too quickly. Whatever the reason Big doesn't fulfill all it could have and ultimately ends up just funny and nothing entirely memorable.35 stars John Ulmer".

It was made during a time when other films like this one were made with two other movies Like Father Like Son and Vice Versa also coming out in the time this one was released. Kind of like the science fiction comedy threesome My Science Project Weird Science and Real Genuises that came out at once point in the 80's and the underwater actionhorror set Deepstar Six Leviathon and The Abyss. This one was by far the most successful of the trio of body switching type movies and I do believe Tom Hanks got an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. Which I will admit he did a very good job of playing a grownup who was a child only a couple of days ago but he did not really act like the child he supposedly was. The kid he was supposed to be was just more reserved than the character Tom Hanks seemed to be portraying. He seemed to be portraying a less mature kid with a bit of hyperness to him. The story is about a kid who makes a wish to be big and gets it and there are some nice scenes here and there. I think the movie fell apart though when he got the higher paying job at the company though as after the chop sticks dance the only thing I thought was mildly funny was the scene where he questioned the building robot and when he tried to eat the baby corn. Add to that a cringe worthy scene where he is about to have sex and you really have to imagine my embarrassment as a kid sitting with my mom through that. To many scenes like that not enough really funny scenes and you have your typical dramedy. A comedy that just adds to much plot and not enough laughs to be something I can enjoy. Still most people like it so I would read what others have to say about it before condemning the movie all together based on my review.

	schema:headline " Arguably Tom Hanks' best performance.";
	schema:reviewBody "Big is one of those charming wistful tales that is completely timeless and still manages to entertain audiences even 15 years after it was made. Nominated for Best Actor for 1988 an Oscar he should have won really Tom Hanks gives a brilliant performance in this fabulous fish out of water story. 12 year old Josh Baskin is a typical adolescent obsessed with girls and shirks responsibility whenever he can. One night when he goes to a carnival with his parents he is embarrassed in front of a girl he has a crush on by being excluded from a fairground ride because he is too short.He comes across a machine called Zoltar at the carnival where it apparently grants wishes. Josh makes a simple request I wish I were big. The next morning when Josh wakes up he finds to his amazement he has become a 35 year old man Tom Hanks.With the carnival gone and the Zoltar machine along with it Josh must frantically try to track it down. But his own mother doesn't even recognise him and assumes he kidnapped her son. The only person he can turn to is Billy his best friend Jared Rushton looking like a live action version of Bart Simpson. After convincing him it is Josh the two head to New York where Josh gets a job at a toy company as a computer operator. Until they can get an idea of where the Zoltar machine is and Josh can wish himself back to being a child.Josh quickly manages to become an executive at the company after getting on the good side of the boss MacMillan Robert Loggia in a charming scene at the mall playing on a giant keyboard. His innocence and wisdom allow him to predict what toys children want much to the anger of one of his coworkers Paul John Heard. It also means one of the female executives Susan Elizabeth Perkins falls in love with him because she is attracted to his innocence.Tom Hanks is perfectly suited to the role because he brings with it a goofy charm that shows how Josh can't properly fathom the adult world even though he looks like an adult. He just sees the world through a child's eye and tries to accept things in the best way he can. The film has many memorable moments especially the keyboard scene but Tom Hanks is what makes those scenes memorable. His gawky enthusiasm is greatly accessible and rich in subtlety and nuance. He's got great chemistry with Elizabeth Perkins and its funny because he can't quite grasp at first what it is she wants from their relationship. One of the funniest exchanges is when they go to his apartment which looks like a gigantic teenager's bedroomSusan I mean I like you and I want to spend the night with you. Josh Do you mean sleep over? Susan Well yeah. Josh OK. But I get to be on top.The fact he is talking about a bunk bed and their wires are seriously crossed is what makes that scene so funny. In some respects the adult world has some connotations with the world Josh is used to. Paul is like a bully and antagonises Josh every chance he gets. The scene where they're playing racquet ball is a prime example.Big arrayed a quite impressive number of up and coming talents both in front of and behind the camera. As well as Penny Marshall in the directors chair the screenplay is overseen by Anne Spielberg sister of...well I think you know who and Gary Ross future director of the extremely underrated Pleasantville. Handling the cinematography is Barry Sonnenfeld before he directed classics like Get Shorty and The Addams Family. Look out for future Simpsons writer James L. Brooks on the credits too!Wisely the filmmakers steered clear of outright mawkishness and over sentimentality and the audience isn't patronised by the material. There is something to appreciate no matter what age you are although there are some scenes that may be unsuitable for young children e.g. Josh's implied sex scene with Susan and one use of the F word.Big is still a lot of fun and the ending is bittersweet when Josh must say goodbye to Susan. That scene right at the end always brings a smile to my face and must certainly go down as one of the most endearing and magical scenes in cinema history.Big has withstood the test of time and is far superior to Forrest Gump another film about a simple man's place in history. Big has more charm and doesn't manipulate you into liking it like Forrest Gump did. Big is a truly magical film and Tom Hanks' career just went from strength to strength after that.In 20 years time there will be legends about Big.".

	schema:reviewBody "Big is an American Englishlanguage movie from 1988 so this one will already have its 30th anniversary next year. It i maybe the most known work by director Penny Marshall an experienced actress as well. The script is by Gary Ross and you will find many known films in his body of work after all he has 4 Oscar noms such as The Hunger Games. His cowriter was Anne Spielberg sister of Steven who received her very first and so far only Oscar nomination for this 100minute film. But the star is of course lead actor Tom Hanks. This film brought Hanks a Golden Globe win and his very first Oscar nomination. In here he plays a 13yearold boy in the body of a grown man. The premise is one that could have gone crucially wrong actually if handled with less competence but Hanks is hitting all the right notes. See for yourself what he does in here and you will most likely agree. Hanks' performance also results in this film being truly memorable in what it teaches the individual audience member namely to stay young at heart even if it is not really a voluntary decision for the central character. There are two scenes in particular that emphasize this message. The first would be the piano scene which is probably the best from the entire film and a moment of true movie magic. It is probably also the reason why Robert Loggia received some awards attention here. The second would be the trampoline scene which is basically a slightly weaker but still pretty great version of the piano scene. Another favorite scene for me was the fight with whom you could maybe consider the main antagonist in this film. It shows how the latter is also still very much a child but not in a good way while Hanks' character's actions are somewhat justifiable by his real age. This also shows that the protagonist is not a hero who wants to help everybody in finding happiness in life and embracing their inner self. They need to want it themselves mostly.This may be a fantasy film to some extent but it is really much more of a comedydrama. The references about the reason why he changes i.e. this strange machine are kept at a minimum early on in the film and very late. There is no talk about other wishes being granted although honestly this machine could have been used for several sequels. But maybe it is a good thing that it wasn't. I also want to talk a bit about the ending. I really wished for the woman deciding to transform into a child as well but I think they probably made the right decision. Another reason why this is not really fantasy film and Hanks' character is also in the center of it all. But even if my wish was not granted I very much liked the ending. It felt authentic and realistic and that's more important than a feelgood happy ending. Not that this was an unhappy ending. not at all. But really hoping for one particular ending also shows us how much we cared about the characters and their relationships in here. I think this film is a tremendous success and for Hanks probably on par with his very best career efforts. It maybe a bit of a oneman show but if this one man is as convincing as in here there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. A mustsee and my new favorite film from 1988. Of course the script is really good too. Only one example the ways in which the kids react towards the grownups The best friend tells the protagonist how he looks like  as a grownup or the best friend is disgusted by the protagonist's girlfriend. This is exactly the way kids would react in this scenario. Very well done. No surprise everybody loves Hanks with films like this in his body of work.".

	schema:headline " Could be a sleeper!";
	schema:reviewBody "I think Disney misfired with the very poor The Pacifier and had higher expectations from the Herbie movie. But they'll do surprisingly well with this kids flick I think. Perhaps we even have a sleeper here.When I saw the Sky High trailer I thought I was going to see the next installment of Spy Kids. Okay there are a lot of crazy special effects in this movie but the story is actually driven by the nice performances by almost all the actors instead of lots of SFX.The film is about young Will Stronghold charming performance by Michael Angarano son of the two most popular and successful superheroes in the world The Commander Kurt Russell and Jetstream Kelly Preston. Will is about to go to Sky High a school especially founded for superheroes but there's one problem he doesn't own any superpower. Instead of being a superhero his highest goal seems to be the one of sidekick. So how can he survive at school being the son of the world most famous super duo? And how will his parents react when they hear the bad news?Sky High is a very entertaining family movie with lots of good hearted humor. Early in the movie Bruce Campbell oh yeah! steals the show as exhero now teacher Sonic Boomer who has a 'Sorting Hat' scene in which he determines which student will go to hero class and which ones will study for sidekick. Kurt Russell gives a great tongueincheek performance as proud daddy who thinks it's great that his son defeats all the bullies at school but has to condemn it in front of his wife. And that's the opinion of a someone who isn't actually a fan of the actor himself. The original little ideas dry out after the first half of the movie but who said that all family movies should have Oscar power?Sky High is a movie about friendship falling in love with the wrong girl falling in love with the right girl and trying to succeed in your parents footsteps. Very entertaining for the kids and some nice laughs for parents too during the Sidekick lessons given by exAll American Boy for instance lots a references to the Robin from the Batman TVseries. Great 80's soundtrack as well with covers from songs by The Smiths Talking Heads Tears for Fears and even Till Tuesday and Modern English.".

	onyx:emotionText "I think Disney misfired with the very poor The Pacifier and had higher expectations from the Herbie movie. But they'll do surprisingly well with this kids flick I think. Perhaps we even have a sleeper here.When I saw the Sky High trailer I thought I was going to see the next installment of Spy Kids. Okay there are a lot of crazy special effects in this movie but the story is actually driven by the nice performances by almost all the actors instead of lots of SFX.The film is about young Will Stronghold charming performance by Michael Angarano son of the two most popular and successful superheroes in the world The Commander Kurt Russell and Jetstream Kelly Preston. Will is about to go to Sky High a school especially founded for superheroes but there's one problem he doesn't own any superpower. Instead of being a superhero his highest goal seems to be the one of sidekick. So how can he survive at school being the son of the world most famous super duo? And how will his parents react when they hear the bad news?Sky High is a very entertaining family movie with lots of good hearted humor. Early in the movie Bruce Campbell oh yeah! steals the show as exhero now teacher Sonic Boomer who has a 'Sorting Hat' scene in which he determines which student will go to hero class and which ones will study for sidekick. Kurt Russell gives a great tongueincheek performance as proud daddy who thinks it's great that his son defeats all the bullies at school but has to condemn it in front of his wife.

I went into this movie expecting a cheesy kiddy movie and ended up spending the next hour and a half being seriously entertained. The story is about a group of freshmen in their first few months at a super hero high school named Sky High. There are all the familiar struggles of high school such as fitting in finding a date and choosing between the friends you have known and loved your whole life and the new popular crowd. These high school newbies have the additional dilemma of learning to use their powers and live up to the reputations that their parents have established as super heroes. The movie is sweet without sending the viewers into a diabetic coma and has a great message. The theater I was in was also full of little ones who I never heard a peep out of! The movie is a great treat for the entire family and will make a great break from the heat or a rainy day activity!".

The acting again not an Oscar performance out of anyone was clean and sincere very believable. The sets and special effects were well good. The diversity and conflict between students of the school once again... good. There were some very witty and dry remarks about high school life as well. Good writing. I say the most surprising thing about this film was that it was just plain old fun! It had the patrons laughing as well as I. My 7 year old and my 3 year old loved it and it was still adult enough with a strong enough plot to keep the parents interested as well. All in all it made for a fun afternoon.".

The plot and theme borrow a lot from the Incredibles which is a good thing because I liked it the best of Pixar's flicks Also you might think Hogwarts when you see the classes except the high school floats in the sky and rather than potions and avoiding the dark forces the student learn how to be superhero sidekicks and how to build ray guns in science class.

High school angst is then thrown into the mix as Will and his new group of friends headed up by the typical girl best friend Layla Danielle Panabaker are told they don't fit the superhero mold and become sidekicks otherwise known as the losers of the school. I loved the idea of this movie and the people in it seemed to be having a great time. The roles were cast perfectly and it was easy to believe everyone. A few favorites were Warren Peace Steven Strait Layla and Zach Nicholas Braun. Sure the plot was a tad predictable both in the superhero plot and in the teen drama area but because of the setting and the mix it made it still worth seeing. Also anything that has Bruce Campbell who plays Coach Boomer is automatically quirky enough to be given a chance. Of course the world ends up in danger and the underdogs must fight to save it but for once I wasn't upset that I knew it all.Disney needed a hit as the past few movies it's put out that were live action failed to do much. I think Sky High is it. Action for the boys cute boys and drama for the girls and Kurt Russell for the moms great family movie. All I can end with is I can't wait for it to come out on video.".

It has all the standard elements of a teenage movie dorky male character female friend who really loves him group of nerdy misfits that save the day high school tough guy high school bullies prom night dance attractive teenage girl that is desired by all the guys etc However the formula works with the superhero aspect added and combine to create a fun entertaining movie. The special effects for the super powers really blend in well and the actors all do a great job both adult and teenagers alike. The pacing was good and the flow of the movie went well.A downside though is that the movie was pretty predictable at least for me anyway. I was already figuring the identity and plan of the villain long before it was shown in the movie. But that's just me.Overall this was a thoroughly fun movie and good for all ages. This movie isn't going to change your life bring about world peace or be titled Best Movie Ever but it is a fun movie to watch and entertain.I definitely recommend this movie. I give it a 7.5 out of 10.".

Good for kids and their parents there were definitely kids and parents laughing alike. I think this movie contains some actors who are really starting to blossom into their careers at the same time Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston add some familiar faces to this charming movie. You like superheroes I don't think you'll be disappointed. My only criticism would be that some of the effects were a little cheesy. However the kids in the audience did not seem to mind.".

	schema:headline " A family movie that actually fun for the WHOLE family!!!!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a real treat. As the father of 2 young kids I can't tell you how many family movies I've gone to that were in fact kids movies. You know the type of movie I mean the one that holds little or no entertainment value for anyone whose age contains two digits. I won't mention any names....The Pacifier Are We There Yet...that would be indiscreet. Anyway...Sky High is a revelation. Not only as a family movie but also as a superhero movie. The superhero movie has become very popular again but there have been some problems with some of them. They are either not any fun to watch Batman Begins or they are TOO lighthearted and you feel nothing for the characters Fantastic Four. But here we get a story that is fun exciting and humorous but we get to watch characters we actually CARE about. We want to see where these kids are headed and what is going to happen to them next. It also deals with the clique situation that every kid that attends school deals with. Granted it does it in a fantasy setting but the point comes through crystal clear. The kids are not the typical kids that you see in family movies. Usually they are uninteresting little runts that we are expected to like just because they're cute kids. No sir these are kids with PERSONALITY!!!! They are individuals and we are given a chance to get to know all of them. But don't worry parents as I said this movie works for the WHOLE family. The adults in this movie are a scream. They may be superheroes or hero support but they are the ones that WE get to identify with. The parents who have the biggest dreams for their kids and want nothing more that to see them succeed. And when the parents in this movie are forced to look at the fact that their son might not be able to live their dreams they realize that he has his own plans and dreams and they must support him in his quest. Kurt Russell Kelly Preston Lynda Carter and Bruce Campbell are all outstanding in this movie. Then there is the action. It's pitch perfect for this movie. Fun without being cartoony and exciting without being violent or brutal. And for anyone like me that grew up in the 80's...you're gonna LOVE the whole John Hughestype feel to the movie right down the covers of classic 80's tunes like Everybody Wants To Rule The World. It isn't very often that you can take your whole family to a movie then leave 100 minutes later and honestly say that EVERYBODY had a great time. Here is the exception go see it make it successful and change it from the exception to the rule.".

We could all relate to the main character who had to struggle with finding out what he had and deciding what he would do with it who his friends were where his loyalties lie and how much integrity to demonstrate.The violent scenes were mostly slapstick or cartoonish enough so as not to distress small children I say mostly because there is some violence but no blood or gore just people smashing into or through things etc..I especially liked that Lynda Carter gave a nod to her Wonder Woman character and that Clois Leachman  one of my favorite actresses  was involved once again with superheroes  and with Lynda Carter too Clois was Lynda's mother in the original Wonder Woman movie.Also although only caricatures the scriptwriters and kid actors were true to the typicalities of high school. The social divisions the crushes the nerds the cool kids  it was all there. And the only annoying characters were supposed to be annoying.I sincerely wish the script had been better written so that the actors had had more to work with. But they did their best with what they had and overall it was just great good clean fun  so rare in today's movie world. Unlike Willy Wonka's current incarnation there was no odd bite or double entente's to worry about. Take the kids  especially your inner child  and enjoy!".

It was a little predictable but held my attention and interest nonetheless.The performances by the young actors were fantastic they have a good future ahead of them. The adults also did exceptionally well and really helped capture the fun young spirit of the film. I loved Layla and how she really fought against the HeroSidekick separation...as well as the other parts of the film which try to parallel regular high school against Sky High School. Even as heroes the main thing they have to fight for is just to fit in and break the typical groups of high school.It was very funny and the vague references to other superhero comicsfilmsshows were great if you could catch them. There's enough action a little romance and some great heartfelt scenes which all mixed together well. A great movie!".

What adds to it is the endless list of very appropriate cameos including two Kids In The Hall stars and the forementioned Bruce Campbell. As mom and dad Kelly Preston and Kurt Russel are hysterical. They capture the cheesy comic book attitude perfectly. As Layla the best friend the stunningly beautiful Danniel Panabaker gives an impressive performance. Michael Angarano plays the lead Will Stronghold. While his performance is lacking on the believable side his facial features and natural look lend itself to the character.

More than a few obstacles keep Bernard from his dream world.

Even minor cast members like Dolph Sweet do a good job and there are great little sequences like Kastner's after dark explorations of the New York City streets. But unlike Herald and Maude Coppola says nothing with this film consequently it ends up as a classic case of the whole being considerably less than the sum of its parts.I am not in love with Coppola as a director but even those who are will acknowledge the incredible distance between his good stuff and the vast majority of his films.

	schema:reviewBody "This film sadly has been lost in the forgetfulness of time. I happily found a copy of it on the Internet and just watched it after waiting 47years since my last viewing in 1966. It was a fresh and funny as that day I first saw it as a crazy hormonedriven teen. As I watched it I marveled on just how ahead of its time it actually was and how many great films have stolen so many of its artistic riffs so many of them redolent of the Swinging Sixties and all of the wild drugfueled looniness that characterized that brief period of time. I realized that without this seminal film there probably wouldn't ever have been a Graduate or even a Dustin Hoffman. To see the great character actors who have gone on to spectacular careers in the many years since was especially thrilling to see including Geraldine Page Rip Torn Tony Bill Julie Harris would there ever have been a Thing in The Men in Black without a Miss Thing curiously starring a much older Rip Torn? and the always solid Karen Black in her first screen role. It's absolutely amazing how many of Coppola's early films have launched such stellar careers. But perhaps this wonderful film owes so much of its depth to the costarring role portrayed by the luminous Elizabeth Hartman who's twisted and soulful performance remains one for the ages. If you smoke pot or occasionally do harder things that have a propensity to expand the mind this is suggested viewing in any case. This movie wonder is a perfectly hilarious perfecting engaging perfect little film. Catch it if you can.P.S. I nearly forgot to give Honorable Mention to the superbly crafted soundtrack by the iconic 60's pop group The Lovin' Spoonful. Long before it was fashionable for rock groups to create music for film the Spoonful did it and did it more than justice... it was perfect. I just downloaded the song Amy's Tune Lonely and am enjoying it as I write this review... ah for the halcyon daze of my youth.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is pretty much a lousy unfunny movie but it's got Karen Allen and Rip Torn and Geraldine Page and is directed by Francis Coppola. The movie moves and makes absolutely no sense. There is no way to relate to the totally geeky kid who stars in this flick. However much of it was filmed outdoors in New York City in 1966 and for those of us who live here the difference between then and now is stark and makes the flick worth watching. For example the kid roller skates to work and one scene is quite extended and rolls through lots of familiar Manhattan streets. The most shocking scened is when he goes past Penn Station which no longer exists. At the moment when the film was shot the front facade of Penn Station was still standing and behind it Madison Square Garden was rising.I froze that frame to stare at it. I couldn't believe that such a moment in architecture actually existed leave alone be preserved on film. The scenes in Central Park are fascinating to compare the brown and yellow grassdirt of yesteryear with the verdancy of today's park. The park was on a downward cycle at that time later to be saved by the Central Park Conservancy.It's wild and raucous and dopey but it shows a great deal of creativity with settings and a camera that moves with or against the actors. It's skillful and fascinating and utterly meaningless but it's history.".

After watching it I think I have a grasp on a possible answer for why it's drifted into obscurity. I'm not saying it's a bad movie. The movie does capture the era quite well those wanting to learn about styles and other period details will find the movie handy. Also Coppola directs the movie with great energy throughout from bizarre camera angles to offbeat performances.But while the movie is directed with gusto it doesn't manage to mask a big problem with the movie. The first half of the movie is really slow going with the story. Sure the direction hides this thin story for a while but eventually you realize that not much of substance is actually happening. Things do start moving after the halfway point or so but it's kind of hard to get involved with what's happening because none of the characters are really all that sympathetic. Even the hero fails to arouse sympathy because he is for the most part a real spineless wimp. The fact that all the performers give really broad performances doesn't help. In the end the movie can only be recommended to people with real special interest in Hollywood filmmaking from this period and even they might find it tough going at times.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most famous movie to look at the younger generation's disillusionment with the American way of life is The Graduate but Francis Ford Coppola's You're a Big Boy Now also offers some insight. The young protagonist is a character very much like Ben Braddock born into an affluent family that plans for him to be a big success. But this young man actively seeks out a new life and he befriends a gogo dancer...but that's not all.A lot of the humor is cutaway humor. In the end the movie isn't a masterpiece but has some funny stuff. It's sort of a cross between the zany comedies that dominated the '60s and a Woody Allen movie. One of the most interesting things is the soundtrack. The Lovin' Spoonful did the music and it includes some songs  among them Amy's Theme  that I had heard but never knew whence they came.I recommend the movie. It's a perceptive look at the youth culture and also at mid'60s New York. We even get shots of movie theaters running noted movies of the era! It's really a movie that you gotta love. I bet that when The Godfather debuted people were shocked that it was directed by the same man who directed You're a Big Boy Now.And remember wooden legs and aggressive chickens.".

So the theme as much as there is one is very much a 60's one how to break free of stifling convention. In Bernard's case it's more like simply understanding what it is that's stifling him.The biggest mystery to me is how FFC assembled such an outstanding Broadway castHarris Paige Tornfor a Master's Thesis. And who's inspired touch is that attack chicken that bedevils the girls or the Neanderthal cop who's never off duty. Anyway if you're not insisting on a conventional style and are willing to put up with some pretty selfindulgent passages the movie may have genuine appeal especially for those either nostalgic or curious about the freewheeling 60's.".

As with The Graduate there is the sensation of driving for something new other than the conformist disappointing world of the socially safe adults. By now though we've hopefully become tired of the increasingly low common denominator movies about the induction of horny young men into the mores of sex. But first of all this light quirky sophomore directorial effortfollowing his requisite Roger Corman warmup debutwas the pioneer of the bunch.In late 1966 Coppola was a wunderkind green out of UCLA and at the same time his second film is of the most base commercial genre it reflects Coppola's more scholarly influences incorporating selfreflexive formal strategies originally conceived of in the European New Waves and thus well received by critics and the public alike. This I think is at the hub of most new waves in this country's cinema. Tarantino and Rodriguez made debuts twentyfive years later by taking on marketable genre plot exercises by fueling them an inimitable mix of influences from their encyclopedic knowledge of cinema. Their favorite genres were of the raw gritty grind house era that was to take advantage of the breaking of ground and opening of doors Coppola and his peers were revving up to do when he came onto the scene with You're a Big Boy Now.This and The Graduate the more mature film that would follow concern young men and older women. They both spring much entertainment from the nebbishy youth's blunders before the luckless boys quickly finish botching up and triumph over this chump called virginity. Nichols served Buck Henry's sharp sophisticated understated screenplay by creating the most refined comic atmosphere with brilliant cinematography. Coppola rather simply enjoys himself as director and his film is awash with recycled sight gags lively performances and a spirited soundtrack by the Lovin' Spoonful. I can't decide whether he's a kid in the sandbox his first time behind the camera or a bull in a china shop as filmmakers are when they are passionately in love with the films they grew up with the filmmaking process and film period.The bungling young man this time is Peter Kastner. He's ambushed consecutively by a cartoonishly emasculating string a caricatured female types a don'twearshoesafterLaborDaystyle mother a jazzy landlady and a chopsbusting brunet. Doubted by his father and deeply wounded by one of the sexy trifecta in due course he's on speaking terms solely with the family dog named Dog. Yeah. It's hit or miss. Coppola is often too selfconscious about being charming. His hero is too blameless and starryeyed. The plot is too random. Mike Nichols was able to illustrate in The Graduate exactly how many promises this broad premise makes and was also able to do that with such masterful restraint and technique. But hey before Mike Nichols' masterpiece how was anyone to see that? Meanwhile we're entrusted with the query of how perfectly decent attractive fellows like Big Boy and Benjamin manage to reach their mid20s in such faralong phases of inexperience. Maybe they drone bemusing little maxims to themselves and keep busy with work and studies until they're assailed by the Mrs. Robinsons of the world. I can see how that was the prevailing male fantasy in media back then and why shows and movies have continued to have a shade of underdog in their young male romantic leads in the ensuing generations from these guys to the John Cusack John Hughes and spring break movies to Jason Biggs' penetrating breakthrough role to the Judd Apatow comedies of today.".

Coppola rather simply enjoys himself as director and his film is awash with recycled sight gags lively performances and a spirited soundtrack by the Lovin' Spoonful. I can't decide whether he's a kid in the sandbox his first time behind the camera or a bull in a china shop as filmmakers are when they are passionately in love with the films they grew up with the filmmaking process and film period.The bungling young man this time is Peter Kastner. He's ambushed consecutively by a cartoonishly emasculating string a caricatured female types a don'twearshoesafterLaborDaystyle mother a jazzy landlady and a chopsbusting brunet. Doubted by his father and deeply wounded by one of the sexy trifecta in due course he's on speaking terms solely with the family dog named Dog. Yeah. It's hit or miss. Coppola is often too selfconscious about being charming. His hero is too blameless and starryeyed. The plot is too random. Mike Nichols was able to illustrate in The Graduate exactly how many promises this broad premise makes and was also able to do that with such masterful restraint and technique. But hey before Mike Nichols' masterpiece how was anyone to see that? Meanwhile we're entrusted with the query of how perfectly decent attractive fellows like Big Boy and Benjamin manage to reach their mid20s in such faralong phases of inexperience. Maybe they drone bemusing little maxims to themselves and keep busy with work and studies until they're assailed by the Mrs. Robinsons of the world. I can see how that was the prevailing male fantasy in media back then and why shows and movies have continued to have a shade of underdog in their young male romantic leads in the ensuing generations from these guys to the John Cusack John Hughes and spring break movies to Jason Biggs' penetrating breakthrough role to the Judd Apatow comedies of today.";

	schema:reviewBody "Gokusen is based on a Japanese manga which became a highly popular television drama series and going by the response of the audience it's likely that many fans have turned up in droves just to catch the latest installment of their favourite inspirational teacher Yankumi played in quite a schizophrenic manner by Yukie Naakama befitting of the character who's balancing her school life with the legacy of who she actually is.Which is being the heir to the Oedo yakuza family as granddaughter of the boss primed to take over the family triad business if not for her desire to live her dream which is to teach. In the television series starring just about the same cast who made it to this film extension plenty of comedy stem from her attempts at keeping her true identity a secret despite lapses sometimes in using Gangster lingo which we do get glimpses of here but being lost in translation. Simply put this story is based upon a typical tale of an inspirational teacher who never stops believing in her students no matter how hopeless they seem in their academics. We don't get to see a lot of classroom lessons here almost zilch but what we do get is how Yankumi through her sincere actions and care for her students win her delinquent charges over and impart some important life lessons which will probably propel them further in life if not setting them out on a clear strong foundation. Two simple values become what's core and that's never to lie and to live life with pride and dignity.But that doesn't means she's a softie O Captain My Captain. When push comes to shove her innate abilities to solve things in gangster style exaggerated of course for comedic effect means she's never one to shy away from fights especially completing those started by her students. Metaphorically it's a fight for her students to wake up their ideas to keep them from being bullied and to be safe from harm. For her young age she behaves somewhat like a mother hen ever protective of her charges extending the notion of being a teacher for life to all her students the entire three generations worth which get their respective air time in this feature film.And that naturally meant that the narrative is split quite evenly one that addresses her current pupil's problems with a biker gang one to solve her exstudent's alleged involvement with drug trafficking which formed the bulk all the way to the finale and one of her earliest students being posted to the Akadou High School as a trainee teacher where she is currently teaching thinking that she had inspired him to follow in her footsteps. The film felt that it's providing some closure to some of the earlier drama series especially in the epilogue where it takes some pains to bring back prominent cast members for a quick canonical updating session.Those not acquainted with either the television or manga series may feel a little left out when obvious references to those material get made although it doesn't dictate that prior background knowledge is prerequisite to enjoy this. To do so you've to accept that there is room for plenty of quirky over the top comedy ranging from deliberate overacting especially with Yukie Nakama's act cute antics to cheesy sound effects that made it look all too cartoony.Definitely one for the fans with nonfans able to join in the fun and probably get their interest piqued in what they've missing out on thus far.".

However the characters grow on you after couple of episodes and it always offered great inspiration.The usual format may have worked for 12episodelong dorama series but it failed in movie as expected. Limited screen time makes character development difficult in fact only one student contributed to the story in the newest class and forced melodrama.I must admit that I was impressed how many upandcoming and popular young actors today are alumni of Gokusen series though. It was impressive they got actors like Oguri Shun Narimiya Hiroki Hayami Mokomichi Koike Teppei and Koide Keisuke to cameo in this film. As far as I can remember Matsumoto Jun and Akanishi Jin are the only main characters missing.In the end the movie was just a fan service for existing Gokusen fans with primary purpose of showing all the pretty boy's faces for fangirls.

I simply do not have the time nor care to dedicate myself to sitting through all the episodes every week for an undetermined course of time till the last episode of the last season. I prefer movies. So I watched the 1st episode of this series just for an idea and I liked it but again I could not dedicate myself to it. But I agree with the review from 8thSin from TokyoToronto. There's two things I remember that made me want to watch the film the silly adorable humor of the teacher...and the sexy male faces. But the melodrama is a bit eye rolling it's another reason I avoid drama series. If I do watch series it's sitcoms free of sentimentality. But I think I have read and heard constantly that recipes for success in Korea and Japan's shows is dramatic tearful moments and the music to go along with it. But it doesn't work for me so I think that the very...VERY attractive guys in this movie VERY was to keep at least the females watching to compensate for a poor plot and idea. I can imagine this was released in Japanese cinemastheaters and made a lot of money off guys getting dragged to see it and stuck sitting next to their squealing girlfriend or sister or even mom the entire viewing. Because I even turned the film off. Not even the cute faces could hold me. I tried. But I couldn't endure it any longer. It was funny laugh out loud funny. Until about 40 minutes in it just became dull. If I hear her say my precious students one more time I'm going to throw this laptop somewhere. Did I mention there are so many sexy faces? It's completely irrelevant to what I'm saying but whatever. The uneven balance between silly exaggerated humor and tear jerking melodrama and mediocre martial arts also threw me off. This film was simply like a long TVepisode.I also do not know why she loved her students so much no offense to children. But you don't just love your students to the point of risking your life and job for them. Especially if they're involved in gangs and crime. As realistically portrayed in Memories of Matsuko. However maybe it's just her character her personality but this teddy bear persona that honestly this entire series and film gave to members of the yakuzamafia was...strange. However the yakuza in Japan do not like to be portrayed as monstrous villains. Word on the street is that they ironically rage if you do that.So all in all if you like cute guys who coif and cry a lot drug dealers who get beat up by a dorky clumsy female teacher and yakuza who learn to love then have at it.".

The story was a Pulp Fictionesque wanna be missing that all important story element. These characters are flat and manufactured with no real goal.

The names in the cast are the hit men Burt Reynolds and William Forsythe who do their best but are defeated by a lousy script and poor direction.

All the genre you can think of you'll find it there. Name it melodrama action comedy romance music fantasy. Raj Kapoor craftily weaved them in the almost three hourlong classic.Behind the melodrama is the social commentary. The conflict between a person versus the orthodox beliefs of the milieu is a recurring theme each of us face in everyday life. Pressures to adhere to the norm led the main character to his plight. Children growing up in squalid areas is an important issue tackled.The musical sequences showed the movie's multifaceted nature. It showed references to Chaplin RodgersHammerstein and the like. Particularly amazing is the dream sequence in an east meets west setting.

	schema:headline " One of the most popular films of all time in India";
	schema:reviewBody "Musicals in America in their heyday were mostly about the lives of prominent show business personalities or small town middle class Americana never about the outcast or the urban slum dweller. This is not the case with the films of Indian director Raj Kapoor especially in Awaara a 1951 film and the later Boot Polish. These films call attention to the less fortunate and in the case of Awaara the vagabond whose life of crime is the inevitable outcome of growing up in the slums. In Awaara Kapoor's real father Prithviraj Kapoor plays a heartless judge who accuses his pregnant wife Leela Chitnis of infidelity after she was kidnapped by bandits and throws her out of his home the logic of this eludes me since she was already pregnant when kidnapped. The stern judge staunchly believes that a thief's son will always be a thief and a good man's son will always turn out good. In a series of flashbacks the film dramatizes the unfortunate consequences of this belief system. Raju played by the director Raj Kapoor as an adult and by his brother Sashi Kapoor as a child is born on the streets and grows up in the slums.Under the guidance of a ruthless bandit named Jagga K. N. Singh he turns to stealing to help support his mother. Raj has little to comfort him except for a picture hanging on the bare walls of his house of Rita his childhood sweetheart played by the stunning Nargis a real life lover of Kapoor. The romance between Raj and Rita is one of the central motifs of the film and the chemistry between the two is electric. This is especially evident in the boat scene where she performs an exotic dance to the Dum Bhar song and after she calls him a junglee savage and he slaps her in an incident that serves to bring them closer together.Raju the tramp is forced to live on his wits but does so with humor and a Chaplinesque charm. When he finds out the true circumstances of his childhood however he sets out to get revenge against his father the judge and ends up facing a charge of attempted murder in the judge's own courtroom. Rita a lawyer herself defends him as she promised she would years ago. She puts the judge on the witness stand and asks pointed questions about how he condemned his wife and child to a lifetime of poverty. Rita holds him and society responsible for the conditions that led Raju to commit his crime and asks the judge to forgive him and admit that Raju is his son. Raju in turn offers an impassioned plea to the court to punish him as a criminal but not to neglect the conditions that gave rise to his life of crime. In the end a very moving scene of attempted reconciliation between father and son had me wiping away the tears.Awaara is reminiscent of both 40s filmnoir with its dark cobblestone streets and menacing shadows and in its social conscience of the great Italian neorealists like de Sica. But basically Awaara is still in the Bollywood tradition that means drama romance music comedy and action  all put together in a total package to appeal to a wide audience. With great songs and dances amazing dream sequences style and panache strong drama and an inspiring message it is not surprising that Awaara became one of the most popular films in Indian cinematic history. It is one of my favorites as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw it as a kid sometime in 1957 or 1958. I was marveled and for a long time the movie remained in my heart. I was humming the Awaara Hum all the time I was imagining myself as Raj I was thinking at Rita. I started to consider myself a grown up after all also Raj started in the movie as a kid and became a grown up. I knew now his songs I knew so all I needed to be a grown up.Well I was a kid it seems that also grown ups were in love with Awara someone told me of a respectable physician who had been seen hanging around and humming Awaara Hum.And this was what was happening those times in Romania. And in Bulgaria. And in the Soviet Union. And in Turkey. Kids and grown ups were humming the songs imagining themselves as Raj unconditionally in love for Rita kids considering themselves grown ups grown ups behaving like kids.The life of this movie was becoming a legend.I watched again the movie a couple of days ago on TV. Of course it gave me an immense pleasure and I began jokingly this time while clearly happy to sing Awaara Hum again.Did I notice this time something that I had missed years ago? Well this time I was able to examine the fascination conveyed by this movie surrounding this movie. I was able to examine it as I was now detached long time ago I had been immersed in the fascinating universe of Awara.I was able this time to observe that the fascination was not coming from the plot it was from somewhere beyond. The actor playing the father of Raj was also in real life the father of Raj Kapoor. The same with the actor playing Raj as kid he was the brother of Raj Kapoor. As for Nargis the great actress playing Rita she was in real life the great love of Raj Kapoor. And all the rest of the cast was infused with the chemistry among these guys their reciprocal chemistry their chemistry for the cinematic art.I think at the secret of this movie it has a secret no doubt about. You see in 1949 the Japanese Ozu had created Late Spring followed by Early Summer in 1951 the same year Raj Kapoor created Awara I consider Ozu one of the greatest masters of cinema in 1956 the Indian Satyajit Ray would create Pather Panchali which is maybe one of the most profound movies of all times followed by Aparajito and then by The World of Apu. Well Awara stands courageously in my preferences among the movies of these titans and this because it has a secret of his own.Many noted the Chaplinesque dimension of the tramp created by Raj Kapoor in Awara. And clearly Kapoor had Charlot in his mind the same humorous courage to stand against all odds. But it's not only Charlot in Awara you feel there also the air of films noirs while the romance saturated with music has a surrealist poetry.And maybe here is where the secret lies this movie was created with the pleasure for creating cinema with the passion to succeed in bringing on the screen a perfectly popular movie. If you want to understand what Bollywood means you should see this movie from 1951. A movie openly looking for popularity because made by someone in love for the people someone loving to tell stories to enjoy the attendance. Awara has a clear social message but as someone has very well observed it is not a popular movie made to convey the message rather the opposite the message serves to convey a popular movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a classic Bollywood movie and seminal Raj Kapoor  Nargis vehicle forcing home to the audience all manner of stereotypes prejudices and assumptions before systematically dismantling them all with a sledgehammer. It was another of RK's successful and respectful attempts at mass entertainment mixed with mass education generations later it's all so obvious that unfortunately we can lose sight of how much good it did at the time and just how wellintentioned it was.I was watching the colourful Suraj a while ago and was reminded of old black and white Awara which I hadn't seen in decades  it's another take on once a bandit's son always a bandit's son or Blood vs Destiny. Delinquent wastrel and felon Raj is the kicked about son of a strict oldfashioned judge played by Prithviraj which neither of them realise he and childhood friend Nargis who is now the judge's ward fall in love and well it spirals out of control for everyone. Is it Nature or is it Nurture that has made him a proud tramp? Some lovely noirish photography and atmospheric flashback scenes complement a melodramatic storyline and there's even time for an admirable dreamnightmare sequence. It's a marvellous if very contrived film with plenty of ideas some tremendous images and great music by Shankar  Jaikishan as it is but as usual for me whenever the incomparable Lata sings it's turned into something even more special. Favourite bits Nargis never looked lovelier or more iconic throughout but Aa Jao Tadapte Hain Arman with RK stroking her hair takes top prize the literally dreamy and fascinating Tere Bina Aag Yeh Chandni and RK does his anthem Awara Hoon too. According to Lata it took a whole night to record the music for the dream sequence.So many sincere films made over the last 50 years have no morality at the most charitable most don't even know the meaning of the word so what's so bad about a film having too much? Nothing wrong at all with Good beating Evil! Imho even though poverty still breeds crime while Our Betters still deny it Raj Kapoor's finest film.".

It was another of RK's successful and respectful attempts at mass entertainment mixed with mass education generations later it's all so obvious that unfortunately we can lose sight of how much good it did at the time and just how wellintentioned it was.I was watching the colourful Suraj a while ago and was reminded of old black and white Awara which I hadn't seen in decades  it's another take on once a bandit's son always a bandit's son or Blood vs Destiny. Delinquent wastrel and felon Raj is the kicked about son of a strict oldfashioned judge played by Prithviraj which neither of them realise he and childhood friend Nargis who is now the judge's ward fall in love and well it spirals out of control for everyone. Is it Nature or is it Nurture that has made him a proud tramp? Some lovely noirish photography and atmospheric flashback scenes complement a melodramatic storyline and there's even time for an admirable dreamnightmare sequence. It's a marvellous if very contrived film with plenty of ideas some tremendous images and great music by Shankar  Jaikishan as it is but as usual for me whenever the incomparable Lata sings it's turned into something even more special. Favourite bits Nargis never looked lovelier or more iconic throughout but Aa Jao Tadapte Hain Arman with RK stroking her hair takes top prize the literally dreamy and fascinating Tere Bina Aag Yeh Chandni and RK does his anthem Awara Hoon too. According to Lata it took a whole night to record the music for the dream sequence.So many sincere films made over the last 50 years have no morality at the most charitable most don't even know the meaning of the word so what's so bad about a film having too much? Nothing wrong at all with Good beating Evil! Imho even though poverty still breeds crime while Our Betters still deny it Raj Kapoor's finest film.";

HOW many times have I seen this? Who is she? What connection does she have with the prisoner AND the judge? Heck what connection does the prisoner have with the judge?

Soon the child is born into poverty and is forced to lead the life that at least what the magistrate says was given to him.He meets a cute little girl and she invites him to her birthday party but he is ostracized because of his societal standing and is soon arrested for a crime and is send off to juvvy prison.When he gets out several years later he goes back to the only life he knows which is crime and during a somewhat botched robbery he bumps into a lady. Yes! The birthday girl from several years back! And they start off on an affair that gets sillier and sillier as the time goes on and on and on Predictable from the very get go It was immediately apparent what relationship the judge the lawyer and the president had filled with yawnish musical numbers broody acting and a slow slow sluggish pace.

While it wasn't as jarring as having characters belt out jaunty numbers in the middle of their family crises in Mother India Raj Kapoor's Awara is most definitely melodramatic enough to have the singing seem both outofplace and completely appropriate.The film is a bit of a social plea to LOOSEN UP depicting a harsh but respected judge Prithviraj Kapoor the director's own father who sentences an innocent man on the conviction that a criminal's son would end up on a criminal. His blind belief is put to the test when he is estranged from his wife and son Raj director Raj Kapoor who in turn grows up to become a petty thief.The film's plot criticism and metaphor are fairly obvious and the film is of course WAY too long at a whopping 168 minutes but more fascinating to examine is the relationship between Raj Kapoor and his father Prithviraj. Is it just a matter of both being actors so playing fatherson helps the resemblance or is there some sense of offspring rebellion that his father expected his son to synthesize his steps incrementally and that the son despite the fact that it DID come true still resents the father for pushing so hard? This is all speculation but it's intriguing stuff.As for the film the leads are what keep this bloated ship afloat. Both Kapoof men as well as the coincidental female love interest Nargis who he keeps seeming to run into AND was adopted by his dad who has a kind of creepy subtextual desire in his eyes about her. There's an extended dream sequence packed into the middle of the film brought to mind the finale of the same year's An American in Paris in that it is impressive and beautiful but ruins the flow of the film and serves no bearing to the plot at large. Every subtext of the sequence has already been spelled out and it proves an unwelcome impediment to the resolvement of the plot.The film's last reels involve a genius bit of setting as some of the most nakedly emotional moments in the film are set on an extremely windy beach getting around the criticism of the 'wind in the hair' clich by positing its characters in a place where that sort of wind could be expected. It gets that sort of grandiose but never falls apart and despite its length and simplistic plot it never lost me for good and although it didn't knock me out like the greatest of Indian cinema it was definitely a worthwhile marathon jaunt.Grade 7.7510 BB  12 of 16 of 1951".

	schema:reviewBody "Actorproducerdirector Raj Kapoor has given many excellent movies to the Hindi movie audience yet Aawara stands tall among them all. It's a movie which is not only considered a classic by critics from all strata and categories but also got thumping commercial success also. Its song in Mukesh's immortal voice  Aawara hoon found itself echoeing not only in the streets and corners of India but also Russia and China.Nature vs. Nurture is an ages old controversy starting from the plants and small creatures but extended to humanbeings also. Can the acquired characteristics be transferred through genes ? Is it necessary that a baddie's offspring will turn into a baddie only and good soul's offspring will develop as a good and virtuous humanbeing only ? No ! The movie answers. As far the development of characteristics and personality traits are concerned nurture has a much bigger perhaps the only role in that instead of nature or the acquiring of things by birth.Aawara starts with the trial of Raj Kapoor with his biological father Prithvi Raj Kapoor being on the other side and his ladylove Nargis as his defence attorney. The story moves to flash back with the abduction of Prithvi Raj Kapoor's wife Leela Chitnis by a baddie K.N. Singh. However when she returns she has to face the horrible truth of suspicion in the eyes of her household members that she was raped by K.N. Singh and the child being carried by her in her womb belongs to K.N. Singh and not Prithvi Raj Kapoor. The insect of suspicion eats up the wisdom of Prithvi Raj Kapoor and he expells his pregnant wife from his home. She gives birth to a son and fosters him under the hope that he will become a learned man like his father. However poverty and hunger throws him in the arms of K.N. Singh only who is hellbent upon inflicting a lifelong bitter revenge upon Prithvi Raj Kapoor who had ensured a harsh sentence for him. He develops Raj Kapoor as a baddie only and one day himself gets killed by him. When Raj Kapoor is tried for the murder charge Nargis reveals the truth that Raj Kapoor is none else but the son of Prithvi Raj Kapoor himself. Ultimately the father recognizes and embraces his son who is sentenced to prison for the murder.Aawara emphatically underscores the fact that it is ultimately the nurturing and the environment which matters in the development of the personality of a child. The child of a highly learned pious and virtuous family may become a criminal in the company of bad guys and the child of a sinful person may become a very nice and admirable person by getting the fosterage of a pious family  group. Raj Kapoor has given admirable direction to the story written by Khwaza Ahmed Abbas. The narrative has been made entertaining not sermonheavy. There is ample doz of comedy romance and melody in the movie. The scene in which Raj Kapoor beats himself behind the wall to win the heart of Nargis is hilarious. The master storyteller has used symbols quite artistically to signify different events. The use of moon in the song  Dumb Bhar Jo Udhar Munh Phere is a marvellous example in this context.Raj Kapoor was a shrewd filmmaker. He used to deliver entertainment enveloped in message instead of delivering message enveloped in entertainment. He has done the same thing in Aawara too. The movie supposedly underscore the supersession of nurture over nature. However when Nargis tries to convince Prithvi Raj Kapoor that Raj Kapoor is indeed his son she brings the point of his anger which is a ditto of his father. What does it underscores ? Definitely the transition of acquired characteristic through genes. Further if Raju becomes a good man in the end ultimately the theory of his father only comes true that a good man's offspring is meant to be a good one. This shows the triumph of nature not nurture.The technical and production value aspects are quite according to the standards set by Raj Kapoor for the movies of his banner. This black and white movie reminds of the noir cinema of the forties. Raj Kapoor's permanent cameraman Radhu Karmakar has caught the mood of the movie very well through his camera.The music of ShankerJaikishan is great. The song  Aawara hoon had almost become the national anthem at the time of the release of the movie and even today after sixty years it is as popular as it was at that time. The other songs of the movie are also no less by any means.The performances of Nargis Leela Chitnis K.N. Singh etc. are very good. I will mention two actors Prithvi Raj Kapoor who has delivered a towering performance in the role of judge Raghunath and Shashi Kapoor who has played the childhood version of Raj Kapoor quite briliiantly at the tender age of 13 years. Raj Kapoor as the perennial Raju has again done well with his mannerisms.In the end I just put up one point which always haunts me whenever I read any such thing or any such movie including the Ramayan that to which extent it is justified to harass a woman under suspicion of being raped and carrying an illegitimate child in her womb due to that incident. Though the movie was made in 1951 still the people's psyche is more or less the same in the Indian society. Had Raj Kapoor's mother Leela Chitnis been actually raped by K.N. Singh would Prithvi Raj Kapoor be justified in expelling her from the house that too in the pregnancy state ? Why should a woman be punished for a crime committed by a man and that too by quoting Lord Rama and justifying this injustice to the woman with the example of Lady Sita ? This question always makes me uncomfortable.".

The master storyteller has used symbols quite artistically to signify different events. The use of moon in the song  Dumb Bhar Jo Udhar Munh Phere is a marvellous example in this context.Raj Kapoor was a shrewd filmmaker. He used to deliver entertainment enveloped in message instead of delivering message enveloped in entertainment. He has done the same thing in Aawara too. The movie supposedly underscore the supersession of nurture over nature. However when Nargis tries to convince Prithvi Raj Kapoor that Raj Kapoor is indeed his son she brings the point of his anger which is a ditto of his father. What does it underscores ? Definitely the transition of acquired characteristic through genes. Further if Raju becomes a good man in the end ultimately the theory of his father only comes true that a good man's offspring is meant to be a good one. This shows the triumph of nature not nurture.The technical and production value aspects are quite according to the standards set by Raj Kapoor for the movies of his banner. This black and white movie reminds of the noir cinema of the forties. Raj Kapoor's permanent cameraman Radhu Karmakar has caught the mood of the movie very well through his camera.The music of ShankerJaikishan is great. The song  Aawara hoon had almost become the national anthem at the time of the release of the movie and even today after sixty years it is as popular as it was at that time. The other songs of the movie are also no less by any means.The performances of Nargis Leela Chitnis K.N. Singh etc. are very good. I will mention two actors Prithvi Raj Kapoor who has delivered a towering performance in the role of judge Raghunath and Shashi Kapoor who has played the childhood version of Raj Kapoor quite briliiantly at the tender age of 13 years. Raj Kapoor as the perennial Raju has again done well with his mannerisms.In the end I just put up one point which always haunts me whenever I read any such thing or any such movie including the Ramayan that to which extent it is justified to harass a woman under suspicion of being raped and carrying an illegitimate child in her womb due to that incident. Though the movie was made in 1951 still the people's psyche is more or less the same in the Indian society. Had Raj Kapoor's mother Leela Chitnis been actually raped by K.N. Singh would Prithvi Raj Kapoor be justified in expelling her from the house that too in the pregnancy state ? Why should a woman be punished for a crime committed by a man and that too by quoting Lord Rama and justifying this injustice to the woman with the example of Lady Sita ? This question always makes me uncomfortable.";

	schema:reviewBody "Shaun of the Dead is not only the best zombie flick I've seen in a long time it is simply the best film I've seen in a long time PERIOD! Clever witty sweet and nasty and at times gory and horrific SOTD has it all. Of course I didn't think I could go very far wrong with a film that George Romero himself said he enjoyed.Shaun Simon Pegg isn't having a very good week. His coworkers have no respect for him his uptight stepfather is on his back and his beloved girlfriend Liz has had enough of his laziness and inconsideration. Really Shaun isn't such a bad guy but he has no ambition and seems to prefer the company of his unemployed flatulent videogame obsessed slob of a flatmate Ed to anyone else. And as if this were not enough the dead have risen and are walking the earth in search of human flesh to feast upon. Shaun doesn't notice this fact as quick as he should but Shaun is somewhat of a zombie himself lost in his own world and distracted by his own thoughts as he strolls right past the rotting cadavers that now fill the streets of Britain. Not even news flashes can get through to Shaun as in an incredibly hysterical scene he channel surfs rapidly every station finishing the sentence of the one before and giving everyone but the oblivious Shaun the grim news of what is happening in the world. When Shaun and Ed finally do realize what is happening it quickly becomes a race against time save Shaun's mum rescue Liz and go to the pub where they can wait out the zombie infestation with a pint and a smoke. Of course not everything goes as smoothly as planned. There's undead flatmates to deal with bitey zombies along the way petty arguments between friends and Ed's cell phone going off at inopportune moments. But Shaun armed with a cricket bat is determined to save the woman he loves and nothing is going to get in his way!This film should be seen side by side with Romero's Dawn of the Dead as both films cleverly and sarcastically comment on our zombified society and virtually show no difference between the living and the living dead. There's not much gore here but there is one very unexpected and Saviniworthy moment in Shaun when the zombies rip a living man to shreds yanking out intestines and tearing off limbs. I really hadn't seen such a gory scene coming and was too stunned to look away. It's truly graphic and nauseating...and though I usually hate gore very well done. For a low budget film the zombies are pretty menacing looking and there are some genuinely scary moments to be found in Shaun. There's also several touching scenes between Shaun and his mum and dad...sorry I mean stepdad. Shaun himself is forced to grow up and take charge as the zombies close in around them. I don't want to give away the incredible ending of Shaun except to say that the living dead are not immune from popculture commercialization and though loved ones may die video games are forever. SEE THIS FILM!!! You do NOT have to be a fan of horror movies to appreciate the sublime satire that is Shaun of the Dead. I haven't seen a movie this good for a very long time. 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shaun of the Dead is quite a surprising and brilliant piece of work which I suspect will achieve the accolade of instant cult status as word of mouth snowballs this film to richly deserved recognition.Simon Pegg both the joint writer and the main star of the film has been a comedic force for some time most notably in the fantastic BBC2 series 'Hippies' which inexplicably bombed in the ratings and the cult Channel 4 series 'Spaced'.  Both programs hinted at Pegg's saliently dead pan comedic manner and writing skills which comes to full fruition in 'Shaun of the Dead'.In a nut shell this film is a romantic comedy with zombies or zomromcom who appear for no good clear reason although some tantalizing clues are offered.  The film is an amazing blend of the funny the violent and the poignant.Pegg has cast himself as one hell of a serious loser in this film.  And not in the 'American' form of 'I am a loser but I work in TV and have Jennifer Aniston as my wife'  kind of loser as portrayed in tripe such as 'Bruce Almighty' or dozens of other US 'loser' films.  Pegg's Shaun is a genuine loser and extremely recognisable too he's an everyday man who works for an electrical retailer and his life is just plain dull and disappointing  and this is where all the comedy comes from in this film.  There are two scenes in the film which seem to summarise this and also shine a light of Simon Pegg as a very clever and funny writer and both scenes simply involve Shaun walking to the nearby corner shop.  The first time Shaun plods semicomatose to the store we simply get the feeling that he is a loser.  However by the time the film shows him making the same journey again we realise that there is a lot more going on!  The scene is played with such exquisite subtleness that it has to be one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any film! Not that this film is subtle however there is a stunning array of visual comedy one liners and best of all some digs at other films from the horror genre. The funniest being a very subtle snipe at Boyles 28 days later'  see if you can spot it!The only problem with reviewing this film is that there are so many funny moments in it that it is hard to pick any to write about without spoiling the film.  All I can say is that I cannot remember a film ever being this consistently funny with probably five or six serious laughoutloud moments. It was a joy to watch and my only disappointment is that I can never watch this film for the first time ever again  every viewing will forever be a repeat viewing.Shaun of the Dead is not very everyone though  the language from the beginning is strong and the violence was quite surprising for a 15 certificate film in the UK. This film is definitely going to be most appreciated by horror fans who know a huge back catalogue of horror films. It will also be enjoyed by teenagers who filled the cinema when I viewed this film which was terrific as they laughed loudest.  Finally I do have some criticism of this film and that is there is some wasted talent in the movie.  Black Book's channel four star Dylan Moran seemed a bit wasted and so was Martin Freeman from BBC2's The Office  who would have made a terrific zombie!  Also did I spot Matt Lucas from BBC3's 'Little Britain' in this film? I am not sure as I was laughing too hard maybe!These problems however are so minor and can easily be forgiven.  My suggestion is to go and slowly shuffle down to your local cinema to see this film and give Simon Pegg the money and recognition he deserves so that he can go on and make more films that are this good including what the UK papers have suggested as his next project  From Dusk 'Till Shaun'.".

A man named Shaun played by Simon Pegg who lives in London and is a bit of a loser. He works in a deadend job at an electronic goods store and spends most of his spare time at the local pub or playing video games with his unemployed roomate Ed. One day Shaun's girlfriend Liz decides she's had enough of his lazy attitude and decides to leave him. When the city suddenly gets taken over by the living dead Shaun finds the perfect opportunity to prove himself to Liz so he sets out to save the day win his girlfriend back and keep his mum Barbara from being eaten by his stepdad who's slowly turning into a zombie.Don't let the title and premise fool you this isn't a simple spoof of Dawn Of The Dead it's more a romantic comedy that just so happens to be littered with the undead. The film is also very clever with a clear social commentary running throughout. The jokes that stem from this are absolutely hilarious but will probably be lost on any nonLondoners. It's actually quite unlikely that this film will translate to anyone outside the UK and this is a real shame and perhaps the films biggest flaw. But if you do get it then good for you because there is a lot of great stuff to be seen here. The script is wonderful and throws up many comedic moments such as when Shaun and Ed are looking through Shaun's LP collection for a suitable vinyl to throw at two oncoming zombies Dire Straits? Chuck it! or when Shaun and his friends beat up an elderly zombie in the pub using cricket bats all to the rhythm of Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. The humour comes thick and fast never have I laughed so consistantly during any film before it only pauses briefly for a few dramatic scenes all of which work surprisingly well. In fact the film tends to genrehop quite a lot and while some find this unappealing I think it works in its favour. One minute it's a comedy then it's a drama and then it's a full blown horror. In fact some scenes are quite jumpy and certainly violent. One extremely gory part in particular is a clear homage to another famous horror film that shall remain unamed but if you know what I'm talking about when you see it then good for you. That's the thing about this movie though you don't need to be a horror fan to enjoy it. You just need to have the right sense of humour. Can I explain it? Well no. You'll just know if the film's for you when you see it. I can assure you that most will like it. If you don't then I really am sorry for you as this is about the most fun I have had in the cinema since Kill Bill . Ok that wasn't long ago but before that I don't think there was a film that was so riproaringly funny and then unashamedly brutal at the same time. There is nothing subtle about this movie and yet it will simply go over the heads of most people. I urge you to watch the film and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it. It's not without its faults though losing its spark slightly during the third act but it comes back with a vengence and gets in some really good jokes just before the credits roll.Shaun Of The Dead is a great film. It's funny it's clever and it's got zombies in it! Just when the British film industry appears to be dead this gem pops up and shows us what someone with a sense of humour and a real passion for the media can achieve.

	schema:reviewBody "Shaun's nearing 30 stuck in a crappy sales job and his girlfriend Liz is unhappy with the amount of time he spends with his ultraslacker Bclass drug dealer friend Ed at their local pub the Winchester. When Liz dumps him Shaun's so glum he doesn't even realise that London's been overrun with flesheating zombies. But somewhere within his consolehappy lazy self a hero is born.I can't even begin to emphasise how cool this quintessentially British film is. The amount of time it takes for Shaun Simon Pegg and Ed Nick Frost to realise anything's wrong is priceless. Director Edgar Wright who cowrote the film with Pegg also demonstrates that there's little difference between glassy eyed commuters and their undead brethren.The plot rips along beautifully and parodies both the romantic comedy and zombie genres while at the same time remaining true to them.

When Liz dumps him Shaun's so glum he doesn't even realise that London's been overrun with flesheating zombies. But somewhere within his consolehappy lazy self a hero is born.I can't even begin to emphasise how cool this quintessentially British film is. The amount of time it takes for Shaun Simon Pegg and Ed Nick Frost to realise anything's wrong is priceless. Director Edgar Wright who cowrote the film with Pegg also demonstrates that there's little difference between glassy eyed commuters and their undead brethren.The plot rips along beautifully and parodies both the romantic comedy and zombie genres while at the same time remaining true to them.

Brace yourself for some nonstop zombie action and laughs with the delightful horrorcomedy Shaun of the Dead.Armed with a cricket bat razorsharp wit and an attitude Shaun Simon Pegg is perhaps the last guy that you'd want to save the world from the legions of the living dead that have suddenly begun to storm the London neighborhood where he lives. It could be stated as this is a running gag here that we're all dying slow deaths so it's no surprise that when zombies begin to eat the flesh of the living Shaun couldn't be any more oblivious to the chaos that has gripped most of London.Shaun loves his deadend existence of wasting his days at the Winchester a local pub with his friend and flat mate Ed Nick Frost. The film's money shot arrives about 20 minutes in when Shaun hungover from a hard night's drinking goes to the store and because he's so hungover and is worried about his exgirlfriend Liz Kate Ashfield he doesn't even notice that the street behind him is teeming with the living dead.While in the store buying a beverage he doesn't notice the bloody handprints on the refrigerator door and he almost slips in a puddle of blood. I was quite amazed at the response this film got from people in the theater it seemed that every time something funny happened the response was almost always with riotous laughter.Straight from Britain we have what is certainly one of the most original horror movies to come out in a long time. Even in a genre that embraces gore Shaun of the Dead is fairly light on it at least for the first 45 minutes and is dominated by laughs galore.You may remember the character of Ash Bruce Campbell of Evil Dead fame who has remained pretty much the supreme demon slayer in the horror genre. But you know Campbell's pushed past 40 and people today may not be weary of his history slaying evil Deadites in Sam Raimi's notorious film series. So maybe with Shaun of the Dead the torch has been passed to Simon Pegg who slays more than his fair share of the living dead in this film.It's pretty obvious that SOTD was greatly influenced by the works of George A. Romero the director of 1978's supreme epic of zombie actionmayhem Dawn of the Dead and 2002's 28 Days Later directed by Danny Boyle. There are little ittybitty references to the two zombie flicks throughout the movie.Granted Shaun of the Dead is aimed largely at the gorehounds who idolized Romero's Living Dead trilogy but it's also the first zombie flick to attempt making a hit with the mainstream. I guarantee any viewers out there that you'll spend more time laughing than you will being frightened.1010".

As if that's not bad enough suddenly everyone is turning into a zombie. Shaun must both straighten out his life and fight for it at the same time.Shaun of the Dead is a superb blending of horror and comedy ala An American Werewolf in London 1981 Idle Hands 1999 Frankenhooker 1990 or the Evil Dead films beginning with the 1981 original although there is progressively less to more comedy in that series. It manages to successfully both pay homage to and spoof a number of classic zombie films and horror film zombie mythology in general.The film begins firmly in very British comedydrama territory with a number of stylistic directorial flourishes that seem like a cross between Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream 2000 and Danny Boyle's Trainspotting 1996. The horror material enters gradually beginning with a couple background gags then entering Desolation Boulevard territory via another Boyle reference this time to 28 Days Later 2002 although that itself was basically a version of The Last Man on Earth aka L'Ultimo uomo della Terra1964 based on Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend. This arrives in the guise of Shaun crossing over to the corner store to buy his morning soda. He doesn't notice the deserted streets or store because he's so hung over from the night before.Before long our ragtag bunch of heroes is in the midst of a fullfledged zombie apocalypseof the traditional slowmoving zombie type. Acknowledging the cultural differences that strict gun laws bring about they have to use their wits to commit the requisite head busting enlisting unwanted LPs after some debate over the merits of each cricket bats shovels and other items for the job. Of course it would be easier if any of our heroes were the slightest bit athletic and had any aim but they get the job done. More or less.Furthering genrefan fun directorwriter Edgar Wright and cowriter Pegg insert a lot of references to other zombie filmsespecially when it comes to explaining the source of the epidemic. The scientific explanations given in Resident Evil 2002 28 Days Later all of Romero's Dead filmsbeginning with Night of the Living Dead 1968and possibly even Romero's The Crazies 1973 and then some are all mentioned in the background but resolutely cut off before they're finished. Part of the reason might be that usually the explanations were pretty ridiculous and we didn't really carewe just wanted to get to the cool zombie stuff such as limbs being torn off guts being eaten and brains being blown or smashed out of skulls.Wright and Pegg also insert clever nods to the subtexts of zombie films. Shaun looks and walks like a zombie when he's waking up. We see zombie like office workers retail workers and so on. There's also an amusing nod to filmic attempts to study and tame zombies as well as organized militaristic defenses both very prominent in 28 Days Later but present in other films as well. There are interesting more subtle and original zombie subtexts in Shaun of the Dead also such as the mirrored scene where Shaun and his crew meet up with Yvonne and her crew.As long as you like outrageous comedy somewhat gory horror and you don't mind mixing the two Shaun of the Dead should provide an enjoyable ride. Although it is the most fun when you're very familiar with the source material it is spoofing and referencing it is still a great comedyhorror film if viewed with fresher eyes and not so much as a spoof.".

On top of that his girlfriend has had enough of him. Oh.and the dead have started walking the earth!Hot on the heels of recent remake Dawn of the Dead comes Simon 'Spaced' Pegg's black comedy zombie spoof in which Shawn must save his friends mum and exgirlfriend from the masses of lumbering dead by erm going to the Winchester! Unlike recent zombiefests these deadites are pretty lame lumbering monstrosities much like the ones from the older zombie films. This is used to simple comic effect throughout as the 'heroes' seem to have plenty of time to think about things before being attacked.The film balances the humour excellently with a decent zombiestory and the array of characters within are not there just for laughs there are plenty of poignant moments scattered throughout. Issues of family love and friendship along with growing older and accepting responsibility are contained within the script. Much in the way that TV series Spaced managed to play the absurd with the serious so does this film. It is easy to compare it to a 'big screen Spaced' episode but that doesn't sell the film enough. It is much more than that and is the perfect homage to zombie flicks and social satire too. Watch towards the early stages of the film to see that most of the population could be confused for zombies anyway and as for the end scenes of the film.well.suffice to say it will keep you laughing right to the end.With a cast pulled from many cult British shows Dylan Moran from Black Books Matt Lucas from Little Britain and nearly everyone from Spaced and an excellent appearance by Bill Love Actually' Nighy there isn't really anything negative I can think of in the film. Even the action is well handled with enough gore to satisfy any fans of zombie flicks.This is a must see film which showcases Simon Pegg's talents excellently. The only drawback is that if it catapults him to international stardom he may never get around to making that final season of Spaced!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The great British sitcom has undergone something of a revival in recent years. Galvanised by the new wave of smart sassy imports from the US the Brits have girded their loins and produced a spate of quality comedies that have banished memories of the bland identikit dross of the late eighties and early nineties.One such series is Spaced a wholly original and delightfully quirky comic bagatelle which has built up a small but dedicated following in the UK. Now writeractor Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright have teamed up once again to give us Shaun of the Dead which is in a nutshell a featurelength episode of Spaced with added zombies. Happily timed to coincide with the Hollywood remake of the 1978 classic shocker Dawn of the Dead Shaun is the perfect antidote Irreverent warm and very funny.Shaun Pegg is your stereotypical sitcom loser An ineffectual slob in a deadend job he is terminally afraid of commitment and spends all his time with his flatmate Ed Nick Frost also from Spaced who is an even bigger loser. After his girlfriend dumps him Shaun and Ed seek solace in their local pub the Winchester  a good oldfashioned English hostelry with warm beer and pork scratchings which is infamous for its lockins. They stagger home in a state of advanced refreshment unaware that the dead are now walking the earth. Indeed it takes Shaun a little while to work it out the following morning despite interacting with a few of them one of the recurring themes is that most of us go through the drudgery of our daily routines in a trance close to inertia.When the penny drops Shaun resolves to rescue his mother and his ex girlfriend and generally stand up for himself for the first time in his life. There is not much more of a plot than that. The film like Spaced relies on a flawless script observational humour and the theatre of the absurd. Pegg has perfected this in his writing but he is also a surprisingly good actor. It helps that he has surrounded himself with the pick of the British comedy fraternity who seem to have been lining up literally in one scene for a cameo. The stars of similarly acclaimed series' such as Black Books The Office and Little Britain are all on show here as well as Jessica Stevenson Pegg's Spaced cowriter who plays a jollyhockeysticks human vigilante with a stiffupper lip and cando attitude ready to give those nasty zombie's whatfor.Veteran support comes from Penelope Wilton a sitcom stalwart from a bygone age as Shaun's curtaintwitching mother and Bill Nighy as her fearsome second husband who performs one of the most dignified and poignant descents into zombieness ever caught on camera.Despite all the high praise it must be acknowledged that Shaun of the Dead is still a spoof  a comic tool that you could argue is as low a form of wit as sarcasm. But where it scores highly is in its respect for the original material. Most spoofs the Scary Movie franchise for example are vicious lampoons that unmercifully mock the films they are taking off. Shaun of the Dead gently pokes fun but doesn't lose sight of the fact that if something is worth parodying it must have some merit. Pegg is also careful to ensure that his film can stand up on its own  there is barely a minute goes by without a very good joke and despite the lightheartedness there are some satisfyingly scary moments and ample gore.What is most encouraging is that us Brits have started playing to our strengths. It took a long time for comedy writers to realise that making an English version of Friends is doomed to failure in the same way that The Office will not work with an American makeover. We should celebrate the Britishness of this film laugh knowingly at the in gags and be proud that it doesn't take a huge budget or movie stars to entertain people at the cinema.810".

Shaun of the Dead gently pokes fun but doesn't lose sight of the fact that if something is worth parodying it must have some merit. Pegg is also careful to ensure that his film can stand up on its own  there is barely a minute goes by without a very good joke and despite the lightheartedness there are some satisfyingly scary moments and ample gore.What is most encouraging is that us Brits have started playing to our strengths. It took a long time for comedy writers to realise that making an English version of Friends is doomed to failure in the same way that The Office will not work with an American makeover. We should celebrate the Britishness of this film laugh knowingly at the in gags and be proud that it doesn't take a huge budget or movie stars to entertain people at the cinema.810";

Because of this through its seriousness the movie becomes perhaps even more hilarious and really delivers. Both the fans of the British comedygenre and the fans of mainly 'Zombie' movies and other gory horrormovies will be entertained by this movie.Visually the movie is really good looking. Its not like many other British movies and has a good looking use of cinematography and lighting. The gore makeup and visual effects are extremely good and are even something that I haven't even seen in 'serious' Zombiehorror flicks.You might think that this movie is just mainly a spoof of Dawn of the Dead 1978 but its really more than that. The movie is good and creates a good story on its own so that it becomes more than just a simple spoof. All of the characters are well written and are funny in their own way.The acting is good for comedy standards and the actors perfectly know how to play in both hilariousfunny scene's as well as in seriousemotional one's. Plus of course it has the wonderful Bill Nighy playing a role in it. This guy really is a terrific actor that always is at his best in comical roles like he plays in this movie.Basically this is a very good looking and professionally made movie that also is funny and hilarious at moments. I can't see how anyone could not like this movie.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The genre has always seemed to focus on gore effects and thrills over plot and innovation. But I didn't think this would be an issue since Shaun is a spoof.But it's not a spoof. Or at least not entirely a spoof. Shaun is a conglomeration of spoof satire horror thriller fantasy romance and of course comedy. Very rarely do I enjoy movies that attempt to bridge more than three genres simultaneously. The only similar movie I can recall for comparison is Mars Attacks! 1996.I had some laughs but overall I could not slip into the proper mindset to enjoy this film even though I desperately wanted to. At times it was clever and creative by placing average Joes in bizarre zombie situations. But at the same time it suffers from all those traits that infuriate and annoy me in horror and thriller movies.In short the primary problem was an inability to empathize with the characters. One reason I don't care for horror movies is because the main characters are generally morons. Shaun himself was no exception he repeatedly makes poor choices and either under or over reacts to all sorts of situations. His mother is a cross between senile and dimwitted. Ed is borderline retarded.Truthfully in real life I can't stand people like Shaun. They are so absorbed in their own problems that they are completely oblivious to their surroundings and events around them. They have no one to blame but themselves for their predicaments. The characters just don't seem to behave realistically which would be fine if the movie was an outright satire sketch like Monty Python but it's not.All in all I give Shaun of the Dead a 6  10 still worth a watch.".

However Shaun has a plan to save himself his mate his exgirlfriend  his mum  stepdad which involves barricading themselves into his local pub...This British French coproduction was cowritten  directed by Edgar Wright  I have to say I was left a little disappointed by it  I can't quite see where all the glowing praise for it comes from. The script by star Pegg  Wright is obviously a nice homage to George A. Romero's 'Dead' films although to be honest I'd sooner watch Romero's splattergore films than this odd mixture of comedy romance  horror. Shaun of the Dead is all very British  maybe the novelty of it wins people over especially those who don't live here in Britian unfortunately I do live here  it just doesn't have quite the same affect on me. Apparently both Pegg  Wright were involved in the British comedy series 'Spaced' which to be honest I've never heard of  maybe that's where a lot of it's fans come from. Anyway it's a moderately successful film  certainly a watchable one it's amusing it's pretty clever  well written it has plenty of fun references to other films it's a fairly fun film but I found it to be too spoofy it goes to far into the direction of silliness  some of the things that happen just annoyed me. I'm in two minds really I will openly admit it's a fun watch but I didn't think it was as brilliant as many seem to think I doubt I'd watch it again anytime soon  I didn't have as much fun with it as I'd hoped overall I'd say I was a little disappointed.Director Wright does a good job it's shot like a TV soap opera at times although he manages to juggle the comedy romance  horror quite well. It's not scary  I didn't find it laugh out loud funny either but I'm sure many of you out there dowill. I like the laddish approach that the modern British male would barricade themselves in a pub  wait for it to blow over rather than head for the plush  sensible surroundings of a supermarket as seen in Dawn of the Dead 1978. There's some gore someone is torn apart at the end there are someone gunshot wounds to the head but little else worth mentioning.With a supposed budget of about 4000000 Shaun of the Dead is well made although there isn't a great deal of style or flair to it. The acting is good  the cast make their character's pretty likable.Shaun of the Dead is a decent fun homage to Romero's zombie films to be brutally honest I'd rather see one of those again than this though. Worth a watch for sure but not as good as I'd hoped  I feel it's slightly overrated.".

	schema:headline " Not wholly successful but a solid horror with laughs  fans of Spaced Black Books etc will love it!";
	schema:reviewBody "Shaun is in his late twenties and works in a electrical store with teenagers.  He hangs out with his slobbish friend and spends every evening in the Winchester pub.  Fed up with this his girlfriend dumps him leaving him with the words of his other flatmate ringing in his ears  sort your life out'.  His plans take an unexpected turn when he and Ed eventually notice that London's populace has mostly given into a virus that turns them into well the Z word.  Shaun and Ed devise a plan to keep safe and rescue Shaun's mother and ex.Although the makers were cursing themselves for the unfortunate timing of this film's release with the much bigger budget remake of Dawn of the Dead  however for me this served as a rather nice experience after the straightscares of Dawn.  A point to note for all those moaners is that this film went into production before the remake did.  Anyway ignoring this issue it is important to note that the film is a very British affair and is aimed at a very particular sense of humour.  In essence if you love Spaced then you'll enjoy this.  The film is NOT a spoof  it is a horror movie with laughs not unlike Evil Dead in that regard.  The gags are good but not as fast as Spaced fans will be used to  instead they are put in with the horror rather than being forced over the top of it.The film has movie references but not to the point where they become the gags themselves Spaced's cutaways for example.  In place of that we have references to Deer Hunter and The Matrix that are funny but will not spoil things for you if you don't spot them.  I laughed throughout but it is important not to expect to be rolling in the aisles  the film is still a horror not a Naked Gun style spoof.As a horror the film is not really scary but does have a good gutful of gore to go around.  The zombies are slow and this will not work for modern audiences but it does hark back to the old zombie flicks and also allows the material to work.  I closed my eyes a few times as the film provided blood and it does have the odd moment that is touching.  Of course the laughs are everything and aside from a slow start and a more horrorfocused ending this is consistently funny.The one thing that it also does well is have a slight satirical edge to it. It is delivered rather heavily early scenes of hooded youths lumbering around force the point home too heavily but it is still true  having done my shopping in Asda just before seeing this film I can definitely contest that many of us lumber around in a semitrance!  This is a nice touch  the Dawn remake lacked any of the comment that it's original made so it is good to have some here.  Again however nonBrits may not totally pick up on this as we seem to be one of the few countries that has this puborientated culture.The cast are great and will be full of faces recognisable from the TV series that this film will draw the majority of it's fans from.  Pegg is great he is a slightly more advanced version of his Spaced character and he makes for a good leading character simply because he is so recognisable  this is not a Hollywood film with characters we don't know but instead a bloke from a pub.  Despite the fact that I would hate Ed in real life Frost is hilariously exaggerated.  He looks very different from Spaced but he does well with the material.  Ashfield is spunky and the only downside to her is that she would never be with Shaun in the first place.  Support is good from Moran Davis and Nighy.  There are plenty of injokes for fans including a great cameo from Stevenson who also shows up with her own group of friends that mirror Shaun's friends in terms of looks and pretty much TV series background eg Tim from the Office and Fran from Black Books.Overall this will not please everyone and I fear that some will not laugh as much as the adverts and hype suggested.  However it is a good horror comedy and easily the best British film of the year so far  fans of Spaced will notice the joke rate is scaled back but it is still very funny.  The humour of Spaced has reached the big screen and is doing good things for the British cinema industry.  The makers said they threw so much into the film horror comedy romance drama gore because they didn't think they would be allowed to make another film  I hope to god that is not the case.".

The film is NOT a spoof  it is a horror movie with laughs not unlike Evil Dead in that regard.  The gags are good but not as fast as Spaced fans will be used to  instead they are put in with the horror rather than being forced over the top of it.The film has movie references but not to the point where they become the gags themselves Spaced's cutaways for example.  In place of that we have references to Deer Hunter and The Matrix that are funny but will not spoil things for you if you don't spot them.  I laughed throughout but it is important not to expect to be rolling in the aisles  the film is still a horror not a Naked Gun style spoof.As a horror the film is not really scary but does have a good gutful of gore to go around.  The zombies are slow and this will not work for modern audiences but it does hark back to the old zombie flicks and also allows the material to work.  I closed my eyes a few times as the film provided blood and it does have the odd moment that is touching.  Of course the laughs are everything and aside from a slow start and a more horrorfocused ending this is consistently funny.The one thing that it also does well is have a slight satirical edge to it. It is delivered rather heavily early scenes of hooded youths lumbering around force the point home too heavily but it is still true  having done my shopping in Asda just before seeing this film I can definitely contest that many of us lumber around in a semitrance!  This is a nice touch  the Dawn remake lacked any of the comment that it's original made so it is good to have some here.  Again however nonBrits may not totally pick up on this as we seem to be one of the few countries that has this puborientated culture.The cast are great and will be full of faces recognisable from the TV series that this film will draw the majority of it's fans from.  Pegg is great he is a slightly more advanced version of his Spaced character and he makes for a good leading character simply because he is so recognisable  this is not a Hollywood film with characters we don't know but instead a bloke from a pub.  Despite the fact that I would hate Ed in real life Frost is hilariously exaggerated.  He looks very different from Spaced but he does well with the material.  Ashfield is spunky and the only downside to her is that she would never be with Shaun in the first place.  Support is good from Moran Davis and Nighy.  There are plenty of injokes for fans including a great cameo from Stevenson who also shows up with her own group of friends that mirror Shaun's friends in terms of looks and pretty much TV series background eg Tim from the Office and Fran from Black Books.Overall this will not please everyone and I fear that some will not laugh as much as the adverts and hype suggested.  However it is a good horror comedy and easily the best British film of the year so far  fans of Spaced will notice the joke rate is scaled back but it is still very funny.  The humour of Spaced has reached the big screen and is doing good things for the British cinema industry.  The makers said they threw so much into the film horror comedy romance drama gore because they didn't think they would be allowed to make another film  I hope to god that is not the case.";

Anyone who has left a review that has stated that this movie is funny you have been warned. The entire film takes place in about 2 locations with very few movements along the way. I wasted over an hour of my life to watch this garbage.Furthermore I've browsed some of the reviews that have been previously written where some of you say that us Americans can't understand the English comedy due to various reasons. Trust me when I say that that isn't the problem here. The problem isn't the dialect nor the fact that the film boasts primarily English actors. The problem with this movie is that the actors are all C class actors. The problem is that they all lack common senseintelligence above and beyond the norm. The screenplay is downright awful and it was just as pathetically acted. Poor acting poorly written and poorly thought out  an extremely poor film.There is no reason to watch this. You will not laugh you will not smile. You will waste your time. If you are looking for a good quality horrorcomedy film. I suggest you watch Tucker  Dale vs. Evil. That movie is without a doubt hands down 10x better than this film here. I have yet to watch Zombieland but would also be willing to go out on a limb and suggest that that film as well has got to be better.Thanks for reading my review and I certainly hope you take it into consideration.".

I see all I can get my hands on whether they get good or bad reviews and whether I've heard anything about them or not. Shan of the Dead seemed like a cool idea for a movie at least prior to when I saw the trailer. After seeing the trailer I thought I'd give it a chance anyway. Something not recommended to others since that's those 99 minutes of your life that you're never going to get back.One of the main problems with this movie is the characters. For good drama you need suitable characters to move the story forward. Shaun of the Dead lacks this vital component. In many instances it's hard to tell what the screenwriter was thinking. The following characters inherit this film The main character Shaun. He is an ugly loser with nothing going for him. He feels sorry for himself the whole film through all the way to the ending but it's really his own fault that he is a big loser. Shaun has a friend who lives off him and Shaun's other roommate. This guy is a lazy fat and disgusting slob with no sense of responsibility whatsoever. I forgot to mention that he deals marijuana as his only way of income. Adorable isn't it? Shaun's second roommate has a job !! a sense of responsibility and seems to know what's right or wrong. Constantly throughout the short period of time that this character still survives he is being called names behind his back by his friends and he is the one who dies first.Hold up a second here. Something's wrong. The unsympathetic main characters are morons who nobody can identify with and the only sensible person in the trio gets killed off quickly. You can't build a movie like this. If you can't identify yourself with the protagonists you won't care what happens to this and then the movie will not draw you in. I won't bore you with descriptions the rest of the characters but it's basically the same drill as with the ones I've already mentioned.Another problem with the film is that it's a bit schizophrenic in the sense that it doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be. It certainly is no romantic comedy because 1. Let's face it How romantic are zombies really? and 2. It's a failed attempt at comedy since very few jokes actually are funny. Maybe the last one is because it's a British sort of humor that I don't 'get'. Anyway the up until the last 20 minutes the movie tries to be a comedy then however it gets 100 percent serious and turns into some sort of splatterhorrordrama. This film is not a good film and it's one of the worst zombie films I've seen and I've seen some pretty bad ones.".

This guy is a lazy fat and disgusting slob with no sense of responsibility whatsoever. I forgot to mention that he deals marijuana as his only way of income. Adorable isn't it? Shaun's second roommate has a job !! a sense of responsibility and seems to know what's right or wrong. Constantly throughout the short period of time that this character still survives he is being called names behind his back by his friends and he is the one who dies first.Hold up a second here. Something's wrong. The unsympathetic main characters are morons who nobody can identify with and the only sensible person in the trio gets killed off quickly. You can't build a movie like this. If you can't identify yourself with the protagonists you won't care what happens to this and then the movie will not draw you in. I won't bore you with descriptions the rest of the characters but it's basically the same drill as with the ones I've already mentioned.Another problem with the film is that it's a bit schizophrenic in the sense that it doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be. It certainly is no romantic comedy because 1. Let's face it How romantic are zombies really? and 2. It's a failed attempt at comedy since very few jokes actually are funny. Maybe the last one is because it's a British sort of humor that I don't 'get'. Anyway the up until the last 20 minutes the movie tries to be a comedy then however it gets 100 percent serious and turns into some sort of splatterhorrordrama. This film is not a good film and it's one of the worst zombie films I've seen and I've seen some pretty bad ones.";

	schema:reviewBody "Big Eden is a breath of fresh air!I would like to shake director Thomas Bezucha's hand and thank him for the kind of film I have been waiting for for years a film in which gay men were represented in all shapes and sizes where they actually were OVER the age of 30 and where they were just regular guys! No drag queens no fey lispy men snapping their fingers saying you go girl no circuit boys and their designer drugs no latest club hit from Cher no stereotypes played for laughs.  I was happy that the film All Over The Guy was a step in the right direction and Big Eden is the one film that has broken through that barrier and gosh darn it SOMEONE had to do this!Realists and critics like Roger Ebert have totally missed the point of this film saying no town could be this welcoming to gays and lesbians and supportive of their lives.  The filmmakers wanted to present a what if situation in which there was no bigotry so that the focus of the story would be on the self discovery of the three main leads and the romance. What's so wrong with that for a change?  The fact that this was done so well helps even more.  Takes you back to films from the 1940s and beyond. Think of it this way if this were a story about heterosexual love then there would be no question about the whole town's support and helping get the lovers together.  That's the focus of the story so by eliminating the bigotry and hate aspect we can just sit back and enjoy what this film is supposed to be about intimacy and where you belong.As Henry Arye Gross is visiting his hometown he finds he still has feelings for a friend from his childhood DeanTim DeKay.  In the meantime Henry is perplexed about the behaviour of the Native American store owner named Pike Eric Schweig thinking the guy doesn't like him a deleted scene elaborates on this fact Henry says he didn't even like me back in high school. Ah but what is REALLY behind Pike's actions?  There is quite a bit of vague behaviour so that you're left thinking who's really smitten with whom here?  Eventually Henry realizes the true meaning of his feelings for Dean and with a heartfelt film like this you just know that somehow everyone will find a degree of happiness and not be left hurt.This is a film about friends and family and most of all HOPE.  It's refreshing to see a focus on the story without trying to make sure there's enough cussing to garner a certain rating or cute naked bodies to lure some in who would normally not be watching a film like this in the first place.  One reviewer was offended by the casting of a Native American in Big Eden well I say KUDOS to to casting Eric Schweig  I personally know gay Native Americans and as that saying goes we are everywhere and you can't deny that certain races or nationalities have gays and lesbians in them. In a time where too much focus is on lipstick lesbians and how you can just work a movie around that it's so wonderful to have a film like Big Eden defy all the typical cliches and dare to give us a rather wholesome healthy portrayal of gays  one in which we do value our families and their support and have other values instead of what people seem to think it's like from watching Queer As Folk.I've always felt Arye Gross would be given a great lead role one day and he plays Henry so well so much like a regular guy.  I for one am so happy that a film like this is showing gay men do have lives beyond the age of 30 and can be just as desirable.  Tim DeKay may be eye candy without a shirt for some but his character is still grounded in reality and he handles that part quite well.  Eric Schweig is simply perfect his character shows that you can't just look at someone and say that's gay for sure.  Louise Fletcher is so loving you just want to hug her and George Coe gives his role a lot of respect.Big Eden was a big winner at numerous film festivals and I am so happy that all involved in making this dream of a film a reality and a REAL reality situation for our lives someday soon are being given a lot of respect for this vision!".

	schema:reviewBody "Until a few days ago I had never heard of the film BIG EDEN and am still not quite sure from where the title came. I appreciated the total absence of any gay stereotypes and while it stretched one's imagination greatly regarding the plot and how it was presented in the film in my mind it could and has happened in just the way the director envisioned it. It would seem that his choice of a mythical? town in northwestern Montana was very much on purpose  making the whole thing improbable at best. Still that very romantic situation has happened a great deal in small town USA. Our director has changed the gender mix and I believe asked us to challenge our own human prejudices and failings. To a person everyone in the film was completely believable. It was a romantic love story as I saw it with an unexpected but nevertheless real valid and honest gender mix. At one point it is obvious that the grandfather knows that his grandson is gay and is hoping that he will confide and share that with him. Some of the towns people depicted in this film are almost ALWAYS seen as conservative and closeminded and downright prejudicial in other films that deal with this particular subject matter. I'm happy to say that I do know lots of openminded liveandletpeople who would definitely enjoy and applaud this gem of a film. With all the sudden controversy about samesex marriages it would seem that its appearance on cable tv was not only timely but very much on purpose. I have a longtime friend who grew up in Montana and although he has yet to see the film I'm quite sure that he would agree that this particular romantic love story could NOT have happened as it did in the film in this small town in Montana. I'm more certain it could and has happened in more urban cities like NYC San Francisco Los Angeles et cetera. Nevertheless I would highly recommend the film to anyone especially to those who have NEVER considered life without stereotyping others or that LOVE and LOVING is not only the most beautiful and powerful gift we can give to and receive from one another but it is also both limitless and has NEVER been gender specific. For me it is the highest form of human behavior and the very best experience we can have and share in our all too short lives on Earth. I'd enjoy hearing from others and their comments about the film. Our main character unfortunately is still too ashamed of who he is and is the direct source of his difficulty in telling his ailing grandfather of his gender affection for two of his male friends. Again I highly recommend this film as an alternative to all of the violentnegative and mean spirited films that the Hollywood seems to happily produce for public consumption and in doing so laugh all the way to the bank. Peace with out  Jesse".

To a person everyone in the film was completely believable. It was a romantic love story as I saw it with an unexpected but nevertheless real valid and honest gender mix. At one point it is obvious that the grandfather knows that his grandson is gay and is hoping that he will confide and share that with him. Some of the towns people depicted in this film are almost ALWAYS seen as conservative and closeminded and downright prejudicial in other films that deal with this particular subject matter. I'm happy to say that I do know lots of openminded liveandletpeople who would definitely enjoy and applaud this gem of a film. With all the sudden controversy about samesex marriages it would seem that its appearance on cable tv was not only timely but very much on purpose. I have a longtime friend who grew up in Montana and although he has yet to see the film I'm quite sure that he would agree that this particular romantic love story could NOT have happened as it did in the film in this small town in Montana. I'm more certain it could and has happened in more urban cities like NYC San Francisco Los Angeles et cetera. Nevertheless I would highly recommend the film to anyone especially to those who have NEVER considered life without stereotyping others or that LOVE and LOVING is not only the most beautiful and powerful gift we can give to and receive from one another but it is also both limitless and has NEVER been gender specific. For me it is the highest form of human behavior and the very best experience we can have and share in our all too short lives on Earth. I'd enjoy hearing from others and their comments about the film. Our main character unfortunately is still too ashamed of who he is and is the direct source of his difficulty in telling his ailing grandfather of his gender affection for two of his male friends. Again I highly recommend this film as an alternative to all of the violentnegative and mean spirited films that the Hollywood seems to happily produce for public consumption and in doing so laugh all the way to the bank. Peace with out  Jesse";

	schema:reviewBody "Unbelievably wonderful performances by all the main actors in Big Eden make for one of the best movies I have ever seen.Arye Gross plays Henry a New Yorker who returns home to the rural West when to take care of his ailing grandfather. There he runs into his old friend Dean played by the irresistible Tim DeKay seemingly bisexual but it turns out he is straight who is now divorced with 2 children. The old fascination with Dean is rekindled  but meanwhile another man from his past Pike played with amazing depth and dignity by Eric Schweig a Native American is smitten with Henry. Henry is no cook so he arranges for the Widow Thayer  played by Nan Martin in the most delightfully memorable manner  to cook meals for he and his ailing grandfather Sam the wonderful George Coe. Widow Thayer's meals are horrible famously horrible so Pike starts to cook Henry  Sam's meals himself without telling them. He is totally in love with Henry but can't work up the nerve to let him know so. He just pours his love into the meals that he prepares.Will Henry  Pike get together? Or will Henry remain smitten with Dean? This delightful film doesn't let you know until the end.One of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen in a film takes place in this film Pike sees a painting that Henry did of stars at night. He then tells a story from his tribe about children who floated up into the sky and became stars. I won't attempt to tell the story here but I assure you that this one story is one of the most beautiful things you will ever hear or see. It applies perfectly to Henry's situation but it is a story that anyone can relate to and learn from. Big Eden is simple yet elegant. It is country yet universal. It is Andy of Mayberry for the modern era a microcosm of how the world ought to be. So stunningly beautiful that you will want to watch it over and over and over again.Bravo! to everyone associated with this loving magnificent film!".

Overall it's decently well acted extremely well filmed and directed but tends to be mostly unsurprising.  However there were a few emotional surprises his best friends' thanksgiving confrontation that true love need not be sexually based and for me more than a small element of truth.While the other commentaries here are mostly accurate I wanted to give a small view from an exMontanan who recently had to go back to care for and later bury his grandmother hmm seems like a plot line in there somewhere. The movie's portrayal of a gay accepting but as in the film a nearly unspoken acceptance Montana was pretty accurate.When I came home to Montana no one in my large extended family could not have known my situation.  However while it wasn't addressed directly it was clear that it wasn't a big deal.  My family went out of their way to introduce me to other members of my community including a few cousins that i never had guessed.  It seemed Montanans expend enough energy getting through daytoday to forego taking precious time worrying about some label. Clearly there it was who you are not what you are.  And most importantly could people depend on you.So while many people compare this movie to Northern Exposure which I dearly loved there is an element of truth beneath the fantasy.  Kudos to a well done film".

Perhaps it is stereotypical to think that such a town CANNOT be real. Sure hatred exists everywhere. I've personally been the victim of a nasty hate crime but I've also been fortunate enough to visit small communities that embrace everyone gay or straight. I have every reason to be bitter but I choose not to be a martyr.As others have said I welcome this film as a gay love story that avoids the pitfalls of torpid melodrama and morbid angst. Many have accurately compared this film to the TV series Northern Exposure. It really is a sweet little film and I normally avoid that word.How interesting that ALL of my cynical gay friends love this film. Surprisingly I only learned of it this year.

	schema:reviewBody "'Eden' is right...for this rustic fictional Montana town is a gayembracing garden paradise.  And why not?  Movies are for dreamers and in this dream of a movie we get to witness a basically straightlaced flagwaving midwestern town embrace homosexuality like never before.  In fact the town is more openly accepting of the gay lifestyle than the rather emotionally repressed romantic trio who are at the core of the piece.  And therein lies its simple bouquet of a message.  The only one who usually gets in the way of you being yourself...is yourself.A lovely cross between Meg RyanTom Hanks fluff and Northern Exposure quirkiness Big Eden insists on keeping it merry and informal confident in knowing that its casual natural stance on the whole gay element actually gives it universal appeal.Arye Gross fills in for Meg here as Henry Hart a former citizen of Big Eden who many years ago moved to the Big City to 'be himself'.  The prodigal son still single reluctantly returns home following the illness of a beloved relative and is surprisingly met with open arms.  The rather chummy eccentric inhabitants in fact hatch matchmaking plans to hopefully dissuade him from leaving.Tim DeKay plays the muscular cleancut Dean a former school chum and longtime crush of Henry's who has returned to his roots following a failed marriage and is now a doting single parent with two kids in tow.  Henry is hoping to spark the dormant but still smouldering feelings they once shared. Eric Schweig plays another classmate Pike a strong silent highly sensitive NativeAmerican who has longed for the unsuspecting Henry since their early school days.The story keeps its limited sights on the amusing entanglements of the trio never allowing itself to get overly serious or preachy.  Things may end up a bit too tidy and neat but again the beauty of the piece is in its gay is normal approach and almost 60slike wholesomeness.The performances are nothing spectacular to write home about but nevertheless quite winning and thoroughly entertaining.  Arye Gross former of Ellen is a pleasant centerpiece as a man searching not only for love but for himself and his place in life.  DeKay is equally charming as Henry's object of desire though his sexual confusion or acceptance seems puzzling coming from such a liberalminded town.  Schweig looking like he belongs in a production of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest instead of a gay love story overplays the unbearably shy intensely quiet type at first but eventually relaxes into his role as he begins to make his feelings known.The mirthful supporting cast is littered with fresh takes on old stereotypes none more so than the wonderful Nan Goodbye Columbus Martin as the brazenly intrusive Widow Thayer whose bold Yentastyled matchmaking methods are never less than delightful.  Louise Fletcher and particularly George Coe give wise restrained performances that lend a touch of class to the silly antics and superficial tendencies of the story.  Veanne Cox too provides a bit of amusing sass as Henry's endearing 'Big City' partner and friend.Big Eden settles in as one of the more 'feel good' movies of the year.  I think even Doris Day would give it her stamp of approval.  A welcome timefiller indeed.".

And I like the TexMex music though to someone like me who lives in Texas the music seems a little out of place ... so to speak.

You will not be sorry if you see Big Eden! Big Eden is UTOPIA!";

He also goes back to unrequited love but eventually finds a love he did not know existed. The film is beautifully shot making the most of the rural surroundings and the characters are all fully rounded so much so that by the end of the movie you will know and care for them all. It also contains much humour and a perfectly integrated musical score. Of course it is a fantasy world where everybody cares for and accepts other people for what they are but it is a world we should all be striving to make real.".

Yes you heard.if those who judged harshly were to apply the same rigorous standards to any number of anodyne bigscreen productions featuring oppositesex couplings that defy the bounds of logic or reality we'd see far fewer films. But until unlikely scenarios are censored altogether I'm happy enough to suspend my disbelief sit back and enjoy a very special kind of candy for the soul.The story features a love triangle involving three men played with great integrity and feeling by Arye Gross Tim DeKay and Eric Schweig. A lonely New York artist finds the answers to his questions  not all of them welcome or expected  when accident sends him back to the place of his boyhood. Fledgling love  and healing  is helped on its way by interfering but kindly locals with fleshed out characters and lives that are not altogether cartoonlike.That one of the three leads happens to be American Indian is entirely incidental to the plot but meaningful given their noticeable absence from the wider American cinema. Haven't we had enough of seeing Indians in American films only when they're running around in breechclouts? I'm sick to death of films which continue to pretend that our modern world consists only of straight white people peppered with a sprinkling of token gay men who talk only in grotesquely exaggerated sibilant asides. How different are the undemonstrative gay and straight men at the heart of Big Eden even granted its 'magicalrealist' premise. Some clumsy storytelling and weak dialogue are offset by considerable charm beautiful scenery and a fantastic soundtrack filled with great offbeat country tunes. Despite its flaws Big Eden didn't win numerous festival awards for being irredeemable tosh. All three lead actors do good work but I'd single out Eric Schweig for particular praise. His cripplingly shy Pike Dexter overcomes his own shyness and learns to show his love through cooking. He ably demonstrates his character's emotional journey despite minimal dialogue  as indeed he did so effectively in another much younger incarnation as Uncas in Last of the Mohicans.If such a world as this should ever exist I'd really want to live in it. Consider this a fine beginning a sea change. Until the revolution comes I'll settle for watching it charmingly imagined in loving detail by Thomas Bezuka. Bravo.".

	schema:reviewBody "This ultra cheap flick is hard to resist since it obviously doesn't take itself seriously so why hate it because it's low budget? Bored? Well okay you probably have me there but lovers of bad films will undoubtedly find a place in their collection for this silly effort. Story takes place somewhere in the forest where we see a biker gang head through a small town before embarking on a hiking trip but Rick Christopher Mitchum and his girl Chris Judy Jordan venture off by themselves for some necking. They come across a burial ground and find a hairy creature buried in one of the plots and then suddenly are attacked themselves where Rick is knocked unconscious and Chris is carried off.SPOILER ALERT Rick wakes up and heads to the nearest town to try and find help but the local police don't believe him and it takes two traveling salesmen who say they are interested in lending a hand. Jasper B. Hawks John Carradine and Elmer Briggs John Mitchum believe his story and think that if they can capture one of the sasquatch's then they will be rich. The creatures have Chris tied to a stake along with another pretty woman named Joi Landis Joi Lansing and they figure out that Bigfoot wants to mount them and get them pregnant because a smaller and more human looking creature Jerry Maren keeps sniffing about. Joi is taken up the hill as a prize for the biggest Bigfoot James Stellar so that he can mount her but Chris Jasper Elmer and the biker gang will soon be there to help.This film is written and directed by Robert Slatzer who had directed a couple of biker flicks before but the budget for this film is so small that he couldn't even get any cool looking motorcycles. It's easy to pick out the silliness here and I'll start with Carradine's character who recites famous lines from other films like Go away kid you bother me It was beauty did him in and ultimately Beauty and the Beast as he looks up and down at the beautiful Lansing. I also couldn't help but notice that Bigfoot knows how to tie knots! Who else tied the women up to those stakes? Lansing is a pilot but after parachuting out she takes her suit off and is wearing almost nothing and Jordan who is in the forest nowhere near any beach is supposed to be on a hiking trip but is wearing a bikini. How convenient for viewers! Chris Mitchum gets into a fistfight with one of the creatures and it turns out that the sasquatch can fight better than most heavyweight contenders. The local police are totally inept and when the sheriff learns that a girl has disappeared he spouts Go on home and go to bed while his deputy in the background is polishing the barrel of a gun like it's a gay phallic symbol. The biker gang in this film has to be the dullest bunch of wimps I have ever seen as they wear nice looking and ironed clothes. Their hair is neatly trimmed and when Mitchum is about to head into the woods with sexy Jordan he's warned to play nice! This gang is so timid and boring that a bunch of insurance salesmen at a convention would be more wild than these boy scouts. The motorcycles they ride are nothing more than medium sized Yamaha's whom I think helped sponsor this film in some way. The highlight of the film aside from gawking at Jordan in her bikini is watching the beautiful and busty barefoot Lansing who when not tied to a stake is either in the clutches of Bigfoot or running around the woods trying to escape. She appears to always be on the verge of falling out of her skimpy outfit but alas it never happens although there are several eye popping shots of her considerable cleavage. Lansing was a popular B movie starlet who unfortunately would die of cancer less than two years later before this film was ever released and she was stunning to look at. Both John and Christopher Mitchum are related not only to each other but to the great Robert Mitchum and along with them a few other familiar faces pop up like cowboy star Ken Maynard who has a poster of one of his old films behind him in the store. Besides Carradine the cast has Jerry Maren Cousin Itt Haji Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! and character actor Doodles Weaver as the forest ranger. I've always found low budget efforts like this fascinating to view and along with the bad furry suits and horrible sound stage forest settings it's still a film that knows what it is and clearly doesn't take itself seriously.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's a vastly superior movie out there called The Ninth Configuration written and directed by William Peter Blatty. In that movie about an insane asylum dwells a character named Frankie Reno who feels compelled to do an all dog production of Shakespeare. Now should Frankie ever film the fruits of his labor I'm convinced it would yield a better movie than Bigfoot.We're talking about a film whose production appears to consists of whatever can fit in the back of a pickup truck filmed at what I'm assuming was a breakneck pace to get a product in the can and distributed to America's drivein theaters maybe 'drivethru' is a more appropriate term. What I'm trying to say is I hope minimal time and resources were dedicated to this movie because the technical merits are so abysmal that the clearly deteriorating print from which the incorrectly framed DVD was made may actually be an improvement to the original projection over 30 years ago. I wish I were exaggerating.Seriously it defeats the purpose of a serious critical analysis want proof check out the cheesy DVD cover art. Instead dear reader I present the fun aspect of Bigfoot.I enjoyed how Joi Lansing piloted a plane that not surprisingly crashes  but not before a leisurely conversation with air traffic control while grips stand outside the obviously grounded plane and shake it back and forth to simulate midair turbulence. I giggled with condescending glee seeing this pilot parachute out descend and then cut to her on the ground wrapping up her chute my guess is the budget couldn't afford the ladder to simulate a landing. Let's not forget the masterful camerawork of the motorcycle gang riding through the woods  shots designed to instill an uneasy slightly nauseating sensation by vigorously shaking the frame as if  as if  the cameraman was sitting in the bed of a truck that had no shocks! And there's a brilliant moment in the party montage where it looked like someone dropped the camera.What brilliant economical editing too! Why show the plane taking off? Crashing? Or Joi landing? And the quick cuts showing the editorial equivalent of nothing to show the plane going down I guess. Oh and when Bigfoot's henchmen littlefoots? kidnap the pilot and the bikiniclad girl what's her name?  these two women are tied to barely visible saplings so their surprisingly calm conversation comes across as two highschool broads hanging around the cafeteria gossiping. So which of the furry guys who kidnapped us do you think is the cutest? Wait it gets better the bikini cladbabe maybe it was the pilot in her  whatever the hell that outfit's supposed to be gives us a quasiscientific run down of what these creatures are.A little bit later glorified monkeys checkmate the rescue party in a battle of wits the rescue party is tied to saplings next to the girls where they all uncannily resemble disgruntled company layoffs waiting in line at a soup kitchen.How 'bout John Carradine's car which the hare could outrun even if the tortoise gave him cement shoes and broke his legs. What am I saying? The tortoise could take an icepick to the hare push the corpse down a hill and the dead body could outrun that car not to mention require less maintenance to keep running. Speaking of John Carradine I hope you like ham and cheese with your turkey.And I learned a very valuable lesson from Bigfoot contrary to popular myth dynamite does not actually require a fuse. It only requires a moron to throw it and boom! I have a theory that films like Bigfoot are made as a selfhelp tool to make suicidal filmmakers feel better about their work. Even the most talentless hacks can watch it with the comfort of knowing well I can do better than that. Maybe life is worth living.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you list John Carradine's films in order of IMDb rating Bigfoot ranks second to last. This is a guy who starred in films titled Hillbillys in a Haunted House Billy the Kid vs. Dracula Vampire Hookers Satan's Cheerleaders and Sex Kittens Go to College among many many others. A gaggle of sasquatches are out looking for women to mate with in this extremely low budget flick that looks like it was filmed on spare sets from Hee Haw. John Carradine is the biggest star but you also have big breasted Joi Lansing and two kids of famous Hollywood actors Chris Mitchum and Lindsay Crosby. Robert Mitchum's brother John is also in it. Oh and Jerry Marren aka the greenshirted Munchkin from the Lollipop Guild as well as I believe the only Munchkin who survives to this day dons the costume of the child bigfoot. Anyway a biker chick and a downed female pilot get captured by bigfeet and Carradine and his bud John Mitchum join the gang hoping to make money by capturing a live bigfoot.

	onyx:emotionText "If you list John Carradine's films in order of IMDb rating Bigfoot ranks second to last. This is a guy who starred in films titled Hillbillys in a Haunted House Billy the Kid vs. Dracula Vampire Hookers Satan's Cheerleaders and Sex Kittens Go to College among many many others. A gaggle of sasquatches are out looking for women to mate with in this extremely low budget flick that looks like it was filmed on spare sets from Hee Haw. John Carradine is the biggest star but you also have big breasted Joi Lansing and two kids of famous Hollywood actors Chris Mitchum and Lindsay Crosby. Robert Mitchum's brother John is also in it. Oh and Jerry Marren aka the greenshirted Munchkin from the Lollipop Guild as well as I believe the only Munchkin who survives to this day dons the costume of the child bigfoot. Anyway a biker chick and a downed female pilot get captured by bigfeet and Carradine and his bud John Mitchum join the gang hoping to make money by capturing a live bigfoot. This is really cruddy and pretty boring. It's rated at a dismal 1.4 on IMDb. I laughed at it enough and it's short enough where I'll rate it a tad higher.

Apparently their race is dying off so they're needing women to have more creatures with. Jasper B. Hawks John Carradine gets the idea of capturing one for the money while a biker gang goes after the creature to get their women back.Bigfoot was always my favorite mythical monster when I was a kid and I was always disappointed because there really aren't too many good movies about him. I continue to watch movies on Bigfoot yet they continue to get worse and worse. This film doesn't have the greatest reputation around but it's certainly a real hoot and a rather fun film as long as you don't take it too serious.I mean just take a look at the sequence where the three hot ladies are tied up talking about why they have been captured. This here alone shows that the film wasn't supposed to be taken serious and then you throw in a biker gang and you've got pure drivein madness. There are some really nutty scenes throughout this movie but the greatest thing about it is the fact that they don't keep the monsters off screen. Nope the monsters are constantly on the screen and there are multiple ones as well as children!The cast is also a lot of fun as we get Joi Lansing as one of the victims Chris and John Mitchum and even Ken Maynard has a small role. Then there's Carradine who eats up the picture just like it was a big bowl of spaghetti. He's really a lot of fun here as he adds in the camp as this redneck looking to make a quick buck. His final line delivery ripping off the KING KONG ending is pure joy.As I said BIGFOOT isn't a masterpiece and it's not even a really good movie but if you enjoy these lowbudget monster movies then there's plenty here to enjoy.".

For instance the opening credits don't appear until almost the 10minute mark. Most the scenes leading up to this are overlong timewasters like Joi Lansing walking up to her small plane and entering. Totally pointless! I guess they had to pad this turkey somehow which is only 83 minutes long as it is. Also most of the acting is laughable and I mean that literally.For me the film's worthwhile for three reasons only 1. The gorgeous Judy Jordan in a bikini mostly tied up to a tree also check her out in 1973's underrated Western The Gatling Gun 2. the cool hippieera score and 3. the nostalgic badness of it all which is sort of entertaining.The movie was shot at Big Bear Lake and San Bernardino National Forest.GRADE D".

Not merely the fact that it has some good quality cast names in it John Carradine John Mitchum but because it is completely treacherous not only to the industry and the art form but to the filmmakers themselves. Making a movie like Bigfoot is like constructing the Empire State Building out of cardboard and expecting people to work in it every day without ever hearing a shred of complaint. It would also be astonishing that anybody even let you get that far. It's astonishing here too.We all know the cult legend of the Americas' simian wonder. Well as this movie would like us to believe there is not just one Sasquatch but dozens of them. And even though they are described in the film as being nine feet tall in reality they're just stubby mansized fuzzballs who carry around clubs and sticks and tie people to trees with...I'm not sure what that was or how they got it. And I don't want to waste my precious brain cells pondering over it.Anyway whatever. You've got a fashion model played by real life fashion model Joi Lansing who crashes her plane in the wilderness and is kidnapped by some lecherous Sasquatches. Then you have some rowdy bikers. One of their girls while wandering about the woods in nothing but her bra and panties is kidnapped by another. Her boyfriend sees the big ape and recruits a pair of goofball con men and they all embark on a mission to rescue their girls from the men in ape suits.The con men are played by John Carradine and John Mitchum of all people. These two marvelous talents who were so wonderful in so many movies are the only ones involved in this treacherous production who act like professionals. Though they could have easily just hammed their way through and nobdoy would have blamed them they stick through to the end even though they can't come within a lightyear of saving the movie.Bigfoot looks and sounds as if it were made by a group of bottom feeders who had never seen a movie before in their lives. The photography is grainy and amateur and the audio on the soundtrack is so poorly assembled and recorded that you find yourself constantly adjusting the volume on your TV set. The screenplay is just the same set of words and phrases being repeated over and over again and the editing is absolutely horrendous. There is a horrible shot where Joi Lansing is on the run from a Sasquatch. She runs past us in the foreground and keeps on running until she's against the horizon. Then the Sasquatch appears to follow her. Between that point and the first one we never cut away or adjust camera speed. Add to the fact that Joi Lansing was apparently trying to imitate Fay Wray in her screams and coming across as irksome. And the scene where she crashes her plane is missing not one but several key shots so that we don't even get the whole picture of what has happened.I don't think I even need to touch on the special effects.This is one of the worst most unremittingly agonizing and horrible movies ever made. As a person who has been and worked on a movie set and knows the pain and pressures that go into making a film I find it absolutely appalling that anybody would even proceed and suffer their way through the production of something like this. The business isn't even that much of a moneymaker for the cast and crew. It's the executives who really get the dough. So why bother unless you're at least going to put up an effort? There are other jobs out there. Other careers.".

Carradine may have been a decent actor at one time but by 1970 he was appearing in just about anything offered. As much as I enjoyed some other films with Christopher Mitchum Ricco and Summertime Killer to name just two he proves here how bad an actor he could be without a solid script. It's all so awful it's really not worth saying much more.After watching this movie I think I need to revisit some of the other films I've rated 110.

	schema:reviewBody "BIGFOOT is a trashy Zflick that manages to cash in on or rip off all kinds of popular trends from the period. The main thrust of the story about a family of Bigfoot creatures living out in the forests who kidnap young women for procreation has obviously been inspired by the supposedly genuine Roger Patterson Bigfoot footage that was shot in 1967 and released to much notoriety. This film even stages a homage in which one of the Bigfoot creatures strolls across open woodland just like in the movie. This flick becomes even more intriguing when watching as it transpires that the director was responsible for a couple of shoddy biker flicks before he made this and sure enough a 'biker gang' are soon involved in the proceedings although it has to be said that these bikers look more like university students! The idea of bikers vs. Bigfoot is a good one but this film ruins it through shocking execution. The biggest problem is that the scant running time is padded out with endless upon endless scenes of bikers riding through the woods cars driving through the woods sometimes just landscape shots of the woods itself. There's about one few second scene of Bigfoot 'action' and the rest of the running time is made up of talking which is boring. The characters are paperthin and the actors are all poor despite the presence of a few notables including John Carradine hamming it up in a monster flick as only he knew how brothers Christopher and John Mitchum both sons of Robert with none of his ability Joi Lansing a cheesecake starlet who strips down to a flimsy dress early on and stays that way throughout Bing Crosby's son Lindsay who makes no impression whatsoever even an exwestern star Ken Maynard severely down on his luck.The cast alone and cheese factor saved this from the list of 'very worst films' I've amassed but there isn't much to get excited about here. I thought things might pick up with the introduction of dynamite and a onearmed Bigfoot hunter but I was wrong. The creatures  for there are a whole host of them running about in the murk  look like a cross between 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY's apes and those cavemen brothers from the cartoon series WACKY RACES. Needless to say that the costumes are tatty beyond belief and the multiple references to KING KONG only serve as a reminder of what trash this is. BIGFOOT crashes and burns from the very beginning and is a total waste of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't let all the naysayers sway you. This is a little gem of a bad movie. By the best guess of many this is probably the very first flick to deal with the notion that the American wilderness was home to a large unknown primate species. Back in the primitive '70's the legend was just starting to get noticed and there was not a lot of information around concerning the supposed nature and habits of the creature. This left writerdirector Robert Slatzer plenty of room to let his imagination run wild and run wild it did. In his vision Sasquatch is not merely a wild animal afoot in the pacific Northwest it is a full blown cave man! According to him they have a language make stone tools know how to tie knots and bury their dead. Naturally they are also completely beguiled by sexy white women in the best King Kong tradition which leads them to kidnap several young ladies one from the ranks of a biker gang. This sets the plot into motion as a group of unlikely allies sets out to locate the ladies and rescue them from the lecherous monsters. That preceding description might have you thinking that it might not be a half bad flick. Don't get carried away. Slatzer may have a wild imagination but he's also completely clueless on how to tell a story cinematically. Suspense pacing believable dialogue etc. are all well beyond his feeble abilities. There is a hilarious scene where the two beauties are bound to poles and at the mercy of the bigfeet. you might imagine that the ladies would be scared out of their wits at this point but no. Slatzer has them calmly discuss the morphology of their captors. One girl even surmises that the child like creature in the group is a Sasquatchhuman hybrid! Ridiculous!John Carradine and John Mitchum are completely wasted in their roles as the avaricious traveling salesmen who hope to capture one of the critters and make a fortune. Location footage is mixed with cheesy sets that are easily distinguished from the real thing. No doubt Slatzer hoped nobody would be able to tell the difference. I had hoped that the climax of the film was going to be an unintentionally hilarious rumble between the bikers and the Bigfeet but no such luck. That would have probably taken days to film and Slatzer couldn't afford to rent the camera that long. Instead one of the creatures flees into a cave and a biker tosses in a bundle of dynamite. There is a lame excuse for an explosion and we are assured that we have just seen the end of the naughty Bigfoot but then a cryptic message appears on the screen Or Is It?? As it turns out yes it is. If Slatzer was planning a sequel it does not seem to have materialized and the world was able to get on with the understandable task of ignoring this guy's movies.".

Another thing I enjoyed about this movie is that the filmmakers actually shot some of the scenes in isolated California mountains were real sightings take place. Unlike more of the 70's Bigfoot movies this one was more of a fantasy or fiction than a docudrama like Sasquatch The Legend Of Bigfoot considering that a group of Bigfoot capture men and women and tie them to trees.

	schema:headline " John McClane Cyrus the Virus God and The Queen team up and kill people for laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "A retired CIA operative hunted by his own people reunites his old team for one last mission. It's certainly not an original story mashing together ideas that we've seen before in the Bourne series The Expendibles and The Losers. 'RED' which stands for 'Retired Extremely Dangerous' is the 4th film this year to be adapted from a graphic novel. It is also the 4th to feature men going on a mission and the 5th with a plot involving the CIA. I couldn't help but feel skeptical. But then I noticed the cast list and realised that this is meant to be a comedy. At this point I saw the project in a different light. 'RED' is a film in which John McClane God Cyrus the Virus and The Queen join forces and kill people for laughs. Clearly this was going to be a film where story and sense came second to cast and chemistry. From 'Die Hard' to 'Sin City' Bruce Willis' goodguyhavingabadday routine has evolved little but it does not need to be fixed. His performance in 'RED' is familiar but he is never less than entertaining. This time he brings with him an air of selfparody. Throughout the film he maintains a carefree pokerface as though he's done this so many times over the years that he can afford to be relaxed. There are valid attempts at making Willis seem more normal and these can be quite amusing. The first 10 minutes which show him adjusting to retirement and aimlessly wandering around the house in his dressing gown are reminiscent of Carl Fredricksen's first appearance as an old man in 'Up'. Deeper characterisation however only serves to show how abnormal he really is and it is a delight to see him in action.With the exception of Willis the cast is made up of actors who have no business waving guns around. Helen Mirren was an inspired choice as if making up for the predictability of Willis' casting. Flowerarranging OAP on the outside and badass hitwoman on the inside Mirren is strangely suited to action. There is something about the juxtaposition of her granlike demeanour with exaggerated violence that makes her very funny and extremely watchable. John Malkovich is particularly entertaining in his performance as a mentally questionable conspiracy theorist who refuses to retire peacefully. After the numerous roles he has played with an undercurrent of insanity it is hilarious to see him go fullon howling mad. It is not often that Malkovich gets to flex his comedy muscles but he steals every scene in which he appears.Morgan Freeman is unfortunately the weakest part of this alternative ATeam not because of his performance but because he is underutilised. He has little action time and even less characterisation. There is a glimpse at pervyoldman behaviour which could have been funny and a mention of health problems which could have been touching but these are quickly forgotten. It is as though the writers were distracted trying too hard to develop a secondary storyline involving Willis' romance with a pension office clerk. This subplot adds little and distracts from the main picture. It is a pity because the wasted effort could have been more effectively put into making the story tighter or on giving Morgan Freeman more screen time.Overall this is a good laugh even if you won't remember it afterwards. Taking things less seriously and trying less hard to be cool means that 'RED' is more fun than 'The Expendibles' and less embarrassing too. Stallone can mumble all he wants about shooting real action  I'd rather see the Queen fire machine guns.".

	onyx:emotionText "A retired CIA operative hunted by his own people reunites his old team for one last mission. It's certainly not an original story mashing together ideas that we've seen before in the Bourne series The Expendibles and The Losers. 'RED' which stands for 'Retired Extremely Dangerous' is the 4th film this year to be adapted from a graphic novel. It is also the 4th to feature men going on a mission and the 5th with a plot involving the CIA. I couldn't help but feel skeptical. But then I noticed the cast list and realised that this is meant to be a comedy. At this point I saw the project in a different light. 'RED' is a film in which John McClane God Cyrus the Virus and The Queen join forces and kill people for laughs. Clearly this was going to be a film where story and sense came second to cast and chemistry. From 'Die Hard' to 'Sin City' Bruce Willis' goodguyhavingabadday routine has evolved little but it does not need to be fixed. His performance in 'RED' is familiar but he is never less than entertaining. This time he brings with him an air of selfparody. Throughout the film he maintains a carefree pokerface as though he's done this so many times over the years that he can afford to be relaxed. There are valid attempts at making Willis seem more normal and these can be quite amusing. The first 10 minutes which show him adjusting to retirement and aimlessly wandering around the house in his dressing gown are reminiscent of Carl Fredricksen's first appearance as an old man in 'Up'.

However it was exactly what I was looking for.You have a great team of actors. They are not even action heroes maybe that did it but they do a great job. just look at that cast Bruce Willis John Malkovich Morgan Freeman Brian Cox Hellen Mirren Richard Dreyfuss even Ernest Borgnine! As the younger crew Karl Urban and MaryLouise Parker are in it and they both play well. But more than that each character actually has a role. They don't just come in say a few inconsequential things then die or are completely forgotten cough James Remar cough.So it had the ridiculously packed action and at times it looked and sounded like Ocean's Eleven who cares? The rest was great! Even the fight scenes... not even the bad guys go out in full view firing wildly then getting shot. People actually took cover helped each other and synchronized their moves. The lines were funny and somewhat complex and all the people on the set were clearly having fun doing what they loved.Bottom line I don't know maybe because the director is unseasoned in the ways of Hollywood the movie turned out to be so good. Or maybe it was the cast. Or maybe it was the fun of it. The movie turned out great with a few screwups that I am ready to ignore. The mashup is Jason Bourne meets The Expendables via luckily for us just a pinch of Ocean's Eleven.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Bruce Willis plays his indestructible yet on the surface everyday guy he is right where the audience loves him. In RED Retired Extremely Dangerous he has a close to perfect vehicle. And so RED delivers in spite of a fairly ridiculous scenario of a group of exCIA operativesor which Willis is one being singled out for execution on the eve of the vicepresident announcing his candidacy for president.We get the message from the first that Willis is somewhat lonely and bored with retirement and is searching for a companion to make his new life matter. He isn't aching to get back to fast track but is venerable and is fixated on a kind and cheery voice on the other end of the phone line when he complains about not getting his pension checks he tears them up just to talk to his handler. He arranges a meeting with the sweet sounding gal just prior to everything falling apart because the CIA sends in a wet team to erase him. As suspected the CIA as well as most all the resources of the government are not up to the task.Willis reassembles his old team all in his age bracket or older in order to survive. That team if not on the surface a formidable threat is pure cinematic gold as it consists of excellent performances by Morgan Freeman John Malkovich and Helen Mirren. It is almost impossible not to like this film because of the wonderfully entertaining supporting cast. In fact Malkovich steals the show providing the correct dosage of crazed comic relief. This leads to impossible feats making for deliciously served up entertainment all with a nodandawink that cuts through the unbelievable. Great action with comedy! Richard Dreyfus turns in a solid performance as a spoiled smartass uberwealthy and powerful arms dealer who pulls strings behind the scenes. And Ernest Borgnine has a cameo role which is memorable.It's a character driven action comedy that truly is RED ridiculous entertaining delightful. This movie gets a 7.5 and as such is hard to fault in spite of being pure lightweight fluff. See it and smile.".

That is certainly one of many philosophies in the action comedy RED That would be Retired Extremely Dangerous for those still living in fear of Communism. Hey it is the right age bracket which collects a who's who of Oscargrade talent and has them blow stuff up real good. This is but the fourth menonamission film so far this year after The Expendables The ATeam and The Losers heck even Inception could fall into that group. The good news is with the exception of the latter it is the best of the bunch and by far the most fun you're bound to have this fall season. Now onto the CIA. I don't know what they're dipping their dirty little fingers into Stateside but in addition to being at the center of some ticked off senior's attention in RED they have been the villains in aforementioned The Losers and The ATeam as well as Salt and Knight  Day. Talk about your need for homeland security they had better keep one of those hightech satellites over Hollywood. At the receiving end of the Central Intelligence Agency's scope are a band of former operatives including the kid of the group Frank Moses Bruce Willis the ailing Joe Matheson Morgan Freeman the brainfried eccentric Marvin Boggs John Malcovich and the sultry heartbreaker Victoria Helen Mirren. Brian Cox also shows up as a Ruskie who may or may not have been previously shot by one of the former. Though not having seen action in a good decade they have been deemed RED by an unknown force which means curtains for this ragtag bunch of geriatrics. The cast truly is great in RED and I don't simply mean the actors in general they simply all give fullon great funny performances. The subtle but hilarious underlying lament of these characters is they all reminisce over their past lives as hardened assassins and pine just to kill one more little ol' person. More at the forefront of course is the bangon wry humour and delicious action sequences. This is old fashion stunt work at play here fittingly perhaps and I'll take it over a green screen any day. These bursts of adrenaline are dumb to be sure but not totally ludicrous think of a cross between Die Hard and Enemy of the State. What they are not is anything short of exciting and kinetic and are interspersed with laughs in such a way as to not drift to one focus too long. RED also gleefully embraces its comic book origins using playful transitions as the globetrotting commences. Yet again director Robert Schwentke never revels in one gimmick for too long and the film goes down smooth and easy as a result.The younger cast is more than worth mentioning as well with the highest accolades going to MaryLouis Parker from TV's Weeds. There is a joke in RED which I am not sure was intentioned when after being injected with a knockoutdrug Parker's Sarah exclaims I'm so high. She steals most scenes when given the chance but her character a love interest of Frank who unintentionally gets caught up in the fracas is utilized far more towards the beginning of the film. Karl Urban is also solid as a CIA operative tasked in finding the RED's but becomes suspicious at his orders which grow increasingly corrupt. I always wonder in the movie world how they would explain attack helicopters shredding an airport to the general public. The government must have some amazing PR agents on staff. Richard Dreyfus in his second cameo of the year after Piranha is also well used as an oily arms dealer who comes across the team's path.Summit Entertainment is pulling out all the marketing stops for this film and I am happy to report the results seem to be worth the glamour. While venturing through my theatres ticket checkpoint they stamped my stub confidential instead of ripping it and a squad of agents clad in sunglasses and suits patrolled the lobby. The showing seemed to be a generous mix of old and new patrons and that really comes as no surprise. Even though the majority of the cast has long breached 60 these are actors generations of all ages still admire. Even if they are not the draws they once were some of them never were this is a great example of people showing up to see actors performers and not special effects. RED may be imperfect it may not even be particularly fresh but it exudes something movies lack far too often fun.playeraffinity.com".

	schema:reviewBody "RED  CATCH IT  B  Red completely justified to its Slogan RetiredExtremeDangerous. The whole movie plays out really cool funny and clever. In recent times Bruce Willis's movies becomes very cocky and senseless despite of lots of heavy Action Drama and even comedy. RED is funny from the beginning and opening phone chat sequence between Bruce Willis and MaryLouise Parker gives out lots of dept and characterization. After that it's a nonstop roller coaster ride and we get to meet so many interesting characters one by one. Now let's talk about the great actors who actually made the movie work like no one has expected. Bruce Willis is at his best in RED I think after Die Hard action franchise finally Bruce Willis got another action franchise which can be preceded further. Bruce's amazing wit Sharp action moves made it really thrilling experience. Trust Me! Watching Bruce Willis coming out of the heavy speed moving car was just outlandish. You have to watch that scene to believe it! MaryLouise Parker is adorable after watching her racyfunny side on WEEDS from almost 4 5 years it's so fun to see her in Big Star studded movie with her crazy witness and attitude. She is really fun to watch the chemistry between Bruce Willis  MaryLouise Parker is wonderful. John Malkovich is Hilarious I never knew this man can be so funny his moves dialogues thus every thing was great and he pretty much steals the scene when he is on screen. Morgan Freeman was the slowest among all of them in humor I guess though he did pretty decent job in his small role. Last but not the Least we are introduced to Dame Helen Mirren who just simply stole the show seriously watching her moving that machine gun like a fire cracker is unbelievable. She brought the utmost charisma to the team of RED. The youngest cast member of the movie was promising actor Karl urban his tux made him move like 007  he gave an utmost completion to the RED team the best thing about Karl urban was that he brought freshness to the movie. Brian Cox Julian McMohan and Richard Dreyfuss were good. Overall it's a fun ride which no one should miss on any chance. Watch it in first moment!".

	onyx:emotionText "RED  CATCH IT  B  Red completely justified to its Slogan RetiredExtremeDangerous. The whole movie plays out really cool funny and clever. In recent times Bruce Willis's movies becomes very cocky and senseless despite of lots of heavy Action Drama and even comedy. RED is funny from the beginning and opening phone chat sequence between Bruce Willis and MaryLouise Parker gives out lots of dept and characterization. After that it's a nonstop roller coaster ride and we get to meet so many interesting characters one by one. Now let's talk about the great actors who actually made the movie work like no one has expected. Bruce Willis is at his best in RED I think after Die Hard action franchise finally Bruce Willis got another action franchise which can be preceded further. Bruce's amazing wit Sharp action moves made it really thrilling experience. Trust Me! Watching Bruce Willis coming out of the heavy speed moving car was just outlandish. You have to watch that scene to believe it! MaryLouise Parker is adorable after watching her racyfunny side on WEEDS from almost 4 5 years it's so fun to see her in Big Star studded movie with her crazy witness and attitude. She is really fun to watch the chemistry between Bruce Willis  MaryLouise Parker is wonderful. John Malkovich is Hilarious I never knew this man can be so funny his moves dialogues thus every thing was great and he pretty much steals the scene when he is on screen. Morgan Freeman was the slowest among all of them in humor I guess though he did pretty decent job in his small role. Last but not the Least we are introduced to Dame Helen Mirren who just simply stole the show seriously watching her moving that machine gun like a fire cracker is unbelievable.

The humour is hilarious mostly a subtle humour that is apparent throughout the entire film in nearly every scene.Bruce Willis MaryLouise Parker Morgan Freeman John Malkovich Helen Mirren Brian Cox and Karl Urban all excel as would be expected. It is refreshing watching Bruce Willis star in another action film alongside MaryLouise Parker the gorgeous mother in Weeds no less. John Malkovich plays the paranoid role quite astonishingly and Helen Mirren firing large weapons including a gatling gun is amazing! Every name above plays an equal part in the film which is amazing. I never had so many characters in a single movie that I highly enjoyed equally. Remarkably done with talent seeping through the actors and vividly portrayed on the screen. Don't expect this film to change the history of all films but expect it to exceed in entertainment. If you give it a chance you won't be disappointed. It's definitely a Friday night flick something that is easily enjoyed.Brilliance!".

Great all around supporting cast. Morgan Freeman is always a nice touch to any film. Helen Miran firing a Rambo sized gun is worth the admission alone. If you miss the classic Bruce Willis Action Comedies this one makes up for all the bad ones in recent years. But what really makes this film worth seeing in theatres with an audience is John Malkovich! John Malkovich steals the show with maybe the performance of his career. If Johnny Depp can get nominated for Pirates and Robert Downey Jr. can get nominated for Tropic Thunder then Malkovich should get nominated for this seriously. Every time he came on screen the whole theatre would be dying with laughter.Movies are expensive now and not all of them are worth seeing in theatre but this one is. It's not the best film ever made the story could have been a little tighter but I can promise you'll have a lot of fun and you will be laughing your ass off through most of it.".

One day he finds himself under attack at home. After taking care of the attackers he goes on a quest to find out why someone wants him dead.RED stamped on Willis' CIA file stands for retired extremely dangerous. The movie is based on the graphic novel of the same name. Loads of big time actors show up while Willis is on the search for the killers. Some of them are other retired CIA agents Freeman Malkovich Mirren. Then there's the federal retirement clerk and love interest to Willis' character mary Louise Parker who steals the movie and an old Russian KGB agent Brian Cox who always does a great acting job. They team together to find out why they and others have been targeted to be killed. Helen Mirren as a hitwoman is a hoot. Malkovich is fun as an oddball exagent. Great cameos by Ernest Borgnine and Richard Dreyfuss. I enjoyed watching them all.I think the movie is meant to be a comedy but the script could be punchier. I sat for long periods watching an ordinary spy movie plot unfold with few laughs. OK I was wowed by the actors but let down by the script. Willis is in his element. Freeman is underutilized but works well as part of the team. If you're a fan of these actors you might want to see the movie to watch them play together. They seem to be having fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't been to the cinema much recently as for me there hasn't really be many films out that have caught my attention. The last film I saw at the pictures was the impressive The Town directed by Ben Affleck that I saw in late September. Red I saw in a trailer prior to that and it looked like terrific fun and was a film I was very much looking forward to. The 7.7 IMDb rating on this film in my opinion is a little extravagant and isn't really justified. It's for me hard to avoid the conclusion that the director Robert Schwentke just placed all the fun moments in the trailer for the sake of drawing the audience to the cinema in a way but it isn't entirely true.The basic story starts off with exCIA agent Frank Mose's chats on the phone to Sarah Ross MaryLouise Parker whom have a thing for each other when Frank is attacked by CIA operatives who attempt to kill him. He hooks up with Sarah and other retired CIA agents along the way which include Joe Matheson Morgan Freeman Victoria Helen Mirren Marvin Boggs John Malkovich and Ivan Simonov Brian Cox to try and find out why their own government wants to kill them. Whilst the CIA appoint operative William Cooper Karl Urban to apprehend Frank.The story is quite basic and the screenplay is functional at best whilst there are some funny moments the script isn't witty or sharp enough and that's where the film loses it's edge. There were moments particularly in the first forty minutes where the movie threatens to be dragged down by it's slow pace and mediocre script but the film does pick up and get better later even if things get a little silly. In terms of the acting Willis gives an okay performance but I was a bit disappointed to be honest. He tries to sparkle but he just couldn't and it felt very run of the mill whilst Malkovich has a few decent comic moments but Freeman and Mirren hold themselves much better with more spark in their eyes and wittiness in the projection of the dialogue they speak. They sounded like they were enjoying themselves. Karl Urban does solidly well for his more serious supporting role but the best person in this was Mary Parker as Sarah. She was terrific as a woman living a normal life but coming to grips that the man she like is a CIA agent and becomes immersed in his world. The action was great and smoothly handled and the music was very good. The style as well was handled nicely as to some extent trying to be cool.Red has been compared to the terrible The Expendables which is similar in terms of story retired soldiers coming against their own government but that is where the similarities end. As Red is much better than that trash. Maybe this wasn't as good as it could have been but it's entertaining enough and is worth seeing. I wouldn't say no to seeing it again but I would only rent it out on DVD not see at the pictures or buy it. Saying that it's an enjoyable enough ride and should satisfy anyone's need for harmless entertainment.".

Bruce Willis played the same character he always does from the Whole Nine Yards and the rest of the cast was clich beyond belief. By the end of the movie you just don't care what happens. The movie tried to be Oceans Eleven but failed horribly. The most annoying thing throughout the ENTIRE movie I mean every single scene was the forced soundtrack. Every single scene and I mean all of them had music playing in the background that was completely unnecessary. Five seconds would go by and oh there it is just a bland soundtrack trying to force the movie into an action or just terrible comedic scene.If you like corny not funny and downright dumb films then RED is for you.

To start it has a starstudded cast Bruce Willis Die Hard Pulp Fiction Morgan Freeman The Shawshank Redemption Se7en John Malkovich Dangerous Liaisons Burn After Reading Helen Mirren The Queen Excalibur and Karl Urban Star Trek The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers. All of these actors played their characters perfectly. The film got into the action almost from the very start and I was thinking that it would be more of an action film than an action comedy but I waited about 2030 minutes and i discovered how wrong I was. The movie continued to be perfect in every way besides the plot did't make total sense to me. Red was a film that I had originally not thought so greatly off. I saw the trailer and thought that could be pretty good but I'll wait until it comes out on DVD. Now I regret thinking that. Red had me on the edge of my seat the entire way through while also making me crack up laughing. If you thought about this film but then decided no I would definitely Reconsider watching this film. Rating 710".

	onyx:emotionText "Red was a great actioncomedy film which I would recommend for anyone who likes the genre. To start it has a starstudded cast Bruce Willis Die Hard Pulp Fiction Morgan Freeman The Shawshank Redemption Se7en John Malkovich Dangerous Liaisons Burn After Reading Helen Mirren The Queen Excalibur and Karl Urban Star Trek The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers. All of these actors played their characters perfectly. The film got into the action almost from the very start and I was thinking that it would be more of an action film than an action comedy but I waited about 2030 minutes and i discovered how wrong I was. The movie continued to be perfect in every way besides the plot did't make total sense to me. Red was a film that I had originally not thought so greatly off. I saw the trailer and thought that could be pretty good but I'll wait until it comes out on DVD. Now I regret thinking that. Red had me on the edge of my seat the entire way through while also making me crack up laughing. If you thought about this film but then decided no I would definitely Reconsider watching this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Like Michael Corleone Bruce Willis is out and they drag him back in but this isn't business. Someone has got a black ops operation on some retired black ops operators. Enough to make anyone see Red.It's quite a reunion Willis has as he starts looking around and sees that a lot of former colleagues are meeting sudden demises. He gets to a few of them like Morgan Freeman Helen Mirren and John Malkovich and he even gets a Russian consultant in former KGB agent Brian Cox. When they're not reminiscing about old times Cox does help point them in the right direction. Red must have taken some inspiration from the two Over The Hill gang movies from the Sixties. Without the western setting and those colorful western character actors Red gets quite a few laughs in mostly from John Malkovich. He's easily the best performance in Red playing a paranoid survivalist who has learned to be paranoid it does keep the group alive or most of them in this film.Willis has perfected a nice dead pan comic style in his performance. Although I really can't see what Mary Louise Parker the young woman working at Social Security who gets involved with Willis and then enmeshed in their counter ops operation.What's this all about let's just say that it's coming from the highest or nearly the highest level possible. Someone doesn't want a lot of people around to tell tales. And at the end of the film I'd love to know how the government covers up what happens in the climax.93 year old Ernest Borgnine is trying to surpass John Gielgud's record of still acting when he was 97 has a small but important role as the record keeper in the underground vault of the Central Intelligence Agency. Talk about knowing where all the bodies are buried. Ernie looks remarkable for his age and this is not his last project.Try to catch Red it's stylish paranoia to be sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "He got old. Then some thumbsucker came along and tagged him RED Retired Extremely Dangerous. Robert Schwentke The Time Traveler's Wife and Flightplan had the privilege of directing a talented cast including Bruce Willis MaryLouise Parker Helen Mirren John Malkovich Morgan Freeman Brian Cox Karl Urban and Richard Dreyfuss. A lot of big names for the latest adaptation of the DC Comic graphic novel written by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner. One would expect nothing could go wrong with a movie with such great star power but I was disappointed with this lightly entertaining comedy slash action flick. Red suffers from a poorly adapted screenplay written by Jon and Erich Hoeber the guys who brought us one of the worst films of 2009 Whiteout. The plot is really bad and the actors do the best they can in order to save the film. There are some funny moments but far too few thanks to the talent from the entire cast that save the movie from falling into horrible territory. John Malkovich gives a very comedic and surprising performance but unfortunately he doesn't get enough screen time to save the movie. The rest of the cast give good performances but they are far from memorable. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and MaryLouise Parker Weeds is pretty decent although nothing we haven't seen before. I really expected this movie would have a lot more funnier moments but the screenplay failed to help out the great cast. Red could have been much better if the producers would have taken more time in finding better screenwriters. I just felt this movie was like an AllStar team without a good coach to help them win the championship. With a better plot Red would have been a great and memorable movie.Bruce Willis is Frank Moses a former CIA agent who is now retired and having a difficult time making the transition. The only thing that seems to keep him going is when he gets to speak over the phone with his government pension representative Sarah Ross MaryLouise Parker. Her life doesn't seem all that exciting either and she spends her days working and reading sexy spy novels. Sarah and Frank spend a lot of time on the phone discussing their boring and lonely lives without having ever met but they seem to enjoy each other. Their daily routines will change all of a sudden when someone puts a hit on Frank and tries killing him. Frank might be old but he's still got game. He manages to elude the dozen of assassins that are sent to his home and decides to give Sarah a visit in Kansas City guessing she might be in danger as well. Frank will need some help in order to discover who is after him so he decides to get his old CIA team back together Marvin Boggs John Malkovich Victoria Helen Mirren and Joe Matheson Morgan Freeman. They are all more than happy to get back in action since they all seem to have difficulties adapting to their retiree lives. Together they begin delving into the past in search for clues while at the same time they have to face the young CIA agent who is after them William Cooper Karl Urban. Richard Dreyfuss Brian Cox and Julian McMahon also have smaller roles in the film.I really wished this movie would have been funnier considering the talented cast. Malkovich is by far the funniest one in the film I've seen Willis in better roles Freeman doesn't add anything to the story Urban being one of the younger actors proved he has what it takes to stand next to these Alist actors LouiseParker was pretty funny in this movie but she is way better in Weeds and Helen Mirren always brings her A game to the table. I didn't have a problem with the performances but I just wished they would have done a better job with the plot and the screenplay. This is one of those movies that looks hilarious in the trailers but then you discover it isn't actually that funny when sitting through the 100 minute film. Red is not terrible. I actually had a decent time watching it but it is just light entertainment I wouldn't consider recommending it or watching it over again. The movie did give me a nostalgic feeling seeing how so many of these actors are actually close to their retirement but they still have the talent if given the right script to work with. I am a huge Bruce Willis fan but I have to admit John Malkovich stole each scene he was in. Richard Dreyfuss and Brian Cox both have small parts in this movie but they are really funny in it as well. Seeing these brilliant actors working together is the highlight of the film but they should have brought in some talented screenwriters as well.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

I just wanted to provide this review an initial Shining moment. OK enough. I am here to review the actioncomedy Red. So rede or not here I come. At first I was a little puzzled upon seeing that Red was nominated for a Best Motion Picture ComedyMusical Golden Globe nomination last year. But I must admit now that Red was a viable nominee. I had much fun watching this movie about retired blackops agents who reassemble their team when retired ops leader Frank Moses is targeted by a group of assailants who might very well have government connections. Red stands for retired and extremely dangerous which fits the bill these days of Regis Philbin George Bush both of them and Joan Rivers is she retired?. Director Robert Schwentke excels in keeping the Red action unpredictable with a nice touch of sarcastic comedy due much to the on target screenplay of Jon  Erich Hoeber. The geriatric and nongeriatric cast of Red was stellar even though that is old news since this movie was released last year. Bruce Willis was vintage Bruce with his wily performance as Frank Moses. Malkovich! Malkovich! Malkovich! Sorry I got a bit excited that the actor human being John Malkovich was in this movie and delivered yet another scenestealing performance as retired ops Marvin Boggs. Morgan Freeman as retired ops Joe Matheson did not have to do much acting but his presence is always welcome in any movie even when his narration is not required. Damn was Dame Helen Mirren good as the badass retired ops Victoria and they give her a machine gun in this one! Yea Baby! Other great supporting turns came in the way of Brian Cox playing Russian inside man Ivan Simanov Karl Urban as CIA Agent William Cooper and the lovely MaryLouise Parker as Moses' romantic interest Sarah Ross. So head on over to the red light district and get the red out and get your DVD or BluRay Player ready for Red.  Good".

The nonstop action entwined with very funny situations make this film one of the best of the genre that I have recently seen. My family and I laughed a lot with the group of retired extremely dangerous agents but John Malkovich steals the film with his paranoid character that sees conspiracy everywhere and most of the time is right. MaryLouise Parker and Helen Mirren are great surprises since this is not their usual genre. If you a seeking a movie simply to entertain and shutdown the brain Red is certainly the right one. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Red  Aposentados e Perigosos Red  Retired and Dangerous".

	schema:reviewBody "From the moment Bruce Willis became the perfect action hero in Die Hard he has been an audience favorite when overcoming insurmountable odds while barely getting bruised for his efforts. In this turn Bruce isn't a cop but a retired CIA agent who some unknown force is looking to liquidate. As in past films swarms of bad supposed good guys come after him. As always by stealth or by force Willis outguns or is no match for whomever is sent to get him.First it is a CIA hit squad. Then the always good Karl Urban  Chronicles of Riddick The Bourne Supremacy  is put on the case and the cat and mouse game unfolds as Willis seeks to learn why he has been targeted for assassination.Unlike the Bourne movies always deadly serious this movie actually successfully combines comedy with action to create an amusing travelogue set like chapters to a book by the use of postcards with the location of the next scenario. What sets this movie apart is an eclectic mixture of actors you would never expect to see in a Willis action movie. Joining Willis in his quest are no less than Morgan Freeman John Malkovitch Helen Mirren and Brian Cox other retired agents and Cox as the exKGB agent. The former nemesis is now a friend and those who should be friends his exCIA employers are now the bad guys.Malkovitch is the scene stealer every time he is on the screen and his LSD induced mania described tongue in cheek by Willis is the result of a past CIA experiment in which Malkovitch was dosed for eleven years. The paranoid exagent is usually right when he senses danger but is still remarkably efficient and proficient even in his crazed state.Mary Louise Parker is the innocent caught up in the whirlwind of Willis' hunt for clues and becomes the hunted along with him. She joins the zany bunch of elder agents by circumstance at first then by choice. Willis a bored retiree has a long distance crush for the government pension girl who doesn't realize his former line of work and who is forced into the fray because as Willis says they know I like you.Mayhem explosions full scale attacks by huge forces are still no match for the indestructible hero though there is a sacrifice made and some blood shed by some of the Willis cohorts.This isn't rocket science but a great date movie a good time and most important worth the investment in a ticket. The last time I could say that was Inception. Look for the cameos of Ernest Borgnine and Richard Dreyfuss. An 8 out of 10 for perfect execution of a Willis reprisal and revival. Go see and have fun too.".

It lacks the fancy CGI that we have come to expect and is in my opinion actually the better for this lack.

	schema:reviewBody "It's been ages since I've seen this film and it holds about as much interest for me as when I first saw it. It's entertaining on a certain level and holds some interest.Some minor notes before progressing with my comments Kalidor in reality is Conan's alternate name. That is to say Conan and Kalidor are one in the same person as per Robert Howard's authorship. Ergo Laurentis casting Arnie in the role was most likely deliberate though Governor Schwarzenegger and his then agent may have had the wool pulled over their eyes and had this little fact kept from them when approached for the role. In fact and essence you're seeing Conan the Barbarian III in spite of the Red Sonja title.But enough of that. Can Bridgette Neilson act? Yeah sure. Is she Oscar material? Err... no. Was she right for the role? Probably. How about the other roles? Me I think Sandahl Bergman rejoining the Conan cast as a lesbian queen was a fine choice. And pardon my prurient interest but I think she's hotter as a brunette with short hair than as a natural blonde The film is what it is a thinly veiled knockoff of the first two Conan films though again it really IS a third albeit unofficial installment of the franchise so to speak. The sets and art direction for a moderately budgeted sequel are actually fairly impressive though one gets the sense that there's some slight of hand being used to mask budgetary limitations. And believe it or not it works after a fashion. There's the usual we can't afford to costume real life size armies so we'll allude to armies and battles in dialog than actually show them thing going on. But there're enough costumed bodies to get the gist across that our antagonist does command vast hosts to conquer the Hyborean world. Other technical aspects it's not a poorly shot film but the cinematography doesn't recapture Milius' touch with the first Conan film. But then again there is a kind of artistic professionalism that comes across in this movie that can be admired after a fashion. The one thing that strikes me visually other than the elaborate and well designed costumes and set pieces is the fact that even though the cinematography is respectable there's no real theme to it. The shots are fairly static but well composed yet there's no underlying dynamic to them. In essence the cast and crew were told to do their best with the material they were given and they do so in spades.This isn't to say the film is outstanding because it isn't. But everyone puts their best foot forward in a film that's pretty much all business. That is to say it was given a nice clean professional coat but lacked a certain integrity that comes across in the script. We are in fact and essence watching Robert Howard's feminized version of Conan do her thing and not much else.What could have improved this film? Lots of things I suppose. A bigger budget for one to actually stage some large battle sequences as Sandahl's character goes about conquering the world. Neilson does her doubleY chromosome thing as an Arnie imitation but is perhaps off par by a stroke or two in terms of performance. Arnie does his thing and Sandahl does hers she actually gives a respectable performance. Reyes Junior is who he is and does an adequate job as a spoiled brat.The truth of the matter is that this film was made in the 80s when female marketed films weren't seen as big money makers and so it was budgeted as such i.e. it wasn't expected to make lots of money but financed to put on a good show. Red Sonja is to the Conan films as Supergirl was to the Superman films. All in all it's another De Laurentis production. Take it for what it is interesting and entertaining popcorn fare.".

Evil Queen Gedren steals a mystical talisman from a group of virginal priestess warriors and butchers them all in the process. She plans to unleash a great evil on the world but one her victim's was the sister of Sonja a fearless warrior. She decides to travel to Gedren stop her plans and get revenge. On her way she meets an impudent young Prince and his servant and Kalidor a great swordsman. Together they try to save the world but Kalidor and Sonja still wish to prove to each other who is the superior fighter.Unfortunately the whole film looks cheap and most of the effects aren't great. Even the sweeping camerawork used to great effect in Conan the Barbarian is nowhere near as good here and the plot is basic. Arnie is good in the role but his part is not very big. Neilson is OK credit must go to both for their training and stuntwork but she fails to show any great emotion. The character is not given much depth though focused on revenge rather than going through any grieving process. The young Prince is constantly annoying but he and his master do provide a few laughs. Bergman is good as Gedren but she has begun to be typecast which is unfortunate as she is a strong performer. The action is good but without proper involvement in the story it seems hollow. Arnie fans should enjoy it but it is over course vastly inferior to his later and prior classics. Still an average fantasy though.6 out of 10".

	schema:headline " A fun guilty pleasure";
	schema:reviewBody "OK I know I'm going to either get a lot of hate for this and a lot of confused emails but Red Sonja to me is an ultimate guilty pleasure. My sister and I used to watch this movie all the time when we were kids we both wanted to so badly fight with Red Sonja and be apart of the group. So oddly after years of not watching this since I was a kid my sister and I found the DVD for 5 dollars and decided to watch it. Oh the things that are so wrong with this film that makes it so right again. Looking to be a spin off of Conan we were introduced to Red Sonja played by FlavaFlav's ultimate true love Bridgitte Nielson. The 6 foot tall drink of glass shows us that this was her acting class as she rehearses her lines as if she had just read them the night before and screams Gedren where are you?! while moving her mouth in the strangest way. She teams up with world's other tall drink of  beef? Arnold Schwarzenegger as they battle it out on who can act the worst? Well who knows who will win with this silly story.A large temple full of whiterobed priestesses are getting ready to destroy a large glowing green orb called the Talisman. This dangerous artifact's destructive power increases from exposure to light and the priestesses intend to destroy it before it gets out of control. However the evil Queen Gedren and Ikol attack with their army. The warriorpriestesses resist but are ultimately subdued by Gedren's forces. Gedren gets her hands on the Talisman but not before proving the myth that only women can touch it and survive. Gedren orders the remaining priestesses to be imprisoned in the vault which held the Talisman. One of those priestesses Varna manages to escape. She doesn't get far before she's mortally wounded by an arrow in the back. As luck would have it she literally falls into the arms of the mighty Lord Kalidor. She begs him to help find her sister Red Sonja. Sonja has been training with a Chinese sword master when Kalidor informs Sonja about her sister. Sonja arrives just in time for Varna to tell her about what happened at the temple. Before dying Sonja's sister urges her to find the Talisman and destroy it or else the world will be destroyed. Everything about this movie is bad but that's what I love about it. You know how sometimes you just need a bad movie that you can make fun of and have a good time with? Supposedly Arnold Schwarzenegger jokes that he uses this movie as punishment for his kids when they act up. Is it that bad? It is bad but it's a ton of fun. I loved the action Arnold fighting Bridgitte for her love as no man may have her unless he's trying to kill her lol. I loved the last fight scene between Red Sonja and Queen Gedren Gedren loves pulling a ton of jump cuts on her as well as one of Gedren's wizards who is using vodoo to cut Sonja to weaken her then when she discovers the wizard instead of him cutting her again he just stands there lol. Also the little Prince Tarn with Falkon was classic and they worked so well together. I think the scene that made me laugh the most was when Red Sonja Prince Tarn and Falkon are stuck in the cave with the machine dragon and Arnold is just riding around with it making it look more like a roller coaster ride rather than a fight for his life lol! My opinion if a movie entertains you even if it is bad why fight it? This is a good bad movie and I know I will always enjoy it. My recommendation being if you have an open mind and decide to just let go and enjoy the ride Red Sonja takes you on take it or leave it.710".

	onyx:emotionText "OK I know I'm going to either get a lot of hate for this and a lot of confused emails but Red Sonja to me is an ultimate guilty pleasure. My sister and I used to watch this movie all the time when we were kids we both wanted to so badly fight with Red Sonja and be apart of the group. So oddly after years of not watching this since I was a kid my sister and I found the DVD for 5 dollars and decided to watch it. Oh the things that are so wrong with this film that makes it so right again. Looking to be a spin off of Conan we were introduced to Red Sonja played by FlavaFlav's ultimate true love Bridgitte Nielson. The 6 foot tall drink of glass shows us that this was her acting class as she rehearses her lines as if she had just read them the night before and screams Gedren where are you?! while moving her mouth in the strangest way. She teams up with world's other tall drink of  beef? Arnold Schwarzenegger as they battle it out on who can act the worst? Well who knows who will win with this silly story.A large temple full of whiterobed priestesses are getting ready to destroy a large glowing green orb called the Talisman. This dangerous artifact's destructive power increases from exposure to light and the priestesses intend to destroy it before it gets out of control. However the evil Queen Gedren and Ikol attack with their army. The warriorpriestesses resist but are ultimately subdued by Gedren's forces. Gedren gets her hands on the Talisman but not before proving the myth that only women can touch it and survive. Gedren orders the remaining priestesses to be imprisoned in the vault which held the Talisman. One of those priestesses Varna manages to escape. She doesn't get far before she's mortally wounded by an arrow in the back. As luck would have it she literally falls into the arms of the mighty Lord Kalidor. She begs him to help find her sister Red Sonja. Sonja has been training with a Chinese sword master when Kalidor informs Sonja about her sister. Sonja arrives just in time for Varna to tell her about what happened at the temple. Before dying Sonja's sister urges her to find the Talisman and destroy it or else the world will be destroyed. Everything about this movie is bad but that's what I love about it. You know how sometimes you just need a bad movie that you can make fun of and have a good time with? Supposedly Arnold Schwarzenegger jokes that he uses this movie as punishment for his kids when they act up. Is it that bad? It is bad but it's a ton of fun. I loved the action Arnold fighting Bridgitte for her love as no man may have her unless he's trying to kill her lol. I loved the last fight scene between Red Sonja and Queen Gedren Gedren loves pulling a ton of jump cuts on her as well as one of Gedren's wizards who is using vodoo to cut Sonja to weaken her then when she discovers the wizard instead of him cutting her again he just stands there lol. Also the little Prince Tarn with Falkon was classic and they worked so well together. I think the scene that made me laugh the most was when Red Sonja Prince Tarn and Falkon are stuck in the cave with the machine dragon and Arnold is just riding around with it making it look more like a roller coaster ride rather than a fight for his life lol! My opinion if a movie entertains you even if it is bad why fight it? This is a good bad movie and I know I will always enjoy it. My recommendation being if you have an open mind and decide to just let go and enjoy the ride Red Sonja takes you on take it or leave it.710";

The action scenes are very well done and Bridget and Arnold should have gotten married after they made this. I thought my goodness they just looked so good together. As it later came out that they were having a roaring romance during the making of the film and I think this came across in the movie which added to it's class. Wonderful fantasy movie. For the adults you can feel the electricity between Arnold and Bridget in this and although it's a fantasy movie it's really no different than Bogart and Bacall in Key Largo or To Have and Have Notbut in their own way despite it being just a fantasy flick. Much better than the Conan movies because of their interaction. For the time period the special effects are quite good! Never boring a great fun movie with an interesting real life story to boot! Oh and any guy that is honest will admit Red Sonja is one of the hottest damn movies made without being porn. That's the huge attraction and ten times better than say Barbed Wire with Pamela Anderson.".

Sonja and Tarn are the two characters with major flaws that as the movie progresses are worked out. Tarn is a selfish little brat that at the end is willing to die so that his friends can make their escape from the crumbling palace around them. Sonja in the beginning will not allow anyone born with a Y chromosome touch her can you blame her after being gang raped by Gedren's army. In the end she allows herself to fall in love with Kalidor. I remember watching this movie when I was a child and it wasn't until I watched it again as an adult that I finally caught some of the innuendo. For example that Queen Gedren was a lesbian who wished to force Red Sonja to be her love slave. It was also quite humorous for Gedren to think that should could actually take on Sonja who has been given supernatural strength by a goddess in a sword fight. Again I still enjoy watching this movie to this day. The part where she is knocking her around the Chamber of Lights and that look of uhoh on Gedren's face is enough to make you fall off the couch in laughter.".

Nielsen and Bergman are so terrible that their performances are sure to generate some big guffaws from the viewer. Still they both look great and that has to count for something. Reyes Jr. certainly does succeed at making his character annoying.While it manages to remain watchable throughout this is pretty forgettable once it's over.

Nielsen is OK to look at but unfortunately she couldn't act if a gun was put to her head. Arnie's supporting role looked like it was done as a favor to director Fleischer who also directed Conan the Destroyer. Maybe Arnie wasn't confident that he would go on to headline films like Predator Total Recall T2 etc.Some of the female guardians of the talisman early in the film looked like they were struggling to lift their swords and the looks on their faces suggested they were having great fun making this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Red Sonja is a careerstepinthewrongdirection for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Having made a couple of sword 'n' sorcery films as Conan he had moved onto slightly more serious acting roles in films like The Terminator and Commando only to make a mystifying return to the sword 'n' sorcery genre for this 1985 debacle. It's hard to figure out why he bothered as this is weaker than both Conan films in every conceivable department. Allegedly this was to have been the third Conan film but for one reason or another the emphasis was shifted onto the leading female character the titular redhead leaving poor old Arnold to play an incredibly dull supporting role. Spare a thought too for director Richard Fleischer who had given the world classics like 20000 Leagues Under The Sea Fantastic Voyage The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place. In this  his penultimate film  Fleischer also has taken a gigantic career step backwards.Evil queen Gedren Sandahl Bergman wants to rule the world and she needs a priceless and powerful talisman to do so. She and her brutish army storm a keep populated by priestesses and steal the said talisman massacring the helpless priestesses as they go. One of the dead priestesses has a sister named Sonja Brigitte Nielsen a fiery redheaded warrior who upon hearing of her sister's death swears revenge upon the evil Gedren. Sonja rides across the land in search of Gedren's lair. Along the way she picks up travelling companions in the shape of a boy prince Tarn Ernie Reyes Jr and his bodyguard Falkon Paul Smith. She also meets the muscular warrior Conan  sorry I mean Kalidor !  who offers to join her in her quest. Initially Sonja doesn't want the help of Kalidor Arnold Schwarzenegger preferring instead to prove that she can confront and defeat her enemies alone but eventually she warms to him and accepts his assistance.Red Sonja is a staggeringly poor film all the more so when one muses that it was made in 1985 when the sword 'n' sorcery genre was close to its end. It seems so simplistic and amateurish that one could easily mistake it for an early example of its kind. The performances are poor on the whole ranging from Bergman's embarrassingly OTT villain to Reyes' unbelievably irritating spoilt brat to Schwarzenegger's wooden and unenthusiastic hero. Nielsen is slightly better as the heroine  presumably full of enthusiasm at the thought of being in her first starring role  but she is let down very badly by the stupidity of Clive Exton and George MacDonald Fraser's script. The film is riddled with goofs including a scene where Schwarzenegger is seen in closeup hacking down bad guys but in a longshot in the same sequence there isn't a corpse in sight. Technically it is very inept too with substandard special effects and appallingly mechanical monsters. There are a few compensations such as Ennio Morricone's enjoyable music Morricone spent a great deal of the '80s providing good music for awful films e.g The Island Treasure of the Four Crowns and Hundra. Another compensation is Giuseppe Rotunno's lensing of the locations  in fact much of the time it's a hell of a lot more gratifying to look at the lovely scenery than the actors standing in the foreground! There were very few sword 'n' sorcery films after Red Sonja so in some ways it might go down in history as the film which destroyed its own genre.".

To be fair while the gunfights in here were well done the fistfights were an insult.

In real life folks chances are you will knocked unconscious if you are hit in the face especially by a powerful man like Wayne. This has been a ludicrous factoflife however in all films for 100 years not just here.Other than that the film is a straight hardnosed one with Wayne and adversary Richard Boone both fascinating. The dialog between the two was especially fun to hear. Too bad there wasn't more of it. Boone did not have enough lines in this film. Wayne's reallife sons in this film didn't impress me with their acting but they weren't horrible either.Bruce Cabot was a hoot as an old Indian friend of Wayne's. As with most westerns there is some nice scenery so if you have the opportunity watch this on widescreen DVD. It was nicelooking movie.".

As with most westerns there is some nice scenery so if you have the opportunity watch this on widescreen DVD. It was nicelooking movie.";

Boone is an awesome villain and Wayne and his dog make an odd hero combo.

	schema:headline " Violently Good";
	schema:reviewBody "From the outset 'Big Jake' will always be a firm favourite of mine it's the first John Wayne movie I can recall watching and this is the movie that has made him my alltime favourite movie star and actor.The movie follows Dukes pursuit of seven kidnappers whom killed a large number of people at his former ranch now run by his estranged wife and kidnapped his grandson.Up until this point in John Wayne's career he had by in large refrained from using excessive violence in his movies. However it could be argued and with some basis that movies such as 'True Grit' 'The Green Berets' and 'The Alamo' to name but three were physically violent in their own right. Regardless of this however 'Big Jake' was to be a dramatic departure for John Wayne due to the fact that on numerous occasions it give an honest depiction of physical violence. The opening shootout at the Candles ranch is a prime example of this the sequence is extremely well executed by the director and stunt cocoordinators and there are many examples gunshot wounds which add to the realism of the movie.The screenplay is rather slick with ample action included to satisfy audience expectations. The movie does contain many memorable scenes such as the opening and closing shootouts Dukes casual killing of a would be assassin and some touching and at times volatile scenes involving Jake and his ex wife played eloquently by the great Maureen O'Hara.An interesting segment at the start involves a voiceover retelling the transformation of the west from the early 1800's to its relatively civilised state in 1909 when the film is set. The voiceover also introduces the audience to nine bandits whom act as the heavies in the movie its fascinating to hear a brief introduction of each bandit and what skill they bring to the group e.g. Fain is the leader O'Brien the gunfighter and John Goodfellow is proficient with a machete etc etc.Duke in this movie is accompanied is his pursuit if the kidnappers by a trusted dog who is very violent an Indian friend played very well by Bruce Cabot and his two on screen sons James Patrick Wayne who is Dukes own son and Michael Chris Mitchum. The main protagonist in the movie is John Fain played superbly by Richard Boone and some of the scenes between him and John Wayne are very memorable containing both tension and style. John Wayne's youngest son John Ethan Wayne makes his debut in this movie playing the kidnapped grandson of Jake and acquits himself very impressively to the field of acting.Despite my fondness for this movie it is not however without its weaknesses for one the acting by both Patrick Wayne and Chris Mitchum is horrendous and neither one manages to endear the audience to their respective characters. Some sloppy direction also resulted in the disappearance of one of the Fain gang early in the movie despite being given an introduction at the start of the movie young Billy simply disappears without any explanation right at the beginning of the raid on the McCandles ranch. Several campfire scenes that are set at night appear much too bright the director should have masked the lens on the camera more in order to ensure the scenes effectiveness. Finally several stunts involving Mitchum and a motorcycle come across as tired overblown and generally dull although the director rightly erased the motorcycle from the movie quite early on much to the relief of the audience.Critics were less than impressed with the movie stating that it was 'overly violent' these were the same critics who praised the Wild Bunch months earlier for being innovative and honest in its depiction of violence. Despite what he critics stated and some of the minor criticisms I have pointed out about this movie it remains a firm favourite and was a big box office hit when first released.".

A gang of kidnappers came on the place while most everyone was on roundup and killed several people and kidnapped Wayne's grandson. Grandmother Maureen O'Hara sends for her estranged husband to deal with the kidnappers as he sees fit. Being this is a John Wayne movie you already know how that is.Son Michael Wayne is the producer and sons Patrick and Ethan play Wayne's son and grandson. This is a bit of a change for Patrick Wayne. From back in the days of The Searchers Pat Wayne always played callow youths in his father's and in other films. Here he's a grown man and quite bitter at his father. The conflict between them crackles on the screen. Christopher Mitchum the son of another Hollywood icon plays another Wayne offspring as does Bobby Vinton.The action flows pretty good here and the tension does not let up for a moment. There are some good comic moments but they are well integrated into the plot of the story.Of the Duke's films post his Oscar from True Grit Big Jake is one of his best and a personal favorite of mine.".

I also as others have mentioned found the last scene of the movie rather incongrous as the grievously wounded Wayne and and his son and supposed grandson but really younger son acting go grinning away from a massacre that killed Big Jake's lifelong friend Sam the Indian and his dogYou would have thought they were leaving a wedding reception.........".

When he was a young man John Wayne once said he'd have to retire when he reached forty because after that you couldn't play a believable hero. Well here he is at 63 still kicking ass with the best of them! BIG JAKE has a sense of selfreferential humor about it that I find irresistible the I thought you wuz dead? running gag for example. Written by the screenwriters of DIRTY HARRY this movie always struck me as their attempt to send up the larger than life image of The Duke in the most affectionate possible way. Wayne's introductory shot and the line leading up to it makes me laugh out loud every time I see it it was cut from a TNT showing of the movie a few years ago making me howl with such outrage that my kids cracked up!. The only thing I don't like about this movie is the callousness of much of the violence. I know Richard Boone and his gang are being set up as the baddest of the baddies but women and children being hacked to bits with a machete is a bit much. Still not enough to ruin BIG JAKE for me. Not hardly.".

It's a treat seeing Wayne and O'Hara again and many of the veteran character actors such as Bruce Cabot Harry Carey Jr. and Hank Worden that have appeared in many films with the Duke. Richard Boone also gives a marvelous performance as the vicious villain and he's the perfect foil for Wayne in the film. No one could play a slimy badguy like Boone. Having said all that however this still is not a very good picture. The direction is shoddy reportedly director Sherman was ill during the shoot and Wayne directed scenes himself the script weak and many of the performances are subpar Patrick Wayne is particularly bad. Most of the humor in the film comes across as forced and some of the violence is kind of gratuitous and in bad taste. This was typical of most of Wayne's 1970's films the exceptions are the classic The Shootist and the underrated The Cowboys he often gave clichd performances during this era and was mostly just going through the motions and playing his personna. I almost gagged when I saw an earlier reviewer state that this is better than The Searchers. Sorry  not even close. Still it's The Duke and most of the movie is kind of fun  just don't compare it with Wayne's best Westerns. Stagecoach Red River Rio Bravo The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and the aforementioned The Searchers and The Shootist are all miles ahead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Regardless about how one feels about his archconservative politics there really isn't any secret as to why John Wayne personified what it meant to be a star in Hollywood for decades on end. And even though he seemed to settle into a routine of making films under his Batjac production banner in the last decade and a half of his life without the strong guiding hand of a John Ford a Howard Hawks or a Henry Hathaway he still put out what everyone had come to expect of the man. Case in point BIG JAKE.Written by the same writers who gave Eastwood DIRTY HARRY BIG JAKE stars Wayne as Jake McCandles a Texas rancher whom everyone thought was dead because no one had seen him in eighteen years as always rumors of his death were greatly exaggerated. But he is called back into action by his estranged wife Maureen O'Hara after a gang of ruthless outlaws led by Richard Boone shoot up his ranch kill much of the hired help and kidnap his grandson Ethan Wayne. Wayne not surprisingly takes up the challenge. But he also has to keep his sons Glenn Corbett Chris Mitchum in line when they call him Daddy obviously this gets a burr up the Duke's backside. They all must venture across the Rio Grande to Boone's hideout on the Mexican side helped out by Wayne's trusty Indian aide Bruce Cabot. And it all comes down to an eminently satisfying and traditional showdown between Wayne and Boone.BIG JAKE is very much in the style of Wayne's other Batjac westerns CHISUM THE UNDEFEATED THE WAR WAGON CAHILL U.S. MARSHAL in its being somewhat predictable but that predictability is precisely what makes it a success people want Wayne to win and who can blame them? Fortunately he gets a vicious enough antagonist in Boone who had had a minor role in the Duke's own 1960 directorial opus THE ALAMO and who does sagebrush villainy as well as anyone else. George Sherman who had directed Wayne in several Bwesterns prior to the Duke's ascension to stardom via Ford's STAGECOACH shows he still has the directorial goods here despite the poor health he suffered during its making Wayne reportedly directed significant sequences but refused to take credit or have Sherman taken off. BIG JAKE also has superlative cinematography by William Clothier no stranger to Westerns he all of which was done on location in what had become the Duke's favorite Western localethe landscape around Durango Mexico. The only really serious disappointment with BIG JAKE is that Wayne and O'Hara barely have any screen time together given how well they worked under Ford particularly on 1952's THE QUIET MAN and seeing as how this was their last joint appearance on screen Wayne died in 1979 and O'Hara wouldn't make another feature film until ONLY THE LONELY in 1991.Still just about everything else one expects from the Duke on screen happens here in BIG JAKE including those little bits of humor revolving around being called Daddy and being thought dead. It's just a lesson to you You don't mess with the Duke.And you definitely don't call him Daddy either!".

Richard Boone plays the head kidnapper and he's solid as always.John Patrick and Chris go off to pay the ransom for his grandchild Bobby's son actually played by Ethan Wayne the Duke's youngest son.  Much is made of the passing of the old rough and ready West and the start of the civilized age throughout the entire movie they show John riding on a reliable  old horse while the sheriff goes off to get the kidnappers in a car that overheats.  Newfangled weapons and modern ideas are juxtaposed against the old timetested ways.  The guys follow the instructions but the Duke never does anything easy.  In the end there's a shootout at a crumbling hacienda and if you've ever seen a John Wayne movie you know who's going to win.I first saw this movie unedited at the 1st John Wayne festival in Winterset Iowa in the early 80's and was surprised at the violence in it one of the villains carries a huge machete.

Once again The Duke is paired with the beautiful Maureen O'Hara as his wife real life son Patrick plays sharpshooting son James. Robert Mitchum's son Christopher plays Big Jake's son Michael. Boone is the perfect villain. And his minions are faithful but dumb enough to die for him. Plenty of gun play and violence to befit a Wayne western. Beautiful but rugged scenery filmed entirely in Mexico. Other players include Glenn Corbett John Doucette Jim Davis Harry Carey Jr. Bruce Cabot and Wayne's own son Ethan plays Little Jake.

	schema:reviewBody "Big Jake is directed by George Sherman and written by Harry and Rita Fink. It stars John Wayne Richard Boone Patrick Wayne Christopher Mitchum and Maureen O'Hara. Elmer Berstein scores the music and William H. Clothier is the cinematographer. It's shot in Panavision and Technicolor with the principal location for the shoot being Durango in Mexico. Plot finds Duke Wayne as tough old ranchergunfighter Jake McCandles who is estranged from his family and spends his days roaming the west with his trusty dog. However when the McCandles family ranch is raided by a gang of outlaws led by John Fain Boone and Jake's grandson Little Jake is kidnapped for ransom Big Jake gets the call from his separated wife Martha O'Hara to go find the boy. Which he sets off to do with two of his sons in tow.There were many critics who felt John Wayne should have stopped making movies before the 1970's arrived. Which is a bit ignorant considering he would bow out with the heartfelt and poignant The Shootist in 1976. It's undeniable that of the ten 1970's film's he made before his death half of them are disposable at best Big Jake isn't one of them. Yes the formula is hardly new only here the blood quota is considerably higher than previous Duke Wayne outings and yes tonally the film is a bit too up and down for its own good. But it's a film that finds old hands Wayne and Boone turning in good shows and the action and thematic camaraderie on show more than compensates for the looming cloud of same old same old.Of worth too is the time setting of the story coming as it does towards the back end of the Old West we get to see many examples of the Wild West being tamed. Be it the railroad or motor driven vehicle's our protagonist and antagonist are old school characters framed by a changing West. This is where it pays to have Wayne and Boone in the main roles turning it in in an old school knowing style. The names Clothier and Bernstein are synonymous with the Western genre and they don't disappoint here both the photography and score treat the eyes and the ears. And although not in it for very long O'Hara adds a touch of class in what was the last of the five times she appeared on film with her friend Duke Wayne. In amongst the violence there's also plenty of fun some intended courtesy of banter between Duke and his estranged sons some not intended such as watching the dog out act the siblings of Duke and Robert Mitchum! But all told if you don't expect The Searchers or Hondo et all then this holds up as a good way to spend an afternoon. 710Footnote I wonder if John Carpenter watched and enjoyed this film so much he cribbed a reoccurring joke from it for Escape from New York? Big Jake keeps coming up against people who say that they thought he was dead same thing happens to Snake Plissken in Carpenter's picture. A homage I'm sure.".

Way too much CGI was used. Not only that but they cut away from what probably would have been the most visually interesting death. 5. No Tony Todd. He was seen in the first 2 and heard in the 3rd one. At this point the fans expect to see him. They should have tried to get him in here somehow.I could go on and on. I hope that if they make a 5th one that James Wong who directed the first and third films returns to give the series a proper send off as the David Ellis entries to the franchise the second and fourth films are definitely the weakest links in the series.

Even though I saw this in 2D there were many elements that were very obviously designed to be in 3D to take full advantage of the medium.However the film itself just isn't good. The acting is terrible. The story is formulaic. There's nothing really interesting as far as the plot. No discussion of death. No new interesting concepts. Lots of fluff in the form of false kills. And the entire film from the opening credits to the closing credits is about the methods in which these people die.What this movie is really about is killing young attractive individuals in a manner which will compliment the 3D. Nothing else. It's just killing people using a Rube Goldberg device or a flying object in 3D.Some of the special effects are good and a few of the deaths are interesting however the film doesn't really do anything for me. It's just kind of there. I don't really hate it but I don't really like it either. I also don't really care for 3D in general. I think it's a stupid way of getting you to pay a little extra like IMAX which is a bigger screen and some extra speakers. Yaay.Overall if you like the 3D gimmick you're just looking for a movie to take a few friends to and have a little fun and you don't really care about plot characters or story you might have some fun. To anyone else I wouldn't really recommend it. It's just a studio gimmick and can be easily ignored.510  Nothing special.".

So when i saw this movie was THE final destination a pretty cocky title but hey it may have lived up to it and it was gonna be in 3D i had pretty high expectations.My expectations were wrong. This movie SUCKED. If it wasn't part of the franchise it would have been a straighttoDVD suckfest. Seriously i was WAITING for it to end. The accident at the car racing ring was just so  blah. I mean i know the whole series is far fetched and you have to have an imagination to believe it but this one was just so uninvolved. I mean getting on a plane getting in a car and getting on a rollercoaster are things where you are putting your life at risk without thinking. Sitting in an audience? I mean come on what's next Final Destination 5  i walked down a street and a building fell on me. By making the accident so unscary what ensued just didn't really leave you involved. Nothing scared me here i wasn't unnerved like i was with 1 through 3. Every time i get on a rollercoaster i get FD3 flashback the only thing that will flashback to me from THE final destination will be the HORENDOUS performances.Ah the performances. FD1 had Seann William Scott  Kerr Smith FD2 has Ali Later  FD3 had the immensely talented Mary Elizabeth Winstead. This film had 1 guy who could act trying to carry the whole sorry mess and a whole lot of bitches who need to be slapped for even thinking they should move to Hollywood. I know it's a lot to compete with but rather than just ignoring this you'd think the producers  casting directors would really try and pull something out of the bag here. Apparently not. To give him his due Bobby Campo was charismatic and tried his best with the shoddy dialogue he had. If the rest of the cast had been as good as him then we would have no problems. Nick Zano was OK as the cocky guy but there are people who could have done that way way better. The real problem? The support actresses here were AWFUL. I just wanted to scream THIS IS NOT A COLD READING. I'm pretty sure that there were a friggin ton of young talents who auditioned for this piece and THIS is what they cast? Even the MILF yes she was actually credited as that sucked. How hard is it to be a MILF?. Shantel Vonwhatever her name is AKA A poor mans Ashlee Simpson and Haley Webb god i wanna slap her SO hard apparently call themselves actresses. Before they continue to do this may i suggest something to them ACTING LESSONS. GET THEM. YOU SUCK! For the love of god EMOTE. They sounded like they were reading straight from the script and looked blank in every scene. Awful.The deaths in FD4 were just too unrealistic. The special effects sucked  not even 3D could begin to save them. They looked like somebody got a little too excited with a computer and didn't really put any thought into making it look real. Making it look just a little bit real will scare people making it look FUNNY is gonna annoy people.This film was just so disappointing. Unrealistic uninvolving uninspired JUNK.The only thing i wanna say is if there is gonna be an FD5 and i really hope there is considering 34 were awesome  then please for the love of god bring back Glen Morgan  James Wong. Those guys know how to really scare people and the whole feel of the 1st  3rd films is just so much better.Oh and find people who have mastered the art of acting. Its pretty vital.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would like to start off by saying I'm a fan of the FINAL DESTINATION series. Even the much maligned third film is starting to grow on me. When it was announced that David Ellis was returning to the director chair along with screenwriter Eric Bress I was quite excited considering that part two is arguably the best in the series. But this one. If I were to describe this film in one word I would say DISAPPOINTING. In fact this is one of the most disappointing movies of this year! The fact that the makers of part two has returned just adds on to the frustration.The film starts off pretty rushed. In fact the film is rushed altogether. You feel as if the filmmakers wanted to get through with the film. The laziness is so apparent in here that you're wondering how much the executives offered in their salary. The film is so lazy that there are even glaring plot holes in the hackneyed script! How the hell does a film that is based on something ridiculous have plot holes? The filmbetter yet the franchise spends most of its time in setting up rules on the order people are going to die yet this film ignores practically everything and kills people in any order it feels like!Even the clever foreshadowing from the previous films is quite blatant here. The laziness is also extended to the death scenes. Remember quality not quantity. Even though this film has the most death scenes compared to the previous entries most of them suck and even that word wouldn't give the deaths that much justice. We all have to admit it sooner or later but we see these films for the death scenes. What is the freaking point in watching this film if they turn out to be lazy to an extent that some death scenes are rehashed from previous FD films? Exactly. There is no point.Another problem about the death scenes is that there is barely any suspense when people are about to get killed. Usually in the FD films seeing the set up of the Rube Goldberglike death scenes IS the suspense but in here they feel as if they come out of nowhere because of how rushed everything is. They're surprising yes but the surprises wear off very quickly. Google up Alfred Hitchcock's definition of suspense to learn the difference between surprise and suspense.Let's move on to the next problem CGI. With the 3D technology it's obvious the filmmakers wanted to add more CGI effects so the images could pop out on the screen. The problem here is that the FINAL DESTINATION series is always known for their practical effects. The premonition sequence in here works well in 3D sure but the CGI is terrible! They look so fake that I questioned how this film wasn't released direct to DVD.You know you have a bad film when a franchise that was supposed to be scary and mysterious now turns into something that pokes fun of itself. It has happened many times before most notably the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise. It's as if the filmmakers were aware that the franchise is dying and that their last attempt was to add selfaware characters and idiotic dumb lines in the film with the many problems the film already has.Even the characters are more like an excuse to kill them off later. It's apparent that this isn't a movie but more of a carnival ride waiting to see who dies and how they will die. That's how low this film has gone. You'd also be surprised to find out that the most fleshed out character is in fact not the protagonist but a supporting character played by Mykelti Williamson. He gives a laughable and forced performance but that's nothing compared to Bobby Campo who is easily the worst premonitionist in the franchise. He can't act to save his life. And the less we say about the others the better. However I'm willing to admit the only character I did feel sympathy for was played by Krista Allen who plays a motherly role with an extremely short running time.However there are other few things that I liked about the film emphasis on the word few There's a sequence in a salon and a car wash that have at least SOME suspense. I don't know if this counts but I also liked the opening credits which I thought was ingenious a montage of the previous films' memorable death scenes. And that's about it. Three things. What an accomplishment!I guess it isn't hard to tell but this is by far the weakest in the series because there's nothing new. You'd expect that a mythology so easily expandable would be explored here but no. By the end of the film you feel underwhelmed. You wished they could have done better. In fact you KNOW they could have done better. If they were to make a fifth film they better put some thought into it. If you're thinking about watching this movie only ONCE you should see it in its intended format in 3D AND in theaters but I don't see why anyone should waste their money on this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're a fan of the franchise you'd know the drill by now and can probably mentally run through all the clich moments you'll be expected to see being played out on screen once again. Start with a spectacular deathdefying escape from certain demise and because Death cannot accept those who cheated on him hence begins that hunterprey game where the Death's invisible hand starts to design some elaborate lifeending sequence for its victims sometimes with some wickedly black humour thrown in.Seriously though Death has turned hip in the series allowing a select group of survivors led by a prophetic messenger if anything just to challenge himself to pick them off one by one through the simple rule of elimination in order of the premonition dangling the carrot that whosoever can break any of his death traps will be worthy of a second chance in life not. One thing's for sure an audience is not going to just walk in and expect great acting or high drama. All we want simply and crudely put is to see how brutal or comical death can result from sometimes the most ridiculous of set ups.To top its predecessors this installment had its introductory big scene set in stock car racing which is the perfect avenue for 101 things to go wrong and when they do have thousands of potential victims to pick off from. While the very first movie had a spectacular and some say too realistic for good taste in having witness from within a plane break up and explode upon takeoff this one had an adrenaline pumping race that got enhanced thanks to the latest gimmick in town 3D.And while some films are presented in 3D format without exploiting its 3D elements to the maximum The Final Destination milked every single sequence that it could. From the get go you have objects darting around and flying toward you be it huge tyres or mashed body insides everything got hurled toward you from the screen which I have to admit made me duck a couple of times having deliberately chosen to sit up front so that the screen totally enveloped my field of vision. But there were still some sequences that looked quite cheaply done though akin to the quality of those made for television movies due to a smaller budget devoted to effects. But for what it's worth as a 3D film this is one of the better contemporary live action ones out there now.One does not expect Oscar winning material in its storyline or acting though the eyecandy cast made sitting through this film palatable even if they're acting range comes with vast rooms for improvement. The film's relatively short clocking under 90 minutes and had enough cheat sheet dejavu moments which included the opening credits priming you on what to excpect to repeat itself for the sole purpose of bloating the runtime. It also ran out of steam in its final act leading to a very convenient and rushed conclusion which was just probably director David R. Ellis' way of saying I do not know how to end this.Will there be another Final Destination? Sure if the writers can dream up of another shocker of an opening sequence to set the stage for more deathly carnage to happen. It's no brainer and if box office results this opening weekend prove to be stellar then we should expect this franchise to develop some legs to keep going on. And on. But if that happens this will be viewed in 3D or naught.".

I honestly can say that I was never once grossed out by the excessive amount of blood they showed no matter how much they tried. Every 'death' that occurred in this movie was so incredibly farfetched that it was extremely difficult to take seriously.In conclusion I do not recommend this movie. If you look at this as a comedy instead of horror you may enjoy it more. You also might enjoy it more if you get drunk first. However seeing it sober as I did will be very painful you have been warned.SPOILERS Also while there are many goofs in this movie I'm sure I would like to add that this film contains a HUGE plot hole towards the end that made me want to rip my hair out.

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the franchise James Wong and David R. Ellis appear to have done a back andforth rotation with directing the series with James Wong taking the director's chair for 'Final Destination' and 'Final Destination 3' while David R. Ellis takes over for 'Final Destination 2' and this one. The franchise seems to stay right on track with James Wong working behind the camera but not much so with David R. Ellis directing. As Ellis returns to the director's chair for the fourth installment what results is what is possibly the worst entry of the this average franchise. This film opens up with twentysomething year old Nick played by Bobby Campo his girlfriend Lori played by Shantel Vansanten and their two friends Hunt played by Nick Zano and Janet played by Haley Webb spending their day watching the drag races at the McKinley Speedway. Out of nowhere Nick has terrifying premonition of a car crash causing a rapid chain of disasters that kills everyone in the audience including him and his friends. Nick panics and drags his friends along with several other spectators out of the bleachers momentarily before the horrifying disaster he visioned unfolds and the remaining spectators are killed. Months go by everyone tries to move on their lives but Nick learns that the survivors are not safe as well as Death comes back to haunt them and claim their lives one by one as it originally intended when they escaped the disaster on the speedway. The Final Destination series introduced a unique idea for the horror genre. Sadly original ideas eventually wear out in the long run and this film clearly shows it. With the previous films carrying a dark atmosphere this one takes on a more comedic tone that results in humor making up the majority of the writing and characters while carrying on the same gimmicks from the previous entries. Yes the film follows the same formula as what we experienced throughout the franchise only here it gets more silly than something to be taken seriously. The characters are once again limited down to onedimensional stereotypes but with less distinguishable personalities and in the end you never come care for any of them. The performances the actors give aren't bad but they don't help how wooden the characters are. The worse aspect comes to the death sequences which are much bloody and gorier than the ones from the previous films but less authentic and logical. The film takes the liberty of using CGI blood and gore that results in some of the deaths being more laughable than effective. The computergenerated blood splatter may fit well with 3D this is the first movie in the series to include 3D but overall it's just looks unrealistic. The only fun this movie brings the table is small plethora of thrills and some gory deaths to please those yearning for gruesome thrills than actual suspense. All in all this film has little to offer than gruesome shock value.The Final Destination is probably the least entertaining entry of the franchise and probably the least favorite as well. This movie may some redeeming quality but most of it is buried under its bad script and tiresome formula. For a fan of the series this one is worth the try but the replay value leads little to be desired.".

Let's start off with the amateurish acting and they obvious so little effort that was put forth here in this sequel. It has plenty of gore plenty of creative sequences to set up the death sequences but it's missing the most important element that this series has characters that I give a damn about. I didn't care about any one of these people and I had to go through 90 or so minutes of pure boredom when all was said and done. The most intriguing storyline for me was the security guard's character but they didn't explore that enough for my liking and instead focused on the two bland and wooden leads.Performances. Bobby Campo is a terrible lead and has no talent as far as I'm concerned. I didn't give a damn about what happened to him. Shantel VanSanten looks cute but she's no heroine that's for sure and her chemistry with Campo didn't feel genuine too me. Mykelti Williamson was the most intriguing character for me but they didn't focus on him enough for my liking.Bottom line.

	schema:headline " The Final Destination is the Worst Destination.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Final Destination has achieved the unexpected  it's actually worse than the third film in the franchise! This fourth film in the series has nothing that made the first two and to an extent even the third films unique and amazing. The Final Destination doesn't have the cleverness intricacies of the previous films. None of the freak accidents are elaborate this time around. I blame the uncreative deaths on the fact that this film was released in 3D. The deaths were obviously created in order to fully utilize the 3D. Polls are sticking out towards the audience things fly towards the screen etc. Because all of the deaths are trying to utilize and please the 3D effect the originality and creativity of the deaths are lowered. And that's the main problem with The Final Destination. The main reason the Final Destination films are so good is the fact that the deaths are cunning and captivating. The acting and story comes second. The deaths are what makes the films work and what makes the films actually fun.Now the first film in the series was actually pretty good. The acting was good the story was good the plane explosion was good and the deaths were intricate. The second film was almost just as good as the first. The third film sort of had notasgood acting or a notasgood storyline but the deaths were still fun and interesting. In The Final Destination the story is boring. We never really get to settle with the characters or learn about them enough to actually care whether or not they're going to die. In the first three films I actually cared for many of the characters. In this film things just happen. The characters wander from one place to another moving the plot along without a care in the world. The only thing we learn about the main characters is who's the hero who's the girlfriend who's the mom who's the asshole etc. We don't know anything else about them.In the previous films the accidents portrayed in the beginning were always badass and amazing. The plane explosion was intense the highway crashpileup was breathless and the rollercoaster accident was crazy although cheesy at many points. The race car accident in this film is boring and uninteresting.The Final Destination films don't necessarily need amazing actors and actresses though they usually do have good actors and actresses. The Final Destination however has wooden and stiff actorsactresses. The two main leads are okay but the other characters suck.Honestly the only good thing I'd have to say about this film is the fact that the pool scene was filmed down my street. My house is a few doors down from the country club where the pool scene was filmed which was pretty cool. Other than that the film was a letdown. The next and fifth film in the franchise is currently in the works and tentatively titled '5nal Destination.' The filmmakers have hired Eric Heisserer to write the next film and apparently they're hoping he takes the film in a new direction. Let's hope the next film in the Final Destination series will bring back the intricate and elaborate deaths and also the fun and joy that was included in the first three.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Final Destination has achieved the unexpected  it's actually worse than the third film in the franchise! This fourth film in the series has nothing that made the first two and to an extent even the third films unique and amazing. The Final Destination doesn't have the cleverness intricacies of the previous films. None of the freak accidents are elaborate this time around. I blame the uncreative deaths on the fact that this film was released in 3D. The deaths were obviously created in order to fully utilize the 3D. Polls are sticking out towards the audience things fly towards the screen etc. Because all of the deaths are trying to utilize and please the 3D effect the originality and creativity of the deaths are lowered. And that's the main problem with The Final Destination. The main reason the Final Destination films are so good is the fact that the deaths are cunning and captivating. The acting and story comes second. The deaths are what makes the films work and what makes the films actually fun.Now the first film in the series was actually pretty good. The acting was good the story was good the plane explosion was good and the deaths were intricate. The second film was almost just as good as the first. The third film sort of had notasgood acting or a notasgood storyline but the deaths were still fun and interesting. In The Final Destination the story is boring. We never really get to settle with the characters or learn about them enough to actually care whether or not they're going to die. In the first three films I actually cared for many of the characters. In this film things just happen. The characters wander from one place to another moving the plot along without a care in the world. The only thing we learn about the main characters is who's the hero who's the girlfriend who's the mom who's the asshole etc. We don't know anything else about them.In the previous films the accidents portrayed in the beginning were always badass and amazing.

The kills entertain as they pretty much always have throughout the franchise with the opening disaster sequences here set at a speedway stadium continuing one of the series' great traditions. While the opening and closing XRaySkeletal credit sequences are superb and a credit to those involved. Yet it all feels so tired where in spite of the willingness to upgrade the technology it's still lazy and has nothing to really justify its very being other than that to make easy money.

	schema:reviewBody "As a big fan of the series this is the biggest disappointment of all 4. It is definitely a movie that if you do not see it in 3D then you probably shouldn't see it at all. The movie is made to be seen in 3D to the point that certain scenes and characteristics seem completely out of place since they can't jump out of the screen at you. The best part of the other movies are the unique and eccentric death scenes making you look over your shoulder in real life wondering if something crazy could actually happen to you. The death scenes in FD4 are a complete joke compared to its predecessors and almost all of them are ruined by the trailer. I would recommend just not watching the trailer since it leaves nothing to the imagination and leaves virtually no surprises. If you're a die hard fan of the series I would recommend buying it instead of renting it since the retail version is at least in 3D.httpthisweeksdvdsonreview.blogspot.com".

If you're seeing this movie because you want some 3D fun fine by all means purchase the grossly expensive ticket and buy your overpriced popcorn and sit there and enjoy it. The entire plot is implausible. It had the potential to be a notsosucky movie but they failed to be aware of themselves during production. Seriously the death scenesor so called 'accidents'would require an obscene amount of Death hating your guts. It reminded me of the letdown in Beowulf when the only sword and only thing able to kill Gretle JUST to happened to be hanging in his cave during the battle. Seriously? Do you really believe it? Most of all it defies your sense of well common sense. In the first one Final Destination you really felt that these things that are being brought on by death COULD actually be accidents. not so much with the shower gel But in this one you really have to think that Death is really livid at this guy messing up his whole convoluted plan. Some of the things that happen the fire scene in the mall are just like wtf? excuse the colloquialism. The nail gun going off after hitting the floor? It would not remain in a static state on a trigger for more than two seconds especially with the propulsion of the nail affecting it's state of balance. I mean come on physics still applies! And that's completely ignoring the fact that nail guns have safety triggers which means they won't shoot unless it's pressed against something where the nail comes out And if it's too old to have that safety function they wouldn't be contracted to work. This movie is presumptuous and assumes the audience will buy anything it dishes out just as long as the audience gets some entertainment. Oh and the whole tire flying over the stadium to hit the first friend casualty... not gonna happen in real life. Every death scene was like Come on! in the theatre. The special effects were awful. If you were to buy this movie on DVD it would just be awful. This movie was made to be seen in theaters and is thus insistent upon the fact that it is only meant to be a blockbuster and nothing more. Honestly better than the first one? No. This entire Final Destination 'franchise' should have stopped at one or two. Not four. I felt cheapened and suckered out of my money when walking out of the movie. Maybe they wanted me to feel like a 5 year old maybe i'd believe everything they sold me. But Final Destination was a decent movie... and this The Final Destination fiasco pretty much stained the name of a good movie. I honestly wish I could get my money and my time back. If you like pointless entertainment by all means see it. But if you liked the first one and have SOME self respect and respect for the original don't see it. Seriously. And if you know what Deus Ex Machina is you will be annoyed at how much there is of it in this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The horror genre seems to be really dull these days. It was tough to decide which movie I was going to see tonight Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN sequel or the latest installment in the FINAL DESTINATION series. I watched both of the trailers and HALLOWEEN 2 seemed like it would be really boring. FINAL DESTINATION didn't look impressive either but I was sold on the 3D and was ready to watch overthetop death scenes in Digital 3D at a sold out theater with a crowd that just wanted to have a good time. Unfortunately the 3D did more harm than good.The original FINAL DESTINATION wasn't a classic but it is one of the better horror movies to come out in the last 10 years. The death scenes were set perfectly and really well executed and it also had a good atmosphere. The second movie directed by David R. Ellis who returned to direct this one was fun in some ways and the death scenes were creative but there was no reason for a sequel. The third one I remember seeing it and not liking it. Now we have yet another unnecessary sequel where the only appeal is the 3D.The movie begins at the worlds worst racetrack where everything is falling apart benches fences the roof etc. Bobby Campo plays Nick who has a vision that everyone will die in the stands as the biggest crash in the history NASCAR will happen in front of them. He and his friends leave the stadium with a handful of others and they survive. It isn't long after the accident that Nick has more visions and the survivors die on some freak accidents.This is lazy filmaking. No one is trying at all. Every performance in this movie is terrible and the script is just a mess. We learn little bits about some of the characters problems but there is no reason for us to care. One of the survivors only known as the mechanic says that after the accident he is trying to make changes in his life for the better. He then dies 3 seconds later. It is impossible to care about these characters especially when one of them doesn't have a name and is just known as the mechanic. No one is trying here and they're just depending on the 3D gimmick to bring in audiences. Honestly you deserve better than this. The death scenes were not even well done. They are quick and just focus on throwing blood and guts in your face. In the original film the deaths had a build up to them that were really well put together and the execution was perfect. Here it just kind of happens. We don't even get to really know the characters enough so that we can care about them and most of them deserved to die.This is a waste of 3D and just an excuse to get a crowd of people to fork over their hard earned money to watch people die for an hour and a half and then leave the theater with a headache. My eyes are still sore as I am typing this review. This is one of the worst movies of the year. Do yourself a favor instead of paying 15 to see this crap fest go see something better like DISTRICT 9.".

	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to the Final Destination series anyone who has seen any of them knows what to expect people survive a horrific accident because someone has a vision and they start to die in brutal ways in the order they would've died had they stayed. After Final Destination 2 I was really excited to hear that David Ellis was returning as director and Eric Bress one of the scribes from it as well was back. The problem starts with the opening since there was not much you can really do with an accident at a racetrack even with the people in the stands the opening shots and music certainly fit I must admit. We have people crushed by an engine impaled on wood from a broken bench and lots of people being crushed by the overhang as it collapses. The characters and acting in the end were okay at best but that's not what most people want to see we want the deaths. Like many others have said they are rather tame compared to the others in my opinion. The idea of believability is to be thrown out the window upon entering any of these films but this time I had trouble ignoring it. The idea that death manipulates things is completely fine but what set me over the edge was a can of hairspray moving completely on its own for quite a long distance and being unnoticed at that. The actual deaths consist of some great setups followed by lackluster payoff none of these beat some of the better deaths in the series whether it be an engine fan shredding a man's head open or even the simplistic deaths such as a shard of metal lobbing the top off of someone's head. They didn't put near the time in effort into this film that they did in the previous ones and the lack of our beloved Rune Goldberg devices certainly shows this. In the end it did have some welldone moments the opening credits were rather awesome with a near complete recap of the previous deaths in the series through the use of skeletons and CGI the escalator death sequence just about the only true Final Destination death in the film gorewise and the opening accident itself which despite what I said negative of above still was rather slick from my eyes. I'd say if you must see it see the cheap show.".

In the end it did have some welldone moments the opening credits were rather awesome with a near complete recap of the previous deaths in the series through the use of skeletons and CGI the escalator death sequence just about the only true Final Destination death in the film gorewise and the opening accident itself which despite what I said negative of above still was rather slick from my eyes. I'd say if you must see it see the cheap show.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Final Destination films have always been more suspenseful than anything and in a genre full of stalkandslash films they were always a fun diversion and often even encompassed incredibly good filmmaking. The newest and supposedly last installment in the tenyear series aptly titled The Final Destination does an incredible job of matching some of the series' best moments and ends things in a very satisfying way. Explosions and insanity abound in the new horror film directed by David R. Ellis and starring Bobby Campo Nick Zano Krista Allen Haley Webb and Shantel VanSanten.So the basis of all the Destination films relies on the opening disaster sequence and in stunning 3D I believe I can honestly say that this one was the best of the four. There's all sorts of blood and cool CGIeffects blazing across the screen it was just a very fun and exciting sequence.Obviously by now everyone knows the most enticing aspect about these films the highly original and creative deaths. In this movie it's heightened tenfold by the extremely fascinating use of the 3D which at times sends all sorts of really cool things flying at the screen. We get a lot of really disgusting death scenes and sequences the coolest stuff definitely taking place at a mall towards the end. Saying even a single word about the hugely inventive deaths in the film would completely spoil the whole point of the movie but at a series high of eleven The Final Destination displays the most kills of the entire series.The 3D works the very best in the film when it comes to the highdefinition CGIladen premonitions which are vastly different than the brief glimpses at future events that were in the first and second films the third had a complete lack of persontoperson premonitions due to the interesting and vastly original picturedeath system. The premonitions are highly effective and inyourface for once displaying just the perfect amount of foreshadowing without going overboard. And in a Final Destination movie foreshadowing is what it's all about.Perhaps the most interesting thing about this installment of the series is seeing the return of presence or evil force that was so prevalent in the original movie that started it all. While many of the situations and things this time around were incredibly unrealistic the 3D definitely was an excuse for all sorts of crazy stuff. The presence works well in this installment definitely fitting more with the semicheesy tone of the film overall. I really enjoyed the red herrings that popped up all throughout the movie it almost got to a point where you're never really sure quite how a character is gonna bite it and it makes for an extremely entertaining watch.The acting? Probably the last thing the audience is thinking about when they come to see a Destination movie. There's some impressive performances here and a very charismatic lead performance from Bobby Campo but nobody is trying to win an Oscar here. It's horror after all. All the actors and actresses are just trying to have a good time and it really shows. They all work well off of each other. Honestly with the short runtime I was seriously concerned that the acting and character development would sort of fall by the wayside. In a lot of ways the development definitely did but the actors bring a lot of life to their characters even the ones who have very little screen time. It's almost like a very fun little ensemble.David R. Ellis was absolutely the perfect choice to close up the final chapter of the franchise. He's at home behind the camera and he seems to really get the whole feel of the movie. The tongueincheek thing is his specialty he also directed Snakes on a Plane and the wellreceived Final Destination 2.What the third film succeeded in the most was three things character development highly realistic death scenes and building tension to a massive boiling point. Where The Final Destination fails in building up much decent character development and in making the deaths hyperrealistic and disturbing it succeeds in both a fun factor that wasn't present much in the other movies and building tension. Horrorsuspense is pretty much the perfect genre classification for these films and there's just as much fear and intensity emanating from the big screen in this one as there ever was before. A scene toward the middle that I especially liked where two people were in danger at the same time was one that really got to me.For months now I've been raving about how badly I wanted to see this movie. After all it was without a doubt my most anticipated movie of 2009. Did it live up to the hype? Hell yes. It was every bit as brutal as I was expecting and I pretty much loved everything about it. One of my favorite things about the movie was the highly original opening credits sequence which was sort of a lament to all of the series' death scenes. It was very wellorchestrated and it set an extremely fun mood for the scenes that followed. All in all this was definitely near the top of my list for best horror films of the year. It was absolutely fantastic.While I still think Final Destination 3 was the perfect film and the best out of the stellar franchise The Final Destination was definitely a good contender and loads of tongueincheek fun. I dug the characters dialogue death scenes and ending a whole hell of a lot and I'd recommend it to any fan of the franchise or any fan of 3D.".

Trying is the operative word here. Sadly the mark was missed on everything except the soundtrack that was the only good thing about this movie. The story was unbelievable with characters you really do not care about bordering on completely ridiculous towards the end. The dialogue was horrible. And was there a plot ? If there was one then I definitely missed it.A good soundtrack bunch of cute girls somewhat stylish cinematography and gun play does not make for a passable movie. In fact it makes it worse because you try to enjoy it try to find something redeeming about it and in the end just come away completely disappointed. That is not what the movie experience should be about. Willis and Whitaker should bother to read the script before taking on any future movies. The only thing that I can imagine made them do this one is either they are desperate for work or they were doing a favor for a friend. Do yourself a favor go out and buy the soundtrack you will get much better value for your money and more enjoyment than wasting your time watching this movie.".

The acting isn't horrible but you might cringe a few times  and don't expect any awards nominations. Where the film really falls short is the lack of character development. We don't really have a lot of reasons or get the chance to care about the characters or what happens to them. And no Bruce Willis doesn't dominate the screen. This film does have a Tarantinofeel but it's obviously not a Tarantino nor does it sell itself as such. I honestly went into this with zero expectations other than seeing the beautiful Deborah Ann Woll in something other than True Blood  Bruce Willis and Forest Whitaker being in the movie was a big big plus. It's slowerpaced and a bit predictable but it's not bad. If you're expecting a fastpaced andor Tarantino brilliant rehash of Die HardmeetsPulp FictionReservoir Dogs then you're setting yourself up for a huge disappointment.

So the acting was good and the script was OK but my impression was that they could have done more if they had put more effort into it it could have been great and that's not a small thing for 2011... There isn't actually a lot to talk about it had a little twist in the end which I liked but the ending is kind of given away if you pay attention to the movie so in the middle of the action you ask yourself how does it come to what I just saw...won't give away more because I don't want to spoil it for you.

An AfricanAmerican gunforhire Forest Whitaker of Bird has been Mel's close friend for seven years and he has the girls' back.

His first movie The Evil Woods was already bad Catch.44 is worse.Here is a sum up of the problems with this straight to DVDRelease.... We know that the main character Tes Malin Akerman will survive which makes the 30 minutes stare down contest in the end completely unnecessary. We know what is going to happen in the scene after that too because we know she has survived and since all the dialogs been painful and excruciating to a very high level we can't wait for this awful film to end. I am shocked Forrest Whitaker and Bruce Willis give their names for such a bad movie. Like I said the plot is 10 minutes long but director decided to Tarantino the plot which was interesting for the first 30 minutes after that it became clear that he was trying to copy pulp fiction but neither the acting nor the dialogs can compare with that. It is as simple as that. The attempt was made to make a rough movie with hardcore people and put a bunch of twists on it. Fact is we didn't care for any of these people since they haven't been explained to us nor did they appear very sympathetic. In the end of the day nobody cares who is going to die. All these hard people that are supposed to measure up to Pulp Fiction appeared to be like Glee singing Metallica. I can't stress the point enough that we know that Tes will survive which makes the last 30 minutes completely pointless.By far one of the worst movies I have seen in 2011 clearly one of the biggest regrets for Willis and Whitaker.Don't watch it it is really really bad Aaron Harvey is a horrific writer it is not even good on a pretentious level. In a mainstream blockbuster movie the entire plot would have been 3 minutes long putting random dialogs in it doesn't make it better. No Message No real storyline and the end given away in the beginning it's not art it's not entertaining just really bad.3 Stars because because of the cast.".

Like Candy Strippers some of the SY FY movies and those horrible videos on zombies and such that show up at small independent film festivals. The I got a video camera for Christmas and now I can make a movie kind of movies.Aaron Harvey director snagged Bruce Willis who likes these off beat roles as in Pulp Fiction and Forrest Whittaker who was great in this with a gem role of a faltering hit man who entertains himself with wacky characters.Catch .44 opens in a restaurant an homage to Tarentino and other restaurant openings with 3 chicks talking not about tips but sexuality.Basically some cute chicks are hired to do a drug run job but in reality their boss is planning their demise.I really like the lighting design in this film. It was genius compared to the horrible lighting in Contraband a 40 million dollar forgettable flick. There was nice subject emphasis shadow detail range of tones and noirish feelings in the lighting design of Catch .44.And Harvey didn't have to 'fade in out' like Dirty Little Secrets where the director did fade in and out to show a 'time shift' which slowed the movie to a crawl.At least Harvey trusted the audience to know a time shift when it sees one and often just used a CU of a clock to show a time shift.Overall a great cast nice direction great lighting and not a bad film. Some people critique films on no redeeming characters...they are all bad guys they opine. Well try watching Breaking Bad. A great TV series. As was the play Richard III by Shakespeare. So unless you like watching Ozzie and Harriet the 1950's TV series be prepared for bad guys as heroes and other flawed characters in the movies. I mean Pulp Fiction had two hit men as the heroes.And OK the ending scene did go on forever with a standoff but hey did you ever see the end to For a Few Dollars More? That went on forever with a scene containing Lee Van Cleef Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach in a similar triangle shoot out. I got it as a rental and did enjoy it as a thriller with some quirky original characters by Willis and Whittaker.".

Catch 44 is so 'Pulp Fiction inspired' that you'll be expecting Samuel L Jackson to pop up in a gimp mask at any time.Instead of a predominantly male cast Catch 44 centres on three female drug smugglers and what happens when one of their supposedly routine dropoffs goes very wrong. That's about the extent of the plot. I've read in other reviews phrases like 'the film stretches a single scene out for the entire ninety minutes.' And they're not far off it.The whole film is  technically  set in a diner the location for the illegal exchange. What other parts of the film come in flashbacks and repeats of the initial scene over and over again. This has picked up more than a little criticism from some as being repetitive and annoying.I didn't think it was that bad. Granted Catch 44 is no Pulp Fiction but I found it entertaining enough to watch for an hour and a half. One thing you should know is that Bruce Willis despite featuring heavily on all major advertising is in it for about ten minutes. The story is mainly about the girls. Forest Whitaker does his best to inject some muchneeded characterisation but really the lack of any forward momentum is the film's major downfall.My advice know what you're getting. This is no masterpiece but it's not quite as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be. It just could have been a lot better based on the starpower that seemed to be attached to the project.".

The dialogue is reminiscent of Quentin's style but it of course does not sustain throughout the whole movie as Tarantino does. The prominence of 'badass' female characters and profuse bloody elimination of non essential and even essential characters also remind us of Tarantino film attributes again not with as much panache as Tarantino. The soundtrack was a wimpy imitation of what usually characterizes QT's movies. Enough said with the comparisons. I don't think the fame director ought to sue as one reviewer put it I think anyone trying to imitate is a form of flattery. Speaking as a fan of QT I believe he'll be amused. I can call myself that because in addition to seeing a few of his films at the cinema I've purchased all he's produced and or directed movies so I feel qualified in saying he won't be threatened by Catch .44.There is plenty of use of the .44 Remington Magnum in this movie and since there is an important scene where we have a Mexican standoff the very definition of the term I see whoever chose the title may have thought it was a smart play on words. If that's the case that person was wrong. For those who saw the movie I would call it 'The Delivery Guy' and bet those who secretly liked the movie would like that title better.Forest Whitaker played the offbeat bad guy Ronny like no one else could I like him in those roles. The bad girl trio of Malin Akerman Deborah Ann Woll and Nikki Reed my idea of antiCharlie's Angels were fun watching and listening to. No doubt Malin Akerman had the best part of the movie all things considered and she looks hot. I thought Jill Stokesberry in the short lived role of Francine looked very much like Helen Hunt it was uncanny spooky even. Shea Whigham Boardwalk Empire delivered one of his best performances very believable again all things considered. As for Bruce Willis well I did not bother reviewing the movie 'Set Up' another 2011 release he's churning them these days because I gave him credit for 'Red' which means he gets a pass based on earlier work ditto for Catch.44.The story is a weak attempt at a good script I had fun watching it but I won't bother seeing it again that's for sure. I don't think it's worth getting all worked up about like many unhappy viewers have. You can rent it for a buck and decide for yourself if you forked over  for an evening at the cinema to see this movie perhaps you could get worked up about that!".

None of the characters really stand out as interesting as we've all seen these characters before. By the end I was wondering where is this even going? The end result... nowhere.

Indeed the film will appeal to a variety of people casting it's target audience nets far and wide.Kudos to the DoP the cinematography in this film is fantastic and solid throughout. There was never a dull shot I thought was out of place it suited and told the story well. Not far behind is the lighting which is also incredible. So many shots stick in my mind and I'm sure I may even borrow a few of the lighting arrangements on my own productions.Acting is also good something which has also been picked at. Pegg pulls off a surprisingly good American accent as does his female counterpart. It was also nice to see Schwimmer on the big screen again the role shows a small detour from his usual characters. I found the characters were believable in their relationship to one another something which is very difficult to establish in the time it accomplished.I suggest people give this movie a chance. Make your own minds on what you think rather than rolling with what the critics say. The film isn't a masterpiece by any means just bloody good fun.".

Big Nothing is the story of two nice losers who decide to blackmail a pornaddicted priest. A foolproof plan. Needless to say everything goes wrong. Big Nothing made me laugh my head off and managed to shock me quite a few times which is what made it so unique. Superficially it might look like another crime caper but the sheer number of twists and turns and the fun factor of the whole thing really sets it apart from the rest of the pack. And just when you think you get the gist of it the tone itself changes and you're leaving the caper behind to plunge into a downright Gothic although still hilarious movie. It's a very intense ride which made me feel almost battered after the screening. My friends reacted in pretty much the same way. We laughed so hard we cried and we jumped our of our seats quite a few times. I suspect some people will be disturbed by the tone change but that's what makes the movie so unique in my opinion. It seems to get great reviews overall although I read a couple of nasty ones in the press. Those guys are probably too old for that kind of ride and I actually wouldn't recommend it to anyone wearing a pacemaker. Nothing's perfect in this world although I have a hard time finding what I didn't like. Kickass soundtrack and photography complemented the storyline perfectly. A fantastically punk movie. Discolovers should give it a miss! This was my very first review. More to come!".

Definitely rent the DVD. The score was also pretty good. If you have seen director JeanBaptiste Andrea's other film DEAD END you'll find this one much improved over his first effort. The writing is much improved and the production clearly benefited from a bigger budget.

	schema:reviewBody "I heard about this film from a friend who loved it. Being a fan of Pegg and Schwimmer I myself was enthusiastic. Finally I got to watch it last night and was blown away by its style slickness very dark humour and wit. I'd advise one to watch it later at night as most of the film takes place in the night and it just has a nocturnal feel to it. Trust me you won't fall asleep because 'Big Nothing' won't let you. It moves at an extremely fast pace but given the length of the movie 87 minutes I wish it was a little longer. It starts off by introducing Charlie as an unemployed who finds a boring job at a call centre where he meets Gus giving one the impression that it's a drama film but once the two are fired the film really moves at full gear and the slickness builds up more and more. The music contributes to that. Andrea and Asher's writing is solid. Though it is essentially a black comedy one really sympathizes with the characters and at certain points feels both sad for them and laughs at them. As director and writer JeanBaptiste Andrea clearly knows what he's doing as he leads the film without derailing at any point. David Schwimmer and Simon Pegg as the two moronic losers are spot on. Schwimmer does show some mannerisms of Ross Gellar from 'Friends' but still does a great job. It's a bit funny to hear Pegg speak with an American accent and it doesn't really appear natural but that's perhaps because I'm used to his Brit way of speaking. But on the other hand his character is a former ? conartist so Gus may not be an American at all. Nonetheless Pegg's awesome. Pegg and Schwimmer have worked again in 'Run Fatboy Run' a hilarious comedy only here they work as director and actor instead of coactors. Alice Eve as the young nymphet is very good as is Natasha McElhone who's accent at times sounds forced. Mimi Rogers is there for one scene but it is a very funny scene. 'Big Nothing' deals with strong themes such as 'crime does not pay' or 'money not being the solution to happiness' and ends in a wonderfully ironic way as Josie the Wyoming Widow a murderess comes across the Oregon Undertaker former conman Gus is conned in the end and Charlie finally receives an offer to have his book published but he already chose an alternative route which leads to a different destiny. His wife tells him that one doesn't need money to be happy and he realizes that she was right but it's too late. This little black comedy is a thrill ride all the way.".

One would hope that when embarking on a scheme that it would be smart looking to begin with at the very least smart enough to rope in someone you've only just met but this scheme is quite foolish from the outset. Charlie's problems are not even fully realised enough to make him look desperate. The slim running time and impatience to get to the meat don't help. Charlie is also irredeemably stupid. An ex teacher with a PHD should know how to check for a pulse or that leaving fingerprints all over the scene of the crime is not the smartest thing one could do. Pegg's character just whines and bitches throughout and doesn't even cut a likable rogue figure. In fact surprisingly there's nothing to like about Gus so why should we care? Director JeanBaptiste Andrea conjures some nice images and uses some good ideas. The opening moonlit scene the little girl's perspective from the swing and the animated description of the plan are all quite good but often goes too far stylistically for example his breaking the 180 degree rule constantly in the first act which serves only to disorientate and annoy.The plot is full of twists which is normal for a film like this but none really stick aside from perhaps the closing. The rest just keeps getting more and more ridiculous as it goes on. In all Big Nothing is a mixed bag with an ironic title one of those films you watch and then immediately forget about. The Ice Harvest did a better job at this kind of thing and that was no masterpiece either.Let's hope that Pegg and Schwimmer's Run Fatboy Run fares better than this. In the meantime if you want black comedy watch Very Bad Things instead.".

Their plan goes awry setting off a chainreaction of unfortunate events that makes it the longest night of their lives.I would not call this film one of the best ever made but I definitely think it is worth a much higher rating on IMDb. Higher than a 6.8 at least. It is a dark comedy and has been made very well for it's genre. But I admit I don't know too much about dark dramascomedies as I don't watch too many.I thought the movie is very engaging but starts out a little slow. But as the movie progresses the tension builds up and the story gets a lot more interesting. Especially in the 2nd half.I definitely think this is one of David Schwimmer's best roles yet. I have seen many of his movies and am an avid Friends fan and Big Nothing is one of his projects which really shows off his acting skills. His character Charlie did have a few RossGellerfromFriends reminders in him but overall was great and much different from the sweet lovable character he usually plays. I am glad he acted as Charlie and I'm sure he will break out of the softie mould he is stuck in soon. Simon Pegg made a very thrilling Gus. He was basically perfect and I thought he was the strongest performance in the whole film. I hate to admit it but Alice Eve was a very good Josie. She had a kind of slutty but sexy appeal and her voice was perfect for her character. She did not seem out of place at all. Her performance spruced up in the last 45 minutes or so though that was when her real acting began.I didn't find a single dull moment in this whole movie and I definitely think it is worth a watch.

Simon Plegg has fun with the limited material he's given but David Schwimmer seems to have some trouble breaking free of his whiny Ross character from Friends... and Natascha McElhone is all but wasted in a peripheral roll that is in the end unsatisfying and unbelievable.";

Well this plan goes so far off the chart that it twists you into one of those most bizarre but simply funny movies ever.Probably the most astounding part of the movie is Simon Pegg who acts astounding this man is British and acts as a damn American through this entire film classic. David Schwimmer in my mind leads the way with some good acting and possibly the best quote of the movie Don't spend it all in one place..This movie isn't one for the faint of the heart and if your gonna place bets on what is gonna go wrong and who is gonna live in this movie do it and get ready to be surprised.".

That memorable opening scene where Joe Pesci Ray Liotta and Robert DeNiro open the trunk of the car and see that their gangster friend is still alive and you know the rest.

A movie with such perfectly written dark humor is difficult to conclude however this movie does so with such perfect poetic justice that it seems unreal.This Jean Baptiste Andrea's film brings to mind the works of the Coen brothers with the clever twists and the sarcasticcynical commentary on human nature and the question of morality.".

I personally felt that there was a lot more potential here as the conceits plot twists and cases of mistaken identity not to mention the bodycount pile up. The second half involved an increasingly elaborate plot to dispose of the bodies left over from the first half of the film. Here's where I lost interest.Two things happened that made me just despair. The first being the introduction of the diabetic coroner. The second being the 'big twist' around Josie's character.Aside from the fact that the usually brilliant Simon Pegg seemed like a shell of a comedy actor without Nick Frost and that David Shwimmer's gamut of emotions have been better used in episodes of Friends He just seems to wear the same 'Oh Gee!' face in every scene! none of the characters have any charisma. They are all bland relatively uninteresting and seem almost embarrassed to be involved. The rest of the supporting cast have too little screen time usually because they are bumped off scant minutes after they appear but even those who do have more than 3 lines in the film make such a poor attempt at their roles that it is uncomfortable to watch.It's a shame because there is a lot of potential here.I wouldn't even worry about the raging debate as to whether Simon Pegg's American accent was any good or not. In a film that just doesn't engage on any level whether or not his accent is up to scratch is a very moot point.".

A movie with this cast especially the hilarious Mr Pegg should have had a good chance of giving me a few laughs but that never happen. A big big disappointment. It's a farce alright but it's not funny.A lousy plot and disappointing acting. I think the manuscript is the one to blame the most for this boring experience. Actually the best thing about this movie is the soundtrack Eels Ramstein etc.If you're looking for comedy I recommend you to re watch Shaun of the Dead instead of wasting time on this movie. Because this is not a movie I would recommend anyone.";

Two Italian brothers run a little restaurant serving superb food as a labor of love but it's failing in contrast to the wildly successful spaghetti emporium down the street with execrable food but which is raking in the big bucks. The story line  set in the late 50's U.S.A.  is paper thin but the movie is populated with interesting likable people and the tale is lovingly told with an excellent script and superb acting all around especially from the two brothers and from Ian Holm the British actor who does an unexpectedly great job as the owner of the red sauce place Ian Holm playing an Italian? Yes stunningly. Caring seriously about food does help one to appreciate this flick I have never seen the preparation and serving of food presented so beautifully and lovingly in a movie. The final wordless scene in which a simple omelette is prepared and the brothers express their reconciliation is for me one of the most eloquently poetic codas I have ever seen.

	schema:reviewBody "I just need to mention that this is my friend's review that I wanted with his permission to share with you. I believe his meticulous view has discovered a veiled aspect which most of us have missed.MRBig Night' is a movie not so much about food and Italian cuisine but rather about cultural encounter and identity crises that most immigrants face upon their arrival in the new homeland.The story cleverly unfolds the multipersonalities of an immigrant's character in a metaphorical representation. A character that is overwhelmed in a fierce inner struggle constantly striving to reach a desired compromised. The big night is a milestone in an eventful and often chaotic journey. It's a moment for close encounter with reality.The movie is about two brothers Italian immigrants trying to run  Paradise' a gourmet restaurant. Primo is an uncompromising chef who wishes to educate Americans to appreciate The Real Italian Food'. Despite the obvious failure of their business he stubbornly defies his customers' conception of Italian food. He simply cannot stand it when a customer wants her risotto painstakingly prepared seafood with spaghetti and meatballs and he calls her a Philistine'.While the brothers are battling for survival Pascal another Italian immigrant one generation older runs a busy restaurant that fulfills the American conception of Italian food. Pascal is the kind of immigrant who has a clear mission statement. He is here to do business.Secondo the younger brother who is in charge of management and accounting tries to convince his brother to give in and accept the business realities. He is in favor of changes to save the Paradise'.Primo the gifted chef Secondo the manager who wants to run his business with the Rules of the Game and finally Christian that mysteriously and quietly is there for the brothers in times of need all are three aspects of the same person. A person lost and exhausted in the Paradise'. Torn apart between Pascal who runs an enormously successful Italian restaurant across the street and Alberto the isolated barber who preserved his old social values.The Movie begins with a scene that shows Christian in deep thought looking at the sea. We will see him often around the brothers throughout the movie. He hardly says anything. However his presence has a mysterious significance yet unrevealed. Perhaps an aspect of the immigrants' character that is more fundamental than the ones affected by cultural differences.Primo represents that side of the immigrant that's terrified by the might of the new culture and the impending changes that eventually unravel. He is reserved strongly opinionated and scared that he may lose it all in this journey and end up eaten up' by the new culture.Secondo shows us the willingness of the immigrant for discovery understanding and adaptation to the new social values. He looks up to Pascal for advice and as Gabriella Pascal's mistress puts it sees him as a lighthouse' in a raging sea.The night of the feast is an important milestone in this evolutionary process. It is an opportunity for Primo to show us what he possesses and how precious  those possessions are. At the same time it's a moment to face the reality that Paradise' is in trouble and without a compromise it won't make it.The film ends with Secondo Christian and Primo eating three scrambled eggs the morning after the big night. Scrambled eggs and bread a basic food in both cultures implying a retreat to a common ground for further evaluation and perhaps some adjustments. The movie quite appropriately doesn't reveal the direction that our immigrants will take. However it beautifully displays the quiet coexistence of three personalities in a more persuasive journey!I wonder if the Big Night' is an adaptation of Freudian Psychoanalysis. If so could you identify Id'  Ego' and  superego'?SR".

	schema:reviewBody "Campbell Scott and Stanley Tucci are good friends in real life and together they made this delicious gem. Tucci plays Secondo who along with his brother Primo Tony Shalhoub run a restaurant named the Paradise. Primo is a genius as a chef but they are on the verge of going out of business so Secondo goes down the street to a very popular place run by an acquaintance named Pascal Ian Holm and Secondo asks for a loan. Pascal doesn't give it to him but decides to help him by having singer Louis Prima come to their restaurant with the press knowing he's coming also. Their restaurant will become famous when its mentioned in the paper so the two brothers plan a big night with special meals. Secondo invites his girlfriend Phyllis Minnie Driver and Primo wants to invite the flower shop woman Ann Allison Janney but is to shy. Secondo helps him out by inviting her. This is another enjoyable film where food is the common component that enables them to communicate. The food and its preparation is the art of the film. Watching Primo prepare meals is a real spectacle to behold. He really does come across as a great chef there is no doubt as you watch this. But at the core of this film is the love and respect of Secondo and Primo as brothers. Even when they argue it is done with mutual respect. Yes they get furious but at no real time do we get the feeling that they will walk away from one another. Scott and Tucci have created a wonderful blend of food and love and its the relationship between the two brothers that is the key here. Secondo is having problems committing to Phyllis and while its an important part of the film its not the main focus. Janney adds just the right touch as Ann and you can understand the awe that she feels when she watches Primo at work and can witness his skill first hand. Tucci and Shalhoub shine in their roles and together they bring a very good film up another notch! This film also does a believable job of recreating the time period that the film is suppose to take place in. When people ask me for a good film to rent I always think of this one. Its a real gem.".

Tucci plays Secondo who along with his brother Primo Tony Shalhoub run a restaurant named the Paradise. Primo is a genius as a chef but they are on the verge of going out of business so Secondo goes down the street to a very popular place run by an acquaintance named Pascal Ian Holm and Secondo asks for a loan. Pascal doesn't give it to him but decides to help him by having singer Louis Prima come to their restaurant with the press knowing he's coming also. Their restaurant will become famous when its mentioned in the paper so the two brothers plan a big night with special meals.

	schema:reviewBody "Big Night is a peaceful joy to watch because its themes and the overall feeling of the film is so normal. The characters so beautifully rich are realistic and so are their problems. The characters are mainly wonderfully infectiously bombastic Italians and entire scenes are sometimes constructed of the process of making Italian food from scratch. The subtlety and unaffronting reality of these qualities are so endearing to me. In fact the scene that leaves an imprint on me more than any of the others despite how fun it is to see the actors have a blast playing fiery thickmustachioed men with heavy Italian accents is a scene that hardly has a connection with any of the others. An Italian ballad is playing over the soundtrack through the previous scene and continues into this scene wherein Marc Anthony playing a lowlevel restaurant bus boy a small quiet incidental character begins dancing with himself as he mops the floor of the restaurant. When other characters enter the music coming from nowhere but the film's soundtrack itself cuts off and he continues mopping the floor as if the dancing never happened. It's so touching for that scene to have been slipped in giving a person who is only against the background of everyone's lives a dreamy sensitive personality that he keeps to himself.The focal point of the film is the chemistry between the characters of Stanley Tucci playing a hardworking pleading frustrated restaurant owner whose head carries only logic and a goal for success and Tony Shalhoub his brother whose aggressive passion is for the food he cooks and the mystery and subtext within it yet his interaction with people is painfully shy. Their clashes of pride their battles with each other's completely different perspectives and yet their sharing of the same dream are what drives the story.A lot of the film's humor comes from the hilarity of Ian Holm. Ian Holm a stifflimbed Englishman plays here a loud very animated hottempered Italian entrepreneur with a seamless and wonderfully entertaining delivery of an Italian accent and Italian movements. It's my favorite performance of his because I had never before imagined that he would play a role like this.Big Night is not a masterpiece nor do I think it was even meant to be one but what it is is subtle and interesting for purely human reasons. It's soundtrack is also a fantastic celebration of Italian music.".

There is a lot of attention given to the food and to its preparation and the cinematography used to actually depict the meal and the music superimposed onto it is fantastically enjoyable. It's like the dishes are actors or characters in the play! The movie's final scene is perhaps deserving of the alltime hall of fame. It plays out over several minutes of complete wordless silence yet it makes such a lasting impression. Ultimately the scene shows that the movie is not about the food or the striving for success but about the relationship between these brothers and that the relationship will outlast any of the trials they are undergoing no matter how severe.If you insist on a tidy ending that resolves all the issues don't look here because the ending is completely hanging.

Tucci playing the selfcentered but occasionally adorable well I think that's what he's aiming for Secondo cheats on his girlfriend and paces around depressingly presumably too hung up on the monetary problems he faces when he and his brother's restaurant looks like going bottom up to care about much else. And his brother Primo played by Shalhoub is so little more than a device to elicit more sympathy for the familial pains that they must all surely be feeling  unfortunately it's hit and miss at the best of times.Instead the film's only moments of real resonance come in the humorous asides of the communal gatherings in the restaurant itself relying not on the chemistry of the two brothers but instead on the audience's preconceived notions of family and community and the occasional joke that actually hits its target.The film isn't bad for a lack of trying and it credit is due for the fact that it manages to come together at all. But the more subtle moments  like the silent final shot of the film  tend to say far more than the scenes which are overwritten to do exactly that. Big Night is a reasonable time waster and its occasional moments of humour do enough to relieve the boredom that might otherwise set in but for the most part it is as dull as its horribly unimaginative title forebodes.If you want a real feelgood film that focuses on food but doesn't leave such a bland taste in your mouth try Ang Lee's superb Eat Drink Man Woman.".

How is this interesting? Well the relationships between the characters are so wellwritten and the acting is so good you really find yourself caring about these ordinary and very believable people.

It's a movie with lots of heart. Many scenes are rich in emotion even when the characters have no dialogue. Tony Shalhoub gives an intense performance as Primo the chef who always strives for perfection in haute cuisine.

It's a movie with lots of heart. Many scenes are rich in emotion even when the characters have no dialogue. Tony Shalhoub gives an intense performance as Primo the chef who always strives for perfection in haute cuisine. The food seems to become a character in itself particularly the pasta colossus the timpano. Big Night is the kind of movie you wish you could taste!";

Obviously if they wanted authentic Italians there are plenty to choose from including in Stanley Tucci's own family. But how can you beat Tony Shalhoub? The lesser question is how the heck did this get on the IMDb Top 250 at one time?

	schema:reviewBody "In the mid1950s two immigrant brothers from Italy work hard in New Jersey to keep their Italian gourmet restaurant Paradise in operation. The older brother the temperamental Primo Tony Shalhoub is a genius cook an artiste but only a cook. The business aspects of the restaurant are handled by his brother Secondo Stanley Tucci who also does cooking. He wants to make changes to sustain the business. While the two brothers often clash tempestuously over procedures they are perceptibly devoted to each other. Nevertheless the reality is that the business despite its sumptuous food is struggling to keep afloat. Tony is dismayed when an underappreciating woman orders both risotto and spaghetti together both are starches. What also irritates Tony is that the restaurant across the street Pascal's  which caters to the working man and gives Americans what they think is Italian food  is very successful. Do you know what happens in that restaurant every night? says Tony . . . the rape of cuisine! Pascal Ian Holm the owner of the competing restaurant later tells Secondo A guy works all day He don't want to look at his plate and ask 'What the f is this.' He wants to look at his plate see a steak and say 'I like steak.' Secondo though wants Tony cater to general public taste to some extent.Pascal as a friend of Secondo offers to assist him. It seems that the great and flamboyant Jazz entertainer Louie Prima is in town. Pascal has his picture on one of his restaurant walls. Pascal who claims to be Prima's friend offers to send Prima and his band to the Paradise for dinner and thus drum up publicity for the failing enterprise. So it is that the two brothers agree to work like blazes to prepare a feast for a king the big night. Obviously much movie time is spent in food gathering and preparation. And what incredible courses that develop! There are the triple risotto the splendid timpano with sausage and eggs and meatballs and pasta that sumptuous fish the roast pork! Besides being an epicurean's delight the entire dinner scene is fun! Although some complain about the ambiguous resolution the movie has important messages like the difficulties experienced by immigrants the cultural clashes the process of adaptability. The scenes are intimate for instance note the elegance of the little restaurant including the kitchen. The feel of the 1950s is there. Notice those largefinned Cadillacs! How about that music! Note that classic cool scene at the end where the eggs are cooked in real time with nary a spoken word. Both Tony Shalhoub and Stanley Tucci are so good with their hands that they make one believe that they are great chefs! Maybe they are good cooks after all. The supporting cast includes Minnie Driver Phyllis and Isabella Rossellini Gabriella both of whom look as dazzling as they ever did. Marc Antony as Cristiano also demonstrated his acting skills. And top kudos to codirectors Stanley Tucci again and Campbell Scott.SPOILER I could not resist but take a peak at the cast to see if a supposed main character was going to show up. As I did not see his name I suspected what the movie's outcome would be.One recommendation Don't watch this one if you are hungry!".

The uptight Primo is annoying while Secondo is unsympathetic either as he spends all his time being a playboy instead of trying to save the restaurant.Camera work is terrible.

There's a scene not long after that sees Secondo in his bank manager's office where he's told things are looking grim with the repayments .

No what happens is Secondo has romantic interludes with a couple of women and pays a visit to Pascal his rival who owns a successful restaurant across the road . It's difficult to explain what happens because little does happen . As I mentioned the screenplay is painfully low concept and no matter how well directed and played a movie is if it doesn't have much of a plot then you don't have much of a movie It should also be pointed out that if you're trying to stop smoking then there's no way you should be watching this movie since every single scene has somebody smoking a ciggie . I know it's trying to convey the 1950s when attitudes to smoking were very very liberal but I doubt if many of the cast will be collecting a pension after appearing in this".

It's a really fun movie and the action seems like an analogy to today's conflict humans fighting for nature against others who show no respect towards nature and won't care to cause damage to fulfill their goals. The movie's antagonist are such people they are really really hateful as they represent the humans' worst traits.While the movie isn't really something new and it has some typical clichs here and there it's a really good film. It's story and some elements are somewhat childish for example as the relation between Coo and Obata develops I couldn't avoid noticing similarities with some other Japanese animations such as Pokemon where such humancreature relations are present but that's not a bad thing just some people may not dig it as children do.

	schema:reviewBody "Coo of the Far Seas is a great adventuredrama anime from 1993 directed by Tetsuo Imazawa and produced by Toei Animation.Basic plot The day after a great storm hitting a small family's island a young boy named Yusuke finds a baby dinosaur while riding his jetski. He takes it to his dad and they decide to keep it for a while. However there is a big problem they have to face several parties are also interested in this 65 million year old creature and some of them are not so nice...This 116minutelong film is a great exciting movie which should be better known than it really is. It is also a great movie to be watched by a whole family. The animation is pretty good and so is the storytelling in this film. Julian Lennon's song Children of the World and the song which plays over the end credits are also fine.Actually I just so agree with IMDbuser Pablo who reviewed this film three years before I did in many aspects. And then I'm especially talking about the action itself as well as the environmental message the animation team managed to pack into this anime movie. Like how some of the humanity simply don't care about whatever happens to the nature around us just to reach whatever goal they have even if it eventually costs the lives of several creatures. It's just too bad not many anime moviesseries take on this type of messages as this film does.Again this film should be better known than it really is and is a great animated film to be watched by a family. Highly recommended. Overall rating is 910.".

The film starts with retired pro soccer player Kim Wonkang visiting Timor to make a quick buck. He has had several mishaps business wise and is laden with debts. Since Timor has newly found independence he thinks of opening a sports goods store and cashing on near and imminent development. He soon finds out that kids there can't afford a 60 shoe and what ensues afterwards is heart warming and inspiring. Kim though an amazingly kind person at heart has been portrayed as a shrewd businessman in the first few scenes. And seeing his character develop into what he is supposed to be was a treat. The kids too were great and played their parts to near perfection. The training sessions the short speeches and the realization scenes made this film worth watching. The hilarious banter between various characters provided the much needed comedic relief. All in all this a very decent film to watch one shouldn't expect too much and enjoy this with an open heart.".

There is admittedly some fun to be had as much of the film is really cheesy with some elements that you can't help but laugh at not the least of which is the dubbing.

While Snuff leans more ardently toward the former the current DVD presentation of this film helps this deservedly obscure classic drift a bit toward the latter.Let's clarify that this film wasn't intended to be passed off as an actual snuff film. If such a genre truly existed which we won't debate here since we're clearly talking about a film that is NOT a snuff movie chances are it would look a bit more like the footage hinted at in Mute Witness or 8mm than a carefully edited multicamera affair with dubbed audio and generous arrays of stock Carnavale footage. If anyone ever truly believed that filmmakers murdered someone on camera and surrounded that footage with a pseudostory about biker chicks who kill random people in surprisingly unbloody ways somehow found a way to bypass all of those dicey regulations concerning murder and its illegalites and found a distributor to get a theatrical release for said footage... Seriously no one did. I promise you.Yes this movie is tedious far too long and so ineptly made that I can not find a single reason to recommend it. To normal people that is. However if you actually know what this film is and still have any interest in seeing it then you kind of need to because it is as wretched an example of filmmaking as you could ever hope to encounter. Scene after scene it is a shining an example of crappy Cgrade schlock. But you know some of us really love crappy Cgrade schlock.We don't want good dubbing quality special effects or actors who had heard of the phenomenon of acting before the cameras were turned on them. We aren't concerned with continuity character development or coherent story structure. We simply want to spend 80 minutes of our life watching something that vaguely resembles a film yet ends up being an hour and twenty minute exercise in incredulity that forces us to question what's wrong with us for enjoying something that is clearly so unenjoyable.This film is a joke. And one would suspect that the filmmakers knew this. Now the reason that Snuff is awesome is that not only did a piece of unwatchable trash like this gain some level of infamy but 30 years later there is a reasonably intelligent person sitting at their computer typing this missive at 333 in the morning and another one reading said missive because they have yet to view this film.Ignore what you've heard about the grand guignol finale of this film because it truly is a disturbing bit of nastiness. The fact that it follows such a laughably bad precursor is probably the point of this entire affair. And kudos to Blue Underground for presenting this film as they did in a package without cover art synopsis or special features which contrary to the numerous criticisms of this I've read captures this film perfectly. If you would really want a Criterion Collection pressing of Snuff then you are clearly missing the point.Fans of terrible movies won't find one much more primitive than this although I'd also tip my hat to The Last Slumber Party. If that sounds appealing to you then you will thoroughly enjoy Snuff. If not I really have to question what you thought you were in store for when you popped in a nonexistentbudget South American film from the '70s called Snuff.Do I recommend this? No absolutely not. But do I own it and love the fact I own it? I kind of have to...".

	schema:reviewBody "Snuff is quite laughably bad.  Lame acting idiotic dialogue terrible voiceovers and poor picture quality even for 1971 is strongly evident here.  Bad movie buffs will undoubtedly like this one.The movie begins with a cokehead next to a rustedout train and chicks on motorcycles with a fauxSteppenwolf soundtrack it sounds like the beginning of Born to Be Wild in the background that repeats ad nauseum and can be heard at various times throughout the film.

It is extremely poorly written directed and acted but it is so bad that it will make you laugh.

The gang of hotties is pretty brutal to a girl named Ann. An American actress comes to Brazil to make a movie takes a lover and gets pregnant.

What brings you to rent the infamous Snuff is well the infamous snuff sequence. SPOILERS FOLLOW As the main movie ends the camera pulls back to reveal a film crew. A guy and a girl are making out on a bed and it turns out it's a snuff film! Her arm is cut a finger is chopped of with pliers her other hand is cut off with a ripsaw  wholesome stuff. Then she's cut open and her guts are played with for a while. The screen goes blank and you can hear the crew talk about how they ran out of film. How conveeenient. It's not very well done or even all that shocking. In fact all the tacked on snuff sequence did was make me want to see all of Slaughter. But you live and learn.".

	schema:reviewBody "Snuff is one of that small group of movies where the story surrounding its production and release supersede its contents by some margin. Exploitation directing duo Michael and Roberta Findlay made a Manson inspired flick in Argentina in 1971 called the Slaughter. Due to its low quality it did little business but was nevertheless bought by the producer Allan Shackleton who left it on a shelf for several years not sure what to do with it until he heard the rumour about the existence of snuff movies to this end he put some money together and filmed a new five minute ending which showed a woman being viciously murdered by the film crew responsible for making the film we have just watched the idea being that this was a real killing. The movie was released to great controversy with publicity generated by protesters and investigators some of which were hired by the producers themselves on the correct assumption that bad publicity is still good business. Needless to say the gamble paid off and the film made a lot of money. And despite being a hoax it only furthered the idea of the existence of snuff movies.Ultimately for better or for worse the end scene is what defines this film. A lot of the comments I read downplay the ending somewhat and say its laughably unconvincing etc. Don't get me wrong it is an obvious fake with professional editing and all that. But I honestly found it to be an actually nasty and uncomfortable viewing experience. The murder of the woman is brutal and sleazy accentuated by the quite decent gore effects for its day. This material would be strong anyway but it is made pretty grotesque on account of the objective of the movie which was essentially to draw people in to the cinema on the promise of seeing a woman being viciously murdered for their viewing pleasure. Obviously from the pointofview of today we can look back on it as an example of extreme bad taste cinema but you have to remember that at the time of its release its selling point was it was real murder on offer and quite a lot of people believed it which is obviously a pretty low way of getting punters through the door the very fact that so many of them did hoping to see a woman be killed before them is a very disturbing facet of human nature that's for sure.There is one thing that you can say for sure about Snuff and that is that it certainly provokes a reaction. It's an overwhelmingly negative reaction it seems yet it appears to offend people in two very distinct ways. There are those who are appalled at the whole tastelessness of the concept of the last five minutes while there are others deeply irritated by the awfulness of the first 70 minutes. Going by all other reviews I have read I have to accept that my view on this movie is a massively unpopular one but dare I say these wordsI actually enjoyed the main story The Slaughter. I get the feeling that there is more shame attached to that than someone liking the snuff bit! I am under no illusions about the technical ineptness here as this is certainly a Zgrade production with ropey camerawork chopsocky level dubbing a police station situated in a carpark and on and on. But I have seen lots of poor quality movies and frankly this one is a lot more interesting that a lot of them. Admittedly my fascination with the whole Manson murder case and all that that entailed makes the contents of this storyline get immediate plus points from me as its parallels are so utterly blatant after all the plot focuses on a group of female killer hippies led by a cult leader called Satan who eventually wind up entering the grounds of a mansion and kill everyone there culminating in the stabbing of a pregnant film actress who it hardly needs stating is a Sharon Tate substitute. It's essentially an exploitation movie with sex drugs violence and acid rock. It was ropey stuff sure but the bad girls were good to watch and anything with a countercultural vibe gets pass marks from me. Additionally some of the dialogue scenes were laughoutloud funny in an unintentional way and the murder scenes were mostly heroically daft. There is neither title card nor credits for The Slaughter those having been removed by Shackleton in his objective of passing this off as an actual criminal undertaking. The DVD distributor Blue Underground recently tried to find an original cut of the film to no avail. It may be lost and I for one think that it is a bit of a shame that it nowadays is only inextricably linked to Snuff. So there you go I like The Slaughter!In the final analysis Snuff is both historically important and extremely notorious while essentially being very strange. Its legend goes before it. Enter with caution would be the best advice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Snuff essentially follows a bizarre cult of biker women who follow a male leader fittingly named Satan around the South American countryside killing whoever they feel like killing and torturing the disobedient members. One of their targets includes a Hollywood actress in the area filming a movie.One of many films whose notoriety preceded its actual merit Snuff was ingeniously marketed in the 1970s which led to its legendary status. The issue? It's just plain bad. The central narrative concerning the cult and the biker girls is clearly cribbed from the reallife Manson family killings namely the horrendous murder of Sharon Tate and the film feels like just as much of a bad trip. The dubbing in the film is horrendous but the performances here really don't help matters. A great deal of the film is laughable due to gaudy performances and dated special effects. The worst part of it all is that the film's most notable scene was not originally part of the film or the narrative at all the evisceration of a woman on a bed while a film crew stands around recording and its displacement in the film is felt. That said it's inarguably the most technically impressive portion of the entire film and the best acted by a mile. The only problem here is that it's not properly linked together with the narrative and thus comes across as what it is an afterthought. A clever afterthought sure and probably the only reason this film was ever released to the world but it quite obviously doesn't belong and by the end of the whole thing you're kind of just left scratching your head.Overall Snuff is one of the weaker exploitation films of its time mainly due to disjointedness it aimlessly plods along its biker cult narrative before derailing into a gruesome murder scene that has absolutely nothing to do with what has narratively preceded it. I can deal with the bad dialogue and the bad dubbing and the opulent '60s hippie aesthetics but the lack of coherence makes it tough to even watch this as mindless entertainment. There are a few well done scenes and some gruesome gore albeit clearly faked but aside from that there's not a lot going on here. 310.".

It's really for the most part an aimless virtually plot less low budget TA fest without much on screen gore and bad dubbing.Why has this movie stood the test of time? Simple sly marketing. SNUFF may be the only movie to have drawn an audience based upon rumors about it's final few moments. That mixed with it's classic tagline The movie that could only be made in South America...where life is CHEAP! put asses in the seats.But what about the movie itself? Well as mentioned there's not a whole lot to it. Basically the plot is about a group of young women who are under the brainwashed control of a hippie guru who wants them to commit murders for him. It is implied that he wants the girls to target a woman who will be pregnant soon as the murder of a newborn baby will give him unlimited supernatural powers.If this sounds more than a little close to the reallife Manson murders that's not by accident. Plenty of movies have taken their subject matter from reallife tragedy The Amityville Horror Summer of Sam even Titanic but Snuff is extremely sordid with nigh a shred of respectability to it so just the sleaze shines through.But the real selling point is the infamous finale in which a beautiful script girl is supposedly murdered for real on camera. Obviously this is not true. But the enthusiasm with which this sham is executed makes it supremely entertaining for fans of sleaze. I was astonished by the seamless switch from the movie to reality. The gore effects at the end are nothing special but there's still an element of subversiveness that gives it a creepy atmosphere. SNUFF is no Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Last House on the Left but it delivers and is recommended for fans of exploitation if only for historical purposes.".

However the similarities stop there and you are certainly not going to see Celine Dion give a water bottle a blow job. The takes her from South Africa Australia Asia Europe and the Americas. Along the way we see plenty of concert footage and there are lots of action behind the scenes meet and greets with fans cast  crew dinners throat problems and sickness birthdays and much more. If you are a Celine fan the concert footage will be enjoyable and I admit she certainly does have a voice. The rest is quite interesting there are moments that show touring builds bonds and relationships such as where one of her dancers leaves the show there are also some nice family moments with her husband and child.However much of it seemed a little staged for the camera such as Celine singing to a young black South African girl who looked very uncomfortable and some of the fan meets which were a little scary often gave the impression that Dion was bored senseless but perhaps doing that sort of thing time and time again must become a little repetitive. I'm sure that this film would appeal more if you have a liking of Celine Dion without that it's mildly entertaining but it's difficult to view it without thinking of the hysterical youtube video Celine Dion is still amazing.more of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Just saw this at an Advanced Screening 2 hours ago in Huntington Beach This film doesn't have a title nailed down yet. It used to be called I'm with Cancer but IMDb has it listed as Live With It. The title we were shown in the film and the title that was on the invite was Get Well Soon. They asked us our opinion of the titles Also include was the title Bright Side but no one really liked any of the titles. So for the sake of confusion I'll call it Get Well Soon. Get Well Soon is the very believable story of Adam a 27 year old nice guy who waits at cross walks at 530 in the morning when nobody is on the road and other joggers have already trotted past. Adam writes stories for radio programs and seems to genuinely care about the stories and the people who are listening to them. After persistent back pain Adam goes to the doctor and is diagnosed with Cancer. He is assigned Katherine a doctorate student who is getting experience for her dissertation to talk to about his new problems. This film will immediately draw comparisons to 2009's Funny People which unfortunately can't be ignored. But fortunately aside from the fact the main character is diagnosed with a terminal illness this is a completely different film. Where Funny People had a lack of connection with its main character due to Adam Sandler being a prick to everyone and being rich on top of that Get Well Soon's Joseph Gordon Levitt is the everyman that everyone can relate to. He does a fantastic job expressing the feelings of calm fortitude as well as isolation. You can see it in his face. It's the little things that make a film feel authentic. Levitt's performance is heart breaking and uplifting at the same time. He maintains a steady calm for most of the film that just feels real. You know this is a dark comedy when there is a Patrick Swayze joke in the first 20 minutes of the movie. I'm not sure if that one's gonna stay in the final cut though lol. This film is very funny throughout. All of the people in the after film focus group said it maintained a perfect balance of comedy and dramatics. I saw Love and Other Drugs and liked it but this film is much more streamlined and has no extraneous scenes. Seth Rogen is absolutely hilarious. I'll be the first to get my opinion out that Rogen is great in everything he's in but he really killed it again. Weed smoking is given a fantastic treatment by this film like director Jonathon Levine's previous work the very amusing The Wackness. There are two scenes that are a creative and effective way to show the effects of marijuana. I love the way they shot a conversation between Adam Rogen and two of Adam's older cancer friends. Anna Kendrick plays a similar role to the one she played in Up in the Air. She does a great job in this too. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Adam's girlfriend and Angelica Huston is his over bearing mother. I rated this film an Excellent which is the highest possible rating and which 18 of the 30 people who stayed after agreed with. 11 said Very Good and 1 said Good. I really enjoyed the film. It didn't really do anything wrong. It might have a bit too much profanity for the older crowd but its central story is so appealing. On that note actually there were several people who said they would not have come to the screening if they knew full well that it was about cancer. I feel that is so extremely narrow minded that no one should even admit that to a group of people. Please if you are on the fence and don't want to go to a depressing movie get over it and see a fantastic hilarious film in Get Well Soon.".

	onyx:emotionText "Just saw this at an Advanced Screening 2 hours ago in Huntington Beach This film doesn't have a title nailed down yet. It used to be called I'm with Cancer but IMDb has it listed as Live With It. The title we were shown in the film and the title that was on the invite was Get Well Soon. They asked us our opinion of the titles Also include was the title Bright Side but no one really liked any of the titles. So for the sake of confusion I'll call it Get Well Soon. Get Well Soon is the very believable story of Adam a 27 year old nice guy who waits at cross walks at 530 in the morning when nobody is on the road and other joggers have already trotted past. Adam writes stories for radio programs and seems to genuinely care about the stories and the people who are listening to them.

	schema:headline " The perfect balance between drama and comedy '5050' depicts cancer the right way";
	schema:reviewBody "Most movies don't know how to handle cancer. Heck most people don't know how to handle cancer  and I'm not talking about the patients. Cancer or any other terminal illness for that matter almost always plays some kind xfactor in a film  that is when a film even dares to enter a realm often deemed depressing and not for the movies. Most often scripts will position cancer as a tearjerking emotional turning point in a film or as the initial spark of some banal live life to the fullest comedy.5050 puts an end to that. Written semiautobiographically by cancer survivor Will Reiser it would seem it takes one to write one. Although cancer drives the entire story the story doesn't fixate on cancer or melodramatize the terrible truths we already know about potentially fatal illness. Perhaps you could tell as much from the trailer thanks to some typical Seth Rogen antics but the injection of contemporary Rrated humor is neither irreverent insensitive nor an attempt to simply put a positive spin on a depressing subject. Life  believe it or not  doesn't stop for cancer. People don't sit in the hospital the entire time and then lie at home in bed the rest. Reiser's story provides a mostly unforced and honest depiction of a young man's diagnosis and treatment for potentially fatal spinal cancer one where cancer isn't the conflict in and of itself but the way it so dramatically changes the behavior of the people whose lives it enters and positively and negatively alters relationships.Joseph GordonLevitt continues his spree of playing absolutely lovable main characters as Adam a playitsafe 27yearold who after the initial shock handles his diagnosis in stride keeping his ups and downs internal other than when the script cues him to let it out a bit. The more external symptoms come from Adam's girlfriend Bryce Dallas Howard best friend Kyle Seth Rogen and mother Anjelica Huston.Other than focusing on these relationships director Jonathan Levine The Wackness puts particular emphasis on character perspective which will change instantaneously at points throughout the film. In one terrific sequence Adam enters the hospital for his first chemo treatment and gets bummed out by all the sick and ailing people in the hallway. After the older men he meets while getting treatment Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer give him some marijuanafilled pastries he leaves down the same hallway high as a kite suddenly elated despite the same negative images lining the hall. Levine understands that so much of how you deal with cancer relates to mood and perspective at any given time.Levine coaxes brilliant and thoughtful performances out of his actors. Even though Rogen exerted his usual shtick a bit more than needed he handles his character as written someone who wants desperately to help his best friend but hides behind shallow selfcentered form of support that many men turn to because they can't communicate emotions all that well.The women of 5050 also deliver if not more so. Howard's character is an unlikable mess but she gives her performance convincingly. Anjelica Huston perfects the ideal onscreen mother the best since Melissa Leo's Oscarwinning mother in The Fighter. Anna Kendrick also continues to blow me away with her talent. She plays a psychiatrist working on her PhD who receives Adam as just her third patient. She gives such lifelike quirks to her characters and Katie plays right to her strengths.But in a dramacomedy about cancer the key lies in tone and for that Levine should become an Alist director. 5050 could have easily turned into a Hollywood hackjob like the various comictoned cancer films before it a film that either overplays the dramatic or overcompensates with the humorous but 5050 might be one of film's best balancing acts between the two. The shifts feel completely natural between moments of deep sentiment and moments of levity. Those who can't help but fixate on this being a movie about cancer will likely have to remind themselves to feel serious when 5050 just wants you to simply absorb it as you would any other film.Other than some predictable moments and plot devices to give the film a nicer Hollywood sheen 5050 provides a genuine and heartfelt movie experience one that neither goes for the emotional sucker punch nor the sugarcoated version. Instead of making us look at cancer in a specific way it makes us look at the way we look at cancer  or any uncomfortable subject  the way we talk about it or don't talk about it the way we interact with those who live with it and the way we cope with it ourselves. That way when someone we love has a serious problem we can ultimately do what's best for that person.Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com!".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. The great Richard Pryor had a portion of his act dedicated to having a heart attack based on his real life experience. I guess if he can generate laughter from a coronary there is no reason writer Will Reiser and director Jonathan Levine The Wackness can't view Cancer as Comedy. There is little doubt that the subject matter of this film will limit its audience but for those brave souls who give it a shot I believe you will find it funny touching and insightful.The film introduces us to Adam Joseph GordonLevitt who is a very nice very normal very lowkey guy who works at a radio station as a writer ... a very conscientious radio writer. Adam experiences a nagging pain in his back which is unusual for a healthy 27 year old. After a few tests the emotionless doctor informs him that he has a rare spinal cancer ... also very unusual for a healthy 27 year old. From this point forward the film borders on brilliance at times.Adam's girlfriend is played by Bryce Dallas Howard his mother by Angelica Huston and his best friend by Seth Rogen. Each reacts in different ways to Adam's diagnosis but what's really interesting is not just how these people react but also how Adam reacts. He moves forward in his meticulous manner but all the while we know the emotions are brewing. We see this in his sessions with his therapistintraining played by Anna Kendrick.Seth Rogen's character is basically a carbon copy of his act in 40 Year Old Virgin. He spews profane oneliners faster than our ears can process. Despite the aggressive front Rogen's character is a friend with a heart ... and one who doesn't hesitate to share his medicinal marijuana.So while Rogen's character generates much of the laughter the real treasure of this film is in the subtleties of each character in certain moments ... and each character has their moment. Many will compare this to Adam Sandler's film Funny People which also starred Seth Rogen. But this movie has infinitely more depth and substance than that one offered.My warning brace yourself. My theatre was filled with tears and sniffles with significant laugh out loud moments mixed in. This is an emotional selfreflective film that will confound you as you inexplicably laugh while listening to cancer talk.".

	schema:headline " Hilarious and touching at the same time";
	schema:reviewBody "Mixing cancer and comedy doesn't seem like it should go so well but 5050 is a film that makes it work. Joseph GordonLevitt stars as Adam a 27 year old easy going guy who unexpectedly gets diagnosed with cancer. The film details his struggle to beat the disease and all the hardships that come along with having to fight a disease as crippling as cancer at such a young age. Adam is surrounded by various other people in his life that all influence him in different ways. Seth Rogen plays his best friend Kyle who always tries to help Adam out but doesn't always know how to go about it. Anna Kendrick plays Adam's therapist Katherine whose attempts to help Adam cope with the cancer work at times but at other times she just can't find the right way to connect with the grieving youngster. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Adam's girlfriend and Anjelica Houston is one of the strongest characters Adam's overprotective mother. The film is a compassionate tale of love and friendship while simultaneously being a raunchy pothead comedy. The overlap is strange but it works incredibly well.There are so many ways to do a comedy film about cancer wrong but very few ways to do it right. 5050 thankfully manages to find the sweetspot of this risky terrain and succeeds in being a charmingly touching film as well as a wildly hilarious one. The writer of the film Will Reiser based the film on his own experiences with fighting and beating cancer at a young age and his passion and understanding of this story shine beautifully through the film and its characters which surely all resemble Reiser's own friends and family in some way. 5050 doesn't lean too far to either side of the comedy versus drama spectrum and it always maintains a consistent level of heartwarming hilarity balanced with touching sincerity. The drama and comedy weave in and out of each other perfectly and seamlessly with neither genre feeling inappropriate or out of place. It is sincere filmmaking at its finest.Moreover 5050 just does a great job with its balance of genres but also with the overall story and the great characters within that story. We grow such passionate empathy for Joseph GordonLevitt in a way I never thought could be possible. The film draws us into his troubled world so well and we are rooting for him all the way cheering on his every move and growing more and more attached to him with every passing moment. We also grow to love the supporting cast who with the exception of one particular character but I won't spoil anything support Adam through all his hard times. The characters are all so well written and they play their key roles in Adam's life perfectly. 5050 is a movie structured to where every character serves a major purpose in furthering Adam's development as well as the development of the plot. And so as we watch the relationships between Adam and the people in his life grow and fade we develop a deeper understanding of his character making 5050 an incredibly human story.It's always nice to be so surprised by a film's quality. I expected good things from 5050 from the first time I saw a trailer but the movie itself exceeded my expectations. It is what the dramady subgenre is all about. It is a film tailor made to be the subgenre's posterchild. I laughed I lamented and I was brought close to tears at how heartwarming and touching of a film 5050 is.".

I cried for about a whole straight 20 minutes in total and laughed or glued my eyes to the screen the rest of the time. This movie will make you not only appreciate all the work went into it but it will make you appreciate life itself. It is so brutally realistic. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Seth Rogen are a great duo and the supporting cast does a great job as well. This movie was made with respect for its viewers. It takes something so serious and so taboo to laugh at and makes it a comedy and a drama. It exceeds in both genres. If I am correct this movie is somewhat based on the Screenwriter's life who also went through something very similar and most of the events in the film are based on things he had to go through as he also got cancer in his 20s.Go see 5050! You will not regret it at all! I am considering it for one of my favorite movies but I think that is just a bit too soon as I need to have multiple viewings to judge if a movie is one of my favorites. I can guarantee one thing. 5050 is an instant classic!".

	schema:reviewBody "Adam GordonLevitt is a rulefollowing mildmannered twentysomething who lives in Seattle with his girlfriend Rachael Bryce DallasHoward and works at Seattle Public Radio. His life takes a sudden and dramatic turn when he is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer that has taken over his spine. A laidback kind of guy Adam handles each hurdle with surprising ease and levity while engaging in somewhat helpful counseling from Katie Anna Kendrick a young psychologist the hospital assigns him. Before long though his complex relationships with Rachael his best friend Kyle Seth Rogen and his needy mother Angelica Huston become even more convoluted with the introduction of chemotherapy and medicinal marijuana into his life. As the severity of his condition increases Adam begins to reassess his life his relationships and the nonplussed faade he uses to get himself through.The inevitable comparisons between 5050 and 2009's Funny People are unfortunate. While I stuck up for Funny People more than most of my colleagues even I will admit it is an incredibly flawed film that misses the mark on many levels. 5050 then plays out a bit like what Funny People should have been right down to the performance of Seth Rogen. It is first and foremost a very funny movie and that is where Funny People first went awry. You can't make a comedy about cancer or any other serious illness for that matter and fail to produce a genuinely funny script. Laughs come often and organically. I also quite liked that writer Will Reiser who based his script on the events of his own battle with cancer makes it clear early on that he intends to laugh at cancer and if you're not up for that you're in the wrong theater. That is not to say that the disease itself or the havoc it wreaks on Adam's life is disrespected or ignored in fact 5050 gives a fairly realistic view of the hell that is aggressive cancer and the sometimes even more aggressive treatment. 5050 is bold but soft a combination that works well.The dialogue between the characters in 5050 flows with tremendous ease especially in the scenes involving Adam and Kyle. This dynamic between JGL and Rogen is the meat of the film and the two play it out brilliantly. They have a chemistry that Anne Hathaway only wishes she could develop withwell anyone. That was an unnecessary shot at Miss Hathaway. My apologies. They reminded me of the type of friendship I might have with any one of my closer pals if we cursed more and occasionally smoked pot. Adam's other relationships are a bit awkward but whether this was done on purpose or not it serves the narrative well. In my mind he would have a tense partnership with Rachael because they're clearly not suited for each other and any furtherance of his friendship with Katie beyond doctorpatient would be a bit odd. All of the supporting actors hold their own. As spoton as I might have been with JGL all those years ago I would have never guessed after reluctantly watching Twilight that Kendrick would be an actress whose performances I truly look forward to. This isn't quite to the level of her work in Up in the Air but it is good and believable nonetheless. Huston's character seems a bit overthetop in the early going but the depth of her character comes to light in the late stages and Huston pulls it together splendidly. And Rogen gives what might be his best performance to date. To be fair I'm not much of a Rogen fan so I'm far from an expert on his value as an actor. But whereas he was completely outclassed in Funny People and pretty much plays the same character in almost every film he shows a little more strength in 5050 than he ever has before with the possible exception of Knocked Up. I actually liked him and I haven't felt that way toward him very often.But of course the weight of 5050 rests almost entirely on the shoulders of JGL and he holds up to the challenge. One of the best compliments I can give an actor is to say that he and his character become one and the same. That's what JGL does here and that's why 5050 succeeds. He envelopes himself into the Adam character and makes his portrayal incredibly believable. It is almost like watching a documentary on a young cancer patient. Adam handles his disease with class and dignity but not without emotion. His outbursts are few but powerful and through them JGL sells the story beautifully. Simply put this guy is a star and 5050 serves as the announcement of such to those of you who didn't already know this to be fact.5050 is honest and at times tough to watch but never purposefully harsh or depressing. In fact it is generally positive but in a way that isn't all sunshine and unicorns. It is smart hilarious and even touching while all the time remaining respectful of the audience's ability to relate to difficult circumstances without artificial emotional fishing. It is an excellent film marked by one outstanding performance that deserves the attention received come Award Season.".

Adam is twentyseven and works for a Seattle radio company. He is informed that he has a rare form of Cancer called Neurofibrosarcoma and is told he only has a 50 chance of living with it. Frustrated but moving day by day in a seemingly calm manner with his buddy Kyle Rogen Adam continues his long journey only to be bothered by his annoying selfcentered girlfriend Howard frequently. Through thick and thin Adam starts to cope with his disease and manages to stay calm for most of the picture.We all have to die at one point. It's part of the life. But I can't imagine the sadness and calamity brought upon someone who finds out they have a rare form of Cancer and that their chances of living are fiftyfifty. At twentyseven nonetheless. My mother who has work in a Chemotherapy unit for about a decade said that the youngest she has even seen someone die from Cancer is two and a half years old. Some people hardly get to experience life at firsthand because of Cancer.There are so many forms of Cancer rare and common harmless and not that your chances of getting it are very high. Getting it is at random but coping with it is even harder. While 5050 has a heartbreaking and is sometimes emotiontesting and tearjerking it still has a strong comedic relief thanks to Seth Rogen who is rather unfairly bashed in a majority of his films.The acting is superb by both leads the parents of Adam played by Angelica Houston and Serge Houde are portrayed effectively and in a loving way and the screenplay and Johnathan Levine's direction never fails or works against this film in any way. Three years prior he was creating good chemistry between Ben Kingsley and Josh Peck in The Wackness. Now he's finally mastered in creating two characters that do nothing but sparkle when on screen together. You can't really call this a Seth Rogen film because while his comedy is here his underlying sweetness shows through the cloth of this film more than it has ever done before. The last time he gave a performance this well done was in Sandler's Funny People.Thanks to a wonderful third act in terms of direction and screenplay you get an all out emotional breakdown from the characters and yourself. 5050 has a way with making emotional moments not seemed contrived but welcomed. I think out of everyone in the theater my mom was more emotional than the average person in the general public which is understandable.Many films have come out this year and many have been ignored. Comedies and dramas alike have been swept under the bus with other blockbusters in theaters at the same time. I plan on doing a list of the top ignored and underrated films of 2011. I hope 5050 doesn't make that list.Starring Joesph GordonLevitt Seth Rogen Bryce DallasHoward Angelica Houston and Serge Houde. Directed by Johnathan Levine.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought this was a better film than The King's Speech or Social Network my two favorite films of last year. Nothing this year has come close so far to the sheer brilliance of 5050. It is the best disease of the week film ever made which sounds like a backhanded compliment but I don't know how to describe the genre any better.I have always felt that GordonLevitt along with Gosling are far and away the two best young actors working today. I thought that GordonLevitt deserved an Oscar nomination for The Lookout but knew that was never going to happen. This is his time. His performance as a young man battling cancer is pitch perfect. You will laugh and cry along with him throughout his difficult journey. His best scenes are with his therapist played by Anna Kendrick. She was good in the overrated Up in the Air she is great in this film playing another neophyte in a high powered career. She will be nominated as well no doubt.Seth Rogan has the role of his career thanks in part to Will Reiser the screenwriter who was able to take the whole sexist slacker pothead thing that Rogan does and add a dimension of humanity. I think both of them also deserve Oscar nominations. Because of the nature of his role I would be surprised if Rogan gets one but not too surprised. He is just hilarious and at times very touching.Finally we come to Jonathan Levine a director that I had never heard of prior to this film. He is fantastic with actors here and has a great style. I say he is a shoo in come Oscar time.Now this review has really centered around Oscar and that is for a reason. It will not be released for awhile and I was lucky to see a preview screening in Denver last night. I could think of no other way to get the point across more clearly that this is a brilliant film that you must run to when it is released.One more thing. I made the mistake of taking my 13 year old daughter thinking the R rating was more about the pot and the language and that the message of the film would overcome those issues. I kind of regret it. I really don't mind her having seen the film in an overall context because the message is terrific but man was it raunchy and uncomfortable to sit through with her.".

He is informed that he has a rare form of cancer called Neurofibrosarcoma and is told he only has a 50 chance to live with him. Frustrated but moving day to day with a seemingly calm with the help of his friend Kyle Seth Rogen Adam continues his long journey of recovery.

It's as if the film were telling us if it is your last minutes let then be smiling!.The cast is terrific even comic Seth manages to have an interesting dramatic performance Anna Kendrick formidable as ever Angelica Houston and Serge Houde as Adam's parents with great performances but who shines above everyone is Joseph Levitt with a fantastic performance proving to be an very promising actor.Thanks to a wonderful third act in terms of direction and screenplay that never fail or work against the film at any time the public has an emotional breakdown all of the characters and the story itself and fantastic to witness.".

	schema:headline " The most overrated movie I've ever seen";
	schema:reviewBody "93 on Rotten Tomatoes? Seriously? Look I'm not a cynic. I love lame weepy dramedies. Even those with little depth can be thoroughly touching and entertaining. But what I can't roll with is shty writing and story telling. Why do I say that you ask? A few big reasons1 See usually when a movie features a character story that character must undergo some sort of fundamental change. He or she may learn something from a trial or a difficult experience and come out stronger on the other end. For example the character might find out that he has cancer and appreciate life more because he's come to terms with his own mortality. There is absolutely no character arc in this movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt's character Adam DOESN'T CHANGE AT ALL THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE. He starts off as a banal character who just kind of goes through life who doesn't even have any notable character traits in the first place. He finds out he has cancer and by the end of the movie...he is still a banal character who just kind of goes through life. Ask yourself this question what exactly did Adam learn throughout the movie? What kind of wisdom did having cancer impart in him. How exactly was his life different from before his cancer to after? The answer is NOTHING. For one thing I find this a little insulting to cancer victims because in my opinion it trivializes the trauma of having cancer. My grandpa has cancer right now. You think his life is different because of it? It sure as hell is. For another thing this is just poor crappy storytelling.2 I have a friend a PHILOSOPHY MAJOR IN COLLEGE who told me to pay attention to Seth Rogen's character Kyle because he's interesting. No he's not. He's not interesting. You know how he came across as a jerk the whole time who took advantage of his friend's horrible situation and didn't seem to care the whole time? And you know how at the end they show the book on his table or whatever? This isn't depth. It's a CONTRADICTION. It's bad writing. It doesn't make Kyle a deep character at all. It makes Kyle a horribly conceived character who doesn't make any sense. I realize there's a forum thread about this movie on IMDb about whether or not Kyle is a good friend. The answer is there is no answer. Why? Because the writer of the movie didn't care enough to write a good answer into the script. Addendum to 2 the characterizations of every supporting character in this movie sucked. Bryce Dallas Howard's character of the bad girlfriend is just too simple. I don't like movies where the bad guy is just evil and nothing else. It's too easy that way. It's lazy. Everyone else just basically had one character gimmick. Anna Kendrick naive. Oh and messy don't forget messy. Anjelica Houston overbearing. Old dying people cynical. 3 I just get this weird feeling that everybody loves that scene in the car where Joseph Gordon Levitt cries. It's really emotional I guess. And I understand that this was a moment of catharsis for the character and maybe the acting was pretty good here. But one single scene out of context doesn't make a movie good. 4 There are a lot of Juno moments in this movie. You know what I mean. The kind where they do some random shots of scenery maybe play some indie music you've never heard of. This is usually done to create some air of deep contemplation. It's a fking farce. It's a trick to make you think the movie's smarter than it is. Don't be fooled. Now I'll be fair. Here are things I liked1 Acting not bad. I find JGL really overrated and I feel like every single movie he's been in gets way too much credit. But he wasn't bad in this or anything. I happen to like Anna Kendrick. Seth Rogen is okay as well because his job was to be Seth Rogen. 2 Ummm actually that's it. Well I like criticizing this movie. Maybe that counts. No one wants to insult the cancer movie. I certainly don't. But just because I hate the movie doesn't mean I'm unsympathetic to cancer victims. A lot of filmmakers get away with creating pure crap just because of the subject matter. Don't let this sway your opinion. A crap movie is a crap movie. There are a lot of movies like this that in my opinion are given way too much credit. By no means am I a film snob but I think people need to check out more established directors. That way they'll have higher standards than fauxintellectual weepy bullst like this.".

Basically twenty seven year old public radio journalist Adam Lerner Golden Globe nominated Joseph GordonLevitt is just your normal average guy with artist girlfriend Rachael Bryce Dallas Howard and coworker best friend Kyle Seth Rogen. His life dramatically changes however when he goes to the doctor suffering with strange aches and pains and he is diagnosed with a very rare form of spinal cancer meaning that he will undergo chemotherapy and looking the disease up on the internet it looks like he has a 5050 chance of survival. Adam tells Kyle who sticks very close with him for support and to give him positivity about his condition and when he tells his overbearing mother Diane Anjelica Huston who cares for his father Richard Serge Houde who is suffering Alzheimer's disease she is very concerned. He does accept his mother's offer to stay at their house to be cared for and Rachael despite being uncomfortable going with him to hospital says that she will help take care of him that is until Kyle sees her kissing another man and reveals this to Adam. After the break up Kyle keeps his spirits up and he says that Adam should try and use his disease for his own benefit such as picking up women who will feel sympathetic so with a shaved head prior to chemotherapy they try this theory out. Seeking more positivity and advice Adam starts seeing young and inexperienced therapist Katherine McKay Up in the Air's Anna Kendrick they start a rocky relationship of sessions but he opens up to her about many things and they start to see each other outside of sessions as friends and he also becomes friends with fellow chemotherapy patients Alan Philip Baker Hall and Mitch Matt Frewer. Mitch dies and fears are obviously welling up inside of Adam especially after he discovers the therapy is not working and a risky surgery is the last resort and the night before he has a bad argument with a drunken Kyle and he calls Katherine to get some much needed support. The next day Kyle and he make amends and go to the hospital and after the six hour operation to remove the tumour the doctors tell Kyle Diane Katherine and Richard that the bone degradation was worse than first thought but the surgery was successful and they hear Adam will recover. The film ends happily with Adam recovering very well with Kyle rubbing cream onto the huge scar on his back and he is getting ready for a date with Katherine and together they smile wondering what the future will hold. Also starring Andrew Airlie as Dr. Ross. GordonLevitt gives a good vulnerable and touching performance as the victim to the fateful disease Rogen gives his usual great brash and sometimes foulmouthed performance as his best friend together they are a good double act and other cast members Howard Kendrick and Houston also do well being concerned and supportive the story does not make any jokes about what is happening to the character but it does leave room for social and dialogue humour so it all adds up to an interesting comedy drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Comedy or Musical. Good!".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought this movie was pretty good I laughed I didn't cry but thought about crying for the most part it handled its topic realistically and maturely.BUT there were three things I didn't like in this film1. The main character's dad having Alzheimer's. Great idea and an opportunity for comparing and contrasting ailments but it's totally undeveloped in the story and leads nowhere and is just distracting.2. The girlfriend. She's first handled realistically then out of nowhere becomes a huge jerk. It's okay that she's a jerk and it's okay that she doesn't want to go to treatments with the main character she's only human. But then she goes from a round to flat character and the butt of jokes. She wasn't given any room to develop she became something to move the plot along and nothing more.3. The ending. No I'm not going to complain there's a happy ending I'm very glad there's a happy ending that's fine. But tagging on a love story makes the whole cancer seem like a questnarrative a journey that our hero must triumph over to reach his onetruelove. In essence it's equating cancer as a character building experience and the hero has won his prize in a girl.That's a little simplifying. I've never had cancer but people in my family have and some have died and from what I can see cancer sucks. It ruins your life and everybody around you it's slow it's painful it's a horrible way to die. It's not something you laugh off. It changes you. It's not something you go through and then at the end you wipe your brow and say Whew! Glad that's over! You worry it will come back. You've been through this painful experience that wasn't caused by anything you did that you didn't ask for. It just happened to you and it changes you.I'm not saying I'm not glad the main character is happy and alive at the end I'm just saying it's a little Hollywood magic that he ends up with his shrink the only person that truly understands him? after going through this traumatic event. It equates being in a relationship as the prize won for winning the game of cancer. There's no winners of cancer only survivors. Validating cancer as an enriching experience and manufacturing a reward for winning it is what makes this otherwise vibrant movie both stale and oddly preachy.".

	schema:headline " Living with cancer.";
	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to highemotion situations in real life few are more extreme than a diagnosis of cancer. Add in the fact that when Joseph GordonLevitt's Adam Lerner is only 27 years old when he gets the news and you already have a story primed for melodrama and loaded with tears and cheers. Firsttime writer Will Reiser uses his own experience with cancer at a young age to play down the dramatic aspects of illness and instead showcase the lighter side of things showing that even when you have cancer you still want to get laid and stoned with your best friend. It's not a strict comedy by any means there are quite a few moments that got me a little choked up but Reiser clearly set out with a goal to show things a little lighter than cancer is usually treated in the film. For the most part this works and although at times I felt it was a little too light I enjoyed Reiser's more authentic portrayal of a diagnosis like this.The film sets out to be an unconventional cancer movie and it achieves at that but it's still so much a cancer movie that there isn't any room for anything else. Yes getting a severe diagnosis like this still leaves room in your life for comedic moments but it also doesn't control every second of your life. It felt like every frame of this movie was about cancer and there wasn't any room for just...life. When Adam's best friend is a jerk it's about cancer when his mom is too worried it's about cancer when his girlfriend does something awful it's about cancer. Adam learns his diagnosis early on in the film and we're not given enough time to understand the character before this so the whole thing ends up revolving around the cancer. The whole thing would have benefited so much by getting us to have a stake in him before he gets the news but instead Reiser builds the entire movie around cancer which it should be but not to this extreme.Reiser focuses everything on the cancer and as a result there's a lot of stuff that gets left behind namely the supporting characters. In approaching Adam they take on the guy full force helped by a great performance from GordonLevitt. I was a huge fan of GordonLevitt in the mid2000s when he had this incredible streak of solid performances but then he kind of faded for me and I was worried that I wasn't going to be impressed by him again. Thankfully I found this to be a return to form for him taking on a character who shuts himself off and meets people's desire to help with aggression but quickly making him likable and easy to root for. As I said earlier I wish we had met Adam earlier so I could have had more of a stake in him but Levitt makes up for it with a very sympathetic performance that taps into the root of what it's like to have something like this take you over so young.It's when we get to the rest of the characters that I think Reiser slips up. For the most part all of the supporting characters are so thin that it's hard to really appreciate any of them as real people. Reiser works so hard on making the cancer aspect feel more genuine and unique that he doesn't spend enough time with the characters to make them feel as such. They all just feel like these movie types we've already seen instead of real people the most offensive of which being Adam's therapist played by Anna Kendrick. Buying Kendrick as a therapist is hard enough to get over but the way that they treat this relationship is honestly one of the most offensive and ridiculous things I've seen all year. From the second they meet it's such a Hollywood display of incorrect cutesiness in a film that for the most part was dealing with things in a pretty realistic way that it was honestly jawdropping to this absurd relationship develop. Kendrick and Levitt try their best to make up for it they do have a very sweet chemistry between them but for me there was no getting around how absolutely ridiculous this whole relationship was. It dragged the film down a lot for me.For a while the title of the film was going to be Living With Cancer and I feel like that would have been a more accurate name for it. Reiser should be admired for his approach to dealing with cancer especially at such a young age but I wish he had spent a lot more time on the actual living side of things. There are a lot of genuine emotions going on here and I appreciate Reiser and director Jonathan Levine not going the easy route with melodrama and emotional manipulation that you find in most stories dealing with this topic but the film has quite a few contrivances that betray the characters in order to benefit story progression and the therapist relationship is something that left a bad taste in my mouth all the way through. There's still a lot to be admired though so at the end I've come down pretty much in the middle when it comes to the overall product.".

	onyx:emotionText "When it comes to highemotion situations in real life few are more extreme than a diagnosis of cancer. Add in the fact that when Joseph GordonLevitt's Adam Lerner is only 27 years old when he gets the news and you already have a story primed for melodrama and loaded with tears and cheers. Firsttime writer Will Reiser uses his own experience with cancer at a young age to play down the dramatic aspects of illness and instead showcase the lighter side of things showing that even when you have cancer you still want to get laid and stoned with your best friend. It's not a strict comedy by any means there are quite a few moments that got me a little choked up but Reiser clearly set out with a goal to show things a little lighter than cancer is usually treated in the film. For the most part this works and although at times I felt it was a little too light I enjoyed Reiser's more authentic portrayal of a diagnosis like this.The film sets out to be an unconventional cancer movie and it achieves at that but it's still so much a cancer movie that there isn't any room for anything else. Yes getting a severe diagnosis like this still leaves room in your life for comedic moments but it also doesn't control every second of your life. It felt like every frame of this movie was about cancer and there wasn't any room for just...life. When Adam's best friend is a jerk it's about cancer when his mom is too worried it's about cancer when his girlfriend does something awful it's about cancer. Adam learns his diagnosis early on in the film and we're not given enough time to understand the character before this so the whole thing ends up revolving around the cancer. The whole thing would have benefited so much by getting us to have a stake in him before he gets the news but instead Reiser builds the entire movie around cancer which it should be but not to this extreme.Reiser focuses everything on the cancer and as a result there's a lot of stuff that gets left behind namely the supporting characters. In approaching Adam they take on the guy full force helped by a great performance from GordonLevitt. I was a huge fan of GordonLevitt in the mid2000s when he had this incredible streak of solid performances but then he kind of faded for me and I was worried that I wasn't going to be impressed by him again. Thankfully I found this to be a return to form for him taking on a character who shuts himself off and meets people's desire to help with aggression but quickly making him likable and easy to root for. As I said earlier I wish we had met Adam earlier so I could have had more of a stake in him but Levitt makes up for it with a very sympathetic performance that taps into the root of what it's like to have something like this take you over so young.It's when we get to the rest of the characters that I think Reiser slips up. For the most part all of the supporting characters are so thin that it's hard to really appreciate any of them as real people. Reiser works so hard on making the cancer aspect feel more genuine and unique that he doesn't spend enough time with the characters to make them feel as such.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good film. It is a very good film. I was tempted to give it a 10.0. It will make you laugh and make you cry. It will make you assess yourself and life. It raises lots of questions without trying to force too many answers. Sometimes life throws you a curve ball. You can miss it duck it hit it back or get hit and take a dive. The best bet is to stay in the batters box for the next pitch. You might strike outor you might get a walk. This film has nothing to do with baseball. I just like baseball metaphors for life.Goodtime buddies Adam GordonLevitt and Kyle Rogan are bouncing along in life. Adam looking for love and Kyle looking just to get laid. Opposites attract even with guys. Then the seemingly good one Adam gets diagnosed with cancer. Bad things happen to good people after all. But in his own bizarre way Kyle sticks by his buddy in thick hair and thin. Adam's new girlfriend Bryce DallasHoward bales on him. Adam's Mom Huston reacts like a real loving mom would. Adam's Dad is so far down the road with Alzheimers he has no clue. It is just as well. There are so many messages here it is hard to sort them all out. The fact is when a sudden death of a young person or cancer strikes there is no solid playbook to follow. No one really knows what they will do even when it happens. Even good people can fail the test. Just stand in the receiving line at any funeral of a young person. It's awkward and messy. People fumble when handed the ball sorry another sports metaphor. Just being there and taking the pain along side your friend or loved one is all that you are expected to dobut do it.The 24 year old newbie therapist Katherine assigned to help Adam cope is trying so hard. She knows what she has been taught and tries all the clich tricks but she realizes she must learn from her patient what she needs to know. In a sense Katherine represents all of us. We all need to care and love but also need to listen and learn from those who meet with challenge or tragedy. Often doctors friends and family end up getting aid and comfort from the victim. Adam supplies the stability to everyone even though it is he who has the cancer. TMG refuses to tell you more. This movie needs to unwind and reveal itself to you. I assure you you will learn laugh cry and enjoy the experience. Take someone you care about and hug them when it is over. Let them know you are with them in good times and in bad for richer for poorer and in sickness and in health. You don't need to be married to give that support to another human being.My cohost Joy Lynn says As I noted on my Facebook page if you plan to see 5050 take a few tissues. If you are a mom of a 26 year old son take the entire Kleenex box. The overall theme in this film is very similar to The Way! You cannot and perhaps more importantly should not live life alone. You need a community of people to help carry your burdens. In this case a dog almost a person! a therapist a parent and a best friend fill the bill. The saddest part of this movie for me was that fact that Adam began his struggle very much alone. The writer did an excellent job portraying the loneliness theme in this film by not having Adam drive no true girlfriend only one parent available emotionally a retired greyhound dog and only one friend Kyle who was yet to prove his worth. No one can feel your painbut each can help you carry the burden little by little. They may fumble trying but each can offer something if they are willing to try. Thankfully the story added some humor  not too much so to be disrespectful but just enough to take the edge off. This is a very real movie  my favorite kind!! A few loopholes here and there made for a slow start but once the chemo started the movie began a new path.".

He has an obscene but totally loyal buddy played by Seth Rogan always drunk hitting on girls and swearing when not smoking pot and trying to convince GordonLevitt to go to bars with him a sham of a girlfriend played by Bryce Dallas Howard stuck with a character so selfabsorbed with a personality illequipped for giving care and affection to someone in need of both that she has no chance of escaping the bitch we love to hate it does provide a moment of great humor when GordonLevitt tells her to get of his porch soon joining Rogan in destroying her painting that once hung above the television a psychiatrist working on her doctorate and a bit inexperienced Anna Kendrick becoming quite a character actress if she could just avoid the Pitch Perfect films I think the sky's the limit who is becoming a possible new love interest an overprotective mother Angelica Huston just wonderful who just wants her son to return her phone calls and make him dinner if he'll let her he's embarrassed by a father now lost to senility and a couple of fellow cancer patients Matt Frewer and Philip Baker Hall who understand his situation all too well.

This is indeed uplifting but not in the usual LifetimeHallmark channel way the dialogue is frank and profane emotional outbursts or scenes where GordonLewitt is sick and too tired to stand aren't overdramatized with a heavy score and there's plenty of adult comedy that can offset the grim diagnosis that heavily looms throughout. Rogan is playing another version of himself using the cancer to pick up girls boozing and oftentimes drunk blunt and viewed as obnoxious and not without plenty of dirty jokes and salty language this character doesn't stray from Rogan's comfort zone. Yet he's there for his friend all the way. GordonLevitt proves here significantly that he's among the best actors of his generation. Scary is I think he still can get even better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adam a 27yearold public radio editor discovers one day that the aches and pains that have been plaguing him signal a frightening reality He has cancer with a 5050 shot of beating the odds. As he undergoes chemotherapy Adam begins to confront his relationships and friendships questioning whether they're satisfying and meaningful  and if not what he needs to do about them. For example is his girlfriend the right girl for him? Can his best friend deal with his illness? Should he trust his new therapist? And this goes on.5050 faces so many hurdles on its way to success. There are so many clichs that a movie about terminal illness has to skirt How to handle the reveal without being overdramatic? Should there be a transformation  and if so how to make it believable? Far from being sappy and mawkish the movie is unafraid to ask difficult questions Does illness allow you to put yourself first all the time? How much can you ask of others when you're sick? And it's bold enough to mine the situation for hilarity without minimizing it or going for the easy jokes. That said it's not perfect by any means Adam's girlfriend turns needlessly villainous and a storyline about Adam's father could have used more depth but instead peters out. But ultimately it takes confidence to create a movie like this one we can root for easily and without pity. When you see 5050 be prepared to laugh and think.".

	onyx:emotionText "Adam a 27yearold public radio editor discovers one day that the aches and pains that have been plaguing him signal a frightening reality He has cancer with a 5050 shot of beating the odds. As he undergoes chemotherapy Adam begins to confront his relationships and friendships questioning whether they're satisfying and meaningful  and if not what he needs to do about them. For example is his girlfriend the right girl for him? Can his best friend deal with his illness? Should he trust his new therapist? And this goes on.5050 faces so many hurdles on its way to success. There are so many clichs that a movie about terminal illness has to skirt How to handle the reveal without being overdramatic? Should there be a transformation  and if so how to make it believable? Far from being sappy and mawkish the movie is unafraid to ask difficult questions Does illness allow you to put yourself first all the time? How much can you ask of others when you're sick? And it's bold enough to mine the situation for hilarity without minimizing it or going for the easy jokes. That said it's not perfect by any means Adam's girlfriend turns needlessly villainous and a storyline about Adam's father could have used more depth but instead peters out. But ultimately it takes confidence to create a movie like this one we can root for easily and without pity. When you see 5050 be prepared to laugh and think.";

	schema:reviewBody "Despite his recent slide into mediocrity John Carpenter is responsible for what could be termed some of the biggest cult movies of the 1980's. Following his resounding success with Halloween he went on to direct a number of quirky yet excellent movies that began to tail of toward the end of the 80's with the release of such dross as Prince of Darkness. Carpenters movies are probably some of the most under appreciated pictures of recent cinema history on a commercial level and none more so than perhaps one of his finest the delightfully absurd action movie Big Trouble in Little China. The plot is as daft as they come. Loud mouthed truck driver Jack Burton played by Carpenter's long time collaborator Kurt Russell arrives in San Francisco's Chinatown where he agrees to help out old friend Wang played by Denis Dun by driving him to the airport to pick up his green eyed fianc. Things quickly go south however when a band of street punks kidnap the girl and the motley duo set off in pursuit. The pair soon find themselves caught in the middle of gang war that takes on a decidedly mythical bent and are forced to flee while Jack's truck is stolen. All this occurs within the first fifteen to twenty minutes. If there's one thing you can say about Big Trouble it's that it's action packed. The plot such as it is moves at an incredible pace and the film rarely slows to take breath as it rolls from one action set piece to the next. In such movies normally the dialogue and subsequently the acting suffer from a lack of any real attention. Not so here. Carpenter balances everything so perfectly that it's a wonder his career took such a slide. Although the actual story may be incredibly absurd and at times suffers from some rather obvious gaps of logic the dialogue never fails to sparkle. Russell gives his very best wise ass shtick as Burton the confused have a go hero who's so out of his depth he should really be fish bait while Dun excels with a character who is consistently more heroic and capable than the lead. Another wonderful turn comes from an appearance by a young Kim Cattrall of Sex and the City fame as Gracie Law a downmarket lawyer with an ability to talk at incredible speed. Some of the scenes between these three are pure comic genius as Dun and Cattrall rattle out plot information at a rapid staccato pace while an increasingly bewildered Russell tries desperately to keep up. Despite such positive remarks Big Trouble was perhaps one of Carpenter's biggest commercial flops. While many of the movie's fans find this difficult to understand I do not. The reason for its failure is really incredibly simple. In terms of its style and the underlying comedy behind the piece Carpenter's loving part tribute part send up of all things Kung Fu was way ahead of the curve in every important respect. Take the relationship between our 'hero' Jack and his 'sidekick' Wang. The true dynamic of this relationship is a wonderfully post modern slant on the clich buddy dynamic that existed in the 80's and it was done long before post modernist humour became truly fashionable in films the most obvious example of post modern piece of cinema being Scream. Despite receiving star billing Russell's Jack is actually a sidekick to Wang. While Wang has the knowledge the skill and the courage to make him a true classic hero figure Jack lags behind being brash ignorant and of little actual use in a fight. Similarly the action although remarkably quaint by today's standards in both its look and execution is a surprisingly accurate foreshadow of the current Hollywood move toward the more graceful balletic chaos exhibited by movies like The Matrix and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Ultimately Big Trouble in Little China is a movie that survived thanks to the home video market and for that we can only be grateful. While its looks may have aged its sense of humour and style is as fresh today as the day it first rolled out in cinemas. In short it's pure escapist magic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Big Trouble in Little China 1986 is one of the best movies ever! A true classic action film from the 80'! After 20.years watching again this movie it is still a classic scifi action film. Kurt Russell rocks also there is theme music from Escape From New York 1981 my favorite classic film that Kurt Russell and John Carpenter worked on it together.Clever one liners that will keep you rolling. This movie has it all high kicks low kicks laughs ghouls demons girls and much more. Oh and did I mention Chinese black Magic? This movie will definitely engulf your living room in green flame and keep you asking for more. Big Trouble in Little China is amazing. Action adventure and comedy are all here and the result is one of the best cult classic films of all time. I must have seen this movie 50 times and it never gets old. Jack Burton Kurt Russell is the character that everyone would like to be just for a day maybe more. Driving around in The Pork Chop Express beating up the bad guys scoring with the ladies.....it's all in the reflexes for OI' Jack Burton! This is one of the most entertaining movies of the 80's possibly ever!I grew up watching this film seen now after 20.years of watching this film later It is still my favorite awesome action film! Mainly because of Kurt Russell the man can kick ass! He has humor charm and can do a good things. He was so funny and hilarious in this film. Gosh the film is wonderful and I just love it so much. Is actually my fourth best John CarpenterKurt Russell film and I just love those four movies so much! I Love Big Trouble in Little China to death and It was hard to get this film on Bluray. It is one of John Carpenter's awesome adventures. Kurt Russell plays the egotistical Jack Burton extremely well delivering the cheesy macho lines in the way they were intended. Beautifully filmed the fight scene in the alley this has been one of my favorites from Carpenter for a long time with Escape from New York Escape from L.A.  The Thing Prince of Darkness The Fog and Vampires. Special effects are great wonderful and outstanding! It is favorite Kurt Russell's performance underrated gem of a movie and one of the most quotable too. I love how this all started because Wang lost a drinking game to Jack. To this day I haven't seen anything like it.That's movie magic right there. Jack Burton should be in the top 10 movie characters ever!. San Francisco CAJack Burton is possibly the greatest hero to ever walk the Earth at least in his own mind!!! The chemistry between Jack and Wang is so believable you want to see more adventure between the duo. This movie has a lot of fun it is enjoyable flick it has imagination great acting from all the actors they all lightning us up with great performances. The action and adventures are super amazing it is like you want to be in this movie! It has super fun characters in here and a cool awesome monster!Big Trouble in Little China is 80's classic! I love everything that it is in this film. I love the score especially in the underworld. The battle in the alley when the 3 storms turn up is awesome. Don't see many films that transcend this many genres as well. I heard they are also planning to remake this film Big Trouble in Little China 2016 with Dwayne The Rock Johnson in it! Why? Only to get more money? Why remaking or rebooting this film? when we already have a classic action film here! This film does not need any reboot or remake leave it alone the way it is! Gosh Big Trouble in Little China is a 1986 American action comedy film directed by John Carpenter. It stars Kurt Russell Kim Cattrall Dennis Dun and James Hong.The basic plot about this film is about Jack Burton Kurt Russell a simple man who doesn't believe in ghosts or magic until he's swept into a mindboggling adventure deep within Chinatown's mysterious underworld. Burton's pal Wang Chi Dennis Dun is trying to rescue his kidnapped fiance. Egg Shen Victor Wong an enigmatic tourbus driver seems to know a lot about ancient Chinese magic for a simple tourbus driver. They do battle with an outlandish array of human and inhuman adversaries under the command of Lo Pan James Hong a 2000yearold evil magician who has the power to transform himself from a wheelchairbound old man into a sevenfoottall mystical menace. It does involves black magic and mystical forces of darkness.".

Richter with the screenplay from Gary Goldman  David Z. Weinstein. Dean Cundey photographs and Alan Howarth doubles up with Carpenter for the musical score.Truck driver Jack Burton Russell agrees to take his friend Wang Chi Dun to pick up his fiance at the airport. Little does he know that he is about to get involved in a supernatural battle between good and evil beneath San Francisco's Chinatown district.A box office failure on its release and known to be the moment when John Carpenter gave up on Hollywood Big Trouble in Little China has gathered cult momentum over the years and shows up rather well these days. Blending Chinese mysticism with chopschlocky adventure Carpenter's movie is at once daft but also a ball of energetic fun propelled by a handsome but inept action hero. Carpenter had always wanted to tackle a martial arts movie and here he gets to do it whilst laying on the comedy and playing with effects as his movie mostly comes alive in a magical underworld of monsters magicians and sexy green eyed women.It's evident now that the film was ahead of its time not from a technical viewpoint but from the point it tried to Americanise chopsocky. This is some time before Chinese style wirework and mythology became common to Hollywood one has to believe that Tarantino was nodding approvingly around about then. It's also worth noting that although this American movie has an American beefcake as its main protagonist it's the Asian Americans who actually are the heroes of the piece with Dun's sidekick the stand out hero as Russell's Burton bumbles his way from one sequence to the next. It was a bold move by Carpenter to structure the narrative that way one that annoyed the executives at Fox and kept the paying public bemused. It's easy to see why the film failed contrast it with the similarly themed Eddie Murphy movie The Golden Child from the same year which was a box office success. There the public got what they wanted or what they were used too the standard American hero fluff where Murphy saves the day and gets the girl. Carpenter dared to be different and had fun along the way as did his cast. It may have taken a decade of VHS and DVD releases to prove he was right but right he was Big Trouble in Little China is a damn fine movie. Russell plays it meat head style with swagger in tow and tongue stuck in cheek. Nicely toned physique for the girls to enjoy and making vest wearing cool two years before Willis did in Die Hard. Cattrall is wonderfully alluring red lips and green eyes shimmering bright in a world of color and boys look out for her wet scene it's wolf whistle time! Dun is likable and athletic while Hong as Lo Pan gives the actionadventure genre a truly memorable villain. The film is briskly paced and not found wanting in the set piece department either. Not all the effects are high grade but in a film with such zestful comic book traditions at heart it hardly matters a jot. With a great DVD package doing it justice Carpenter's movie is now at long last getting the appreciative audience it deserves. Amen to that. 810".

I and many others like me repeatedly viewed this film throughout childhood and still love it just as much now as then. Nowadays a new viewer who is past puberty will regard it with a more skeptical eye comparing it to things it shouldn't be compared to. Some newcomers might get it right away but I don't think they get the same thrill out of it as they might have as a child in the eighties. That's why this film needs to be shared with children especially boys who hopefully won't be too jaded by flashy nineties schlock to be impressed which I think is exactly the problem for adults who are new to the movie. Perhaps it can't be taught the reverence I mean but the movie isn't any less fun and awesome for new viewers just less magical. I would rate it with stars or something but that's like trying to grade your own religion. I love you Mr. Burton.".

Russell plays Jack Burton a wise cracking long distance truck triver and all American hero passing through Chinatown on some business. After a card game with old friend Wang Chi Dennis Dun Wang now penniless thanks to Burtons good fortune pursuades Jack to drive him to the airport to pick up his childhood sweetheart a girl Wang has not seen since they were children. Its here the story begins as Mao Yin Wangs girlfriend is captured by a mysterious gang. The two form a pact to rescue the girl from the clutches of the evil Lo Pan former crimelord of Chinatown a myth who has apparently lived to the age of almost 200 with a little help from some black magic.Thats it Im saying no more cos I dont want to spoil it. Youve probably seen the movie anyway.Its hard to pick a favourite John Carpenter film very hard but this one has it all. Its a great action movie a great comedy an original story great lines and even a love story a perfect blend of what big screen entertainment should be. Its strange though that the ending was left so open begging for a sequel that was never made.".

Big trouble in Little China is a fun movie that you can sit back on a lonely night and just enjoy. The plot is pretty basic and that is why it is easy to follow. Yet the acting of Kurt Russell alone makes the movie. Im not saying this just because i am a BIG KR fan but he just does a wonderful job in this movie as a Truck drive who has no clue on whats going on but just goes with the flow! The witty lines of Kurt Russell in this movie are some of the funniest lines i have ever heard come from an actors mouth.. I mean the whole part of Lopan and Jack in the wheelchair is one of the funniest peices of material i have ever seen on the big screen... Well gtg and just remember if some wild 8ft tall monster grabs the back of your favorite head and slams it aganist the bar room wall and ask if you paid your dues!!??! well just tell him what ole jack always says..

Its blend of Chinese black magic with American style and humour that only Kurt Russel and Dennis Dun could pull off makes it an unforgettable adventure comedy.The big problem with Big Trouble in Little China is that no one went to see it in theaters. Poor box office reciepts makes for a small fan base and its sad how few people have seen this film. Though not soaring art with grand ideals Illalways remember BTLC as one of the best films of my lifetime.".

The gag in this movie is that the hero Jack Burton an outofhisdepth truck driver is nothing of the sort. He's a bumbling useless but wisecracking idiot and played to perfection by Kurt Russell. The plot is pretty standard fare. Truck driver Jack arrives in San Francisco's Chinatown and becomes embroiled in a plot in which LoPan a 2000 year old cursed Chinese sorceror needs to marry a girl with green eyes to become human again. LoPan abducts the suitablyeyed fiance of Jack's best friend Wang and the duo set off with friends in tow to defeat the dastardly sorceror and rescue Wang's girl and Jack's truck The script moves at 100mph bolstered by some of the best and funniest dialogue of all time. The supporting cast including a young Kim Cattrall help to flesh out the story. One of those films that can be watched over and over again the bizarre sight of a man who can selfinflate himself when under attack is worth a watch by itself. Have you paid your dues Jack? Yes sir the check is in the mail!".

Yet in the midst of this friendly chaos lies a demon who needs a girl to make himself whole again. And Jack's friends girl friend is that girl. This takes Jack in all sorts of directions from a street rumble which shows a rather unique martial arts display to a sorcerer who has hired guns called the three storms. Now knee deep in dark magic and other types of folk lore Jack must help rescue this girl from an ultimate sacrifice. But in the back ground lies Egg Shen Victor Wong who is a long time rival of this demon and his help causes a turn around to the groups luck. Using all sorts of magic and sorcery. This film held every aspect of action magic tales of the old and a reluctant truck driver who just says What the hell to make this movie very watchable. The only thing wrong with it is Gracie Law Kim Cattral. Her persona does not fit this role too mushy in some ways and not all bad girl type. I would say a woman who could have filled her shoes would be Debra Winger. She has a way with her attitude and no nonsense hand of getting things done. A great movie from a great director John Carpenter. It would be really nice to have a second instalment to make this show even more of a classic.".

But Jack just wants his truck back.A box office disaster 'Big Trouble in Little China' has rightfully gained a cult following as Eastern cinema grew more popular in the West during the nineties. This is the fourth occasion that saw John Carpenter collaborate with Kurt Russell and it is very much a different style to their earlier work and everything else Carpenter has done for that matter. Carpenter was ahead of his time here giving Western audiences a type of film that they weren't interested in until the following decade. Big Trouble could easily have been the standard of subsequent trashy US martial arts films but it is turned into an all out comedy with the roles of hero and sidekick Wang and Burton reversed so Burton is the lead and therefore you see the entire film through his eyes hence you don't know what is going on during a lot of the early scenes.It looks and feels like a lot went into the production design and style of the film. Carpenter consistently respects his Eastern influences keeps the film B grade spirit while fusing it with his own style and satirising it with a unique campness. Be it the musical score's fusion of Eastern music with Carpenter's trademark synth the arcade game style magic battle between Lo Pan and Egg Shen or the villain being defeated not in a grand duel but with a simple bowie knife to the forehead this film is perfection in the kung fu comedy genre.For Western standards the martial arts on display here is pretty good. But for any Hong Kong action fans it will seem pretty weak. But for those that 'get' the film it is obvious the real entertainment doesn't come from the action but from the writing and the overall sense of fun unlike a lot of kung fu films there is never a dull moment between the action. The most memorable aspect are the exchanges between Russell and Dun or Russell and anyone else in the film for that matter. Everything he says is instantly quotable and everything he does is usually hilarious. This is largely due to Russell's willingness to do anything be it wear lipstick act like an idiot or be knocked unconscious before the main battle actual starts.Russell stands out and the film wouldn't be half as good without him. But this isn't to discredit the rest of the cast who consistently Howard Hawks it as Carpenter said. Dennis Dun in what is really the hero role says his fortune cookie wisdom with his tongue firmly in cheek and delivers his lines with as much enthusiasm as Russell Victor Wong and James Hong are both suitably OTT playing the wise old magician and evil villain respectively and both look like they are enjoying themselves. Chinese superstar Carter Wong also puts in 110. Kim Cattrall has a surprisingly large amount of dialogue but delivers it all with enthusiasm even if a lot of her screen time is spent in the shadow of Russell's one liners. Donald Li and Kate Burton have smaller roles but are good fun for the time they have.All things said this film isn't for all audiences and took its time finding the right one like earlier RussellCarpenter films did and Escape from L.A has yet to do. But if you are one of the people who like comedy with your kung fu read fans of the brilliant Stephen Chow you should watch this and agree it achieves perfection in what it sets out to do. Sure it isn't a work of art but Big Trouble in Little China is a fun film without a single dull second that never gets worse with repeated viewings and will always forever entertain me more than any other film. Except The Thing but that's a different story.1210".

So often I find myself just not LIKING the protagonist in modern romantic comedies  which is fatal to their enjoyment.Joan Blondell's films of the 1930s whether comedies or the six she did with Jimmy Cagney with whom she was starring on Broadway when both were discovered by Hollywood are a great and rather undiscovered treasure for modern audiences. You just can't go wrong with Blondell in this or such films as The Traveling Saleslady in the Gold Diggers films or anything else I've happened to see from the 1930s.Do watch it  even though it requires close attention because the dialogue flies as fast as His Girl Friday.

Their boss has one last assignment for them and after being offered a huge amount this will be their last caper serving the big mob boss who doesn't want to be served. Ginger has a beau Carter played by Ross Alexander. Sadly Alexander offed himself a couple years after this film was released. The Hays film code had just started being strictly enforced and this clearly was not good news for Alexander as his lifestyle could not be kept quiet and this clashed with the studio bigshots. Silly vaudeville man Hugh Herbert is the goofy attorney and is clearly here for the laughs. Some fun cameos or almost cameos... a young Lionel Stander Max.. from Hart to Hart has several spoken lines. Walter Brennan is a guest at the wedding and according to IMDb Mayo Methot's scene was deleted. Also several songs by actorsinger Phil Regan... he had quite the adventures after his acting days if you look him up on wikipedia. This one is fun and scurries right along. Story is pretty straight forward and has some clever lines. I recommend this one. Pretty surprised at the low rating... only a 6.. but of course only 140 votes so far. Hopefully TCM will show this one more often.".

While he was a popular supporting character actor in the 1930s he was a strictly onenot actor and his shtick was VERY heavyhanded and annoying. And combining this AND horrible rearprojected chase scenes the film is darn hard to watch at times. Watchable but not nearly as good as it could have been.".

The idea is very clever and enjoyable...to a point. Unfortunately the movie has as much to dislike about it. The worst was Hugh Herbert. While he was a popular supporting character actor in the 1930s he was a strictly onenot actor and his shtick was VERY heavyhanded and annoying. And combining this AND horrible rearprojected chase scenes the film is darn hard to watch at times. Watchable but not nearly as good as it could have been.";

	schema:reviewBody "...and that's just in this review!!! Seriously though this movie is warped. There wasn't a minute where I wasn't completed floored at something or other.I watched this after watching Swordman II. I am a huge Brigitte Lin fan and this movie was made to capitalize on the success of her character the freaky Master Asia the Invincible. That is the most pompous name any character has endured. Catchy though ain't it? Master Asia as we learned from Swordman II is a man that has become a woman sort of as a side effect from studying a sacred martial arts scroll. ProAsia can decimate whole armies by making simple hand gestures. ConSerious genderbending. You're never really sure what Asia is. He looks and sounds like a woman but acts like both depending on the situation. For example in Swordman II he developed an unfortunate crush on Jet Li's character. In this film we are treated to a confusing sex scene. I must elaborate on this one because it deserves the attention. Bear with me.Snow a former lover of Asia's has decided to carry on the tradition by dressing up as Asia and killing people. One night shehe decides to sleep with a concubine that we would assume is a woman. So that's two womensomething is missing. This isn't the sort of thing shown in this type of movie so you automatically wonder what's up. This movie must have some ulterior motive in showing two women making love. Anyway they start by indulging in some opium to heighten the mood I suppose and all of a sudden we are whooshed for lack of a better word into a flashback. Now we have Snow and some person kissing. There is no warning that there's been a time shiftit just happens. The other person is Asia himself of course played by Brigitte Lin. So if you're keeping score that a sex scene with three women. One is a woman pretending to be a man one is a man pretending to be a woman and one is a man that is becoming a woman. Confused? Goodyou'll be in that bewildered state for the rest of the movie.This movie defines the phrase over the top. You know you're in for a wild ride when people start using cannons as handheld weapons. The guy just picks it up and fires it off just like a regular cannon only he's holding it like a battering ram. That would knock the bewhickers out of any normal person you know. Another great sequence is the ninja that hides by holding a fake moon up in front of the real one and hiding behind it. Upon his being discovered a pigeon flies out of his mouth. Brigitte Lin enters one scene riding a swordfish sings a song while disguised as a lethal gambling prostitute in a Japanese camp and later appears as a samurai dressed in red. Sewing needles are common weaponry to those endowed with supernatural wonderfulness and people are used as bloody marionettes. Devil May Cry anyone? This movie is everywhere all the time. I was constantly floored by the sheer insanity of it. Add a large volume of blood and the needle on the weirdo meter goes wild.In short I enjoyed this movie simply because of its marvelous ability to entertain. You may not be awed by the scenery or moved by the plot but you should be entertained.".

The European version is about 10 minutes shorter than the Asian one and probably one scene was cut for blasphemy when Asia humiliates the Spanish priest forcing him to worship her instead of their catholic god.

If you watch the trailer you'll see that Jet Li is in it... but when you watch the film you realise he has been left on the cutting room floor...!

But someone else already has gotten the same idea and now King is caught up in a game of who has the millionaire? King's Ransom takes a harmless premise and turns it into a torturous experience. It is one of the worst attempts at comedy and it may be the first comedy ever that has failed to make the audience laugh at least once. It was like they weren't even trying to entertain the audience. I have to ask what was the point? There was some potential in the premise and the cast wasn't terrible. However the script fails the film at every turn and it was probably written by a five year old. It's just too bad this film wasn't meant for kids since they would have gotten more entertainment out of it. I would also be more forgiving if this was a kid's film.The semi decent cast is wasted in this mess and nobody gives a good performance. Anthony Anderson gives a really bad performance as Malcolm King. He overacts like crazy and just ends up being really annoying. Regina Hall over did the airhead role and it got tired fast. Sadly she probably gave the best performance out of everyone. Jay Mohr tried way too hard to be funny and it didn't work. Donald Faison and Kellita Smith should be ashamed for agreeing to appear in this piece of crap.I believe the blame shouldn't only go to the screenwriter but to the director as well. Jeff Byrd does a really poor job at directing and he seems to be trying too hard. He sets up all these situations of different people trying to kidnap Malcolm on the same night. There was like four different attempts and none of them were funny. Also all the subplots are weak and none of them are good enough to save the movie. I will cut Jeff some slack since this is his first real film. However this isn't the way you should start off. Also he has to work with a very weak script and an obnoxious lead. I really wish I was joking here but there is not one funny moment. It's really just 95 minutes of pure boredom and there is no point in wasting your time to watch this movie. In the end this light comedy may end up being the worst movie of 2005. Rating 110".

	schema:reviewBody "his character Malcom King is a slimeball in this. The one mistake with the movie is none of the characters are likable. His wife is a golddigger. His employees can't stand him and Corey has prior arrests so you can't root for him either. King is getting a divorce so in order to try to keep his wife from getting half he plots his own kidnapping. The same night some disgruntled employees and a loser Corey are planning to kidnap him too. King has gotten his buffoon of a girlfriend to get her brother to do the kidnapping.

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard some pretty horrible things about this movie but i love Anthony Anderson so i decided to give it a shot. Kings Rasom is a comedy about a rich man named Malcom King Anthony Anderson who decides to get a divorce to avoid giving his wife a divorce settlement. I never knew how being kidnapped would help achieve this but were just led to believe that somehow this will work. He enlists his girlfriends Regina Hall aid to help him who has the IQ of a raising and calls her creepy convict of a brother to help her played by the brilliant Charlie Murphy.Unfortunately 2 more sets of people get the same idea of kidnapping him at the same time what are the odds on that? You have the disgruntled employee who was passed up for a vice president position and you have a lovable looser who is stepped on by Malcolm king.Kings Ransom does have some funny moments and interesting turns. But allot of things fall flat. Were supposed to believe that a man who built a company would make his bimbo girlfriend vice president? So many coincidences? The feds don't get involved when a millionaire gets kidnapped? My experience with the film was bipolar. At the begging i was hating it then i started liking it hated it loved it and in the end disappointed. Its as if the script self destructed being pulled in so many directions at once it just gave out. The ending was tagged on character disappeared had no purpose or just got lost in the shuffle.Quite frankly if this was rewritten I think it actually could have been up there with kidnapping classics like Ruthless People but instead its just one more movie for the bargain bin.".

More than half the movie is weak so the likelihood of a rewatch is extremely slim.

I liked his goofy Louis persona in Kangaroo Jack his idiotic antics in Malibu's Most Wanted stood out from the entire film and most recently in Scream 4 he was a great addition to the cast. He's always stuck in movies that fail to achieve anything they are trying to achieve. He is a funny and energetic actor with instant recognition even with his respective weightloss. I will say even in this poor comedy he still manages to impress.The film centers around an arrogant self indulgent rich man named Malcolm King Anderson. Upset his wife Renee Smith is divorcing him and is expected to get half his earnings he fakes his own kidnapping but a crazy fastfood employee Mohr and a mad employee Parker also want to kidnap him to teach him a lesson.The first forty five minutes of the film are nothing but overacted events that showcase nothing but the film's hyper activity and craziness. I liked both Anderson and Mohr's characters but their antics aren't as funny that I would even come close to recommend this at all.The writer of King's Ransom was one of the many writers for one of my favorite television shows Kenan  Kel. It seems the jokes could've worked in a twenty minute episode of a Nickelodeon they absolutely do not work for a ninety seven minute movie that is nothing but one poorly done slap sticky joke after another barely saved by two likable actors.Starring Anthony Anderson Jay Mohr Donald Faison Kellita Smith Nicole Ari Parker Charlie Murphy Regina Hall and Roger Cross.

Malcome's friend Peaches has her convict brother Herb pick up Malcome but he picks up the wrong guy some dude named Andre. Malcome is then kidnapped for real by a low life bum named Corey who lives in his grandma's basement where Malcome teaches him the ropes of kidnapping thinking Corey is Herb. Meanwhile his wife is on the run looking for him as so is Malcome's large secretary who is raving on with lazy policemen on the trails of two other groups of people who want Malcome dead. But when Malcome's wife is kidnapped as well by Corey who suddenly goes crazy Malcome's life is all up for grabs. King's Ransome now is a movie that had a really good plot but it was wasted. The characters are all sleazy especially Grandma and the story keeps getting twisted around with character plots. The writing is pretty choppy and lame in some areas but sometimes it's really funny like when Malcome describes how big a mans balls are to really be a true man hilarious. The ending though is where it all goes down hill where we have freeze frames of all the characters and captions going across the screen telling about what happened to them. The last caption with Malcome and his wife throws the story out the door which means I just sat through a boring movie that never made a difference. But that doesn't mean the movies all bad. Charles Murphey Eddie Murphey's bro is hilarious as Herb and the guy who played Anre is good. Peaches is a little annoying and Anthony Anderson is really wasted as Malcome. Jay as Corey though gives an alright performance. This movie though succeeds in bringing back and forth good ideas. The ending fight scene is alright till the police arrive where Mrs. King throws in some bad dialog so fast we loose interest in the timing. Kings Ransome gets a 5 out of 10 good but made totally wrong. See it only for Charlie. Try to enjoy it if you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well to start off I have to say that Biker Boyz isn't a good movie. However it is better than the other recent bike movie Torque if only because it tries to do something with itself.  But it fails none the less perhaps for being too ambitious.  The bike crowd watches the movie hoping to see realism and some good racing. Instead they get straightshot drag style races which in real life involve little to no actual talent on a machine. Also they'll be racing 160 mph one minute and dead stopped the next.  It takes some time to come down from speeds like that.  The movie also frequently ignores the force of wind that would be present at high speeds with the racers hardly tucked in at all.  The final race much like many in Torque takes place on a dirt road.  Apparently they aren't aware that these high end bikes are often called street fighters.Despite all that there's actually an effort to tell a story.  It's an admirable effort but many of the parts just slow the movie down.  It's often a painfully slow movie. Odd since it's about a bunch of guys that race at speeds in excess of 100 mph.  The story is a coming of age one for both Kid and Smoke.  They are both forced to confront issues and in the end reconcile them.  The biker clubs are set up to mirror I think a sort of community and therefore Kid's efforts to rise in the clubs are supposed to represent his finding his place in society.  The pieces are there they were just poorly assembled. Folks most likely were expecting a quick guilty pleasure like the Fast and Furious movies and instead got a slow movie with mediocre action sequences.The acting isn't nearly as bad as most are saying. It's not Fishburne's finest moment but it's not like it stained his reputation or ability just look at his fine work in Mystic River.  The writers made an effort to have threedimensional characters.  For example After Dog's dirty racing forces Kid to drop his bike at the track he lends him his own bike to take on Smoke. Granted it's for his own reasons but it's not like he's the evil villain parody going muahhaha off in the corner.  I have to agree with another user that said it portrays black Americans in a positive way. They're not all stereotypes they have their own personalities.  Smoke is confident but level headed. Soul Train seems the stereotype but we see a totally different side of him when we find he's a lawyer. So it's not a good movie but it makes an effort to be one which counts for something.  For all it's lack of realism it gets points for not having the absurd stunts that Torque did like flipping a huge street bike with a helicopter jet engine mind you mid air and riding on top and through the passenger sections of moving trains.  Biker Boyz isn't good by any means but it's not quite that bad.".

As a Shakespeare fan I thought it overdone washed out.  As a motorcyclist I thought it shameful Passengers in shorts spaghettistrap tops and heels? Racing wo helmets?  Stunting on a public freeway in traffic at night? These are NOT the role models you were looking for...  I will point out that a FEW lines in the movie did hint to the dangers of riding especially 'extreme' riding.  The crashes were definitely hopped up not sure if a 500 lb superbike would sail spinning thru the air like a frisbee... but no punches were pulled as to how badly you can get hurt on these things if you're not careful and FOCUSED.  And Fishbourne's character although definitely the most badass in the whole bunch showed how far skill finesse and restraint will go beyond blind luck guts and adrenaline. That is to say he was on top the whole time even to the last frame.With the budget this film had pretty much the bikes alone are each worth 20G's or more they COULD have made something with more emotional impact more story and a LOT less gratuitous teenage hormone inducer.  So if you see this movie resist the impulse to go out and get a bike.  The real world ain't like this at all.  Riding like this in the real world will get someone probably YOU killed.".

When Tariq is killed in a motorcycle accident Kid drops off the scene for six months but returns determined to become more than just a prospect. His ultimate aim is to challenge Smoke himself and make his mark by taking down the biggest dog there is but first he must go legit and set up his own motorcycle gang with friends Stuntman and Primo.Opening with a really nice tracking shot or series of shots I'm not sure this film had my interest early on but very quickly blew it. With an obvious and predictable establishing scene the narrative arch is established and thus I began my weary trudge from start to finish through countless music video scenes unconvincing dialogue scenes and loads of motorcycles. It is very basic stuff and it never aspires to much. The characters are cut out of cardboard and the dialogue is awful this might cut the mustard if the film was an out and out action film but it isn't. Instead it is supposed to be a character driven film and thus it is a big problem for it to not have characters or convincing dialogue. Sadly it is a mess in regards the writing and plotting and only the forgiving will find the material worth two hours of their time.The action is pretty weak. I didn't think any of the races were exciting and although they are well done all of them could have sorely used the emotions of the characters to feed into them. As it is the failure of the plot means that much of the film is lacking and feels rather pointless. Occasionally it hints at depth and humanity but the occasional spark is totally drowned out in a sea of noise. The music video goals of the film are met but personally I'm glad not to be in the demographic sector that is tricked into thinking that this makes for a good film.The cast are mixed containing people that I expected better from and people that deserve stuff like this. Fishburne may well have expected more from the film because at times you can see him reaching sadly he cannot achieve the impossible and any glimmer of a good performance is swamped. Luke struggles from the start. He is pretty and charismatic here but he can't deliver emotion and understanding that isn't in the script and his narration is terrible. The support cast are roundly average with obvious performances from Jones Hounsou Fehr and others. Good is sexy but pretty vacant while I'm not sure why Bonet bothered to turn up for so little.Overall then a fairly pointless film that shrugs off any character potential it may have had in favour of MTV visuals clunky dialogue and mostly average performances at best. You can see the potential in the story but across several aspects the film fails to deliver this potential and just churns out a totally unnecessary film that doesn't deserve any of your time.".

Nowadays color and plastic coat the fastest and most coveted motorcycles in the land and Biker Boyz' heralds the passing with unrestrained glee.Set among AfricanAmerican biker clubs in Southern California the film follows Kid Derek Luke a prodigious young motorcycle racer in his quest for the title of King of Cali' currently held by Smoke Lawrence Fishburne leader of the Black Knights bike club. Smoke hesitates in accepting Kid's challenges citing that Kid is not a member of a legitimate club. In one scene Kid addresses Smoke's assistant with anger and frustration Are you racing? Or are you just blowin' smoke?' Kid begins his own club the aptly named Biker Boyz' and sets out for the crown of fastest biker. The rest of the film follows a sort of formula we have seen before with the underdog taking on the inhumanly skilled antagonist at the end. Though the plot is weak the talent both onscreen and off push the film into something the script alone could not hold. The actors for the most part excel in their respective roles. Fishburne turns what may have been a trivial role into one exuding sincerity and masculinity holding to an effectively pensive and reserved demeanor. His presence on the screen legitimizes the film as not just another Days of Thunder.' Fishburne's charisma must have extended to the rest of the cast as even Kid Rock who made his film debut in 2001's deplorable Joe Dirt' portrays his character with gusto and roadwise scruffiness. Director Reggie Rock Bythewood makes his presence felt in the film. Bythewood made a splash at Sundance a few years ago with his debut Dancing in September.' With Biker Boyz' he manages to pull off something slightly extraordinary he makes motorcycle racing entertaining. The camera freewheels around smoking tires colorful racing suits and bouncing nightclubs with dizzying ease. His film is loosely based on a feature from the Los Angeles New Times on the biking subculture in California and Bythewood tries to bring a sense of biker culture to the screen. The nonfiction foundation of the film shines through displaying a bizarre sense of camaraderie between cyclists similar to that of a fraternal order.Despite its basically inane premise the movie is not all bad. The poor title and plot outline summons memories of Rollerball' and the like but do not be deceived. Biker Boyz' inspires some sense of genuine excitement and intrigue. As entertainment it works on the same level as last year's SpiderMan.' It cannot be praised as a piece of art but the craftsmanship of the film is undeniable which grants it a begrudged recommendation.".

I really also enjoyed how the movie was NOT violent and they showed how Black people can have a great time wo guns and violence notice the only weapon in the movie is brandished by the Italian gang.

Nothing at all to hold your interest. No action poor acting esp. from Kid Rock and even the bikes looked bored. The ending is so predictable that it's a relief when it finally comes.Oh and did I mention that Hollywood expects us to swallow Derek Luke as an 18 year old? He's 30 next year for Chrissake!And as for Laurence Fishburne....... don't get me started...oops! too late! What was with him?

I do agree though that some of the race scenes appeared to be at 30 mph. All in all its a good movie and if you're into motorcycles its especially good.";

	schema:reviewBody "Oh my God was this movie bad!  They tried to make it into a Fast and the Furious on bikes which when you think about it couldn't have been that difficult since FF was no gift either.  But it really is impressive how terrible this movie is! SPOILERS  movie is so bad it doesn't matterFirst of all could they have picked a more lame name for their gang? Biker Boyz????  The main characters decide to start their own biker gang and what do they call themselves?  Biker Boyz????  Were they trying to steal the fire from the Back Street Boys?  What a bunch of limpwristed morons!  And then they get two Asians who want to join..... on ATVs!!!  ATVBoyz??? Hahahahahahaha!  You have to see the stunts in this pile of junk you call those motorcycle stunts?  They were terrible I was laughing my head off when it was supposed to be cool!  It was especially hilarious when the third founding member a Latino guy tries to show them how good he is on a bike. He actually stands up and sticks his leg off the back of the bike! That's it!  Really!  That's it!   Oooooh you have talent you have to help us start a biker club!!!  HAhahahahahahahahahha!And then there is the story of how poor old Jaleel bad name loses his father to a bike accident boohoo and his mother doesn't want him involved in bikes.  They of course live in a perfect suburban home she drives nice cars and wears nice clothes.  But when he invites her to the annual biker party?  She turns up looking like a 2bit tramp!  Way to go Mom! Hahahahahahha!The street racing scenes were boring as sin.  For instance in the big climactic scene the course they are racing on is on some Greedy Farmer's Field.  You can see that the finish line is only about a mile away before they even start.  But they get their bikes up to 200 miles and hour and it takes roughly 10 minutes to race the mile!  It was laughable!  What in the world was Laurence Fishburne thinking?  The only reason I gave this movie a 2 was that he was in the Matrix.  That's it there is no association with The Matrix at all but hey he was in it.And there was the boohoo fatherson scene hahahahahha!  Standard fare in trying to bring a smidgen of drama to the flick.  Then Jaleel promises his mother he will never race again..... oooooooohhhhh!  Do you think he will keep his promise?????    Do you?????  I don't know there are some pretty compelling reasons to race out there!!   Like BE A MAN!  A challenge was issued!  And a bunch of other macho BS!  HAHAHAHAHAH!  I think the only audience who would be impressed are The Village People!  The characters in La Cage Aux Folles were more macho than these losers!  And oh my God I nearly forgot..... Kid Rock!  HAHAHAHAHA!  He should call himself Skid Rock! Hahahahaha!  Man talk about the poster boy for trailer park boys!  Is he EVER gross!  And you have to see his gay helmet with the dog collar! HAHAHAHAHAHA! There was nothing of interest in this movie whatsoever!  Even the music was terrible what a complete and utter waste of time!  At least we all now know that Lisa Bonet is still alive...... barely.....".

	schema:reviewBody "A film about dragracing motorbikes was never likely to win any screenplay awards but the least an undemanding audience could expect is some brainless thrills a couple of decentenough performances and perhaps an enjoyable but throwaway 100minute experience. Well at least the brainless part was achieved Suffice to say it's a long time since I've seen a major cinema release directed so badly. Reggie Rock Bythewood fails spectacularly at just about every aspect not least his utter inability to inject any feel of excitement into the integral racing scenes. The bikes appear to be doing a sluggish 30mph and the effects shots and camera movements used to mask this are laughably amateur. Even the limited stunts are totally unimpressive. Surely a few bucks spent on the odd jump or explosion here and there isn't too much to ask? Needless to say there were strict restrictions evident on the shoestring budget.But Larry Fishburne's in it! I hear you cry. It can't be all that bad? Unfortunately the erstwhile Morpheus just adds to the horror the poor bloke obviously realising just what he'd gotten himself into early on. You can see the wincing embarrassment on his face as he's forced to spout out tedious lines while strapped into uncomfortably snug leathers playing a cringeworthy 'hip dad' role not seen since early '90s sketch shows.The rest of the cast are even worse and coupled with very poor editing the film comes across like lots of individual scenes cut together rather than as one flowing storyline. The illfitting soundtrack follows suit banal post2000 hiphopRnB mostly as it is often completely out of synchrony with the 'action' on display.If you must see this film it will only be for the benefit of viewing some truly hilarious but utterly unintentionally so moments e.g. the 'tragic accident' at the start which actually added the second star to this almost sobadit'sdepressing movie.In comparison The Fast And The Furious looks like the bloody Shawshank Redemption.".

Some of the acting in the movie is poor and whilst the plot is clichd for the genre and the crew didn't do themselves any favours by not accentuating the emotional points of the plot the film is still a solid and emotional drama.

	schema:reviewBody "It's deep contemplative sayings like this that elevate this magnificent film from the trite piece of hiphop pistonpumping fluff promised by the trailer. Just kidding it is hiphop pistonpumping fluff.  At times goofy at times kinda fun I guess if you like motorcycle tricks. And who doesn't when you get right down to it. This review contains a spoiler just in case you really care.  Trust me it really doesn't matter.  Derek Luke stars as Kid a young talented motorcycle rider whose father is the mechanic that keeps Smoke Laurence Fishburne on top of the street racing scene the King of Cali as Smoke is called. Things go south early as Kid's father Slick Willie played by Eric LaSalle is killed when an outofcontrol motorcycle smashes into him during a street race. The meat of the story thus begins as Kid tries to step out of his father's shadow and take his place in the pantheon of great motorcycle street racers. Now I am going to divulge a few secrets in this review I figure you probably aren't going to see this one anyway and if you do the surprises really are nothing you haven't seen before. It is revealed late in the film that Smoke is Kid's real father. I think the writers thought this might complicate the story but they don't exploit it in any meaningful way. The best we get is a tense scene between Kid and his mother where he asks her if she was ever going to tell him Smoke was his real father if Slick Willie hadn't died. She says I don't know.would you have wanted to know? Kid responds with I don't know. Now just because you say I don't know with a brooding intense look on your face doesn't mean you've done anything to clue us in on how your character is feeling. She doesn't know you don't know guess what the audience doesn't know either. Thanks for that. There are some things to keep the average older white guy like me watching Meagan Good plays Kid's girlfriend. I've never seen this girl before but I think she's been in an few things and she's hotter than a bug under a magnifying glass on a Death Valley August afternoon. And there are some okay motorcycle sequences nothing too amazing though. In fact all of the races are basically just drag races not very interesting visually. We are told that it's the rider not the bike but it's difficult to understand this based on the movie which offers no insights into what it takes to be a good racer. I think this film may be trying to be like Saturday Night Fever meaning that SNF is about disco but it really is not about disco in fact it's an antidisco movie. Well this film may be trying to do the same thing with motorcycles. I think in this case the writers think it is about what it takes to be a man. Well if that's the case. They biffed it. This movie it seems really is just about motorcycle racing. Burn rubber not your soul. That line is spoken more than once and I'm not sure what it means don't lose sight of who you are or something like that. Anyway the ending is completely baffling and seems to go against the value system the movie sets up for itself. Ready? All through the movie we sort of get halfassed moral lessons on how dangerous it is to race in the streets and how Kid should stop. And how Smoke Fishburne has never grown up still chasing young girls this is sort of explored with Kid's mother and one of Smoke's old girlfriends played by Lisa Bonet in a real disposable role. The big climax is set up like this Kid Challenges Smoke who's undefeated in over 200 races to one race. If Smoke wins Kid must stop racing which is ostensibly the right thing to do but if Kid wins then Smoke must stop racing. So what happens? The big race comes it's a good one real exciting down a long straight dirt road and.and...Smoke eases off the throttle a little bit and let's Kid win. Why? I have no idea. Kid and his friends celebrate. Now Kid has inherited the mantle as King of Cali which he didn't even really earn and will have to defend his title maybe crack his head open who knows. Didn't the filmmakers see American Graffiti? I give up. The only way that would have worked as an ending would be if it were Laurence Fishburne's story which it ain't. So filmmaking 101 don't switch protagonists right at the end or you run the risk of completely deflating any sort of catharsis or resolution by the time the credits roll. Did I mention that Meagan Good was really hot? To wrap it up Kid is an uninteresting and drab hero as is the plot. Fishburne is really the life preserver that keeps the whole thing from sinking but maybe we should just let this one sink. It's not worth your time.".

And how Smoke Fishburne has never grown up still chasing young girls this is sort of explored with Kid's mother and one of Smoke's old girlfriends played by Lisa Bonet in a real disposable role. The big climax is set up like this Kid Challenges Smoke who's undefeated in over 200 races to one race. If Smoke wins Kid must stop racing which is ostensibly the right thing to do but if Kid wins then Smoke must stop racing. So what happens? The big race comes it's a good one real exciting down a long straight dirt road and.and...Smoke eases off the throttle a little bit and let's Kid win. Why? I have no idea. Kid and his friends celebrate. Now Kid has inherited the mantle as King of Cali which he didn't even really earn and will have to defend his title maybe crack his head open who knows. Didn't the filmmakers see American Graffiti? I give up. The only way that would have worked as an ending would be if it were Laurence Fishburne's story which it ain't. So filmmaking 101 don't switch protagonists right at the end or you run the risk of completely deflating any sort of catharsis or resolution by the time the credits roll. Did I mention that Meagan Good was really hot? To wrap it up Kid is an uninteresting and drab hero as is the plot. Fishburne is really the life preserver that keeps the whole thing from sinking but maybe we should just let this one sink. It's not worth your time.";

Biker Boyz was well put together and was very interesting. It was a good movie with little violenceand it is also a more real approach to what a Bike crew really does. Everyone thinks that all they do is race around. They are just like a football team. I wish they would come out with Biker Boyz 2. There was drama in the movie but it went with the story line. I think that there was not an over kill of it and not to little it was very balanced. I wish that people would give it a chance and see the movie for what it is and not just a bike movie. If you sit and watch it you can really get into it. I can watch this movie anytime and day and have seen it at least 15 times. Burn Rubber not Your Soul is one of the best catch phrases I have heard in a movie. Stating to be true to your self. What other movies can you say that about. Everyone is so caught up in non reality and homosexuality. Lets keep our minds open instead of passing judgment. I mean we are giving movies like Broke Back Mountain better reviews that a movie that for once doesn't demonstrate that.".

Those with an open mind or an understanding of ethnic communities and lifestyle subcultures should recognize the spirit of this film.  Derek Luke establishes himself as a rising star not a fluke.  Vanessa Bell Calloway shines.  The whole cast reflected some bold choices that I really appreciated.  I loved seeing Lisa Bonet and Salli Richardson given a chance to do their thing on the big screen.  The story is brimming with good messages about family honor and manhood.

Played story and all... but so what? I ride I'm a newb. I ride a rocket. But I'm no sunta'. Not sure I care to be one. But it is impressive to see what some people can do on these machines and not die. I agree the public displays of disregard are a bad model but I hear about that stuff all the time and have seen a little in my area even so it happens. The thing missing from the movie was a disclaimer stating that it's NOT smart to NOT wear a helmet and that it's highly disrespectful to pull most of that stuff on public roads. As for Brendan's character not wearing during the races.. the point was that no one would take him serious for not wearing a helmet.. which showed the other characters didn't appreciate the cockiness.As for the comments about the half naked bodies and other eye candy body shots... gimme a break. It hardly took much time at all on the movie.When I originally saw the previews I was concerned that this movie would only encourage eejits to go out and buy rockets and cause havoc. Perhaps bombing on the big screen was a good thing because I didn't see that fallout. I even joked about my watching it not in the theater being a bad thing... but I don't believe so now. I enjoyed this movie perhaps I'm too easy to please and do recommend it to people who don't take themselves too serious and don't expect a movie about bike gangs doing races and tricks to be high caliber.".

Motorcycles demand your full attention but aren't as dangerous as everyone thinks. off the soapboxThe movie does hit upon the fact that motorcycles can be dangerous but thankfully doesn't spend the entire length of the film talking about it. The acting isn't topnotch but the actors do a good enough job to not get in the way of the movie's events. Besides if you are watching this movie you're watching it because of the fact that it's about motorcycles and the culture not because you're looking for an Oscarworthy performance from any of the actors involved. I believe that the movie does a good job showcasing the machines and the motorcycle club culture. The film does suffer from some character development issues but given the film's purpose are ultimately forgivable.I slot this movie right between 2Fast 2Furious and The Fast and the Furious in the quality continuum with The Fast and the Furious being the best of the three. If you want a closer subject matter comparison this movie is LEAGUES better than Torque. This movie is much more realistic than that title.".

His arrival would mean that the supply of funds doled out by his father's estate under matriarch Henrietta Lowell Bernard Colby's sister would come to an abrupt halt. Henrietta has an abiding interest in all things psychic and has spent nearly one hundred thousand dollars on psychic research sances and payments to Professor Bowen and wife Carlotta to stay in touch with the dead.Although it's presumed Allen Colby drowned when a cruise ship went down detective Charlie Chan Warner Oland has his doubts. With no body and a recovered briefcase bearing the initials A.C. Chan believes the missing heir will show up. Indeed he does but not as expected. Gaining entrance to the old Colby homestead Allen is quickly dispatched by a knife in the back thrown from a parlor trapdoor. His corpse does make an appearance though at a scheduled sance meant to determine his fate. With Colby truly gone the remaining ColbyLowell heirs can gain some measure of satisfaction  or can they? The film does a nice job of presenting a number of possible suspects to the Colby murder. Attorney Warren Phelps the administrator of the Colby fortune stands to lose a substantial portion of his income from fees paid for his services. Henrietta Lowell would lose all of her psychic research funding and her two daughters would be cut off as well. Accordingly Professor Bowen and wife Carlotta would no longer enjoy their sance income if Allen Colby showed up to claim his inheritance. And for good measure the film offers caretaker Ulrich as a suspect his daughter was in love with Colby years ago but died some time after Colby disappeared seven years earlier.Charlie Chan approaches the case methodically and begins to unravel the case a step at a time. When he demonstrates to Mrs. Lowell how the sances were rigged by the Bowen's she becomes a loyal ally to uncover the mystery to the point of faking her own death when the killer lashes out. But with all the meticulous work done in laying out the suspects the identity of the real murderer still comes as a surprise at the end. In typical Chan fashion the killer had a stake in Colby's disappearance but there were no real clues to implicate him throughout the film.With no Chan family members on board for this film the comic relief is handled by Lowell butler Baxter nervously but effectively portrayed by Herbert Mundin. As if to lend further credibility to mysterious psychic forces at work in the Colby House a black cat named Lucifer snarls his way into a couple of well placed scenes. Sufficiently dark and moody Charlie Chan's Secret is a well told mystery that nicely complements other films in the Chan series.".

I originally felt it was among the weaker Chan films starring Warner Oland today however I would describe it as a truly solid entry.Several years earlier Alan Colby heir to a major fortune disappeared and was presumed deadand elderly aunt Alice Lowell Rosina Lawrence inherited the estate. Now however it seems that Colby may be alive and although his resurrection will cost her the family fortune Mrs. Lowell dutifully enlists Chan to investigate the matter. But with a great fortune at stake murder cannot be far behind.Such earlier Chan films as THE BLACK CAMEL and CHARLIE CHAN IN Egypt introduced an occult edge to the Chan films and CHARLIE CHAN'S SECRET plays upon this theme to a degree not previously seen in any other Chan film Mrs. Lowell is a spiritualist who is given to everything from sances to nightly sessions with the Ouija board and both elements play into the story in a significant way. Although the plot itself is nonsense the spooky elements fill the holes and the castmost particularly Rosina Lawrence as Mrs. Lowell and Herbert Mundin as the bumbling butler Baxterdeliver solid and quite often charming performances.Chan films are often accused of being racist and critics often complain that the actors playing Chan wore yellowface make up. The films however must be seen within the context of their era. In the 1930s Hollywood presented most Asian characters as either servile or as Fu Manchulike entities Chan was actually just about the only positive Asian character going and as such the films were tremendously popular with AsianAmerican audiences of the era.True enough Chan is inevitably played by an occidental actor but this was typical of the era in which star status was considered more important than racial accuracy. Whatever the case neither Warner Oland or the later Sidney Toler wore significant makeup for the role and Olandalthough a Swede by birthactually had a strong strain of Asian ancestry in his family tree. But most significantly while Chan often allows his suspects to dismiss him through their own prejudices as a character he is always presented in a positive lightand this is particularly true of CHARLIE CHAN'S SECRET in which Chan is the only Asian character in the film.While I would not rank it along such knockout Chan films as CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OPERA or CHARLIE CHAN AT TREASURE ISLAND CHARLIE CHAN'S SECRET grows upon you with each viewing. As noted the plot is weak but the film is long on charm. It is also one of the few Chan films available to the home market. Most Chan fans should enjoy it.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

All in all I rather found Charlie Chan's Secret very good overall. P.S. I feel the need to mention another player from my birthtown of Chicago Ill. here. This time it's James T.

Such loan out arrangements were not uncommon between studios in this period.In any event Charlie Chan's Secret survives his absence very nicely and emerges as a solid entry in the series with its own particular charm and entertainment value.

Of course one has to like the stereotypical device of rounding up many suspects to entrap the culprit but this one has a simple yet solid plot line that unfolds nicely is entangled but not confused like say the 'Olympics' movie is in which conclusions literally fall from the sky. Heir to a fortune comes back after a long stay abroad in the French foreign legion only to be murdered while his relatives and ancillary characters administrators accountants housekeepers etc  gather to get in touch with spirits the family's hobby...it turns out everybody would have something to loose from the heir's return but the culprit is not whom we may expect at first sight. Acting serves the purpose well and the eerie atmosphere is nice. There is no 'number son' bit which to me is quite a relief while the comedy moment is provided by a clumsy butler who grimaces all the time. 1930s topnotch science returns when a UV projector is used and the 'fake medium' bit will be copied nearly verbatim in the Houdini movie with Tony Curtis.".

Of course one has to like the stereotypical device of rounding up many suspects to entrap the culprit but this one has a simple yet solid plot line that unfolds nicely is entangled but not confused like say the 'Olympics' movie is in which conclusions literally fall from the sky. Heir to a fortune comes back after a long stay abroad in the French foreign legion only to be murdered while his relatives and ancillary characters administrators accountants housekeepers etc  gather to get in touch with spirits the family's hobby...it turns out everybody would have something to loose from the heir's return but the culprit is not whom we may expect at first sight. Acting serves the purpose well and the eerie atmosphere is nice. There is no 'number son' bit which to me is quite a relief while the comedy moment is provided by a clumsy butler who grimaces all the time. 1930s topnotch science returns when a UV projector is used and the 'fake medium' bit will be copied nearly verbatim in the Houdini movie with Tony Curtis.";

Oland is the best of the Chans and performs the role with dignity and some humor.  You get the feeling that although he isn't a Chinese actor he respects the character.  No Confucius Say here.

On the other hand though there's also the clear logic reasoning of Charlie Chan and his costar Henrietta Crosman as Mrs. Lowell who is a fervent believer in the communication with the dead but also shows quite remarkable guts! The murder victim is millionaire Allen Colby who'd been away for years but suddenly turns up again  much to the chagrin of his aunt's Mrs. Lowell's family who had hoped to inherit his fortune as well as to Mrs. Lowell's trusted psychic couple which has already earned quite a nice sum from their obviously faked sances. Then there is janitor Ulrich who'd hated Crosby ever since he'd seduced his daughter and then dropped her like an old glove and the poor girl committed suicide and Colby's lawyer and trustee Phelps... So as we see there are QUITE a lot of suspects to choose from! But since Charlie realizes that he'll never get a confession out of any of them he decides to catch the murderer redhanded  and for that purpose he applies a VERY clever trick his 'secret' as the title suggests...This movie REALLY holds you in its spell from the first to the last moment  and when there are moments without the creepiness of dark sance rooms in the old house especially prepared for those procedures or the even darker secret passageways behind its walls there are surprisingly welcome comical sequences provided by the everscared butler Baxter Herbert Mundin...

Warner Oland is a delight as Chan full of his usual witty aphorisms and remaining one step ahead of the murderer when the owner of the fortune is killed as soon as he shows up! There's even a bit of JFK style shooting to which of course there is more than meets the eye. This scene and its aftermath is a real standout. No Keye Luke this time out but Chan has plenty of helpers on this one! I really enjoyed this mystery movie and hopefully you will too.".

There are some very effective moments to be found in this entry including the ending which I obviously won't spoil for people who haven't seen the film but it's a great one. Also worth noting is a terrific sequence at the start of the film during a psychic reading where a body appears. How many films from this era featured a psychic reading? Well this here might be the very best of the bunch.The story itself is quite strong and allows for some pretty good suspects to come into play. Another plus is that the performances are so good with OIand once again hitting a grand slam in the role of Chan. The supporting players are just as good including Henrietta Crosman in the role of the leader of the family.

Still we have to endure the comic relief of a dimwitted butler a character I could have done without. The story is full of character stereotypes not unusual for films of that era. And the plot left some questions in my mind unresolved.Yet the eerie atmosphere and the standard gathering of the suspects at the end make the film worth watching. This is one story wherein Chan himself Warner Oland is not sure of the killer's identity until Chan lays a trap and the villain grabs the bait. Compared to many whodunits the large number of suspects here makes picking out the murderer a little more difficult. Toward that objective one plot point can really lead the viewer down the garden path if not paying close attention.Visuals consist mostly of set pieces which are fairly well constructed. BW lighting is okay but could have been ratcheted up a notch or two for even greater suspense. Henrietta Crosman is terrific as the wealthy old woman. She and Warner Oland work well together.Of all the Chan films I have seen Charlie Chan's Secret probably would be in the top half mostly owing to the atmospheric visuals and a plot that made guessing the identity of the murderer tricky and far from certain.".

The production designer is responsible for the look of the sets  the design of the rooms and ceilings the furniture the decor. This one has doors you must stoop to walk through. There are melancholy underground passages reached through hidden doors. There are ancient chandeliers with hidden radio speakers. The ceilings slope down to waist height. And they have exposed beams like a Tudor house. There are tables with statues on them. The statues must have taken an archaeologist to find them in the Fox basements. Gargoyles stick out of the discolored walls.You may or may not notice all this stuff because there are actors moving around in the sets talking to each other gesturing sometimes holding a sance or throwing a knife or firing a pistol.The problem is that a terribly rich man who has been missing for years shows up just at the time his will is about to be read. Half a dozen people gather at the mansion to hear the will. So does the mogul but he's immediately murdered. And everybody present seems to have had a motive. It's up to Charlie Chan to unravel the mystery and he does so without the zealous help of an Enumerated Son. One highly suspicious character is the caretaker Egon Brecher. I would like to see Egon Brecher go mano a mano with Max Schreck. The comic sidekick role is taken by Herbert Mundin as a frightened English butler. You'll recognize him as Munch the Miller's Son in The Adventures of Robin Hood the one starring Errol Flynn. Award for most strikinglooking performer goes to envelope please  yes  Henrietta Crosman as Henrietta Lowell just as I thought. She's unforgettable. An old lady her hair was snowy white but her eyebrows were dark and formed a straight line across her brows as if she were some raving paranoid. Her irises were the color of anthracite. She looks a lot more like a heavy than a pal of Charlie's.Since it's an inexpensive B film you won't find much in the way of originality. These cheap movies were designed to be shown as a second feature on a double bill with a more lavishly budgeted film that was colossal in scope stupendous in impact featuring thousands of extras and a major director who did not come out of production design.

	schema:reviewBody "Now that more and more people are reflecting on the great career of Walter Matthau it is surprising that very few critics have mentioned his topnotch performance in Charley Varrick the best thing he has ever done. I got interested in this film when I discovered that it had an underground following with everyone from The Pretenders to several critics. I bought the film and became floored by how outstanding of a movie this is. In my opinion it is the most under appreciated movie ever made and the best movie to come out of the 70's yes even better than THE GODFATHER DAYS OF HEAVEN TAXI DRIVER and APOCALYPSE NOW. It is also one of the ten best movies I have ever seen. I have seen this movie over 20 times and it gets better every time I see it. It is surprising that I have learned more about how to make a great suspenseaction film from this movie than any other which I have seen. The interesting thing about Charley Varrick is that you wonder why you are so taken in by the story. It's a relatively simple one. Yet this is a story with a conclusion that leaves you stunned every time you see it and convinces you that this is a film that should be seen again and again unlike some great movies that should be seen only once. I make it an effort to see Charley Varrick on a regular basis. The story starts out as follows a group of bank robbers attempt to make a small killing and right when they think that they have succeeded . . . The story then allows the viewer to be consumed in a film of drumtight professionalism with great action sequences excellent performances incredible dialogue and possibly the greatest single screen villain of all time in the form of Joe Don Baker I wouldn't have believed it until I saw it. I am convinced that in the near future Charley Varrick will be resurrected in the form of a remake not that I am looking toward that day. But in context Don Siegel's masterpiece is a film that stands by itself as one of the great under appreciated and undervalued movies of all time and is a film for everyone. It doesn't get any better than this.".

In my opinion it is the most under appreciated movie ever made and the best movie to come out of the 70's yes even better than THE GODFATHER DAYS OF HEAVEN TAXI DRIVER and APOCALYPSE NOW. It is also one of the ten best movies I have ever seen. I have seen this movie over 20 times and it gets better every time I see it. It is surprising that I have learned more about how to make a great suspenseaction film from this movie than any other which I have seen. The interesting thing about Charley Varrick is that you wonder why you are so taken in by the story. It's a relatively simple one. Yet this is a story with a conclusion that leaves you stunned every time you see it and convinces you that this is a film that should be seen again and again unlike some great movies that should be seen only once. I make it an effort to see Charley Varrick on a regular basis. The story starts out as follows a group of bank robbers attempt to make a small killing and right when they think that they have succeeded . . . The story then allows the viewer to be consumed in a film of drumtight professionalism with great action sequences excellent performances incredible dialogue and possibly the greatest single screen villain of all time in the form of Joe Don Baker I wouldn't have believed it until I saw it. I am convinced that in the near future Charley Varrick will be resurrected in the form of a remake not that I am looking toward that day. But in context Don Siegel's masterpiece is a film that stands by itself as one of the great under appreciated and undervalued movies of all time and is a film for everyone. It doesn't get any better than this.";

Matthau plays beautifully against Robinson who's everything Matthau's not in terms of brains and self control.Matching Matthau is the syndicate cleanup man Joe Don Baker who's also a shrewd man with a very suspicious nature. That comes with the territory of Baker's job still he's got a streak of meanness in him as well. Matthau and Baker are an evenly matched pair.

	schema:reviewBody "This quickmoving thriller demonstrates that cinematic amorality has been around a long time. Made in 1973 it allows cropduster and bankrobber Charley Varrick played by Walter Matthau to get away with a heap of stolen money the theft of which has led to the death of about half a dozen people including his wife. The movie is directed in his usual snappy but artful way by Don Siegel who taught Clint Eastwood everything Clint knows about direction but not necessarily everything Don knew. The movie also demonstrates that in the days when movies spent less time on technical wizardry they could spend more on character development. For example on Molly Joe Don Baker a courteous but sadistic heavy from the deep South who can beat a man to death without losing his cool or creasing his sharp suit. Other noteworthy character studies are Andy Robinson as Charley's sweaty weasly accomplice Sheree North as a twotiming photographer John Vernon as Maynard Boyle a suave but crooked bank owner and Marjorie Bennett as a nosey trailer park resident. The plotline is supposed to be that Charley expects to get only a modest sum from the bank heist and then has to get his thinking cap and skates on when he realises he's taken a pile of Mafia loot. But Siegel teases us and it's never very clear just how much Charley knows and how far ahead he's thinking perhaps there was an insider and Charley knew about the big money before the raid. Overall can we believe what we're seeing or is Siegel playing with us like Bryan Singer in The Usual Suspects?Which leads to the third thing demonstrated by this and other Siegel movies  that current hotshots like Quintin Tarantino owe him a debt.Incidentally those IMDb commenters who are offended by Charley bedding Boyle's secretary Felicia Farr because she is too young for him should check Ms Farr's DOB. Also she was married to Jack Lemmon Matthau's friend and filmpartner so the bedroom scene is something of an injoke.".

He lives in a trailer park with his girlfriend Nadine Jacqueline Scott. He decides to supplement his income by robbing a small bank in a backwater New Mexican town. Unfortunately not everything goes as planned.I watched Charley Varrick in a fine widescreen transfer by the way at present only a bad pan and scan version appears to exist on DVD during a TCM channel marathon of director Don Siegel's films. I had just finished Madigan 1968 which I didn't care that much for although I thought the limited action sequences were good and the direction fine and was about to finally shut off the television and go to sleep. However Walter Matthau is one of my favorite actors and Charley Varrick was starting almost immediately after the end of Madigan so I figured I'd at least peek at the first few minutes. That was a long peek because this is one excellent film. Charley Varrick ended up with a 10 out of 10 from me.It probably wouldn't be quite so good without Matthau as the lead. He's had a plethora of fantastic performances but none are better than Charley Varrick many are just as good. Matthau was perfectly casthe had exactly the right age the right look and the right disposition for this role. His understated intelligent manner makes the character and his actions eminently believable within the context of the film. As this is a film that hinges on a fairly complex logically intricate plot believability within the context of the film is very important.Not that the other elements aren't laudable. Siegel's directionmost of it imbued with a great gritty early 1970s feelis impeccable and ranges from a series of beautiful shots of the countryside during the opening credits to elaborately staged underhanded clues as to the plot beneath the plotduring most of the middle section Varrick makes a number of moves that would seem bizarre if taken at their surface value but he's really hatching a scheme to extricate himself from the mire he's sunken into. None of this is explicitly stated but Siegel easily conveys it with his direction. There is even one pointright after a character named Molly Joe Don Baker visits Jewell Everett Sheree North that it seems like maybe Siegel made a fatal misstep and a scene or two are missing but I retained faith that it would work out in the end and it did seamlessly.The rest of the cast is fantastic as well and of course a film like this wouldn't succeed without a great script in this case written by Dean Riesner and Howard Rodman from a John Reese novel. This is a toolittleknown gem that deserves wider recognition and better treatment such as a good DVD transfer with lots of extras.".

	schema:reviewBody "The decision to cast Walter Matthau as the eponymous antihero of this entertaining heist movie proved to be highly inspired because not only did he turn in a great performance but also because of his deportment and mannerisms etc. immediately signalled that Varrick is far from being a stereotypical smalltime criminal. By dispelling any audience preconceptions in this way his character is established very naturally and soon becomes a rich source of interest in a fascinating story that was based on John Reese's novel The Looters.Exstunt pilot Charley Varrick runs a cropdusting business and supplements his income by robbing small banks. He's been successful because his crimes have been lowprofile but his luck changes when his gang robs the bank at Tres Cruces New Mexico because a patrolman recognises that their getaway car is displaying stolen plates and the sequence of events that follows results in the whole operation getting out of control. Two police officers and a gang member are killed during the robbery and Charley's wife and getaway driver Nadine Jacqueline Scott is also shot and later dies from her injury. Charley and Harman Sullivan Andrew Robinson the gang's only survivors then hide out in a trailer park.After Charley hears a radio news bulletin that claims that the robbers got away with less than 2000 and discovers that the money they've actually got amounts to 750000 he immediately realises that the small bank was obviously being used as a drop for mob money that was subsequently due to be sent out of the country to be laundered. With the police and the Mafia guaranteed to be pursuing them Charley doesn't want to use the cash immediately because he knows that the Mafia will be relentless in hunting down the cash and the thieves. This idea doesn't go down well with Harman who isn't so concerned about the danger they're in and remains determined to go on a spending spree without delay.Maynard Boyle John Vernon who's the head of the corporation that owns the bank at Tres Cruces hires hit man Molly Joe Don Baker to recover the stolen money and deal with the bank robbers. Charley wastes no time as he devises an ingenious survival plan which involves the use of switched dental records fake passports and a cropduster plane to try to extricate himself from the tight spot that he's in.Charley Varrick is a gritty violent and actionpacked movie with some great stunts and a good deal of humour but it's the strength of its plot and Charley's character that really elevates it to a higher standard than the average crime thriller.Charley is an interesting character because he's older than the average bank robber and is essentially an easygoing guy who wants to make a living by his own efforts. His cropdusting business isn't viable because the bigger outfits have the power to squeeze the smaller businesses out and so he uses his criminal activities to maintain his independence. What's more surprising about this man whose business slogan is The Last of the Independents is how resourceful he proves to be as he executes his plan and outwits his foes in what turns out to be a David and Goliath type scenario.Walter Matthau's superb performance is complemented by great work from the supporting cast with Andrew Robinson as Charley's notsobright hotheaded sidekick and Joe Don Baker as the sadistic hit man who enjoys his work also excellent in their memorable roles.".

He's been successful because his crimes have been lowprofile but his luck changes when his gang robs the bank at Tres Cruces New Mexico because a patrolman recognises that their getaway car is displaying stolen plates and the sequence of events that follows results in the whole operation getting out of control. Two police officers and a gang member are killed during the robbery and Charley's wife and getaway driver Nadine Jacqueline Scott is also shot and later dies from her injury. Charley and Harman Sullivan Andrew Robinson the gang's only survivors then hide out in a trailer park.After Charley hears a radio news bulletin that claims that the robbers got away with less than 2000 and discovers that the money they've actually got amounts to 750000 he immediately realises that the small bank was obviously being used as a drop for mob money that was subsequently due to be sent out of the country to be laundered. With the police and the Mafia guaranteed to be pursuing them Charley doesn't want to use the cash immediately because he knows that the Mafia will be relentless in hunting down the cash and the thieves. This idea doesn't go down well with Harman who isn't so concerned about the danger they're in and remains determined to go on a spending spree without delay.Maynard Boyle John Vernon who's the head of the corporation that owns the bank at Tres Cruces hires hit man Molly Joe Don Baker to recover the stolen money and deal with the bank robbers. Charley wastes no time as he devises an ingenious survival plan which involves the use of switched dental records fake passports and a cropduster plane to try to extricate himself from the tight spot that he's in.Charley Varrick is a gritty violent and actionpacked movie with some great stunts and a good deal of humour but it's the strength of its plot and Charley's character that really elevates it to a higher standard than the average crime thriller.Charley is an interesting character because he's older than the average bank robber and is essentially an easygoing guy who wants to make a living by his own efforts. His cropdusting business isn't viable because the bigger outfits have the power to squeeze the smaller businesses out and so he uses his criminal activities to maintain his independence. What's more surprising about this man whose business slogan is The Last of the Independents is how resourceful he proves to be as he executes his plan and outwits his foes in what turns out to be a David and Goliath type scenario.Walter Matthau's superb performance is complemented by great work from the supporting cast with Andrew Robinson as Charley's notsobright hotheaded sidekick and Joe Don Baker as the sadistic hit man who enjoys his work also excellent in their memorable roles.";

	schema:headline " Matthau at his ruthless best";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems a little off to call such a cold blooded story fun but that's exactly what Charley Varrick is. It's a neat little crime caper a look at the cultural zeitgeist of the early 1970s and features Walter Matthau as one of the most ruthless bastards in cinematic history.The simple but still interesting and effective plot starts with a bank robbery in a small New Mexico town. Charley Varrick Walter Matthau is a middleaged pilot who's gone from flying in air shows to being a crop duster. When bigger companies start to push him out of the business he decides to start robbing banks. Yeah that seems like an odd decision but the movie makes it subtly clear that Varrick has more than a bit of experience with the criminal world in his past. Though they get away with the bank's money twothirds of Varrick's gang ends up dead and Charley's worried the same thing will happen to the rest of them after they discover the small town bank held over 750 thousand dollars. As Charley explains to Harman Andrew Robinson the young and reckless surviving member of the gang the only way a tiny bank in a backwater town could have that much money on hand is if it were mob money being hidden from the authorities.Charley's right about that. Bank president Maynard Boyle John Vernon and branch manager Harold Young Woodrow Parfrey have been laundering money for the Mafia. Boyle and Young aren't just concerned about the robbery. They're also worried that their mob friends will blame them for the theft La Cosa Nostra being notorious for its suspicion of coincidence. The explanation that a crew of professional bank robbers just happened to hit a nothing little bank in a nothing little town on the exact day it was holding a stash of Mafia money isn't likely to satisfy them. So Boyle dispatches a pipesmoking cowboy of a hitman named Molly Joe Don Baker to track down the robbers though Molly's also instructed to find out if Boyle and Young were behind the theft.Charley seems to know it's just a matter of time before the cops or the mob run him down. The only question iswhat will he have to do to get away?Let me acknowledge that Charley Varrick shares two things with a lot of other films from the 1970s. Visually it looks a lot like a TV movie by today's standards and it has a more leisurely pace than most modern crime stories. While it's actually more realistic for things to unfold the way they do here folks used to the rattattattat speed of current films may find Charley Varrick a bit slow. If those things don't bother you though this is a very nice piece of work.There's a beguiling moral vacuousness to this film. The title character is a truly evil person even worse in some ways than the mob guys out to kill him. Yet the story treats his unflinching heartlessness as though it were merely a natural and proper reflection of the world in which Varrick lives. The slogan of Varrick's crop dusting company is The Last of the Independents and the film uses that as something of a rallying cry. It treats him as the symbol of the ordinary guy being squeezed by larger forces in society whether it's the law the mob or big business. That Varrick has the brains and boldness to take those larger forces is portrayed as admirable even though the actions he takes to do so are undeniably horrible.The movie also reflects the 70s conceit that crime and the underworld are never more than an inch under the surface anywhere in America. That a bank president would be in bed with the Mafia is treated as the most unsurprising thing in the world. The existence of men like Molly who cruise through the world like sharks is considered a normal and expected aspect of life.The acting in this film is quite good. Joe Don Baker plays Molly as a man who lives by very strict rules but relishes inflicting pain and death within those guidelines. Andrew Robinson plays Harman as a boy in a man's world incapable for seeing beyond his immediate wants and impulses. William Schallert as the sheriff investigating the bank robbery manages to make him a genuinely good man but not one who's nave to the bad world in which his lives. Walter Matthau also gives a great demonstration of movie star charisma. Charley Varrick is not a colorful or largerthanlife guy. He's plain spoken and his only affectation is chewing gum. But Matthau manages to hold your attention every second he's on the screen to the point you can't help but empathize with this vicious and unredeemed man.Charley Varrick is from another cultural and filmmaking era. If you've had little experience with that era this movie might be a bit of an acquired taste. Give it a chance though and you'll find watching this film to be very rewarding.".

	schema:reviewBody "Terrific underrated crime film from veteran Hollywood director Don Siegel. Siegel was coming off the biggest hit of his career with Dirty Harry when he made this quirky crime film starring Walter Matthau who at the time was best known for his comedic roles. Matthau plays career criminal Charley Varrick who pulls a bank job with Andrew Robinson the deranged killer in Dirty Harry but the two realize there was far more money in the bank than their should have been and that the bank is a mob front meaning they just robbed the mafia and are now on the run for their lives. To reveal more would spoil the clever and twisting plot but I can say that things kick off with bank president John Vernon calling upon a laconic mob hitman named Molly played by the always great Joe Don Baker to track down the stolen money. The rest of the cast includes many familiar character actors including Norman Fell William Schallert and even future director Craig R. Baxley I Come in Peace and Action Jackson. The film was cowritten by frequent Siegel collaborator Dean Riesner uncredited script doctor on Starman Sudden Impact and Blue Thunder and credited writer on Dirty Harry Coogan's Bluff and Rich Man Poor Man. Siegel's frequent composer Lalo Schifrin Bullitt Enter the Dragon Mission Impossible is also on hand to deliver another excellent score. Overall if you're fan of 70s crime films along the lines of Prime Cut or The Outfit you'll greatly enjoy Charley Varrick. FUN FACT! At one point in the film John Vernon's character tell's another character They're gonna strip you naked and go to work on you with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch which Quentin Tarantino paid homage to in Pulp Fiction when Marsellus Wallace says almost the exact same line.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don Siegel's outstanding caper makes an appealing contrast to his Clint Eastwood films. Walter Matthau's shrewd crafty protagonist uses his unrefined presence to put his opponents off guard instead of threaten them all the while keeping steps ahead of them.

On Varrick's tail is a callous enforcer named Molly played by a very unassuming very chilling Joe Don Baker and John Vernon plays the banker who on account of Varrick seems to have deceived the mob.There is a whole heap of brutality in Charley Varrick so much that I'm amazed by its relatively kind PG rating regardless of what ratings meant early on as opposed to now. But its violence is less a disquieting likeness of any familiar reality than an important element of the maneuvering of action melodrama in a pretend universe. The enjoyment in this robbersandrobbers action drama is not vicious despite the fact that there are many nasty moments in it. Though Charley is resilient enough to walk away from his wife's death after the early robbery without betraying much sentiment the character is occupied perhaps even distorted by Matthau's trademark drollness and sympathy as an actor. If the character were inhabited by someone else Charley Varrick he and the film both would be something else completely.Excluding Charley and a sheriff played by Norman Fell who is practically an upright fellow everyone in the movie is essentially no good Charley's greedy young helper the Mafia hit man the bank owner and a photographer very well played by Sheree North who concentrates her efforts on making counterfeit passports on short notice. What makes all this so involving is that every character believes they are the main one. And they're so convincing about it that the story itself starts to wonder. Like a movie by Tarantino who sponged a line of dialogue Siegel has festooned the film with loads of rich bit roles including a forthcoming sexobsessed old lady but the action sequences give the film its function as well as its form.

Clint Eastwood Burt Reynolds Charles Bronson Steve McQueen Al Pacino Robert DeNiro Gene Hackman Roy Scheider it's unbelievable the number of great actors and enjoyable movies that came out of this decade. In this vein comes Charley Varrick an outstanding if unheralded movie in which Charley Varrick Matthau his wife and partner knock off a small town bank without realizing it is a drop for laundered Mafia money. Expecting a small heistthey instead get away with hundreds of thousands of dollars in Mob loot. They spend the film eluding both the cops AND the Mob with tragic consequences for most of those involved. Directed by Don Siegel Charley Varrick is well written well acted and very nicely paced. Present in the film are a number of great character actors of the 70's including Woodrow Parfrey Norman Fell William Schallert and one of my favorite small screen villains John Vernon who also appeared as The Mayor in Dirty Harry and Dean Wormer in Animal House.Andrew Robinson so outstanding in his role as crazed killer Scorpio in Dirty Harry isn't as magnetic here although his character plays well. Two people carry the film One is Joe Don Baker whose portrayal of sadistic hit man Molly is memorable. And Two Walter Matthau who skillfully portrays the title character. Matthau pulls off the difficult feat of allowing us to root for him despite the fact that he is a criminal whose actions resulted in the deaths of several people. He does so successfully because of his superior acting skills and because those who are after him are even more crooked than he is.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and stayed engrossed throughout. Also good is the music score by veteran film and TV composer Lalo Schifrin whose trademark style doesn't disappoint. Highly recommended film!!".

Varrick along with his partners rob a small New Mexico bank but instead of the usual decent haul they find that they have nabbed over 760.000 sadly for the boys it is mafia money that the bank was laundering. Varrick is a smart cookie and thinks it should be given back but his young greedy partner insists that it's a chance of a lifetime and convinces Varrick that they should keep the cash. This not only brings the law after them but also sadistic hitman for the mob Molly and he is cruelty personified. Can the boys flee the country in one piece?This is a delightful film that relies heavy on character development and strength of plot. Siegel gets fine performances from the supporting cast to back up the cunningly sedate lead turn from Matthau. As Siegel left Dirty Harry behind where 1973 saw the sequel Magnum Force released Ted Post directing the director gives us a complete opposite to the machismo of Harry Callahan. Matthau's Varrick is lowkey and hang dogged but below that sleepy exterior beats the heart of a cunning devil and he's the one with all the aces up his sleeves.Andy Robinson as Varrick's partner Harman Sullivan is all twitchy and on the edge whilst Joe Don Baker as hitman Molly is simply magnetic in his icy portrayal. Lalo Schifrin again scores for Siegel with great results and the photography from Michael Butler is very rich indeed as the locales seep with that bleached dried look. This is great storytelling with suspense and no little action the opening robbery and the finale involving a car and a plane joust are quality Siegel constructions but most of all it's a film to remind you that cinema can be great without crash bang wallop every ten minutes. An excellent heist and escape movie. 810".

Walter Matthau plays the title role of either title as the last independent pesticide pilot and the last independent err bank robber.  One day he hits the big time so it seems but the loot was apparently deposited by the Mafia.  Being chased by both police and the mob Charley Varrick has to be on his toes all the time.  Soon the police doesn't figure any more but the mob's harder to get rid of.Of course Don Siegel is a specialist of the action genre and again he provides a very fine specimen that never falters and always keeps us guessing right to the surprising end. Matthau's performance is absolutely brilliant obviously being helped by his expert sense of timing.  Since his other attempts in action thrillers were also quite convincing especially in The Taking of Pelham 123 it is rather puzzling why there weren't many more films exploiting this side of his talent.Inevitably one day Hollywood will give Charley Varrick the remake treatment  it is too good to be overlooked.

	schema:headline " Another Don Siegel Thriller Masterpiece  and Walter Matthau Shows What His Villains Might Have Done";
	schema:reviewBody "I always had a small wish now totally impossible to consider doing. Up to the time Cary Grant died in the 1980s I wished he Audrey Hepburn and Walter Matthau could have reshot the conclusion of CHARADES. Matthau played one of his excellent villains although with comic moments. But after 1964 Matthau won a place in our hearts as Whiplash Willy Gingrich Oscar Madison Horace Vandergelder and dozens of other curmudgeons. They were crooked at times and could be nasty  but they were nasty to the idiots that annoy us. So I reedited the end of CHARADES so that Walter Matthau remained Hamilton Bartholemew of the State Department and Cary Grant was Carson Dial. Matthau somehow blundering into saving Hepburn's Mrs. Lambert at the end would have been as memorable a conclusion as the actual film's end today  possibly more so.In 1964 Walter Matthau rarely played heroes. His wise television executive who tells off a destroyed but scheming Andy Griffith in A FACE IN THE CROWD was an exception. But afterward with a well deserved Oscar for Willy Matthau got better leading roles as well as film partnership with his perfect fencing mate Jack Lemmon.As one of the fans of the evil as well as the shadynice Matthau I have often wondered if he could have appeared as more of a conniver and schemer outside of Billy Wilder's films in his later career. The answer outside of Wilder is found in this film CHARLIE VARRICK. It is surprising that Matthau apparently disliked it but he may have felt that it was too mechanical thrillers like melodramas can be like that. But it enabled him to play a man who was not beyond planning or setting up deadly violence for his own sake. And he gets away with it in the end. This film suggests a possible career twist that Matthau never had to follow but could easily have been his had the motion picture business of the 1960s 2000 been run like it had been run in the heyday of the studios. Just like the typecasting of Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre one can imagine the typecasting of Walter Matthau in such roles as Charlie Varrick back in the 1930s  1950s.Varrick and his wife had been in a daredevil airplane act for years but found less and less jobs. So they turn with their mechanic and Harmon Sullivan  Andy Robinson into small town bank robbers. But the bank they rob turns out to be a nightmare. There is a shoot out with unexpected local police headed by William Schallert. Schallert is wounded and a deputy killed but so was Varrick's old mechanic and Varrick's wife. Varrick is able to transfer himself and the bank loot and Harmon to a truck and Harmon blows up the getaway car. Varrick and Harmon go to their home in a trailer park and discovers that the money in the bags is far more than the 10000.00 or so they expected it is more like 750000.00. When Varrick hears of the robbery report on the news he learns a much smaller amount is reported stolen. Varrick soon realizes it is an illegal bank  a Mafia drop off bank. In the meantime a hitman named Molly Joe Don Baker in a wonderful sociopath performance has been hired by the Mob to go after the thieves. But he has considered that it is odd that the bank robbery occurred when it did  just after the Mob sent so much money to the bank for money laundering purposes. He tells his contact Benson Fong of his suspicions and Fong and he agree to include the head of the bank John Vernon as a leading suspect. Varrick has problems with his partner Harmon who wants the money split now wise old Charlie realizes they have to wait at least ten years to do it safely and they have to spend it very slowly not to raise any suspicions. Harmon warns Charlie not to cross him. Charlie disgusted and angry says Okay Harmon you're calling the shots. He subsequently leaves a drunken Harmon with no clothes and no money. Harmon can't do anything because he may be targeted now by the mob.Varrick sets things up to hide his own identity tampering with his dental records and switching his records with Harmon's whose file he removes. He starts studying the situation and notes the involvement of the bank President his local representative Woodrow Parfrey and Molly. Varrick decides to manipulate the mobsters into destroying Harmon and each other. And due to the personalities of the characters involved Varrick triumphs in the end.One can just imagine  thinking of Matthau's cleverness and ruthlessness in this plot  how he could have been the antihero of a series of B features in an earlier period of film history.You have to watch it to appreciate the Don Siegel touch as well such as the scene where John Vernon frightens Woodrow Parfrey with images of torture with an electric cattle prod and the various scenes of Molly's handling characters like a crippled wheelchair bound informant. Events mesh effortlessly into each other and there is no wasted time. This is one thriller that never loses it's effectiveness.".

	onyx:emotionText "I always had a small wish now totally impossible to consider doing. Up to the time Cary Grant died in the 1980s I wished he Audrey Hepburn and Walter Matthau could have reshot the conclusion of CHARADES. Matthau played one of his excellent villains although with comic moments. But after 1964 Matthau won a place in our hearts as Whiplash Willy Gingrich Oscar Madison Horace Vandergelder and dozens of other curmudgeons. They were crooked at times and could be nasty  but they were nasty to the idiots that annoy us. So I reedited the end of CHARADES so that Walter Matthau remained Hamilton Bartholemew of the State Department and Cary Grant was Carson Dial. Matthau somehow blundering into saving Hepburn's Mrs. Lambert at the end would have been as memorable a conclusion as the actual film's end today  possibly more so.In 1964 Walter Matthau rarely played heroes. His wise television executive who tells off a destroyed but scheming Andy Griffith in A FACE IN THE CROWD was an exception. But afterward with a well deserved Oscar for Willy Matthau got better leading roles as well as film partnership with his perfect fencing mate Jack Lemmon.As one of the fans of the evil as well as the shadynice Matthau I have often wondered if he could have appeared as more of a conniver and schemer outside of Billy Wilder's films in his later career. The answer outside of Wilder is found in this film CHARLIE VARRICK. It is surprising that Matthau apparently disliked it but he may have felt that it was too mechanical thrillers like melodramas can be like that. But it enabled him to play a man who was not beyond planning or setting up deadly violence for his own sake. And he gets away with it in the end.

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Winner's Chato's Land of 1972 starring the great late Charles Bronson and the equally grand Jack Palance who also passed away recently is a toughminded and violent English Western which should not be missed and a mustsee for every Bronson fan. Director Winner who is most famous for his violent 1974 cult classic Death Wish is certainly one of the masters of uncompromising revenge cinema and Chato's Land Winners first collaboration with Bronson is one of the movies which have rightly earned him this reputation.When halfbreed Apache Pardon Chato Bronson shoots a racist Sheriff in self defense in a Saloon local men form a posse to catch him in order to hang him as soon as possible. The posse is lead by former Confederate Captain Quincy Whitmore who is more keen on the manhunt just for the good old times than out of hate towards Chato. The sadistic Hooker brothers who have also joined the posse however hate Indians of any kind and they don't have the slightest scruples of doing anything to make the fugitive pay for defending himself. As the posse members get deeper and deeper into the desert of Indian territory however they have to find out that they might have underestimated their opponent. This is Chato's land and in Chato's land the hunters can quickly become the hunted...The acting in Chato's Land is great Charles Bronson who hardly says a word fits perfectly into his role. Jack Palance is superb in his role of Capt. Quincy Whitmore and I couldn't imagine anybody else but Bronson and Palance to play the leading parts in this. Simon Oakland and Richard Johnson are also great in their ugly roles of Jubal Hooker and his psychopathic little brother Earl and the cast furthermore contains Richard Basehart. The film is very well photographed in the Spanish Almera certainly the best location for European Westerns.Chato's Land is a brutal toughminded and great Western which should not be missed by anybody who likes revenge movies. The performances are excellent and the movie is stunning raw and atmospheric from the beginning to the end. A mustsee for Charles Bronson fans Chato's Land is a great film. Highly recommended.".

Being set upon by the sadistic town Marshall Chato kills the lawman in self defense and must run from a posse of the town's people led by Jack Palance as Quincy Whitmore. Palance is excellent as Whitmore an exConfederate officer who still longs after the excitement that comes from waging war. Leading the town's men in pursuit of Chato Whitmore is decked out in his Confederate officer's jacket and plummed hat. Along with Whitmore is Nye Buell Basehart dressed in top hat and frock coat offering his whiskey laden salty commentary along the way. Simon Oakland also does a fine job as Jubal Hooker the vicious elder of the degenerate Hooker clan who takes control of the posse from Quincy and ultimately cause the death of several of the posse members.This movie has some beautifully set scenery that captures the harshness of the desert land that Chato takes refuge in. Whitmore comments that the harsh land is something that a white man would just damn off to hell and forget but to Chato who doesn't ask much or take much from the land it is almost a living thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Did anyone notice that Charlie made 2 of his best maybe his best pictures one after another both directed by Michael Winner who did some more nice entries in the Bronson catalog both scored by Jerry Fiedling superbly if I may add CHATO'S LAND and THE MECHANIC from whom Tarantine chose to quote in Kill Bill II ??!! I must have watched both movies app. half a dozen times and they seem to get better with every viewing despite knowing its ending! First these are films made for men not children or familyviewing. And let's be honest if you wanna see a good though well played movie today what you're gonna do?? Certainly not go to the cinema were you see noisy trashy highbudget trash in a row. You buy yourself a DVD or watch some latenight viewing of a 70ies movie on TV! And these two movies are certainly as good as it can get! Second these movies are more less silent! You don't hear some silly dialog through it all but just men saying a few words when it's really needed. Those people who talk a lot in such movies are happily the first ones that gonna be shot and it's good this way! Everybody's always pointing out who little Arnold is saying in TERMINATOR of course the first one a real good movie too! Well get yourself CHATO'S LAND. In the German dubbed version good old Charlie God bless him! spoke less than 10 words in German and maybe another dozen or so in some tribal language that's it! I'd take a bet that there is most likely no other nonsilent movie every made in which the hero says as few words as in this one!! And while we're at comparing it to SchwarzeneggerTerminator did anybody notice those MUSCLES of Charlie??!! And these are certainly no anabolicstuff but real hard  honest earned ones! If we'd take Charlie in his prime when he made this one he was HALF A CENTURY OLD  50 years!!! and compare it to Schwarzenegger when he was 50 not that long ago ... I'd say Charlie would have wiped the carpet with him should there have been any reason for an argument. I'd just wish I'd have looked that well when I was 30 not to speak of being 50 not yet.The guy is just SO COOL in this movie as well as in THE MECHANIC and many more in fact! OK I hear the critics saying this is just a silly revengemovie note made before DEATH WISH I !!. Nope it ain't !! First it's not that important what the story is what really counts is how it is delivered movieexperts doing what they can at the highest level! It's just GREAT to watch them delivering all the expected scenes without getting whimsical talky or making compromises. This is a men's movie made for men! And second it's not stupid at all! Why does everybody has to go on his knees in front of authorities the sheriff? Esp. if you're part of a badly treated minority! He's on his own when a big crowd invades HIS LAND like the USA did in Vietnam and he wipes them off. He knows the land better than everybody else he's trained and intelligent the followers are more stupid but not completely so he does what he has to do. At the end the winner is logical and probably that's the movie Mr. Bush should have watched before entering the Iraque ...OK back to the movie. What about the acting? Wooden??? Come on it ain't it's just perfect for this movie!! Would you like to see some whattheycallactortoday say Adrien Brody who wasn't too convincing in KING KONG either delivering this?? It would just be strangeridiculous. And the other members of the crew? Just perfect! Palance superb as always but he should have avoided City Slickers Basehart and Whitmore great! Just the kinda support crew one needs and which is simply nonexistent today and which is sadly missed!.One critic complained about the cheap look ?? of the movie and that it must have been inexpensive to make. Well so what? First blockbusters suck anyway every 2 minutes an explosion is just noisy and boring but obviously expensive anyway and the scenery is in fact superbly chosen! It's just THE MAN the scenery and his doomed followers. The land is as bleak as the fate of the followershunters. It's empty it's pure it's honest it's something for desertrats.  So to sum up you can't chose better for a great action movie of the 70ies and that'w when most of the great actions movies were made!.Moreless the same can be said about THE MECHANIC tough nottalky thrilling superbly shot and acted great support cast too and what an ending !!! I'd LOVE to see these out on DVD with much bonus material scenes from the set one of Carlies too rare interviews well the guy stayed silent when there was not much too say smile although I would love him to still be among us and write some great autobiography!!What a loss but then again he's hopefully having superb times wherever he's now!".

	onyx:emotionText "Did anyone notice that Charlie made 2 of his best maybe his best pictures one after another both directed by Michael Winner who did some more nice entries in the Bronson catalog both scored by Jerry Fiedling superbly if I may add CHATO'S LAND and THE MECHANIC from whom Tarantine chose to quote in Kill Bill II ??!! I must have watched both movies app. half a dozen times and they seem to get better with every viewing despite knowing its ending! First these are films made for men not children or familyviewing. And let's be honest if you wanna see a good though well played movie today what you're gonna do?? Certainly not go to the cinema were you see noisy trashy highbudget trash in a row. You buy yourself a DVD or watch some latenight viewing of a 70ies movie on TV! And these two movies are certainly as good as it can get! Second these movies are more less silent! You don't hear some silly dialog through it all but just men saying a few words when it's really needed. Those people who talk a lot in such movies are happily the first ones that gonna be shot and it's good this way! Everybody's always pointing out who little Arnold is saying in TERMINATOR of course the first one a real good movie too! Well get yourself CHATO'S LAND. In the German dubbed version good old Charlie God bless him! spoke less than 10 words in German and maybe another dozen or so in some tribal language that's it! I'd take a bet that there is most likely no other nonsilent movie every made in which the hero says as few words as in this one!! And while we're at comparing it to SchwarzeneggerTerminator did anybody notice those MUSCLES of Charlie??!! And these are certainly no anabolicstuff but real hard  honest earned ones! If we'd take Charlie in his prime when he made this one he was HALF A CENTURY OLD  50 years!!! and compare it to Schwarzenegger when he was 50 not that long ago ... I'd say Charlie would have wiped the carpet with him should there have been any reason for an argument. I'd just wish I'd have looked that well when I was 30 not to speak of being 50 not yet.The guy is just SO COOL in this movie as well as in THE MECHANIC and many more in fact! OK I hear the critics saying this is just a silly revengemovie note made before DEATH WISH I !!. Nope it ain't !! First it's not that important what the story is what really counts is how it is delivered movieexperts doing what they can at the highest level! It's just GREAT to watch them delivering all the expected scenes without getting whimsical talky or making compromises. This is a men's movie made for men! And second it's not stupid at all! Why does everybody has to go on his knees in front of authorities the sheriff? Esp. if you're part of a badly treated minority! He's on his own when a big crowd invades HIS LAND like the USA did in Vietnam and he wipes them off. He knows the land better than everybody else he's trained and intelligent the followers are more stupid but not completely so he does what he has to do. At the end the winner is logical and probably that's the movie Mr. Bush should have watched before entering the Iraque ...OK back to the movie. What about the acting? Wooden??? Come on it ain't it's just perfect for this movie!! Would you like to see some whattheycallactortoday say Adrien Brody who wasn't too convincing in KING KONG either delivering this?? It would just be strangeridiculous. And the other members of the crew? Just perfect! Palance superb as always but he should have avoided City Slickers Basehart and Whitmore great! Just the kinda support crew one needs and which is simply nonexistent today and which is sadly missed!.One critic complained about the cheap look ?? of the movie and that it must have been inexpensive to make. Well so what? First blockbusters suck anyway every 2 minutes an explosion is just noisy and boring but obviously expensive anyway and the scenery is in fact superbly chosen! It's just THE MAN the scenery and his doomed followers. The land is as bleak as the fate of the followershunters. It's empty it's pure it's honest it's something for desertrats.  So to sum up you can't chose better for a great action movie of the 70ies and that'w when most of the great actions movies were made!.Moreless the same can be said about THE MECHANIC tough nottalky thrilling superbly shot and acted great support cast too and what an ending !!!

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1972 Chato's Land is typically written off as lame Spaghetti Western with Charles Bronson but actually it's a UK production shot in Spain Mexico and Arizona. And secondly there's more depth here than the onedimensional racistrevenge plot might first lead you to believe.I'll admit that I was turned off to this movie for years due to Brian Garfield's scathing review in his excellent book Western Films where he called it cheesy dreary phony but an openminded and honest viewing proves him wrong. Yes it's dreary but it's not cheesy or phony. It's true that the desolate Spanish locations are phony in that it's not the American Southwest but other than that the characters and dialogue ring true.The plot is simple Chato a halfbreed Indian Charles Bronson shoots an arrogant racist lawman in a saloon and a large posse is assembled where they chase Chato in his own element which is why it's called Chato's Land. Bronson's role is taciturn onedimensional and almost invisible until the end where he's a stunning example of masculine strength. Amazingly Bronson was 50 yearsold during filming but he was in prime physical condition with not an iota of fat. Another reviewer commented that if he were 6'5 he would've made a perfect Conan the Barbarian.Bronson's striking presence and solemn performance is key to the success of the movie of course but the film's true strength is the writingdirecting and the stellar cast that make up the posse including Jack Palance Richard Basehart James Whitmore Simon Oakland Ralph Waite Richard Jordan and more. The group dynamics of the posse and their interplay is where the film shines. Four or five of the men are good men but they're too blinded by cultural bigotry toward a halfbreed to realize the injustice of their cause. It never occurs to them that Chato has rights and that the slain lawman was in the wrong. All they focus on is that a sheriff is dead and a halfbreed did it. Most of the rest of the posse are unlikable or repugnant particularly a character played by Richard Jordan and his father played by Simon Oakland.Due to their differences the loosely puttogether posse lacks solidarity. Some are hellbent on apprehending or killing Chato while others are rather halfhearted on the issue pretty much just doing a favor for the former Confederate Captain played by Palance. You have to listen closely because sometimes the dialogue isn't too clear but the quality writing brings these characters to life.Why does Chato become increasingly merciless as the story progresses? At first he does things to simply deter the group and provoke them to give up like destroy their water supply but at a certain point some of the members of the posse cross the line and do something particularly heinous not to mention utterly criminal proving that they are the true criminals and not Chato. Some of the members object which is respectable but not enough to stop the atrocities and so they become guilty by association. It's called cowardly condoning.As for the slightly ambiguous ending what's the point? Chato need not kill when Chato's land will do it for him. That's why it's called Chato's Land. The score is decent with a compelling percussive part but some aspects are too dated. An exceptional score would've propelled a good Western into greatness or neargreatness. Also some of the editing is too abrupt and awkward. Still despite its onedimensional plot Chato's Land is a quality Western. With all due respect Brian Garfield was wrong.The film runs 110 minutes but there are versions that cutout about four minutes of Rrated material.GRADE B".

	schema:reviewBody "Chato is a halfbreed Apache Indian who shoots a sheriff in selfdefense while in town and finds himself the target of a head hunting posse led by a former Confederate soldier Quincy Whitmore. They track Chato into his own harsh territory and they soon find that the tables have been turned. As now they're the ones trying to survive while being picked off one by one by Chato and braving the rough elements of Apache territory. This was the first feature to bring the pairing of director Michael Winner and actor Charles Bronson together in which they would go on to make another five films. Chato's Land is just like any other Winner exercise. This straightforward western tale comes across as crass and rather offbeat in its meanspirited tempo and bloodthirsty violence. Thanks mainly to Winner's always daring and hardboiled direction which is always more workmanlike than glitzy. Direction wise two solid lead performances Bronson and Palance and the intrusive handling of transporting you amongst blistering bonedry location is what keeps one interested. This is because the efficiently simple catandmouse plot hunters eventually become the hunted has very little structure to it and is tied along by airy pockets that can slow up the film's momentum. Within the bold context is a passionately thoughtful though quite blunt message that you could interpret about the intolerance of racism just listen to the crude dialogues that the thickly verbose script spits out and an allegory on the Vietnam War with the men underestimating their man on his turf. The characteristics between the hunting party behavioural changes and the character's turning on each other because of the stressful nature they are put into are reasonably dynamic with it sometimes getting rather sidetracked from the central focus of the narrative. The dialogues between them are quite heavy but on the other side of the coin. Charles Bronson gets very little to say even using some Indian tongue but still feels nicely fleshed out and tells the story with simple facial expressions and actions. When Winner wants to get down and gritty the elaborately relax pacing is broken up by excitingly sudden short bursts of conflict and the tense finale is perfectly fitting. Even a few surprises are illustrated into the dying half of the picture. The isolated atmosphere of the barren location only adds more to the anxiety created by their situation and there are stunning images captured on screen. The camerawork does get some singular shots interwoven within its sturdy foundation. A vintage sounding music score has that potently loud western twang that drenches the film with the right air. The performances are all particularly good. A terrific Jack Palance gives a classy stable depiction of Quincy Whitmore and Charles Bronson was in ripe condition and form as Chato. Making up the marvellous assemble were James Whitemore Simon Oakland and Richard Basehart. A competently wellfocused and quite brutal western that in the long run is nothing to get too worked up about. In saying that it's better than the norm.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the opening scene the story has a flavor of The Most Dangerous Game going for it. Pardon Chato Charles Bronson instead of being hunted by a determined posse looks more like the hunter in this revenge Western filmed in Spain. That should have been more than apparent to Captain Quincey Whitmore Jack Palance and his bunch even before Chato took his first victim it was easy enough to determine that Chato was leaving a trail for his pursuers to follow.What disappointed me here was the Jack Palance role in the latter part of the story. Captain Quincey was given ample opportunity to be a standup guy in a number of situations and he backed down each time. You could sense the Captain was wrestling in his own mind over what to do about the rape of Chato's wife for example but he gave the vicious members of his posse a pass to follow their own will. I would have expected a more principled leader to stand in opposition to the thugs thereby setting up a more momentous confrontation against the Apache half breed they were trailing.Even so Quincey's death scene after getting shot by Jubal Simon Oakland was pretty interesting. I believe it's the only one which I've seen where the guy who's about to die is still talking when his body gives out. And speaking of dying is there a more ignominious way to go than the way Jubal got his? Man three rocks to the head seemed pretty gruesome to me but the guy had it coming.As for Chato himself Bronson didn't need a whole lot of dialog to portray the cunning Indian. Other reviewers here have commented on Bronson's physique in the film quite impressive for his age and naturally ripped from whatever training regimen he might have followed away from the set. Bronson got to put his body on display in any number of vehicles and as a contrast I would point to two guest starring roles he had in TV shows a decade apart. He portrays a boxer in an episode of The Roy Rogers Show from 1952 called 'The Knockout' and again in a One Step Beyond Story from 1962 titled 'The Last Round'. The difference in his appearance is notable in that he's a lot more muscular and heavier in the latter vehicle looking almost as if he might have been using steroids. All conjecture since I have no way of knowing but here another decade later he has that natural looking physique toned by a rigorous exercise schedule.".

He portrays a boxer in an episode of The Roy Rogers Show from 1952 called 'The Knockout' and again in a One Step Beyond Story from 1962 titled 'The Last Round'. The difference in his appearance is notable in that he's a lot more muscular and heavier in the latter vehicle looking almost as if he might have been using steroids. All conjecture since I have no way of knowing but here another decade later he has that natural looking physique toned by a rigorous exercise schedule.";

	schema:reviewBody "Winner's astonishingly harsh western parable is an underappreciated genre classic. It's a flinthard and stone cold essay on racial intolerance and man's inhumanity to man. There is zero radiant warmth the characters and the landscape reflect only savagery and implacable abrasiveness. As the tale unfolds it becomes clear who the real savages are  and it's not the taciturn halfbreed Indian Chato Bronson but his hateful and spiritually ugly posse of pursuers led by exconfederate veteran Quincey Palance.Throughout the first half of the film Chato provides his enemies with the means to relinquish their quest turn back give up and go home with their lives intact. They choose to pursue their quarry escalating to violence murder and rape even turning upon each other thus becoming the architects of their own doom. The white man here is depicted as a cruel racist intellectuallychallenged barbarian full of selfrighteous hate. The Indian is a nobler being at home in the barren landscape concerned only with survival on his own terms.Goaded into killing a bigoted sheriff in a saloon showdown in the opening minutes Chato flees back to his homeland. The town notables take the law into their own hands form a posse and give chase. On the way they pick up supporters from local homesteads including the Hooker brothers a trio of grizzled terminally twisted rednecks. Quincey Whitmore an exsoldier leads the gang. For him it is a last chance to succeed in warfare where in the past he had been on the losing side of the confederacy. One more shot at glory one more campaign against an enemy force. As for the rest they are driven either by warped ideals of justice religion or a desire to impose their perceived masculine superiority over the Indian.Inevitably as his wife is raped and his brother murdered Chato turns on his antagonists and proceeds to hunt them down using guerrilla tactics for which they are no match. Capitalising on the terrain to his own advantage he systematically terrorises and kills his enemies or sees them turn against and kill each other.Winner's directorial style is primal basic perfectly suited to framing the minimalist narrative. For all his unflinching brutality and instinctive capacity to terrorise and kill Chato is a higher being in all respects compared to the whitetrash scum on his case. Bronson is perfectly cast as the monolithic native who simply is a force of nature in his own land.Politically as with so many movies released at the same time it is easy to discern parallels with the Vietnam War. America was fighting on the home turf of the Vietnamese and didn't stand a chance. As with Quincey they failed to understand their enemy outside of bias assumption and mythology. Quincey makes some pronouncements of what the Indian is how he thinks and functions and how he behaves. He miscalculates due to his own internal influences and manages to be only halfright on a good day.These days Michael Winner is portrayed in the media as a jovial buffoon and foodie snob  and in fairness he plays up this persona. It should not be forgotten that Winner was a director of some vision and status making key films in the swinging sixties that helped define that decade and then mapping out the genre of modern revengecinema in the seventies. Chato's Land is a prime example of his work and demands to be viewed in a fresh light by new audiences. The portrayal of human nature as a cruel and vindictive primordially antagonistic entity has rarely been so tellingly achieved on screen.".

Listen to this fabulous cast of recognizable veteran character actors which accompany Whitmore on this journey..Simon Oakland Ralph Waite Richard Jordan James Whitmore Victor French and Richard Basehart. Other actors tagging along are William Watson Paul Young and Roddy McMillan.Jubal HookerOaklanddecides he and his boys Elias and EarlWaite and Jordan will tag along to find that halfApache relishing the thought of hanging an Injun. Racists them all pretty rough around the edges and foul in demeanor and attitude. Earl keeps his mind of the ladies while always having to start up something with the posse's Mexican scout. When members of the possemainly Elias and Earlfind Chato's home his squaw inside they rape and molest her leaving the woman's naked body tied out in the open as bait for her mate. This act along with the eventual murder of Chato's Apache comradewho helps tend to his home hanging him upside down setting his body on fire will be the posse's downfall. You see for most of the film before this act Chato was just tormenting and teasing them. He'd shoot some of their horses or stab open their water bags. But when they resort to violence in order to draw him out Chato will respond in kind. We watch as Jubal and Elias become tyrannical in their desire to find and kill Chato after Earl goes out looking for the squaw saved by her mate getting himself mutilated for his heinous actions regarding the rape for which he was an active enthusiastic participant..when Quincey speaks of turning back when catching Chato seems futile the Hookers pull a gun on him shooting down two who attempt to leave in cold blood. The rape of Chato's squaw and murder of his friend sealed their fates.As impressively shot by cinematographer Robert Payntera veteran director of photography he shot many of Winner's early work including THE MECHANIC the sun downs are particularly aweinspiringly beautiful while the days look unforgiving and treacherous land which seemed to have been forgotten by God only Chato it seems could live on it. We see that the white man can not survive on this land never at any point one step ahead of Chato truly at his mercy. And that's really the point these men start out with great confidence their heads held high believing that Chato will be caught by nightfall further following the halfbreed into the sunbaked abyss. We see that this posse begin to tear at one another their camaraderie and swagger deteriorating the longer they remain in pursuit of Chato doubt and fear starting to flower. Especially disconcerting for them is how Chato picks them off systematically not in a hurry gallantly riding his horse mostly overhead peering down at the posse using his surroundings as a tool against the group wiser and more restrained. Not halting the rape in my mind costs the entire group even if some of the posse didn't participate in the act..in allowing it to continue each is just as guilty and must pay with their life. I was a bit disappointed we never get to see Chato and Quinceyor Chato and Jubal for that matterface off but even if they had we know what the outcome would've been. Once Earl was found with his crotch destroyed by fire Jubal would not allow this to go unabated and his mania is the upending of the posse's efforts. As is often the case when things don't go according to plan usually dissension and friction develop until members of the posse are at each other's throats. This is not the traditional western many grew up watching it casts white man in a negative light while the Apache is presented as smart brave and ingenious in his cunning. Using the Hookers as an example we see white man as the savages instead of the Injuns often depicted as such.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's a little injoke that's included in Pardon Chato's Charles Bronson only line spoken in English and that occurs in about the second minute of this savagely entertaining story about vigilantism running amok somewhere in the Old West.We see Chato at the saloon bar waiting to get his whiskey when in comes the local Marshall Endersby Jacob Meade looking to kill himself an uppity mestizo. So here's the injoke just before the Marshall draws to shoot Chato says Back off lawman! Then he spins quickly shooting from the hip to kill the Marshall. It's a joke because the director Michael Winner in 1971 had already filmed a story called Lawman by the same screen writer Gerald Wilson in which a Marshall hunts down a group of men  relentlessly mercilessly and legally. Note that Lawman is more highly regarded at IMDb than Chato's Land.Anyway the story of Chato is double joke here the Marshall is out of the picture no pun intended immediately and the hunters  the Posse Commitatus a mixed bunch of misfits headed up by either exCaptain Whitmore Jack Palance or Jubal Hooker Simon Oakland depending on how the plot unfolds  become the hunted when Chato begins the task of killing them  relentlessly mercilessly...but illegally in this story. Oh Chato has the moral high ground many would argue but objectively any court would find him guilty of manslaughter at the very least. And man what a slaughter it is! But this is the Old West where just about anything goes.The story has many antecedents about which Winner and Wilson would have been well aware The Bravados 1958 with Gregory Peck as the hunter Hombre 1967 with Paul Newman as the despised mestizo and Valdez is Coming 1971 with Burt Lancaster as the hunter and a Mexican to boot. You could probably add to that list. This film adds to it of course as being just another take on the good ol' American pastime of vigilantes racing off to git themselves a hangin' afore nightfall if possible. In that regard and if you have seen it you shouldn't miss watching the heartbreak in The Oxbow Incident 1943 with Henry Fonda heading up an allstar cast who tries to stop the west's favorite method of dispensing rough justice.The best part about Chato's Land is the land the stark unforgiving country that Chato uses to his advantage. Winner makes good use of long wide angle shots to emphasize the harsh bleak landscape but his studied closeups of the characters are often almost works of art. Of the cinematography I can only complain of the lighting  a good lot of the shoot was completed in pseudodarkness using blue filters no doubt and was quite annoying at times. Editing is up to par though and Jerry Fielding's music is suitably moody  although I could have done without the militarytype snippets.After speaking that one English line Chato sticks to Apache or is silent throughout as he gets on with his task. So it's nice to see a man happy in his work and who doesn't bother us with useless talk.Highly recommended for all fans of Bronson and Palance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chato's Land was a pleasant surprise due to its mixed reception and that the type of film that it falls under is not always my thing I was not expecting an awful lot. But seeing as the cast was a good one on paper I thought why not? Chato's Land is not going to be for everybody it's very gritty and violentsome of it being not for the fainthearted the most memorable of it actually being very brutal and Michael Winner's films are the kind that will entertain some and not be others' cup of tea.The film is a touch overlong and gets a bit draggy in spots while the ending is rather abrupt and rushed sure it was intended to be ambiguous but for me there was the feeling of uncertainty of how to end it and the dayfornight lightingshooting is awfully obvious. Jerry Fiedler's music score compliments the film well and dynamically orchestrated but could have had a more sweeping punch and with less of a TV series and workmanlike pace. However Chato's Land was a pretty good film apart from the dayfornight it's reasonably well made with splendidly gritty scenery and handsome photography that suits the atmosphere. Chato's Land is also very intelligently scripted with some remarkably literate dialogue the direction from Michael Winner is above competent at least pacing and technicallywise and the story mostly is wellpaced and compelling.In terms of action that in Chato's Land is sparse but when it does appear it really does pack a punch. For an actionWestern film what was really impressive about Chato's Land was the way the characters are written. The characters here are very interesting and with plenty of layers Captain Whitmore is a very multifaceted character and perhaps the most multifaceted role of Jack Palance's career. The great performances helpapart from for my tastes the hammy one of Richard Jordan Charles Bronson has rarely looked better and brings a real commanding charisma every time he appears very telling even when not saying very much. James Whitmore Richard Basehart Simon Oakland and Ralph Waite give solid support but best of all is Jack Palance who is superb in one of his better and more layered performances.Overall far from perfect and not for everybody's tastebuds but a pretty good film. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Chato's Land is directed by Michael Winner and written by Gerry Wilson. It stars Charles Bronson Jack Palance James Whitmore Simon Oakland Richard Baseheart Ralph Waite and Richard Jordan. Shot on location in Andalucia Spain with photography by Robert Paynter it's musically scored by Jerry Fielding. Plot finds Bronson as half Apache Pardon Chato who is forced to kill the local sheriff in self defence and finds himself being hunted by a town posse led by Captain Quicey Whitmore Palance. However as the posse trail him into the wilderness it becomes apparent that the tables have been turned with Chato given further cause to inflict harm upon his pursuers.The first of six collaborations between Charles Bronson and Michael Winner Chato's Land finds the pair setting the marker for what would define their work. With the Western genre going thru a resurgence Chato's Land is very inkeeping with the type of Western that was being released in the early 70's namely violent uncompromising and certainly gritty. These things as history now shows were tailor made for Winner who perfectly utilises Bronson's silent and brooding assets to great effect.Often suspected to be an allegory of the United States' involvement in Vietnam it's thematically correct in that respect. But the timing of the film would suggest this to not be the case. Chato's Land is more than just a revenge Western a film about white men out of their usual terrain being pursued by a man of a different ethnicity it wants to and does quite well be a picture dealing in racism violence and the folly of hypocritical justice. But even tho Wilson's script brings these issues to light they are not fully formed with Winner at times dragging the film to a standstill. However the group dynamic is a good one with the inevitable character differences creating a tinderbox waiting to ignite while Winner doesn't skimp over the violence puncturing the narrative with savage thrusts.Bronson was 50 years old when making the film his physicality here is very impressive. The role of Chato is hardly a stretch for him in fact it's very much a perfect fit. He's basically asked to be a phantom in the landscape but he casts an imposing presence each time he's called on to deliver some Chato justice. In pursuit are a mixed bunch of actors with Palance Whitmore and Baseheart the obvious professional standouts while Simon Oakland leaves an indelible mark as grizzled father of the Hooker boys Jubal. Fielding's The Wild Bunch score is efficient but workmanlike and Paynter's Lawman photography never really makes the landscape as imposing as it should be. Overall it's a mixed bag but for fans of revenge type Westerns and Palance it's easy to recommend but it still should have been more intelligent than it ultimately is. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoy this movie. In 1971 director Michael Winner and writer Gerald Wilson combined for Lawman in which Burt Lancaster's Marshal Maddox hunts down a group of men. In 1972 Winner and Wilson again paired for Chato's Land in which Charles Bronson's Chato hunts down a group of men. Ralph Waite Richard Jordan and William Watson were among the unfortunates in both films.Both are good films. But what is unique about Chato's Land is that the movie is carried almost entirely by the supporting cast. Though billed as a Charles Bronson movie Bronson's role is actually quite small. He has very few lines and is seldom even seen. We know the posse is being stalked by a generally unseen Apache. In the few scenes where that Apache is on camera it is Bronson. But that role could even have been played by an unknown actor without affecting the quality of the movie.In actuality the movie is about the posse. The lead roles are Jack Palance and Simon Oakland. The principal supporting roles are played by Ralph Waite James Whitmore and Richard Jordan. The posse also includes familiar faces in Richard Basehart and Victor French. The personalities of the posse are well drawn out. The movie is essentially about what happens to them as they go from hunters to hunted. The actions of some of the posse members when they attack a woman are horrible. The others are at fault for not stopping it even though it disgusted them. All paid a price.Some are evil some are noble some are weak. Palance's character is interesting. He is a respected former confederate officer who assumes command of the posse but slowly comes to realize he has no control over these civilians and watches helplessly as things disintegrate around him. Oakland's character is the most vile violent of the group. He seems to endorse Palance as the posse's leader only as long as things are done as he wants. And it is interesting when Palance quietly realizes that it is actually Oakland and not himself who is the real leader of the posse at which time he avoids a confrontation and continues to act as the posse's leader by doing what he knows Oakland wants him to do. It is a well crafted script. Bronson is on screen only enough to remind us that he is in the film. Had the movie been accurately billed as a film starring Jack Palance and Simon Oakland with Bronson in a small role few would have paid to see it. Which would have been unfortunate because it's a good movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "After virtually inaugurating the British Western with 1970's Lawman director Michael Winner returned to the quintessential American genre in 1971 for this film again scripted by Gerald Wilson.  Wilson would be the scripter for many of the director's 1970s films.  For Chato's Land they managed to attract star Charles Bronson in the decade of his peak popularity.  Winner and Bronson would work together many times over the next 15 years most notably perhaps for Death Wish.The intention of this Western was to debunk the genre's notion of the validity of the social compact upon which social order is founded ie. Patriarchy. Winner showed law and justice as emerging out of pettiness and boredom instead of any greater good.  Thus the traditional cowboy hero and lawman was a mere sadistic thug with Indian Bronson being Winner's noble savage using what Winner suggests is an innate violence to protect himself and his property.  In that respect one can see the influence of Sam Peckinpah.Winner depicts Patriarchal codes as revealing only the base bestial nature of man.  And he does so with a gleeful relish that borders on sensationalism.  Thus the scaled to essentials plot of a Posse chasing down a renegade Indian is a vehicle for the bitter condemnation of the American heritage.  The brutality of both sides makes the film an intriguing companion piece of sorts to Robert Aldrich's much praised Vietnam allegory Ulzana's Raid which was released about the same time.  However it is unlikely that Winner will ever be accorded the same status as Aldrich.To Winner cinema is inherently sensationalist and he lingers on every unpleasant detail with lurid and distorted angles.  Justice is a concept here equated much as in Aldrich's film with a sport a hunt and kind of boy's night out with the guns.  But further than that Winner suggests that justice is ironically based on the need to counter or indulge man's inherently brutal nature prone to sadism and revenge.  It is an amoral and cynical film wherein Winner takes the themes of his previous Western about a man obsessed with the law to the point where he becomes a danger and shuffles them in favour of the outlaw.  Jack Palance's vile lawman in Chato's Land is the end result of Burt Lancaster's character in Lawman. Justice is personalized and twisted into violent expression.This film like most Michael Winner films has very little critical reputation behind it but has a stark raw quality that borders on the exploitational.  What is perhaps disturbing is the humour with which violence especially sexual violence is treated by Winnerwho seeks to make the audience participate in such violation but not for moral aims just for kicks.".

	schema:reviewBody "It may sound clich but this is how this western starts. Charles Bronson plays Chato an Apache Indian who captures and breaks wild horses with one other Indian to eke out a living for himself his wife and his young son. Chato's is a simple life living off the land deep in the Apache territory and only coming in town by himself to receive payment for the horses he breaks for the white man.Obviously there is racism for the red Indian and in this case the local sheriff does not take kindly to an Indian expecting to get a drink in the local town's saloon. When the sheriff tells Chato to leave or be killed on the spot a gunfight ensues and the sheriff is left dead as a door nail. So a large posse of cowboys is gathered each with their own purpose for chasing Chato with a posse's mind set and intent to just hang another worthless wild Indian. Chato on the other hand is more intrigued by the posse chasing him than he is worried about what they would do to him if they ever caught him and he shows no sign of fear. As the chase begins we see Chato just wants to have a little fun with the dumb cowboys who are out of their element in Apache territory. Very quickly though the fun turns ugly when the posse stumbles upon Chato's own farm. The wild and uncontrollable animals that some of the posse are leads them to gang rape Chato's wife and hog tie her to a post outside so that Chato will have no choice but to come in to the open to rescue his wife. For good measure the posse also hangs Chato's Apache farm hand upside down and they burn his body at the stake. The director Michael Winner puts together a terrific film supported by first class actors such as Jack Palance Simon Oakland Ralph Waite and James Whitmore who are all members of the posse chasing Chato. If you are a Charles Bronson fan as I am then this is Bronson at his very best. Chato is a quiet and unassuming Apache Indian whose actions speak much louder than his words. In fact in this film Chato says more in his native Apache tongue to the audience then he does in English. One by one Chato seeks and gains his revenge and as all wild animals usually do the posse also start to turn on one another when things don't go the way they expected it would turn out. As James Whitmore states to the posse leader Jack Palance during one particular scene while out in the wilderness I have an awful feeling Quincey that this hunt is not going to end well. We should turn around and head back while we can. One by one we want to see how Chato will seek his revenge on the posse who killed his farm hand by burning him to death and who gang raped his wife. No longer is this fun for Chato but Chato is all business as he does in fact complete his systematic revenge. This is a great western without any computer graphic interfaceCGI effects that are so common today. No this 1972 classic western directed superbly by Michael Winner relies on a good story line a cast of great actors and some wide open spaces to get you in the mood for a western that will always be considered one of Charles Bronson's best performances.No wonder than that director Michael Winner went on to direct Charles Bronson in the block buster films that followed such as the Mechanic and Death Wish 1  2. Yup they don't make westerns like this one anymore. Too Bad. I gave it an 8 out of 10 rating.".

No this 1972 classic western directed superbly by Michael Winner relies on a good story line a cast of great actors and some wide open spaces to get you in the mood for a western that will always be considered one of Charles Bronson's best performances.No wonder than that director Michael Winner went on to direct Charles Bronson in the block buster films that followed such as the Mechanic and Death Wish 1  2. Yup they don't make westerns like this one anymore. Too Bad. I gave it an 8 out of 10 rating.";

Chato's Land is one of those movies that you have to watch From The Very Beginning! It starts with the towns sheriff going into the saloon. At the same time Chato plucks a coin down for a taste. The bartender takes the bottle pours a couple. I won't repeat what the sheriff says to Chato . . . but in a nutshell Chato is Forced to defend himself  adios Sheriff Eli Saunders. Chato rides quickly out of town . . .  here is where i'm going to leave it. What happens to the men who hunt him down is what drives this movie ....almost from start to finish. It's unfortunate that movie hasn't gotten any good if not better reviews. In my opinion the cinematography is wonderfully photographed  Beautiful . . . with the exceptions of the saguaros notice how they bend when the wind kicks up. Chato's Land is one of those rarities that is actually Western with all the Dirt Grit  Horses. The Cast is Excellent ! Jack Palance Richard Basehart Simon Oakland Victor French and the many others I didn't mentioned work so well with each other in this movie. but be prepared for some of the language . . . An Excellent addition to Any movie collection ! Thank You M. Winner for an Excellent Western!! I also found out that the Soundtrack is now available on CD!! Enjoy!!".

This is a banal teen movie with very few elements of originality the rivalry of two teenage girls who in the end manage to work together for the benefit of a greater good. I think the authors took everything bad from the American teen movies chewed it and spat it out. And this is how Alom.net came into being. The story is told in a poor language and the poorest possible performance of the actors maybe with the exception of Rkasi Kroly and Reviczky Gbor. However their skills and experience are simply not enough to save the film. The worst is the lead actress Labancz Lilla. I don't think she belongs to the guild of actors. She is very beautiful extremely lovely but with very little acting talent. On the other hand the whole movie is filled with beautiful wannabeBarbies extremely nice looking girls but none of them are above or near average as far as acting skills are concerned. The only edible thing in this picture is the soundtrack and perhaps the setting it was filmed by the Balaton lake Hungary".

Hungarian movies are really good it was a biggest mistake we've ever made and I really hope that we won't repeat it in the future.The worst Hungarian actors and actresses they're absolutely not qualified and the don't have any talent just nice faces and body were chosen to make a movie about something which is completely unimaginable in Hungary. All of the situations are as false as Lilla Labans boosts. Sorry but it's the truth Everything is idealized nothing can be imagined. Characters have no motivation and their biggest life goal is to dance without clothes in front of thousands of people. The worst is that with this movie it is transferred to all of the young girls that prostituting themselves is enough to become famous and successful. No the life is much more harder than the lom.net shows. Please forget to see it and delete from the Hungarian film hisory!".

Hungarian movies are really good it was a biggest mistake we've ever made and I really hope that we won't repeat it in the future.The worst Hungarian actors and actresses they're absolutely not qualified and the don't have any talent just nice faces and body were chosen to make a movie about something which is completely unimaginable in Hungary. All of the situations are as false as Lilla Labans boosts. Sorry but it's the truth Everything is idealized nothing can be imagined. Characters have no motivation and their biggest life goal is to dance without clothes in front of thousands of people. The worst is that with this movie it is transferred to all of the young girls that prostituting themselves is enough to become famous and successful. No the life is much more harder than the lom.net shows. Please forget to see it and delete from the Hungarian film hisory!";

	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to biopics there are usually two discernibly differentiated forms the film and the documentary. Of course when I use the word documentary I don't mean it literally but rather as a means to say that the approach its director takes it similar to those used by directors of documentaries. Che which comes in the shadow of a recent but very different cousin W. is such a movie that exists not to entertain or provide the viewer with any personal gratification outside of historical and biographical information on its central figure and topic. Where Oliver Stone decided to take a much more lighthearted human paintbrush to his canvas Steven Soderbergh here uses stern almost completely serious shades creating an informative and compelling account of a man that became a living icon in our modern culture. So like most of those that have come before it Che is a movie that is best appreciated under no pretence this is a history lesson disguised as film and while it does tell a good story those looking for entertainment best look away.Of course the icon that I refer to is quite obviously Cuban revolutionist Ernesto 'Che' Guevara here played by Benicio Del Toro a figure now embellished upon the memories of those with slightest interest in political history. If not then you probably have his face on a tshirt somewhere and you didn't know. Yet it doesn't matter how or why you know of Guevara before you view Che because Peter Buchman does a fine job of introducing you to him here. Plus coupled with a performance that never begs for attention but instead simply plays the man he's supposed to be portraying with no overt padding Del Toro goes a long way to giving Che the right amount of conviction that is needed to keep thing interesting and dynamic. Make no mistake this is no dramatization of the man's life so Del Toro never piles on the melodrama or anything to that degree to win over the audience and this is reflected not only through the movie's ensemble of performances but through the entire production itself.Had the feature remained its original singular five hour form however a different opinion may have been garnered but as it stands the movie does well on its own merit. Part One which details the initial struggle of the revolution of Cuba is less about Guevara and more about his cause under the leadership of Fidel Castro. Granted focus is shifted every now and again to set up part two's inevitable centralization upon Che himself but for the most part Part One remains more as a wideangled view on the movement in which Guevara was part of. This shift in focus does well to once again distance the movie away from mere speculative entertainment and more towards the form of an educational informant. Yes there are scenes that drag on and on and generally some of these seem superfluous and dubious to the overall arc of the production but for the most part the script and direction remains coherent in its willingness to merely document rather than emote.As a whole Che's first half is an unassuming picture. At first glance it isn't anything remotely special and probably won't provide viewers with any degree of resonance if they are not interested in the man and his people's struggle beforehand yet the same can be said for a number of similar features. Instead I can only recommend this to those who are interested in the revolution and don't mind slow paced attentiondemanding material that does entertain from time to time but only as a natural result of its historical importance. Again those looking for a character piece similar to Stone's portrayal of George W. Bush last year would be wise to reevaluate their will to see Che although titled after the man himself and a biopic on a purely ostensible level Che is more about his fight than the man himself. There are no real moments of personal insight here no cathartic revelations or studies of psyche. No instead the movie tells the facts as they were straight from the horses mouth and while they can sometimes work against the common desires of cinema goers' need for personal fulfillment if digested objectively can provide a strongly engaging interesting and informative piece of historically significant art.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

	schema:reviewBody "Che Part One felt very complete and fulfilling. I found myself looking at Ernesto Che Guevara as a very well rounded person. Not as an ideological self fulfilling man but as an articulate man with thought out rational decisions as well as a man with many useful talents.The acting of the cast all around was very good but Benicio Del Toro took the movie by storm but he did this in a very subtle way. His performance displayed how Che's spirit was able to superseded the hardships faced in the Cuban Revolution. It did not display any brutality or recklessness but a devotion to a cause. Del Toro's perforations was that worthy of an Oscar nomination but I don't think Che Guervara cared to much about awards.The directing by Steven Soderbergh was visually stunning at times with much of the scenes shot in the forest. What kept the movie upbeat though were the scenes of Che in New York giving interviews and addressing the U.N. It added an extra layer to the film allowing you to see another side of Che. The side in which he shows his political and speaking abilities. The writing was very good with the dialog always keeping you engrossed. The music though not much of it was very good and stayed within rhythm of the rest of the film.Overall the film succeeds in showing Che as a well rounded man never developing into oversimplified or unnecessarily complex portrayal of a man. The movie was very accurate and refused to take on a role of being inspiring or Hollywoodish which I enjoyed. The only problem with the film I had was that it seems to have a little too much of a feel of a war film rather than a biopic. Still I highly recommend this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ironically the most talkedabout American film in the 2008 New York Film Festival is 98 in Spanish. The extralong film's controversy began at the Cannes Festival. There were lovehate notices and considerable doubts about commercial prospects. As consolation the star Benicio Del Toro got the Best Actor award there. I'm talking about Steven Soderbergh's 'Che' of course. That's the name it's going by in this version shown in New York as at Cannes in two 2hourplus segments without opening title or end credits. 'Che' is certainly appropriate since Ernesto Che Guevara is in almost every scene. Del Toro is impressive hanging in reliably through thick and thin from days of glorious victory in part one to months of humiliating defeat in part two appealing and simpatico in all his varied manifestations even disguised as a bald graying man to sneak into Bolivia. It's a terrific performance one wishes it had a better setting.If you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours with an intermission between the two sections there are rewards. There's an authentic feel throughoutfortunately Soderbergh made the decision to film in Spanish though some of the actors oddly enough in the English segments especially are wooden. You get a good outline of what guerrilla warfare Che style was like the teaching the recruitment of campesinos the morality the discipline the hardship and the fightingas well as Che's gradual morphing from company doctor to fullfledged military leader. Use of a new 9pound 35 mmquality RED digital high performance cine camera that just became available in time for filming enabled DP Peter Andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold but at times still sing and are always sharp and smooth.The film is in two partsSoderbergh is calling them two films and the plan is to release them commercially as such. First is The Argentine depicting Che's leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of Havana in the late 50's and the second is Guerrilla and concerns Che's failed effort nearly a decade later in Bolivia to spearhead a revolution a fruitful mission that led to Guevara's capture and execution in 1967. The second part was to have been the original film and was written first and I think shot first. Producer Laura Bickford says that part two is more of a thriller while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes. Yes but both parts have a lot in commontoo muchsince both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country. Guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the Bolivian revolt was doomed from the start. The group of Cubans who tried to lead it didn't get a friendly reception from the Bolivian campesinos who suspected foreigners and thought of the Cuban communists as godless rapists. There is a third part a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of Che's speech at the United Nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time but that is intercut in the first segment. The first part also has Fidel and is considerably more upbeat leading as it does to the victory in Santa Clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba.During 'Guerilla' I kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality Europeanstyle miniseries which might begin with a shortened version of Walter Salles's 'Motorcycle Diaries' and go on to take us to Guevara's fateful meeting with Fidel in Mexico and enlistment in the 26th of July Movement. There could be much more about his extensive travels and diplomatic missions. This is far from a complete picture of the man his childhood interest in chess his lifelong interest in poetry the books he wrote even his international fame is only touched on. And what about his harsh cruel side? Really what Soderbergh is most interested in isn't Che but revolution and guerrilla warfare. The lasting impression that the 4 hours leave is of slogging through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the tyranny of the rich. Someone mentioned being reminded of Terrence Malick's 'The Tin Red Line' and yes the meandering episodic battle approach is similar but 'The Thin Red Line' has stronger characters hardly anybody emerges forcefully besides Che and it's a really good film. This is an impressive but unfinished and illfated effort.This 8yearsgestating heavily researched labor of love how many more Ocean's must come to pay for it? is a vanity project too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries. Radical editingor major expansionwould have made it into something more successful and as it is it's a long slog especially in the second half.It's clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down though it's not so clear what form the resulting film would have takenbut with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one.".

There's an authentic feel throughoutfortunately Soderbergh made the decision to film in Spanish though some of the actors oddly enough in the English segments especially are wooden. You get a good outline of what guerrilla warfare Che style was like the teaching the recruitment of campesinos the morality the discipline the hardship and the fightingas well as Che's gradual morphing from company doctor to fullfledged military leader. Use of a new 9pound 35 mmquality RED digital high performance cine camera that just became available in time for filming enabled DP Peter Andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold but at times still sing and are always sharp and smooth.The film is in two partsSoderbergh is calling them two films and the plan is to release them commercially as such. First is The Argentine depicting Che's leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of Havana in the late 50's and the second is Guerrilla and concerns Che's failed effort nearly a decade later in Bolivia to spearhead a revolution a fruitful mission that led to Guevara's capture and execution in 1967. The second part was to have been the original film and was written first and I think shot first. Producer Laura Bickford says that part two is more of a thriller while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes. Yes but both parts have a lot in commontoo muchsince both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country. Guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the Bolivian revolt was doomed from the start. The group of Cubans who tried to lead it didn't get a friendly reception from the Bolivian campesinos who suspected foreigners and thought of the Cuban communists as godless rapists. There is a third part a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of Che's speech at the United Nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time but that is intercut in the first segment. The first part also has Fidel and is considerably more upbeat leading as it does to the victory in Santa Clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba.During 'Guerilla' I kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality Europeanstyle miniseries which might begin with a shortened version of Walter Salles's 'Motorcycle Diaries' and go on to take us to Guevara's fateful meeting with Fidel in Mexico and enlistment in the 26th of July Movement. There could be much more about his extensive travels and diplomatic missions. This is far from a complete picture of the man his childhood interest in chess his lifelong interest in poetry the books he wrote even his international fame is only touched on. And what about his harsh cruel side? Really what Soderbergh is most interested in isn't Che but revolution and guerrilla warfare. The lasting impression that the 4 hours leave is of slogging through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the tyranny of the rich. Someone mentioned being reminded of Terrence Malick's 'The Tin Red Line' and yes the meandering episodic battle approach is similar but 'The Thin Red Line' has stronger characters hardly anybody emerges forcefully besides Che and it's a really good film. This is an impressive but unfinished and illfated effort.This 8yearsgestating heavily researched labor of love how many more Ocean's must come to pay for it? is a vanity project too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries. Radical editingor major expansionwould have made it into something more successful and as it is it's a long slog especially in the second half.It's clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down though it's not so clear what form the resulting film would have takenbut with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one.";

The story follows Che from his first meeting with Castro to the climactic battle in Santa Clara where Batista's army makes its last stand against the revolutionaries.This battle scene is filmed guerrilla warfare style in an urban environment with short bursts of action followed by silence as soldiers move into newerbetter positions. It all feels very tense and realistic which makes a nice change to the shaky cam explosion fests that we're used to. This style works well throughout the rest of the film but swaps the city for the jungle.The flash forward scenes where Che is interviewed and later addresses the United Nations help to give the story and Che more depth and background whilst giving us insights into his personality and ideology. Along with the battles these scenes also help to break up the slower parts of the film.Cinematography in the film is good and occasionally great with some stunning shots of the Cuban landscape. The black and white scenes are also well shot without feeling out of place.On another positive note Benicio Del Toro does an excellent job portraying Che. He is understated and believable as the man who wanted to change people's lives focused on doing what he thought was right.Unfortunately though I had trouble caring about or even remembering most of the other characters as dialogue between them isn't particular memorable. Sometimes you almost feel like you're watching a documentary that's trying to teach rather than entertain and this can start to wear especially when you're reading subtitles. Che may also be shown in a better light than some would like although honestly I feel the film is fairly accurate in its portrayal of the man and the history.I'd definitely recommend this film to anyone interested in Che or the events in Cuba. Even if at times things do get a little slow it's still a rewarding and informative experience.".

This is like a good few in the audience like yours truly. I didn't know much at all about Che except that he was involved with communist uprisings and revolutions was buddybuddy with Castro and died in executionstyle as a guerrilla that and his image appears on tshirts everywhere. What Soderbergh provides for an audience that will go to see it for what he will do with the project and what Benicio DelToro does with the character is that it's a history lesson made vibrant and urgent and passionate and according to the director in interviews and Q  A's honest portrayal of events.If this means that we may not get exactly a fully rounded portrait of its titular protagonisthero then that's probably the only real liability that the picture has. Maybe perhaps rightfully so Che wasn't a guy at least in his prime revolutionary years to be one that had much warmth or moments of doubt and if he had them they were behind closed doors and out of any record of diaries. So what we get in Part 1 the conventional Rise of the character in the story is the tale of how to do a revolution right or rather how to take over a government by military force and it's Che as a man who pretty quickly becomes a natural leader a stern taskmaster and also someone who loves as a revolutionary must Che says.It's gripping filmmaking nevertheless with Soderbergh commanding the narrative wonderfully between a colorfilmed partdigitalpart35mm Redcamera on the 19571959 events in Cuba and the 1964 trip to the UN in New York filmed in grainy black and white. What we get is part documentary and part biopic words straight from the guerrilla's mouth as it were and the events that led up to the takeover which serves as the climax of the picture in Santa Clara Cuba. Some of the elements as noted are conventional of just a war picture we get the young kids 16 and 14 who will do anything to fight with Guevara and his group we get the supposed love interest only thankfully muted with only one scene with small talk and we get the moments of enthusiasm humor camaraderie and unlikely bravery in the heat of battle.But most importantly we see Benicio delToro take command of this role like he does seemingly often but rarely with such force. In fact he probably elevates this Che past some possible pitfalls this project was actually his baby as he serves as coproducer and developed the project for years and makes him as human as he can be using Che's healthtic asthma to its fullest and reveling in going for broke as far as gusto and revelation go. For all of Soderbergh's command of the filmmaking style most of all for me during the climactic battle where we get to see him awesomely direct a battle sequence delToro for any scene he's in steals the show. If for nothing else whatever your political stance or thoughts on Che he's worth the admission. 8.510".

	schema:headline " TIFF 08 Homeland or deathChe Part 1 The Argentine";
	schema:reviewBody "Telling about the years from his fateful first encounter with the Castro brothers in Mexico to the end of the revolution The Argentine helps show how a young doctor became a Comandante respected and loved by a nation that was not even his. This was a man with ideals one who believed in the love of humanity justice and truth. He was a doctor above all else patching up the troops and making sure the people in every village they passed through had the care and attention they needed. He also was not afraid to lead the charge and stand at the frontlines without fear of death. One must live as though they have already died then the fear will be gone and you can do what is necessary for the cause. It is about the group and the country not about his survival. In his idealized communist beliefs he was fighting for Cuba and the only outcomes allowed were victory or his own destruction.Soderbergh's ambitions are evident right from the start. Although it mainly concerns the years between 19551962 he splices in events happening later on as Che visits the UN. Shot in black and white to help juxtapose against the sumptuous colors of our main action these future scenes comment on what is happening during the war cutting in to enhance the tale. There is a lot of structural jumping between the years each change titled with a date and place to orient us as the viewers. The technique lends a more modern artistic scope to what would otherwise be a linear narrative and I believe helps tell the story more coherently. He has edited the film for the most efficient portrayal of the facts a somewhat cause and effect relationship to better let us understand the situation. And it is a beautifully shot film lending a fly on the wall type feel as we follow the revolutionaries or watch the UN debate. It is less artifice than an account of what happened based on the memoirs of Guevara himself. All the battles and all the victories from start to finish his own uphill advancement through the ranks from doctor to righthand man instructor of new recruits to leader of an army. However if this film is to be believed Che never wanted the power past being able to get the job done. Once Cuba was free he wanted to bring the revolution to all of Latin America to share his experiences and political viewpoints. An intelligent man he is shown fighting for his beliefs no matter the cost. Unafraid to do what was needed meant he was unafraid to kill. Does a man like that deserve to be glorified in a film like this? That is in the eye of the beholder because to some he was a hero and a patriot but like every conflict in history where there is a good side there is a bad. To view a battle objectively is impossible because there will always be someone to defend it and someone else to protest.The Argentine is one that will make you think about the strength of the mind and the power of ideas. A country came together and helped back a revolt with force to take over the government. With the charismatic and understated performance from Benicio Del Toro as Che one can't help but see why. Always with a smile and a kind word he ruled with respect and without compromising his beliefs. The fact that he leads intellectually makes the moments of outburst that much more effective. The role should garner a lot of praise as he embodies the man completely shedding any preconceptions of the actor himself. Demotions and promotions don't apply during his tenure in the army he does what Castro needs him to do he follows his leader and expects the same from those under him. He portrays this man as one to be listened to and taken seriously. Castro himself holds council and values his ideas and one might say that if Fidel was the face of the revolt the man pulling the strings Che was the muscle the force allowing it all to happen.In the end though while the visuals are gorgeous and the acting superb it is the story that leaves a little something to be desired. Structurally interesting and easier to follow than one might think due to the jumps in time we are not shown all the details. Often times we are thrown directly into the action without knowledge of why we are there or what is happening for what reason. Events occur and we are shown flashes learning details after the fact or never at all. An example is when Che all of a sudden needs a cast for his arm. We don't know what happened another character actually asks him but when the answer is about to be said we cut to another scene. Soderbergh seems to have crafted the tale he wanted to only allowing us to see what he deems important while leaving all other details by the wayside. He paints Guevara in a kind light as a warrior with a purpose never putting himself in front of the mission or country. In that regard the film is about the Argentine but on the whole it is really about the war itself. Why is Batista bad? Why is Castro good? None of that matters. This isn't a history lesson showing the reasoning or rationale you can get that in a book. Instead Soderbergh is just sharing the events themselvesas they happen not why. You can't deny the scale or ambitions on display however the lack of background may make it hard to decipher or even hard to really care.".

	onyx:emotionText "Telling about the years from his fateful first encounter with the Castro brothers in Mexico to the end of the revolution The Argentine helps show how a young doctor became a Comandante respected and loved by a nation that was not even his. This was a man with ideals one who believed in the love of humanity justice and truth. He was a doctor above all else patching up the troops and making sure the people in every village they passed through had the care and attention they needed. He also was not afraid to lead the charge and stand at the frontlines without fear of death. One must live as though they have already died then the fear will be gone and you can do what is necessary for the cause. It is about the group and the country not about his survival. In his idealized communist beliefs he was fighting for Cuba and the only outcomes allowed were victory or his own destruction.Soderbergh's ambitions are evident right from the start. Although it mainly concerns the years between 19551962 he splices in events happening later on as Che visits the UN. Shot in black and white to help juxtapose against the sumptuous colors of our main action these future scenes comment on what is happening during the war cutting in to enhance the tale. There is a lot of structural jumping between the years each change titled with a date and place to orient us as the viewers. The technique lends a more modern artistic scope to what would otherwise be a linear narrative and I believe helps tell the story more coherently. He has edited the film for the most efficient portrayal of the facts a somewhat cause and effect relationship to better let us understand the situation. And it is a beautifully shot film lending a fly on the wall type feel as we follow the revolutionaries or watch the UN debate. It is less artifice than an account of what happened based on the memoirs of Guevara himself. All the battles and all the victories from start to finish his own uphill advancement through the ranks from doctor to righthand man instructor of new recruits to leader of an army.

This wont appeal to mainstream viewers. This is not a Cuban Braveheart. This is not some twisted Scarface prequel. There will be no postmovie popart.

It's a thorough and naturalistic treatise on iconic human drive and endeavour that infrequently shuttles between monochrome and Technicolor between Che Guevara's 1964 delegation at the UN headquarters and time spent trudging through the Cuban jungle.If your understanding of certain political ideals and movements are at best hazy then it's best to steer clear of this one. You're likely are likely to find the first serving of Soderbergh's fourandahalfhour two part political epic a little confusing. This ain't no Hollywood funded slick and stylish overdramatic chronicle concerned with entertainment or income. This isn't 'Defiance' or 'Valkrye'. This is a wellresearched claustrophobic and paced political drama shot in Spanish where spurts of action violence and humour are few and far between. Imagine Oliver Stone's 'Salvador' by the way of Terrance Mallick's 'The Thin Red Line' fragmented antimainstream and very heavygoing.The bravura Benicio Del Toro stars as Che and is quite excellent. He delivers a focused and unwavering performance worthy of a thousand accolades his finest since '21 Grams'. The fact that Del Toro is fluent in Spanish also helps as does a rallying and unknown supporting cast that work well as a lowkey ensemble. It's all about Del Toro though. His insurgent intense and convincing Che is one marred by crippling bouts of asthma yet defined by a burning desire to educate and reform to put his litigious beliefs into action and unite Latin America.With Che Part One the diligent Steven Soderbergh has found his blend of realism and narrative documentary and drama.

Fourth visit Che simply a great film that I loved. I don't really know when will be released in my city Che Part Two Guerrilla I hope it will in theaters next Friday and if so I will certainly be there. Mainly two facets Benicio del Toro did simply a remarkable work we see Ernesto Guevara in Mexico and certainly Fidel Castro chronologically that is the first part of the film the beginning in Mexico City. The film begins and we move from one place to another we will keep seeing NY while we see the revolutionary road. A marvelous entertaining picture in the battlefield in Cuba we see Che in the battlefield of the revolution how he was the medic a revolutionary not only have to fight Guevara as the leader as the fighter. Certainly we see how Che was many people wanted to join him the ones who knew how to read and how to write came first the other ones while not in combat must learn. We follow this period the way of the revolutionaries the moves of Fidel Castro and all certainly will take us to Santa Clara but we had memorable parts. A fine example is when two brothers of only 16 and 14 wanted to join the revolutionaries they were with some other people that certainly also wanted to fight and the brothers were the only ones who knew how to read and write they will stay and we will see how when all of the revolutionaries had the last chance to stop fighting they will not leave Che and they will have the option to leave the fight but certainly with their honor intact. And talking about memorable parts the very last scene is marvelous since it resumes how Che was. Che will be in La Habana for the very first time. So The Argentine was just my introduction to the work of Steven Soderbergh yes I haven't seen sex lies and videotape yet and Traffic. Here the first very positive fact for me was that the film is in Spanish in short it is a piece of work and I can't wait to see more Soderbergh starting with Che Part Two!

	schema:headline " Honest biopic of revolutionary Ernesto 'Che' Guevara";
	schema:reviewBody "What on earth was director Steven Soderbergh thinking when he decided to tackle the story of Ernesto 'Che' Guevara the Argentinian born doctor and revolutionary who joined Fidel Castro's campaign to take Cuba back from the American backed dictator Fulgencio Batista? What motivated the director of Oceans ElevenTwelve and Thirteen to make this amazing 4 hour biopic. Why Che Guevara and why now? How did he even manage to get the funding for a film about a communist revolutionary in the first place? What was the pitch? Not that there is anything wrong with the film. Far from it. Soderberg tells Guevara's story with loving attention to detail and without resorting to sentimentality or melodrama.This is not the first time Che's story has been turned into a movie. The 2004 film The Motorcycle Diaries examines the formation of Guevara's early politicization and  But Soderberg's film with Benicio Del Toro in the lead role as Che Guevara is the first to try and tell the whole story of Guevara's involvement in the Cuban revolution and his subsequent attempt to spread the revolution to Boliva where he was eventually caught and killed in October 1967.Part 1 deals with the fight against Batista. The long hard slog of waging a guerrilla campaign is covered in great detail as a boatload of 82 revolutionaries head for Cuba during November 1956 and the struggle to win Cuba back for the Cuban people begins.The first film draws extensively on the Guevara's own writings especially his memoir Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War. The months and years of protracted guerrilla warfare are intercut with beautifully recreated scenes showing Che addressing the United Nations in 1964 and conducting numerous interviews with a range of media outlets.Soderberg uses these scenes to explain some of the history and 'back story' to the Cuban revolution and to give the audience some insight into Che Guevara  the man and revolutionary. Part 1 of Che ends in 1959 as Batista flies into exile in the United States and the revolutionaries under the leadership of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara are about to enter Havana.Drawing on Guevara's 'Bolivian Diary' Part 2 of Che takes up the story as Che going under the pseudonym of 'Ramon' lands in Boliva in 1965 and begins trying to recruit local guerrilla's with the intention of overthrowing the ruling government.Here his campaign to recruit local peasant farmers fails and before he and his small band of revolutionaries are able to launch any sort of major anti government attack they are hunted down and killed with the help of the Central Intelligence Agency.Che Guevara was wounded and captured on or about October 9 1967. It is a matter of record that he was alive at the time of his capture and that he was subsequently shot and killed to ensure he would no longer be able to foment revolution either in Boliva or elsewhere in Latin America. How ironic then that his execution has sparked a 'cult of the revolutionary' that has not diminished over the intervening 40 plus years since his death.Of course apart from the Oceans series of films Soderberg has shown he is socially aware by also directing Erin Brockovich Traffic again with Del Toro and The Good German so maybe we shouldn't be surprised that he decided to tackle the story of Ernesto 'Che' Guevara.Don't be fooled by the inclusion of other Alist cast members Julia Ormond Matt Damon Franka Potente and Lou Diamond Phillips in Che. All of these actors have minor roles and small support parts. In fact Matt Damon is on screen for less than two minutes! I can only assume that Soderberg needed some additional well known actors to help secure finance and distribution for the film.However this is without a doubt Benicio Del Toros' film. His performance is a revelation. He inhabits the role of Guevara so well that there are times when I wasn't sure if the historical footage  recreated in black and white  didn't have the real Che Guevara in them.According to the program notes Soderberg is working an a middle part to Che's story. This film will apparently cover Guevara's experiences in Africa. If this is the case then this trilogy will indeed constitute Steven Soderberg's masterpiece. I can think of no other biopic to rival it and the finished series should help to keep the legend of 'Che' Guevara alive for at least another 40 years.".

The long hard slog of waging a guerrilla campaign is covered in great detail as a boatload of 82 revolutionaries head for Cuba during November 1956 and the struggle to win Cuba back for the Cuban people begins.The first film draws extensively on the Guevara's own writings especially his memoir Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War. The months and years of protracted guerrilla warfare are intercut with beautifully recreated scenes showing Che addressing the United Nations in 1964 and conducting numerous interviews with a range of media outlets.Soderberg uses these scenes to explain some of the history and 'back story' to the Cuban revolution and to give the audience some insight into Che Guevara  the man and revolutionary. Part 1 of Che ends in 1959 as Batista flies into exile in the United States and the revolutionaries under the leadership of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara are about to enter Havana.Drawing on Guevara's 'Bolivian Diary' Part 2 of Che takes up the story as Che going under the pseudonym of 'Ramon' lands in Boliva in 1965 and begins trying to recruit local guerrilla's with the intention of overthrowing the ruling government.Here his campaign to recruit local peasant farmers fails and before he and his small band of revolutionaries are able to launch any sort of major anti government attack they are hunted down and killed with the help of the Central Intelligence Agency.Che Guevara was wounded and captured on or about October 9 1967. It is a matter of record that he was alive at the time of his capture and that he was subsequently shot and killed to ensure he would no longer be able to foment revolution either in Boliva or elsewhere in Latin America. How ironic then that his execution has sparked a 'cult of the revolutionary' that has not diminished over the intervening 40 plus years since his death.Of course apart from the Oceans series of films Soderberg has shown he is socially aware by also directing Erin Brockovich Traffic again with Del Toro and The Good German so maybe we shouldn't be surprised that he decided to tackle the story of Ernesto 'Che' Guevara.Don't be fooled by the inclusion of other Alist cast members Julia Ormond Matt Damon Franka Potente and Lou Diamond Phillips in Che. All of these actors have minor roles and small support parts. In fact Matt Damon is on screen for less than two minutes! I can only assume that Soderberg needed some additional well known actors to help secure finance and distribution for the film.However this is without a doubt Benicio Del Toros' film. His performance is a revelation. He inhabits the role of Guevara so well that there are times when I wasn't sure if the historical footage  recreated in black and white  didn't have the real Che Guevara in them.According to the program notes Soderberg is working an a middle part to Che's story. This film will apparently cover Guevara's experiences in Africa. If this is the case then this trilogy will indeed constitute Steven Soderberg's masterpiece. I can think of no other biopic to rival it and the finished series should help to keep the legend of 'Che' Guevara alive for at least another 40 years.";

	schema:reviewBody "This struck me as a documentary or more fairly as a personal yet direct meditation on the own words of a man embedded in context which may also be a definition for documentary I was deeply impressed by the honesty of this film. I understood where Soderbergh the artist was as i felt the space he left for me to think. How he uses Che's own expression of the part of his life depicted in the film with the least possible manipulation editing the book is already manipulating and still it's up to the viewer to place his own opinions over what he saw  more or less distanced according to where we come from and where and how long we lived. Of course this is made considering that who goes to the film has a previous knowledge of what context and moment and what character he is about to watch.I'll put this film together with Medem's 'La pelota vasca' an assumed documentary for they both show an extreme sensitivity working with such delicate themes as like they choose to work. Both originated some contesting More with Medem's because the director was more rooted in the problem that was shown and because the story is far from being closed but to me they were both opened films which as any contemporary film should be leave a lot of the thinking to the public and work as brain starter for discussion.The narrative structure is effective the artwork and editing are of great competence. Che in the woods of Sierra Maestra on the verge taking the power in Cuba inter cut with his visit to the USA in 1964. This second line is shot in black and white the other has beautiful colors. The absence of music was a mildly risky choice i appreciated. The rest you can think of it yourself. I thought Del Toro was very good internally concentrated resisted totally to being what we expected Che to be and that's something to be able to interpret a character with such an charismatic aura behind him which we can still feel when his own words are spoken. From this film on i admire Del Toro before this i didn't look at him as i do now. I'll review his previews performances i have to check if i didn't notice how good he is. Quite on the contrary Bichir as Fidel was a total disaster frankly one of the worst performances i've ever seen. How could he think Fidel was all about imitating a voice some gestures and handling a cigar. What a mess.Of course this man's story is controversial which means one can make radically opposed opinions out of the same known and accepted facts. The fair amount of arguments i've had since i saw it with someone who saw it with me prove me right here. I think Guevara was a lucid man who read perfectly well the mechanics of the world of oppression where he stood. He chose to stand there and live like them though he wasn't like them and that's worth admiration. The ideas he made of the injustice he saw was a product of a genuine mind. But though the diagnosis was right the whole process of making it in practical terms was a mess to my eyes. He was at the root of a regime inserted in a bigger regime that grew on arrogance on hypocrisies and at a certain point became at least so unfair to the same oppressed people as those oppressed had before. And that's because though wanting to do different this revolution used the same weapons of strenght and physical superiority others had used. And that killed the whole idea. And Guevara was there with it being oppressive when he thought he was being better out of i think ingenuity. What i say is read the man his observations are probably equally or even more correct today as they were when he made them but don't follow his steps i wouldn't not knowing what i know today.Also notice how Che the icon grew to incredible proportions 3 reasons i give it He died young and fighting for ideals at least shooting for ideas He was picked up by the very capitalism he rejected and was sold like an icon the population mainly youth desperate to get out of the contradictions in this regime check the contradiction of this He had an image standing for him literally an image the photograph Korda took. It's amazing and it's probably an unique case how a single image can move millions how the right moment with the right publicity can be so powerful. If you think about that among the capitalists who sell tshirts and the liberals who believe Guevara this is image is the center of the most successful publicity campaign ever. Once more i admire Soderbergh's intelligence to leave that image out of this film. It's more than avoiding a clich. It's avoiding the viewers to go recall clichs they've made me included over that image.My opinion 45httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

How many more movies do we need about this murderer? How does that wash in Hollywood? Why not make a movie about Heinrich Himmler and show his human side? Why do movie makers love Communism so much? They should go and live in North Korea or Cuba. What dribble!";

	schema:reviewBody "Che is sometimes almost like life itself a bit of a mess. It meanders. In and around the time of the Cuban revolution  and so fittingly that the film is being released 50 years on  but jumps back and forth to give us black and white footage of Che Guevara addressing the United Nations. Or meeting McCarthy in New York. And then through lush tropical terrain fighting to overthrow the regime in power until 1959.Says director Steven Soderbergh I was drawn to Che as a subject for a movie or two not only because his life reads like an adventure story but because I am fascinated by the technical challenges that go along with implementing any largescale political idea. I wanted to detail the mental and physical demands these two campaigns required and illustrate the process by which a man born with an unshakable will discovers his own ability to inspire and lead others. With that brief there are so many different films that could have been made. This is one of them. And rather a good one. Yet probably not the one you will expect.There is plenty of closeup fighting. But somehow we feel quite removed from it. What Soderbergh portrays is not the action hero. Nor the colourful historical drama. Neither is Benicio Del Toro's portrait one painted in closeups and interiorisation. Instead we have the vision. Depicted in a way consistent with the man's outlook  a teamplayer as well as a guerrilla and idealist. A doctor and a soldier who aroused strong loyalty. I was trying to find the scenes that would happen before or after the scene you would typically see in a movie like this says Soderbergh. The result is casual desultory. We get the feeling of what it may have been like to be around such a man. 'Political' is simply the mechanism the procedural of guerrilla warfare. Soderberg is agnostic about Guevara and indifferent to the rabid hatred of people who have not even seen the film.Meticulously researched over many years Che is a considerable achievement in historical accuracy. And yet here is the first controversy. Wouldn't a balanced portrait of such an almost mythologized figure include more of his faults as well as his virtues? I found myself struggling with this. A director who was capable of describing such a multiplicity of viewpoints in his earlier film Traffic or bringing a real character to life on screen with emotional force as in Erin Brockovich was giving me something rather bland and unquestioning Oliver Stone's insipid Comandante was already coming to mind. Che Guevara was lionised by the liberal left from Sartre to Nelson Mandela and is still a hero to many of the world's youth. But he is also a hated figure by the antiCastro Miami Cubans not least for the bloody executions that followed his socialist revolution a period conveniently ignored in the movie. I had berated Charlize Theron for her rightleaning documentary East of Havana  for its misstatement of facts. But isn't Soderbergh's film with seemingly the opposite political bent guilty of omission? There is no amount of accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him says the director when confronted with this. Although this will not appease the fervent antiCastroists it does give some justification to the filmmaker's choices.Guevara is not just a politicalhistorical figure. Based on the famous photo by Korda his image continues to emblazon tshirts and memorabilia worldwide. For many youngsters it is simply an antiauthority figure. In parts of South America that I have visited it symbolises opposition to U.S. economic occupation. In other words a hero. The inspiration rightly or wrongly is of someone who put moral ideals above his own material welfare. Not a bad image for a youngster to aim at perhaps. When we analyse the real person which most people don't we could perhaps ask if noble ideals are as noble when they don't always have noble results.Soderbergh has had to condense enough material for a dozen films. The romantic youth so ably portrayed in Motorcycle Diaries left the viewing public deprived of any representation of the most famous and important period of Che Guevara's life. Before we passively sit down to a Spielbergsized overinterpretation for bums on seats at the boxoffice perhaps we should hail Soderbergh for this calm relatively unspectacular and unemotional account. It is not a political film. But it perhaps approaches as close to documentary as biopic is capable of. Benicio Del Toro becomes Che Guevara with great acumen. Not flamboyantly. Not with great theatrics or displays of emotion. Sincere and almost reverent he blends seamlessly with quasidocumentary footage. Unless you heard the real Che Guevara speak at the United Nations this is probably the next best thing.On the other hand if your reply is United what? and you would prefer a wellmade Hollywood romp please leave Che to us sad little people that inhabit arthouse cinemas . . .".

The events in Cuba are shown alongside the later events when Che travelled to New York to address the UN and through this we see Che beginning to emerge both as a tough junglestreet fighter and political orator with intelligence and feeling finally transforming himself from a doctor with political leanings to a fully fledged revolutionary.The New York scenes also illustrate the opposition to Che both within the UN and out on the streets which give the film an added depth politically and socially.Del Toro is outstanding as Che and he is backed up by a superb supporting cast. The film is also helped by Soderbergh's wonderful visuals  the forests look amazing and the streets gritty etc and the careful use of music. Yes some of the battle scenes do tend towards the Hollywood but generally are within keeping of the gritty realism of the rest of the film.This may not be everyone's cup of poison but if you like your biopics done with depth and intelligence then this is the film for you.

Some fans get carried away and call it one of the best movies ever made I wouldn't go quite that far but it's damn good.This film is quite different from the 20 sequels that followed. Here Godzilla is not so much a creature as he is a walking incarnation of the atomic bomb. His death ray which became a rather amusing cartoon laser blast in later films is here depicted as a sort of radioactive mist that sets its victims on fire. These radioactive horror images still resonate today  and imagine the impact they must've had on Japanese audiences fifty years ago.From a production standpoint the film holds up well. Godzilla's costume is much more convincing than the silly monkey suits that featured in the 60s and 70s Toho films and due to the grayscale photography the model cityscapes look convincing in most shots  or at least respectable. Ifkube's music score is stirring you know it has to be good as they kept recycling it in later movies and director Honda makes great use of camera angles and imaginative special effects to give Godzilla a genuine aura of menace. For once the human characters don't let the side down. There's a compelling love triangle and a dramatic sacrifice made at the end of the film that adds enormously to its emotional impact. The American version Godzilla King of the Monsters cut out much of the character development and is thus clearly inferior but never fear Rialto is apparently releasing Gojira in all its original glory sometime this year 2004.In the later Godzilla films the destruction he causes is almost incidental. Here it's the whole point  he's a force of nature. Impressive.".

There a legendary mythical creature called Gojira alleged to be responsible for the ship disasters make his first appearance and begins a rampage on hapless Tokyo threatening all of mankind.

The love triangle between the character leads blends in very well with the monster plot. Godzilla making his first attack on Tokyo created haunting scenes of death and destruction and poignant moments of dismalness in the aftermath of his wake. Director Ishiro Honda did his finest and composer Akira Ifukube scored one of his best film music masterpieces. A compelling story by Shigeru Kayama marvelous screenplay by Takeo Murata and superb special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. Actors Takeshi Shimura Akira Takarada Momoko Kochi and Akihiko Hirata gave outstanding performances. And Haruo Nakajima Katsumi Tezuka and Ryosaku Takasugi did a terrific and realistic job on portraying Godzilla.It is clever that the grave consequences of atomic bomb testings are depicted in this film which sends a vital message to the real world. This is a creative way to explain Godzilla's origins. Every element in this movie are throughly connected leaving no room for loose ends and plot holes. While the plot's pace is steady all the onscream drama and action will grab the audience's attention. Above all this film is not just a monsterontheloose movie. It's a true classic one that stands out above many scifi movies in cinema history.

	schema:reviewBody "So this is where it all started!Of course as Godzilla is my alltime favorite character I admit to being raised on the heavily edited US version starring Raymond Burr. But when viewing this film in its original form it not only looks more like a Golden Age Toho fantasy as we all know it but it's a very powerful masterpiece as it stands in the history of world cinema. Here in 2004 50 years ago today after its release American audiences finally get to see the film in its entirety thanks to its longawaited subtitled theatrical release by Rialto Pictures.Technically Japanese monster movies began with the nowlost 1934 period fantasy KING KONG HAS ARRIVED IN EDO EDO NI ARAWARETA KINGU KONGU which was obviously produced upon the success of the 1933 American classic KING KONG. But it was GODZILLA or GOJIRA as the Japanese call him that truly made it over. Clearly inspired by the success of the 1953 hit THE BEAST FROM 20000 FATHOMS released to Japan by Daiei early the same year with a bit of KONG thrown in Toho set out to make their own monster movie not knowing that they would create a phenomenon that would last to this day!What more can I say? This movie pretty much set the standard for Japanese monster movies as we all know! Watching the Japanese version is an amazing experience and a hauntingly epic one!The special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya as lowtech as they were had minor flaws notably visible wires and missiles shooting against a background but even for a first try in the monster genre they still looked spectacular as is the photography! Even though the effects work improved in future films this is still the landmark of things to come.The music by Akira Ifukube is memorable. From his stirring main title music to Godzilla's destructive ponderous theme music to the poignant ending. Again Ifukube's work for this film sets the standard for his work in the fantasy film genre.The main cast is topnotch as you'd expect. Akira Takarada 20 at the time stars as salvage officer Hideto Ogata the main character. Veteran actor Takashi Shimura plays Dr. Kyouhei Yamane the eccentric paleontologist who serves as the Godzillaexpert. Momoko Kouchi plays Yamane's daughter Emiko who's in love with Ogata. But the best character by far and my alltime favorite human character in a Godzilla film is the tormented eyepatchclad scientist Dr. Daisuke Serizawa played by Akihiko Hirata. When watching the Japanese version other supporting characters share the spotlight especially the newspaper reporter Hagiwara Sachio Sakai radiologist Tanabe Fuyuki Murakami the Ooto Island fisherman Masaji Ren Yamamoto and his younger brother Shinkichi Toyoaki Suzuki. They just come off as mere background characters in the US version but if you watch the Japanese original you'll be totally surprised. Their performances were really dazzling just like you'd expect from actors in a Toho fantasy film. Some of these actors would appear in future Godzilla films as well as other SPFX fantasies from Toho.Compared to other incarnations this film as well as GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN had the creepiest Godzilla ever and that was just the way he was supposed to be! Almost like a black silhouette with bright white staring eyes. Godzilla was not just a mere animal he was basically a modern god! A raging destructive demon with the power of the hydrogen bomb that affected him. Although Godzilla is inspired by the Rhedosaurus from BEAST he was a completely different entity. He was virtually indestructible and had an awesome power  a whitehot atomic breath! Godzilla became the archetype for many Japanese giant monsters to follow.But exactly what is Godzilla? As explained in this film it's explained better in the Japanese version he's a huge amphibious bipedal dinosaur that lives in caverns under the sea feeding off of smaller sea animals. He was feared as a god on Ooto Island and many young virgin women were sacrificed to him to appease his hunger. Hydrogen bomb tests affected his habitat giving him unbelievable radioactive power  strength and a towering size of 50 meters 164 feet. And a sleeping giant was awakened . . .Makes you think more about those nuclear tests doesn't it?Lastly while the Japanese original played out more smoothly the American version starring Raymond Burr of PERRY MASON fame as the visiting American reporter Steve Martin not to be confused with the famous comedian! is still very effective. The epic scale of the original still manages to shine through what the US producers could allow and Burr who was hired for a whole day for filming the added scenes still did a serviceable job. American fans of the original version can at least be thankful for this US version without which America could not accept Godzilla.As for the movie's story I'd rather not go into it in detail. If you haven't seen it please do so! Be it the original Japanese version which I recommend the most especially subtitled or the edited US version!Here's to 50 years of a classic movie and a classic character I will love forever!".

	schema:reviewBody "Essentially a Japanese remake of Hollywood's 1953 classic 'The Beast From 20000 Fathoms' 'Gojira' took the same formula and became so much more than simple giantmonster entertainment.Both films told stories about a prehistoric creature releasedmutated by atomic testing. 'The Beast From 20000 Fathoms' followed the appearance of a dinosaur released by an atomic blast. This dinosaur proceeded to destroy some stuff turned up in New York and destroyed New York too. Fun but that was it and not much more I'm not saying its a bad film.On the other hand 'Gojira' used the same idea and had a great impact in Japan. Gojira represented a real threat a danger that Japanese of the time knew all too well. The message behind 'Gojira' was warning of the dangers of nuclear testing and nuclear weapons. Conversely the message of 'The Beast From 20000 Fathoms' is one for aspiring comicbook writers exposure to radiation is a cheap but easy way to explain your character's freaky superpowers.'Gojira' starts off with several boats going missing. One old man claims that Godzilla has returned and in surprisingly unGodzilla movie like fashion no one believes him. I can understand this Japan wasn't accustomed to giantmonster attacks yet. Anyway Japan asks an imminent paleontologist Dr. Yamane to investigate the disappearances around Ohto Island. He discovers a twomillion year old shellfish and lots of radiation. Oh and a dinosaur the locals have dubbed Gojira. Back in Japan Dr. Yamane is convinced that Gojira has been released by atomic testing and that it should be isolated and studied. Obviously no one else shares his view and they all look for a way to destroy Gojira.The key to Gojira's destruction lies in the hands of Dr. Serizawa. You can tell he is mad scientist because of his eyepatch. He is arranged to be married to Emiko Yamane but she is in love with Hideto Ogata a naval officer. Meanwhile Gojira is turning Tokyo into a fiery crater.Storywise its pretty similar to any irradiated monster movie of the 1950s. However what all the other movies lack is the gripping images of destruction. Gojira is depicted as an evil force of nature  instead of wanting to see cities get crushed we see Tokyo in Gojira's wake it resembles a nuclear wasteland and then we are treated to hospital scenes where medical staff try their best to deal with the scores of Gojira's victims. I can only imagine how terrifying scenes like those would have been so soon after World War Two. These are scenes we don't to see in contrast to the sheer joy of watching two giant monsters have at each other in a big metropolis with no apparent consequences see nearly every other Godzilla movie ever made for starters Interestingly enough Godzilla was only 50 metres tall in this and he left radioactive fallout wherever he went. Somewhere along the along the line in the following movies he got significantly taller and lost the radioactive fallout. I guess it was a good career move seeing as he wanted to become a superhero later on.Great film worthy of a 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Along with the 1933version of King Kong this original Japanese release of Gojira is THE most essential giant monster movie ever and one the very few horror movies that every film lover in general has to see at least once. Why? Because it's so much more than just silly drivein cinema with a cheap looking monster! This is dark and apocalyptic SciFi with a nearly allegorical rant about nuclear warfare and the honest fear for new types of weaponry. But I really don't feel like going into the deeper meaning behind Gojira as it primarily is an adrenalin rushing and overpowering action classic that doesn't need intellectual defense at all. One of the many reasons why I love this film so much and same goes for King Kong is that we don't have to wait a dreadfully long time andor endure a large amount of tedious speeches before we see the monster we want to see! Godzilla makes his highly memorable first appearance after approximately 20 minutes by stretching his neck over a cliff! and from then on this is deliciously hectic and paranoid monstermadness! The little bugger is presumably the result of too much Hbomb radiation and lives in the depths of the ocean near the island of Odo. But now he's heading for Tokyo with his unnameable strength fiery breath and  oh yeah  insatiable appetite for destruction! Particularly this extended sequence in which Godzilla blasts his way through the Japanese capital crushing buildings and setting monuments on fire is very impressive and legendary. The actorinmonstercostume works a lot better than any form of computer engineered effects and the carefully imitated Tokyo sets are truly enchanting. The absolute best aspect about this production is its powerful score which makes Godzilla even more threatening. Great stuff! This milestone simultaneously meant the goahead for an innumerable amount of quickly shot sequels Son of Gozilla Godzilla vs. Mothra spinoffs Godzilla VS. King Kong remakes Godzilla 1984 the hitech American version and of course an overload of pathetic imitations Reptilicus Monster from a Prehistoric Planet. I still have to see all the direct sequels but don't really know what to expect from them. I guess that even if they're only half as good as this original I'll be very satisfied.".

This film has the terror of The Beast from 20000 Fathoms. The sets were much better. The battle scenes truer than the cheaper things that came later. The monster was a force. I have always enjoyed that scene where one goes over a hill or a rise just before a beach and on the other side is the monster. The scenes of him wading into the harbor. This is a striking presentation for the early days of monster movies. Of course it's all based on radiation and the nuclear threat. This stuff enlarges things and makes them rampage.

This is the story of an unstoppable destructive force unleashed on a city its aftermath and the impossibly hard choices people must make in response.

Basically in Japan a number of freighters and ships are destroyed in mysterious circumstances with few survivors and fishing catches are reduced to zero these incidents are blamed on an ancient sea creature known as Godzilla. Reporters arrive on Odo Island to further investigate that night a large storm strikes and an unseen force destroys many homes and kills nine people and twenty villagers' livestock. Odo residents travel to Tokyo demanding disaster relief villagers and reporters have evidence that something large is crushing the village palaeontologist Kyohei Yamane Ikiru's Takashi Shimura is sent by the government to lead the investigation to the island. Giant radioactive footprints and a trilobite extinct creature fossils are discovered and soon enough the creature Godzilla appears it is a gigantic dinosaur that crashes around and roars before returning to the sea. Yamane estimates Godzilla to be 50 metres 164 ft tall evolved from an ancient sea creature becoming a terrestrial animal and came from deep underwater it was disturbed by underwater hydrogen bomb testing. Yamane wants to study Godzilla but ten frigates are dispatched in an attempt to kill the monster this fails Yamane says Godzilla is unkillable having survived Hbomb testing. The monster next appears in Tokyo Bay and enters the city destroying everything in its path with its large feet body and atomic breath before once again returning to the ocean. While the Japanese SelfDefense Forces construct a 30 metres 98 ft tall 50000 volt electrified fence along the coast Yamane is devastated there is no plan to study Godzilla for its resistance to radiation the creature resurfaces in Tokyo unleashing a more destructive rampage across the city with increased loss of life. Yamane's colleague Daisuke Serizawa Akihiko Hirata who was engaged to Yamane's daughter Emiko Momoko Kchi has researched and developed a weapon called the Oxygen Destroyer which disintegrates oxygen atoms and the organisms die of a rotting asphyxiation Serizawa eventually agrees to use the weapon in an attempt to destroy Godzilla having seen the devastation. Salvage ship captain Hideto Ogata Akira Takarada who Emiko now loves and Serizawa take a navy ship out of Tokyo Bay to plant a device they find Godzilla using its radiation as detection Serizawa sacrifices his life to activate the Oxygen Destroyer the mission proves t be successful Godzilla is destroyed many mourn the death of Serizawa and Yamane believes if nuclear weapons testing continues another Godzilla may rise in the future. Also starring Sachio Sakai as Newspaper Reporter Hagiwara Fuyuki Murakami as Professor Tanabe and Ren Yamamoto as Masaji Sieji. It obviously looks dated by today's standards including the special effects with cardboard style buildings being destroyed a man in dinosaur stomping around and the creature's atomic breath but that is part of the charm unlike the many sequels and the American remakes and there are moments that genuinely grip you I can imagine it would have been pretty scary in the day a great oldfashioned sciencefiction horror monster movie. Good!".

The music seemed to underscore the ominous nature of the film. I can only imagine what the reaction of the Japanese people was when they first saw this movie 64 years ago.

	schema:reviewBody "Among the kaiju diaspora there is constant disagreement worthy of a Star Trek convention not necessarily a compliment on every minor detail of a film running the gamut from aesthetics in cinematography to monster originality to th realness or fakeness of the godzilla suit in this or that film. The general conversation on Kaiju rarely simmers above that appropriate in a sandbox. However almost instinctively each kaiju fan when asked will rank this at the top of the list the genre has produced glowing remarks follow about its tone its somber atmosphere the general sad feeling one felt and of course the importance of the subtext of the whole screenplay. I always find it odd how uniformly they all take their hats off at the mention of this film like a Casablanca or Citizen Kane of the giant monster movie.The plot is well known and so I wont detail it. Borrowing much from its inspiration The Beast from 20000 Fathoms and to a lesser extent King Kong it begins with mysterious happenings at sea reports by islanders are muddled with ancient mysticism and the government goes to check out the evidence. In the midst of this is a love triangle all linked to apposing sides on the matter of the devastation. The film is above all an antiwar film the inspiration for much of the film was director Ishiro Honda's journey through Hiroshima in 1945. Godzilla is a symbol the incarnation really of unstoppable unreasonable death. Towering over Tokyo and moving slowly across he is war at its corewar against civilians. There are subtle notes scattered all over the scene where parliament erupts into a shouting match for example the scientists men of reason are heard and quickly forgotten the politicians go on bickering note also that Serizawa is also a scientist it is obvious Honda placed little hope on politicians.I think the general appeal of the film is partly warranted partly nominal and partly unavoidable. The warranted aspect is present to anyone who has taken the time to see it more than twice. The writing has been derided by many a critic for example Roger Ebert I originally intended to make this review a rebuttal to his but I found it eloquent the characters have a sense of restraint they always seemed urged to say more than they do. I also like the cinematography the vast number of shots of the beast are from below from afar in the distance within a corner like a silhouette figure shining in dark black waters and sky. Sadly its a form never again taken up by the genre preferring a bland approach mid sized shots on the center of action so as to not miss out on the tumbling creatures and even more recently is to ape what Hollywood generally finds to work the simple angle shots which I think come standard on every camera by this point.The nominal aspect is the general tendency of people to treat the older movie as above criticism to be stashed in shrink wrap and on ice. It is sacrilege to speak ill of the original the Masterpiece the serious toned grandfather of all that is rubbery and rampaging. Quick example I remember noting in passing how I felt Akira Ifukube's score sounded hoarse and almost amateurish in the film and that the themes took life with Mothra vs. Godzilla 1964. Immediately he defended the score calling it the best in the whole series from what I gather for no better reason then that it was the original and the masters work cannot be challenged. Many a film fan will be quick to defend Phantom of the Opera or Nosferatu and with justified historical and technical reasons which would be much more entertaining than watching those films again I may be schooled on the context of them but the context can do little to bring it back from the depths of anachronism.Finally black and white just looks glorious. As many know color dates a film but black  white always looks classy and supersedes any particular era it looks as good in 1932 as it does in 2008 violence is given meaning by simply moving through the contrast a man walking down an empty street is a non literal expression of his life and thoughts in color its an extended scene editing mistake. For Gojira a monster crushing a city in B  W is a commentary on violence in color a summer popcorn romp at a multiplex manyatime color has no patience for subtext.In my view it is the greatest kaiju film and one of the best films of a golden age of Japanese cinema.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "To criticise the original Godzilla would just be plain silly in my view. Yes everything looks so fake and yes the buildings are models and yes it's a guy in a suit but you know so what? These are the special effects for the time and just as I complain about the latest Hollywood blockbuster these days and how in some other films the special effects are terrible Godzilla's may look a little rough now but the unreal elements in this film do not detract from its experience nor do they ever take centre stage above the narrative or the themes within. Godzilla is a focused film a film that is structured around an idea that is bold and outgoing whilst simultaneously making a statement about the world at the time of production. Godzilla retains a certain charm and a certain quality that never makes it uninteresting and surely that means it can only be labelled as a success.We've all seen the American remake and all had our opinions on it. I may have liked it as a child as a fast moving good looking epic but thinking back it makes the mistakes toward the end that its Japanese original and inspiration does not and that is allowing the special effects to take control of your picture. By the time what'shisname and who'sit are in that subway station fending off Godzilla's young in a blatant attempt to recreate the kitchen scene out of Spielberg's Jurassic Park you've accepted the film has gone down a certain disappointing route. But here I feel the scenes involving the special effects are really just the result of good filmmaking prior to it all happening. There is the introduction of the monster the keeping the monster away from the screen the presenting of the monster but not as a destructive creature the dialogue building the monster up offscreen and then the carnage that is what Godzilla is capable of now that he's reached that level of destruction.I feel that despite the film being considerably large for its time the people that made it probably never envisaged it becoming as successful as it did. The film has spawned sequels prequels spinoffs and even a remake forty years after the initial production. Hollywood were perhaps familiar with the concept of this bigbudget special effects extravaganza involving a giant monster following 1933's King Kong and were perhaps more used to this genre by the time they'd seen Gojira. But if the rumour that people were running from the cinemas following King Kong are true then I wonder what Ishir Honda and Shigeru Kayama exactly had in mind before this was released. I think the emphasis was always on delivering a film with an intriguing story and one with some sort of eerie message at its centre much unlike today's extravaganzas and perhaps a lot less than 1933's King Kong although the message nearer the end could echo along the lines of 'Just what exactly consists of entertainment these days?' But it's not Honda and Kayama's fault this is as big as it is today and it's not their fault I saw this on a DVD disc free with a newspaper complete with huge build up from a preceding television advert right here in the year 2008. Godzilla may be a film that is a guy in a suit tearing down models of dodgy looking buildings whilst breathing some sort of fire rendering him more ancient mythical dragon than deep sea lizard but it works in its own way. The film is a folklore story from ancient times resurfacing no pun intended into modern times through what the characters deem to be the lack of attention and acknowledgement to times gone by. It could be true that the legend that is Gojira is angry at the lack of sacrifice or food or whatever it was and he has come to wreck and nasty revenge or it could be a statement on Japan's ever growing modernity that by now we all know is the best in the world when it comes to stereo systems gadgets and gizmos. I don't think the producers were threatening people with a giant lizard that will come from the sea and destroy us but the ruined Tokyo shots are probably metaphors for the falling apart of society if Japan itself looses focus of who they actually are and buckles under the immense pressures of 20th Century modernising.Then there are the plot elements that declare Godzilla the result of nuclear testing. World War Two had ended a mere nine years ago ironically in the Pacific with the dropping of Big and Little Boy respectively. Look what the nuclear blasts have done to us look at the moral decision we now face we must rebuild and get going again but at what cost? No a lizard won't come from the deep and destroy everything again but if we fall behind then Japan will never once again be a great nation. These are the questions and ideas I think Gojira raises given its timeframe. Then there is the lack of international support offered when Godzilla goes nuts another statement on Japan's global position and relationship with other world powers following the war? Perhaps. The reallife images of Tokyo decimated from bombing adds to the reality Japan faced and the use of the special effects is smart it's always model attacking model not model attacking 'real' like America usually do it today and sometimes in 1933's King Kong. One of the reasons I thought Jackson's was better is because his is CGI fighting CGI. Gojira may borrow from Hollywood's storytelling regarding the morale choice and the 2nd Revelation but the film remains an entertaining and fascinating one all the same.".

World War Two had ended a mere nine years ago ironically in the Pacific with the dropping of Big and Little Boy respectively. Look what the nuclear blasts have done to us look at the moral decision we now face we must rebuild and get going again but at what cost? No a lizard won't come from the deep and destroy everything again but if we fall behind then Japan will never once again be a great nation. These are the questions and ideas I think Gojira raises given its timeframe. Then there is the lack of international support offered when Godzilla goes nuts another statement on Japan's global position and relationship with other world powers following the war? Perhaps. The reallife images of Tokyo decimated from bombing adds to the reality Japan faced and the use of the special effects is smart it's always model attacking model not model attacking 'real' like America usually do it today and sometimes in 1933's King Kong. One of the reasons I thought Jackson's was better is because his is CGI fighting CGI. Gojira may borrow from Hollywood's storytelling regarding the morale choice and the 2nd Revelation but the film remains an entertaining and fascinating one all the same.";

What sets this movie apart is the fact that Godzilla is a metaphorstand in for the atomic bomb. Not another monster movie with a hero that slays the monster at the end but a movie where the one who defeats or according to Dr. Yamane MAY have defeated has a huge decision and responsibility to make not only that but actually shows the weight on his shoulders instead of just being like hmmmm we got the one hand i can do this but on the other hand i could do that i think i'll do that instead in the moment of decision he is pulling his hair out sweating and it looked like he was about to cry too. Then the innocent people caught in the rampage they show more emotion then running and screaming like having scenes where they are caught in claustrophobic tight spots watching in horror while trying to hide and instead of most giant monster movies shows what happens to some of them like people being torched by Godzilla's fiery breath and shows the aftermath of what happened to the injured and dieing.

	schema:reviewBody "Director of special effects for this movie Eiji Tsuburaya he was the first of his kind in Japan once commented in an interview that ever since he saw King Kong he wanted to make a movie just like it. He got his chance in this movie made 20 years later. Tsuburaya commented on the hardship he encountered when he tried to make the first Godzilla suit when right kinds of foam and rubber materials were not yet abundantly available in Japan at the time. He mentioned that he even used concrete to make part of the suit. Eiji Tsuburaya is also the inventor of the blue screen technique which later evolved into today's green screen technique. Modern movie owes Tsuburaya a lot for his pioneering works. Many people mistakenly credit Inoshiro Honda for the fantastic action scenes in this movie but it was Tsuburaya who did the work. Tsuburaya later went on to invent other characters such as Rodan and the original Ultraman series which is still popular today.I was raised on the American version of this movie starring Raymond Burr and didn't even know that another original version of this movie existed until recently thanks to IMDb. I ordered the video from Japan and got to see it for the first time as it was created. After seeing this movie I can now tell the discontinuity in the American version of Godzilla where Dr. Yamane mentions about Godzilla in Japanese before it shows up.This was the first Godzilla movie and it still holds up after 50 years and what's even more remarkable is the fact that it's still the most realistic rendition of the monster. The production value have never been matched in this genre until the release of Gamera 1999 Revenge of Iris in my opinion.I give it a 9 because acting of Momoko Kochi and other actors are bit spotty but Kochi made good later by studying hard to become a good stage actress in Shakespearian play and became one of the best actress in Japan. Kochi also appears in her final role before her death in 1995's Godzilla vs Destroiya reprising her role as Emiko Yamane.".

A scientist has the device that will destroy the monster but is reluctant to use it because the device could be weaponized. He uses it anyway at the willing cost of his own life.I kept trying to compare this original Japanese version with the export version made for the American market the one with a somber Raymond Burr describing the destruction. It wasn't easy because I hadn't seen the Burr version for years.The isomorph we've been exposed to is almost funny. Burr is wideeyed and awed. The monster is a man in a ridiculous rubber suit. The visual effects are based on models and give away their true size because of their texture. A rocket hitting Tokyo Bay sends up splashes with drops as big as basketballs.Yet though the skeleton of the story and its associated effects are the same this is a far more serious story. There's nothing much laughable about it. There are extended scenes of the suffering of Tokyo's residents after the raid by Gojira. The hospitals are jammed. Babies wail. It doesn't take much imagination to figure out what memories only nine years old were being redintegrated in the collective consciousness of the Japanese viewers. Kids we dropped two atomic bombs on Japanese cities three days apart at the end of World War II. PS That would be 1945. The movie is deliberately invested with moral weight. The scientist who destroys Gojira kills himself so that the secret of his device will never be revealed and used in war. He's already destroyed his notes but the knowledge is inside his head.That spirit of self sacrifice is built into Japanese culture and I have no idea whether it's easy or not for most Westerners to grasp that and other subtleties. It's a matter of national character. And not just something as simple as young ladies hiding their giggles behind their hands. When the scientist tells his assistant never to reveal the existence of the secret oxygen destroyer she promises. Later when she breaks her promise she and the man to whom she revealed the secret hang their heads in shame before the scientist and beg his forgiveness. The device may save the world but they're still ashamed because they've broken a moral code. When I was in the service a colleague told me wonderingly about his leaving a Japanese cat house and being chased down the street by one of the staff who wanted to return the wallet he'd left behind.Well  so much for cultural relativity. In case we might overlook the fact that this story is really about something other than a destructive monster who is a man in a rubber suit one of the scientists launches into an obiter dictum about how much he hopes no more nuclear bombs will be exploded so they can avoid more Gojiras.It's a sobering movie.".

The scene opens onto a fishing boat that strays to close to a nuclear testing site reminiscent of the Lucky Dragon No. 5 the blast which sinks the ship also awakens the feared Gojira. Gojira a feared beast with rocklike skin likened to the texture of radiation burns with the ability to shoot radioactive fire from his mouth and whose footsteps leave radioactive fallout in his wake seems the perfect living depiction of a Nuclear Bomb. The first shot of that unfortunate ship is believed to be a reminder of the Lucky Dragon No. 5 a ship that when fishing for Tuna and instead was delivered a heavy dose of radiation from testing done by the U.S Military on Marshall Islands. The ship well outside the radius was hit with radioactive fallout when the tested atomic bomb was more powerful than the U.S military realized. As with those in the film who died as the ship sank the crew of Lucky Dragon No. 5 obtained radiation poisoning and died quickly. This same atomic testing that killed the crew of the ship is also attributed with awakening Gojira a menacing beast that attacks Japan in the same manner as that of an atomic bomb. Unlike an atomic bomb the Japanese in Gojira find a way to stop the monster with a fictional Oxygendestroyer thought this may seem the typical happy Hollywood ending the fact that Gojira the allegorical Atomic bomb and in some sense the U.S military was destroyed shows the true feelings of the Japanese people. The Japanese mindset is one that believes what's done is done and instead of dwelling in the past the Japanese should work toward the future the very fact that Gojira was so popular helps the outside world realize that even though the Japanese may not mention it the atomic bombings are always on their minds.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's virtually impossible to summarize my feelings on Synecdoche New York. This astonishing brain teaser from the mind of Charlie Kaufman affected me deeply probably more than any film I've yet seen this year. I can't say it's necessarily enjoyable because it's full of uncomfortable brave truths about what it means to be human and it goes places most movies don't dare to. But watching it is a bracing experience and it's encouraging to know that there are still filmmakers willing to use film as a means of challenging their audiences and picking at scabs that most people would prefer to remain solidly in place.I can't begin to tell you what Synecdoche New York means and it wouldn't matter anyway because I think it will mean different things to different people. A basic summary goes something like this Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a morose depressed theatre director who's convinced that fatal diseases are lurking around every blood vessel and who decides to stage a monstrous ambitious theatrical work that will leave him remembered after he dies. Soon the work as he's staging it becomes confused with the life he's living so that he finds himself directing a version of himself through a story that seems to be made up as it moves along.If this sounds like an act of mental masturbation by a pretentious intellectual with too much time on his hands rest assured Synecdoche New York is not one of THOSE films. I didn't become impatient with Kaufman or his characters like I have with some of his previous projects. In fact this film made me uneasy because of how much of it I DID relate to. The conclusions it draws are that we are all alone in this big universe life doesn't necessarily have any meaning other than what one brings to it and there is not a higher power who is going to make sure our passage through the world makes sense. It was a bit of a wake up call to hear these beliefs beliefs that I happen to share stated so boldly for while I'm confident in what I believe that confidence doesn't make the beliefs themselves any less scary.But depressing and nihilistic as those beliefs might sound the film is life affirming in its own way. It suggests that too many of us spend too much time trying to make sense of the world and not enough time living in it. We pull back in loneliness and fear when faced with things bigger than ourselves rather than turning to those who can actually help namely the other human beings with whom we share our time on this planet.Synecdoche New York will not likely find a big audience as most people will either not want to work at understanding it or won't like what it has to say. But if you're willing to go into it with an open mind you might just find yourself amazed.Grade A".

It's the sprawling story of one man's life a tragic life. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a harrowing performance as his character attempts to create a play of realism and honesty. And even as he dives head first into his work his own life is in a perpetual state of free fall. A wife who leaves him a daughter out of his life relationships that crash and burn. His play inside a warehouse where he has reconstructed New York City for people to live our their ordinary lives becomes a fruitless and maddening descent into unhappiness and destruction.What is 'Synecdoche' about?

Existence is what we make of it and it is the choices we make that shape and define who we are and the lives we lead. Every choice brings with it a million different consequences some seen and others that go unnoticed.Kaufman tells us we are one in a world of many. We each play a starring role in the story of our life. People we meet every day those we know and love. Never will we truly know them their thoughts or why they do what they do.

And I believe there are people as equally blessed and cursed to not think very deeply on these matters. I think this film will find a comfortable home in the hearts of the former. Now of these inner seekers I believe you have all variations of folks those that seek deeply and find beauty connection and great joy. There are those seek deeply and find isolation grief and deep wells of sadness. There are those who find some semblance of balance between the two. I myself lean more towards connection and subsequent joy because of that I found this movie to be profoundly moving on almost a primordial level and I believe in a hopeful way. Don't get me wrong I cried many times during the movie and didn't want to leave the theater when the film was finished. I held back the wells of whatever it was that was welling up in me until I got to my car and then unloaded some body shaking tears. It wasn't sadness though it was something else. I don't really know yet. One thing I do know is that all of Kaufman's films seem to affect me in this manner. After the initial viewing I know distinctly how the movie has affected me emotionally I can FEEL it. I am not capable of defining that feeling or explaining why that feeling has erupted it is clear to everyone that his plot and content are generally all over the board and it usually takes several viewings to pull any real intellectual analysis from them but I certainly am conscious of something new and fresh happening inside my emotional hard wiring. I find that a phenomenal feat in the face of a sea of art which relies on very standardized ways of pulling it's consumers in emotionally. Do you remember how you felt after Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? I remember walking out and feeling very hopeful about the nature of love in a whole brand new way. Not in the contrived standardized Sleepless in Seattle kind of way not to judge that but there is something amazing about an artist who can make you feel things you are not sure you've felt before. That to me is authentic art. This really isn't about valuing one thing more than another just offering great respect to someone who has taken your mind and heart to places it hasn't been before. It is nice to visit those old comfortable haunts but this well like all of Kaufman's films will take you somewhere entirely new if you are predisposed to that kind of wandering.".

	schema:headline " to call it a disappointment might almost be a compliment but I dare you to see it";
	schema:reviewBody "Note This works MUCH better on a repeat viewing practically a masterpiece and one of the perfectly sad comedies ever made... though the last ten minutes is a slog perhaps intentionally as it's near the end of the tunnel... but it's still unbearable.Over the course of my teenage years I've seen Being John Malkovich through Eternal Sunshine those two the Mword masterpieces with Adaptation and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind neargreat and Human Nature a fun minor work and he's always given something to chew on for the brain. He's an incredible wit maybe too incredible like something that could combust with the amount of ideas and ruminations and skill at defining what's important to us as people and what we want out of art. Synecdoche New York could be seen as his lifesummation of what concerns him as a writer. And to call it art is simple because it is it is alongside the something like Inland Empire the most challenging work to come out of American cinema. To say that either one is flawed may come as something as a given but for Kaufman it's somewhat more troubling.This is a big film of ideas crucial lifeaffirming or lifedamning thoughts about love and death and loss and forgiveness and essentially the process of trying to recreate and recreate and recreate this. But at the same time the intellect to engage fulltilt by Kaufman the writer the director couldn't engage me as a viewer emotionally  at least at first. This changed on a second viewing  I'm reminded of Woody Allen's assertion on multiple viewings of 2001 that Kubrick was much ahead of him on what he was doing  but on a first impression I have to wonder with everything going for Kaufman the satirist the original the sad dramatist what the movie's audience really is. Like the play that is rehearsed for decades that Cotard never brings to his audience what can one take away from Synecdoche New York as far as connecting with the characters or just Cotard?Maybe it reveals something about me just talking about this indeed this is probably the film of the season if not just the year Dark Knight fanatics take note that you will want to talk about after it ends. As far as puzzling works of art go it's great for a good argument especially if one is familiar with how Kaufman's work has been leading up to this point. It's not exactly that the film is ever so confusing that one will want to walk out  there is a logic in a sense to the life imitating art imitating life imitating art etc etc aspect that makes sense. When Kaufman as director makes his film this time about as hopeful as Franz Kafka rewatching the Zapruder film on a loop even the scenes and moments that do feel somewhat powerful emotionally i.e. Hoffman seeing his daughter in a nudiebooth or the final scene on the bed with Hoffman and Morton old and in bed with the house once again on fire don't hit their mark  again at least at first. It's almost as if seeing the film again it becomes deeper more resonant like any work of art at another point in one's life it could change and if one gives it the chance it does. Certainly the cast makes it worthwhile to watch Hoffman is what he is brilliant at transforming physically as age goes by as Caden Cotard and at delivering subtle moments of humor amid his healthdecay ditto in her own right to Morton who ranges from bubbly and lustful to anrgy and dejected Michelle Williams too shows this range even a bit part by Dianne Wiest is appreciated. They all help to give life to what is a big somber meditation on quoting Douglas Adams Life the Universe and Everything.And yet expressing my initial disappointment over the length at 124 minutes it feels twice as long or the music did Kaufman order killmyselfpianotunesyou'lllove off of ebay for this? or the personal problem of connecting emotionally with some of the characters as they intentionally don't really grow shouldn't I hope diminish recommending Synecdoche New York for anyone who wants something to challenge them provoke thought and discourse to engage and disrupt brainwave patterns.

	onyx:emotionText "Note This works MUCH better on a repeat viewing practically a masterpiece and one of the perfectly sad comedies ever made... though the last ten minutes is a slog perhaps intentionally as it's near the end of the tunnel... but it's still unbearable.Over the course of my teenage years I've seen Being John Malkovich through Eternal Sunshine those two the Mword masterpieces with Adaptation and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind neargreat and Human Nature a fun minor work and he's always given something to chew on for the brain. He's an incredible wit maybe too incredible like something that could combust with the amount of ideas and ruminations and skill at defining what's important to us as people and what we want out of art. Synecdoche New York could be seen as his lifesummation of what concerns him as a writer. And to call it art is simple because it is it is alongside the something like Inland Empire the most challenging work to come out of American cinema. To say that either one is flawed may come as something as a given but for Kaufman it's somewhat more troubling.This is a big film of ideas crucial lifeaffirming or lifedamning thoughts about love and death and loss and forgiveness and essentially the process of trying to recreate and recreate and recreate this. But at the same time the intellect to engage fulltilt by Kaufman the writer the director couldn't engage me as a viewer emotionally  at least at first. This changed on a second viewing  I'm reminded of Woody Allen's assertion on multiple viewings of 2001 that Kubrick was much ahead of him on what he was doing  but on a first impression I have to wonder with everything going for Kaufman the satirist the original the sad dramatist what the movie's audience really is. Like the play that is rehearsed for decades that Cotard never brings to his audience what can one take away from Synecdoche New York as far as connecting with the characters or just Cotard?Maybe it reveals something about me just talking about this indeed this is probably the film of the season if not just the year Dark Knight fanatics take note that you will want to talk about after it ends. As far as puzzling works of art go it's great for a good argument especially if one is familiar with how Kaufman's work has been leading up to this point. It's not exactly that the film is ever so confusing that one will want to walk out  there is a logic in a sense to the life imitating art imitating life imitating art etc etc aspect that makes sense. When Kaufman as director makes his film this time about as hopeful as Franz Kafka rewatching the Zapruder film on a loop even the scenes and moments that do feel somewhat powerful emotionally i.e. Hoffman seeing his daughter in a nudiebooth or the final scene on the bed with Hoffman and Morton old and in bed with the house once again on fire don't hit their mark  again at least at first. It's almost as if seeing the film again it becomes deeper more resonant like any work of art at another point in one's life it could change and if one gives it the chance it does. Certainly the cast makes it worthwhile to watch Hoffman is what he is brilliant at transforming physically as age goes by as Caden Cotard and at delivering subtle moments of humor amid his healthdecay ditto in her own right to Morton who ranges from bubbly and lustful to anrgy and dejected Michelle Williams too shows this range even a bit part by Dianne Wiest is appreciated. They all help to give life to what is a big somber meditation on quoting Douglas Adams Life the Universe and Everything.And yet expressing my initial disappointment over the length at 124 minutes it feels twice as long or the music did Kaufman order killmyselfpianotunesyou'lllove off of ebay for this? or the personal problem of connecting emotionally with some of the characters as they intentionally don't really grow shouldn't I hope diminish recommending Synecdoche New York for anyone who wants something to challenge them provoke thought and discourse to engage and disrupt brainwave patterns. Perhaps there should be some disappointment like life and the art pulled out of it with pliers it's not always a pretty sight especially near the end. But it is a unique journey I was glad to take and I hope every few years or so to come back to it and see if it changes me or if I've changed since seeing it last.";

	schema:reviewBody "I got to see a screening of this in Boston and let me admit to the fact that I consider this film a masterpiece. It is a rare entry into the market an ambitious film a gamble that sadly makes me question how much success it could garner in the mainstream boxoffice.Charlie Kaufman however is not a screenwriterdirector who inherently aims his sights on the boxoffice or the mainstream anybody who questions this has to question Being John Malkovich. Instead his greatest strength is a boundless creativity and insight into the qualities of humanity and Synecdoche New York is no exception. Rather it is the apex of Kaufman at his most insightful his most ambitious and as his directorial debut his most hauntingly beautiful.The plot itself is a contradiction of simplicity and complexity to say that it is about Philip Seymour Hoffman trying to put on a larger than life play is an accurate statement yet it completely fails to capture what Synecdoche New York tries to convey. It is not a conventional film but instead it is ambitious a mixture of conventional narrative and surrealist cinema one where the beauty of the film does not solely lie upon the plot but the way every minute quality of the film ties together to form the tapestry.The actors all do their parts brilliantly. I am hardpressed to find any performance that was weak or for that matter standard of the Hollywood formula. Hoffman is brilliant in a role that utilizes his physical and acting gifts and he takes the character through the spectrum of its possibilities. All the other actors also performed brilliantly although what struck me as wonderful about the acting choices are that the majority of the actors present are not glamorized for the screen. Rather the blemishes the age and the imperfections that make them ordinary are ever present in the film making Synecdoche New York seem beautiful in a strange dirty way. Much like a city its majesty lies not in grungy street corners or clogged rain gutters but in the whole image that is comprised of such small necessary imperfections.And that ultimately is why Synecdoche New York is such an ambitious beautiful film. It is not a perfectly crafted standard screenplay nor a perfectly executed piece of cinema. At least Kaufman's work is not perfect under the current criteria of modern cinema. Synecdoche New York is a gamble a mixture of images and music and dialogue and acting that follows Kaufman's heart and his meditations on several ideas namely those on life and death and the connections all around us. It is dark yet funny evocative and haunting. It is perfect in being a work of art that tempts us to find explanation yet ultimately needs none compared to the feelings they evoke in us.Viewers who are looking to see the difference between art and entertainment need only see Synecdoche.".

So weird that half the people left the theatre before the end either confused or offended by what they saw. Poor Charlie witnessed the whole scene and I suspect it really got to him.The film's very much Spike Jonze in style but grander and more ambitious than Malkovich and Adaptation. The first hour is hilarious next half an hour is still good and you're struggling not to lose threads the last half an hour gets really messy and tends to drag a bit. It might be due to Charlie's inexperience as a director or it might be intentional and a means to express one of the points of the film futility and dragging of time or the topics simply grew too difficult to deal with but it seems to me that the last part could have been made a bit more compact for a stronger impression. Seven to ten minutes less would have helped if that was possible.Perhaps Jonze would have done a better job in terms of pacing and craftsmanship but the content is still really strong. The film had been five years in the making and you can feel the issues that Kaufman wanted to address brimming over. Illness death transience love relationships passion devotion art theatre identity hope so many topics dealt with in a painfully sincere way. You both laugh and get emotionally affected all the time along with being confused by the twists of the plot and the grotesqueness of the imagery. You get many 'this is so true' moments that you completely identify with and then you suddenly get struck by a completely surreal scene. The film certainly reinforced my impression of Kaufman as a bastard son of Woody Allen and Tom Stoppard.The cast is wonderful. Philip Seymour Hoffman has to be singled out for his magnificent performance. I have never been much of a fan of his and I was somewhat bothered by the idea of him as a lead in the next Kaufman movie. I didn't think he had a presence for that but did he prove me wrong! Appearing in virtually every scene the man has carried this film on his shoulders. He has created a completely lovable and ludicrous character and conveyed Kaufman's ideas splendidly.Catherine Keener is as fun and adorable as ever! As a fan I was really overwhelmed by this experience. I saw it two nights in a row and spent hours discussing it with friends. The film is a bit difficult to comprehend instantaneously and Kaufman himself insists it requires a second watching. It is an amazing picture rarely thoughtprovoking and I can't wait to see it for the third time.".

As with many other filmmakers who are genuinely engaged with film as a unique art form it seems quite clear to me at least that Kaufman requires the spectator to meet him on his own wavelength.This is what a significant portion of artists in any medium do they take the constraints conventions and materials of their chosen form very seriously and explore their own perceptions ideas and emotions plying the tools of their medium on their own personal terms.At the opposite end of this artistic spectrum is the sort of pandering manipulation of a Spielberg or the painter Thomas Kincaid. Their works are only personal in the sense that what is most prominently on display in their work is their own desperate personal need to have their intended message understood and even experienced by all spectators in exactly the same way so that the artist can in turn feel his own personal worth has been validated by public and critical responses  Hah I must be a great artist because I succeeded in making you think and feel the exact thing I wanted you to! I'll grant that this spectrum is a very broad one and I won't discount the work of anyone along it but that doesn't mean I have to enjoy things I see as technically accomplished hackwork. I don't and never will. I'll take an artist who refuses to telegraph his statement to me any day. I prefer works that wash over me entrance me and lead me down paths to new or longburied thoughts and feelings.I feel GREAT after having seen Synecdoche this evening. I laughed I cried and I see the world just a little differently now. I feel like a group of people I have never met Kaufman and the others involved in making this wonderful movie shared something with me that was very important to them. I wish I could thank them because I think it takes a great deal of courage to share with others things that are so personally important in such an honest unapologetic way.I think it also takes a lot of courage for investors to throw millions of dollars at such a personal vision.

It brought in my mind some of Ingmar Bergman's characters and of course Woody Allen's but without the liberating sense of humor. Liberating for the characters that is.

So I guess it rather saves itself that accusation.

So I guess it rather saves itself that accusation. If it only was 15 minutes shorter then I wouldn't know what to nag about.It seems that Charlie Kaufman was not afraid to challenge his hip followers did a difficult to appreciate movie dark that really makes your stomach and your brain hurt with with overactivity.It's a great film.";

	schema:reviewBody "One thing right ahead Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut is an extremely uncomfortable film. It is likely not to make much sense the first time around that you are too busy taking it all in and your efforts to understand it get derailed. Many will end up repelled by the experience and don't feel the desire to return to it. Subsequent viewings however should help to value the gargantuan task Kaufman has undertaken and to look forward to further visits to that strange place called Synecdoche. Make no mistake This is no love story much less a happy one not a tale about someone succeeding or get rewarded by any kind of redemption. There are images which seem too trivial to be part of a cinematic masterpiece and you'll wonder about the surreality of some scenes and the layers upon layers that stack up. But getting into the film and getting out of it again only can be accomplished with difficulty. And that's a good thing.On the surface Synecdoche is about theater director Caden Cotard understatedly played by Philip Seymour Hoffman whose life more and more slips out of his hands and literally rushes by in the film's narrative. An unexpected award gives him the chance to attempt something big and so he builds a simulacrum a lifesize replica of New York casting people to play roles in it in order to replace the persons of his life. But the simulacrum is not enough and while he tries everything and then some in his struggle to find a sure footing a proof of his existence between life and death he turns out to be nothing else than the ultimate victim of his limitations. Caden's story is about the loss of himself in the imitations he created yet miraculously this sad life eventually becomes part of something larger by just fading away. For watchers will notice a deliberately designed circular structure of the film... One could even argue that Caden might just be a character in a film and longing for a life outside. Up to you! Make sure to watch Synecdoche more than once. And maybe at some point you'll learn to smile along with this postmodern masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rating A 98100 1010 Charlie Kaufman explores the depression of Caden Cotard a playwright hypochondriac Philip Seymour Hoffman. It all stems from his wife Catherine Keener but he knows and the audience knows that she is not the cause of all his problems although she is quite unsettling.We are introduced to Hazel Samantha Morton a sweet distraction from his decaying family life. However his sense of loyalty stands in the way of anything meaningful happening with her.As he grows older Caden becomes acutely aware of the things that are missing from his life. His focus is on himself but in his myopic state he cannot identify the problem. So he comes up with the best solution he can. He'll make a play of his life. And in so doing maybe he'll find out what went wrong. Maybe he'll find out who he is. Maybe he'll only continue to destroy his life.Sammy the actor who plays Caden in the play seems to overtake Caden's life and becomes more like Caden than Caden himself could ever be. Lines of fantasy and reality blur as Sammy makes creative choices about the character of Caden that Caden disagrees with. Then as if that weren't enough the role mutates to the point where actress Millicent Weems Dianne Wiest takes over the role. She becomes Caden's doppelgnger taking control of Caden's life when he is unable to cope.The film starts in October 2005 and continues over forty years into the future. Nothing much changes in the world around the characters. The only thing that is constant is time spinning out of control. When his grown up daughter Olive falsely accuses him of ruining her life her perception totally skewed Caden begs to be forgiven in what is a very moving scene.Not to be overlooked is Hope Davis' psychotherapist character. She plays the straight guy nodding asking how Caden feels. Oh it feels bad? Good! Her collection of selfhelp books all written by her don't help Caden solve his problems. They are only false remedies that Caden tries in effort to satisfy him in his life. Caden either projects his health problems onto her or she has problems of her own a grotesque blister on her toe that mirrors the boils on Caden's legs.Emily Watson plays an actress that is portraying Hazel's character. To me she and Samantha Morton are like the same person the same actress. I only saw their similarities. However apparently Charlie Kaufman cast them because of their differences. Also the characters are supposed to be extremely different. But at first the overwhelming similarities are often confounding. Emily Watson takes over Hazel's character and acts in ways Hazel would never act just as Sammy and Millicent overstepped their bounds with the Caden character.What is moving about this movie? Certainly Caden's connection with his daughter Olive. Certainly his affection for Hazel the closest thing he has to a soulmate. Yet he always manages to screw things up with her no matter what. Also death is explored in this movie the idea that we're all going to die one day. That everyone is the main character of their own story. That we all have choices.Synecdoche New York is a gross and weird movie too different from anything that you'll see this year. That's ultimately why I love it. It attempts to show the truth through all the seemingly unimportant details yet they are tied together in a nice bow without the movie seeming too perfect. It's offensive to many the way life is shown yet I laughed at the things I should have been shocked by.After this film it almost doesn't make any sense to see any movie by anyone except for Charlie Kaufman. No one has more sense of oneself and everyone else and yet no one is more lost and wandering and boy I thought I was bad!. Kudos to Kaufman for succeeding yet again when he could have taken the easy way out and written something more simplistic or less gutwrenching.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw the trailer for Synecdoche New York I was interested intrigued and excited. A few hours later after seeing the film itself I left the cinema not just disappointed after what seemed like several hours of slowmoving uninspiring uninteresting boring viewing I was actually annoyed. Annoyed at the money and time I had parted with to sit through such an ultimately pointless experience.The concept behind this film is a grand and exciting one. Theatre director Caden Cotard attempts to recreate the world he lives in with a vast cast of actors in a hopeless struggle to make sense of the misfortunes in his life and analyse his own inadequacies. With such a great inspiration and a stellar cast you would think Kaufman would have to try very hard to go wrong but somewhere along the way he does.In Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich Kaufman showed a great skill for combining strange plots with creative casting and a quirky comic edge to create profound and moving films riddled with symbolism. It is because of these films that his brand of surrealism has become popular and very successful. Synecdoche New York should and could have featured alongside these works as triumphs of the avantgarde. It does not. Kaufman seemed to spend so much energy applying surrealist quirks to the plot that he neglected the fundamental aspects of his film. I never connected with the protagonist or cared enough about his tragically unhappy life to find his story interesting or moving.Had this film lived up to its promising roots I would have spent my time longing for Caden to find some sort of happy conclusion to his struggle. I would have felt sympathy and sorrow when he finally dies. As it was I spent my time longing for any conclusion so I could leave. I felt pity and in the end I was relieved when he died.This may have been forgivable had the message behind the film said something innovative and original. Instead the message behind this waste of time of a motion picture was not to waste your precious life analysing your misfortunes. I wasted two hours of my life watching a highly analytical film effectively telling me not to waste my time because analysis is fruitless! Frankly that message is pointless hypocritical and uninspired. I may as well have painted carpe diem on a wall and watched it dry.Moreover having decided to pass on this unhelpful message Kaufman's incessant tangents of unrelated surrealism were more distracting and confusing than quirky or interesting. Where there was symbolism to be found I was usually so uninterested that it only served to detract from the core meaning of the film.Maybe I have missed the point or lacked the patience to fully appreciate this film. I have asked myself this several times since seeing it especially since so many other reviewers seemed to enjoy and admire Kaufman's creation. But no matter how much I reconsider the film I always come to the same conclusion I wish it had been better. I wish I still had my money. I wish I could get those two hours back.My advice do not watch Synecdoche New York. Certainly do not pay to watch it. And at all costs avoid trying to pronounce the word Synecdoche!".

Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as usual. This time I also felt his body odor. Yuck!

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is like being forced to watch a very ugly naked man take a very very very long nap. At the beginning it's boring and a little odd but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it. As it goes on however the boredom turns to frustration as you just want to look away. Then the frustration turns to disgust as every crooked misshapen aspect imprints itself on your eyes. The disgust shifts into anger at why someone is doing this to you.

When Dianne Wiest shows up at the end of the movie playing an actress who first takes on the cleaning lady role and then replaces Caden as himself in the enormous warehouse play all you can do is wave the white flag of surrender to the labored narcissistic eccentricities of Charlie Kaufman.There are a few moments when this film doesn't suck and they're all due to the talented and skillful cast. Their work is even more impressive because they might as well have been reading out of a Lithuanian phone book as acting out the meaningless plot characterization or dialog of Synecdoche New York. Emily Watson also takes her top off.Some people may enjoy the sort of deliberately contrived strangeness on display here. I think that when anything can happen in a story nothing that does happen can have any significance or impact. If it had been revealed at the end of this movie that Caden Cotard was a robot a hermaphrodite or even his own daughter it would have made just as much sense as everything else in the film. There's literally NOTHING that would seem wrong out of place or discordant if it had been stuck in a scene. Caden could have been gang raped by sentient aardvarks the role of Adele could have been played by an orange tree or the guys from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure could have shown up and I wouldn't have blinked an eye.If that sounds like the sort of thing you'd like you're welcome to it.".

At the beginning it's boring and a little odd but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it. As it goes on however the boredom turns to frustration as you just want to look away. Then the frustration turns to disgust as every crooked misshapen aspect imprints itself on your eyes. The disgust shifts into anger at why someone is doing this to you.

Please read my review until that point if you want to hear a perspective that did not love the film.Synecdoche NY is a film that in theory sounds great but when shown to an audience ends up dull patronizing and repetitive. The ultimate flaw of the movie is the director and the incoherent story telling that takes place. I LOVE Phillip Seymour Hoffman Catherine Keener and Charlie Kaufman so I was very excited to sit down a movie involving all three. PSH and Catherine Keener shine but Kaufman's directing is atrocious.I'm sorry folks but this movie is simply too confusing to be enjoyed. The idea of the movie is great but when played out...ugh it just really shouldn't have been played out. I thought the movie was 4 hours instead of 2 and checked my watch a number of times to see when it would end. There are a number of movies on life and death that do not literally require a scene that comes 34 of the way through explaining what the hell you have been watching for the last hour and a half.I blame this on the directing and it being the debut of Charlie Kaufman as such. He was too close to the material and therefore couldn't tell what needed to be done to make the movie understandable let alone enjoyable.Kaufman attempts to weave an epic tale of a sick? theater director named Caden that takes us through his entire life. In the final act of his life the last 40 years he builds a replica of New York city to work through the issues he has through his life with gulp women. Sounds interesting enough right? It would be if we were ever shown this overarching narrative. Instead we are shown scenes that put together resemble this topic but really just confuse the hell out of the viewer.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT.The movie was frustrating to say the least. I'm not a lazy film viewer but this one used tricks instead of good direction to tell the story. It was confusing for the sake of confusing and quirky for the sake of being quirky.For starters is Caden sick? Of what? Is he terminally ill? My initial impression of the movie was that he was terminally ill given him urinating blood being frail having blemishes on his face and his wife fantasizing about him dying so she can move on. But then why is he the last to die? I spent half the movie thinking that in the last scene we would figure out he was already dead because of the initial impression of how sick he was. But he lived! Longer than anyone else! Unfortunately I think this was bad direction and missing scenes. It is the job of the director to explain whats going on in the movie and Kaufman either wasn't up to task or didn't recognize it because he wrote the story.Next why is the house Hazel purchased on fire? Not only is this stupid it's never explained. Sure someone here is probably going to chew me a new one because I don't understand metaphors but here's where I see a problem. The director tried to blend fantasy and reality but then made everything that occurred real. Having a house that was on fire makes no sense given that even the marriage dream sequence really happened. You can't ask me to suspend reality then punish me for doing so which the movie did quite often.Caden wins a Macarthur grant or some fellowship or something. Nowhere does the movie stipulate that this fake grant will allow a man to never produce another play in his life except his weird 40 year opus that no one gets to enjoy or have to support himself financially in any meaningful way again. I'd believe a million dollars tops. How long would that last in New York City? Hmmm. Three years for one person living. But to refurbish an entire warehouse into a replica of the city as well as support the staff and himself until death? COME ON. Kaufman should recognize that this is just utterly ludicrous to believe we should take this genius grant at face value for not working for 40 years? At least try to explain it with a line or two of dialogue. Christ you've gone on and on about every other imaginable topic that 2 sentences wouldn't kill you.The time sequencing requires someone to explain what's happening near the end of the movie. That Caden couldn't handle time appropriately and is why there were jumps in years that were not consistent or formulaic. One scene moves the story forward a year. The next 10 years. But wait I thought Caden had AIDS shouldn't he be dead by now? Move the scene to the beginning of the movie! I could go on and on why would some freak follow Caden around for 17 years? How did Caden have his daughters diary although she left years before she could have written any of it when he was standing in the attic of his old home? All of it put into one movie just makes it...stupid. The last insult was the worst Caden dies last!!! How in the hell did he outlive everyone? He was pissing blood at the beginning and seeing 5 or 6 doctors a week.I think Kaufman as a writer succeeds in leaps and bounds. But he shouldn't direct his own pieces because it was pretty clear he felt he didn't need to explain much of anything and expected the reader to sit back and allow it to happen. Better luck next time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Synecdoche New York ripped me off. It's not the dollarfifty I paid at the discount theater to which I'm referring. See generally speaking a director or any kind of artist for that matter makes one of two choices. I feel Charlie Kaufman lied to me about the choice he made. Choice one is that the director makes a movie intended to make me happy. Pretty images cute dialogue and a happy ending to wrap it all up. You know like most of the movies you and I and everyone likes. Choice two is the hard one. The artist portrays something ugly or unpleasant but hopes that in so doing he will give me something I value make me think or feel in a new way. Charlie Kaufman portrayed the less pleasant emotions of everyday people loneliness hopelessness confusion the dull fear of death. He did it using the intentionally confusing formula that seemed fresh and challenging in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich in which the viewer must tease out reality from fantasy. Now it just seems like busywork from a one trick pony. And he did it in ways that were intentionally unappealing. A few things such as the anachronistic dingy hospital scenes I might like to describe as artfully ugly. Mostly I would describe this movie as gratuitously ugly. But the main problem with Kaufman's effort is that he thought making a movie unpleasant in unusual ways WAS the point. He forgot to give me anything to make me feel that the uncomfortable twohourfourminute journey I made with him was worth taking. The main character is a hypochondriac and Kaufman portrayed this fear by showing me a whole bunch of tolerablebutdisgusting real and imagined scenes of his health and his body. I was tricked into believing that cringing through these ugly scenes would give me some sort of payoff in the end. Instead I was left with some vague trite morals at the end. All the world's a stage or something. Loneliness sucks or something. People are all different or all the same or something. Don't be selfindulgent or something. Everybody's confused about what they should do in life and wishes there were answers or something. Admittedly the above could be considered Underlying Themes. If kidnapped by sadistic high school English teachers I could probably write a fiveparagraph essay on the Underlying Themes in Synecdoche New York. So I'm sure that nothing I can say could potentially make Kaufman believe that this wasn't a deep movie. But to the best of my knowledge Kaufman isn't a philosopher and unless I'm missing something he didn't say anything new about these themes. Sure it's hard to say anything that's truly new. But what a deep movie can do is provoke selfexploration. When I go to a movie that provokes me in a certain way I find myself wanting to discuss those themes with my friends afterward and they usually find themselves wanting to do the same. After watching Synecdoche New York my friend and I found ourselves simply wanting to purge ourselves of the images of Caden's blood fecal matter skin diseases and gum surgery by talking about hair products. I guess if I wanted to defend this movie I'd say it portrays the reality of how ugly life can be sometimes. But it doesn't add any wisdom to that dialogue so I'd rather be reminded of the ugliness of life by doing something more productive. Like standing in the DMV line.".

	schema:headline " See this film!!!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The most exciting aspect of Synecdoche New York is that Charlie Kaufman is attempting greatness. The only real criticism you could level at this movie is that Kaufman tries to do too much. One should never fault a filmmaker for too much ambition. This is a first film by an untested director. For a freshman effort it is absolutely stunning in it's bravery and refusal to placate a mediocre consumer audience. This movie is unabashedly an art film first and an entertainment second. You must meet the work halfway and join Kaufman on his spiraling absurdist journey. In an era of artistic timidity this movie is like a cleansing breath of fresh air. Charlie Kaufman is not afraid to explore topics that most other filmmakers would rather not touch. I sense an almost Bunuel influence in Kaufman's obsession at pushing bodily decay in the audience's face. Make no mistake this film is about mortality and the end of life. A light date night at the movies this ain't! If you want to watch a true work of art that you can really engage with intellectually then you should definitely watch this picture. When Charlie Kaufman introduced the film at the Toronto Film Festival he described it as a conversation between himself and the viewer. That description is very apt. The piece has the exhilarating feel of a late night college bull session. It is a movie about everything and is not afraid to ponder the big questions while still employing a great deal of subversive and wry humor. If you like movies that take real chances than you should watch this picture. If you enjoyed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich you will savor this film as Kaufman going for broke. This movie is like a cinematic Rorschach test. To really enjoy this film you must have a high tolerance for metaphor and symbolism. Kaufman constantly plays with the narrative to bring forth subtext. This is a movie that cannot even be deciphered in one viewing. There is an accumulation of detail in this movie that is staggering. I defy the most eagleeyed viewer to catch all the important details the first time they view it. This film is such a rich construction and the constantly roving eye of the camera mirrors the anxiety of the protagonist as well as the anxiousness of the viewer as one tries to take it all in. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's minimalist performance as Caden Cotard will be unfairly derided in some circles as lazy. These unfortunate critics are not paying attention. Hoffman's character is so ground down by life that he barely has the energy to lift his head. His character is really just a fulcrum that other less neurotic characters spin around. The more Cotard tries to dramatize his life the less sense it makes to him. Time ravages his body as he keeps trying to encapsulate the whole of his experience in a massive work of art. The whole movie is about an act of creation. Cotard's need to make sense of his life through art mirrors the audience's need to understand Kaufman's complex layers of symbolism. Kaufmann is doing the most important job of an artist. He is asking questions without providing the answers. It is left to the audience to figure out what if any grand statement is being made by the piece. When the movie ended the strongest feeling I came away with was one of melancholy tempered by a certain sense of hope as well. Kaufman is a secret romantic and that ultimately is what I love about him. As bleak and full of despair as things become within the narrative the movie is ultimately comforting. The main character finds solace in another character that was not previously important to him. The final truth is that there is no truth. The fact that we die is what gives life meaning. As you get older everything is taken from you. Life is simply a transitory process. However that transitory quality gives it urgency and meaning. There is real resonance to be found in our connections with one another. I walked out of this picture in a sort of trance. It is one of the most important and exciting films to have been released this year. This is not a movie that you can like easily but it is possibly a film that you will come to love. I know it is a film that I will watch many times in an attempt to catch all the small bits of nuance and detail. How wonderful and thrilling it is to discover a work of art that defies easy categorization. What you take from the piece may be entirely different from what I take from it.

	onyx:emotionText "The most exciting aspect of Synecdoche New York is that Charlie Kaufman is attempting greatness. The only real criticism you could level at this movie is that Kaufman tries to do too much. One should never fault a filmmaker for too much ambition. This is a first film by an untested director. For a freshman effort it is absolutely stunning in it's bravery and refusal to placate a mediocre consumer audience. This movie is unabashedly an art film first and an entertainment second. You must meet the work halfway and join Kaufman on his spiraling absurdist journey. In an era of artistic timidity this movie is like a cleansing breath of fresh air. Charlie Kaufman is not afraid to explore topics that most other filmmakers would rather not touch. I sense an almost Bunuel influence in Kaufman's obsession at pushing bodily decay in the audience's face. Make no mistake this film is about mortality and the end of life. A light date night at the movies this ain't! If you want to watch a true work of art that you can really engage with intellectually then you should definitely watch this picture. When Charlie Kaufman introduced the film at the Toronto Film Festival he described it as a conversation between himself and the viewer. That description is very apt. The piece has the exhilarating feel of a late night college bull session. It is a movie about everything and is not afraid to ponder the big questions while still employing a great deal of subversive and wry humor. If you like movies that take real chances than you should watch this picture. If you enjoyed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich you will savor this film as Kaufman going for broke. This movie is like a cinematic Rorschach test. To really enjoy this film you must have a high tolerance for metaphor and symbolism. Kaufman constantly plays with the narrative to bring forth subtext. This is a movie that cannot even be deciphered in one viewing. There is an accumulation of detail in this movie that is staggering. I defy the most eagleeyed viewer to catch all the important details the first time they view it. This film is such a rich construction and the constantly roving eye of the camera mirrors the anxiety of the protagonist as well as the anxiousness of the viewer as one tries to take it all in. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's minimalist performance as Caden Cotard will be unfairly derided in some circles as lazy. These unfortunate critics are not paying attention. Hoffman's character is so ground down by life that he barely has the energy to lift his head. His character is really just a fulcrum that other less neurotic characters spin around. The more Cotard tries to dramatize his life the less sense it makes to him. Time ravages his body as he keeps trying to encapsulate the whole of his experience in a massive work of art. The whole movie is about an act of creation. Cotard's need to make sense of his life through art mirrors the audience's need to understand Kaufman's complex layers of symbolism. Kaufmann is doing the most important job of an artist. He is asking questions without providing the answers. It is left to the audience to figure out what if any grand statement is being made by the piece. When the movie ended the strongest feeling I came away with was one of melancholy tempered by a certain sense of hope as well. Kaufman is a secret romantic and that ultimately is what I love about him. As bleak and full of despair as things become within the narrative the movie is ultimately comforting. The main character finds solace in another character that was not previously important to him. The final truth is that there is no truth. The fact that we die is what gives life meaning. As you get older everything is taken from you. Life is simply a transitory process. However that transitory quality gives it urgency and meaning. There is real resonance to be found in our connections with one another. I walked out of this picture in a sort of trance. It is one of the most important and exciting films to have been released this year. This is not a movie that you can like easily but it is possibly a film that you will come to love.

Sadly obsession grandiosity megalomania and hypochondria are not attractive qualities unless punctured by wit and irony and Synecdoche does not have such characters to put it into perspective so the film is just as overblown and barmy as its hero's insane project.

	schema:headline " no conventional score applies to Synecdoche New York";
	schema:reviewBody "It is very difficult to conceive of a movie much more complex than synecdoche. Yet oddly I have no desire to see it again just so that I might resolve something. Not because I disliked it but because so many scenes were indelibly imprinted within my mind such that I get it. That is I get it as much as can be expected. My first impression as the movie started was that dialogue was the entertainment. Actually for this reason i.e. dialogue I would see this movie again. However because the dialogue heightened my awareness of the same it became easily perceptible when dialogue began to yield its place to various prop devices as the centerpiece of entertainment. I'm not necessarily using the phrase prop devices as disapproval because we sometimes present ourselves as silly when we for example indicate that such and such should not exist or should be replaced by such and such. In many cases we would have then simply created another movie. In this case maybe we should make our own movie. That's when some of us would realize just how difficult it is to actually make one of these things. Some of the devices literary or cinematographic used by Kaufman were stunning or spectacular! For example the voice of Adele's Cotard's wife played by Catherine Keener miniature paintings and the paintings themselves were used to great effect. The creation of a New York within New York presents very interesting and creative cinematography. The work makeup costume and lighting performed to create the illusion of aging characters is also very well done. And while the seemingly nonstop nested twists and turns might make one dizzy it is just this unexpected variety that provided a journey instead of just another movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman continues to deliver. I found his performance to be communicative and almost accessible to the touch as one is almost unaware that he is acting. This gives us the feeling that we know him. We then become comfortable with him and finally empathetic.This movie comes at you in layers of interwoven humanness. Every message invited the audience to think about themselves their families their lives their legacy their meaning and their relationships. Caden Cotard main character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman was chronically and strangely ill. There was a scene where Cotard after receiving permission from his wife Adele urinated in a sink while his wife and young daughter were both present in the room present but not watching. His urine appeared to be mostly blood yet he offered no reaction at all and simply carried on as if the absurd had become the expected. His sickness seemed to symbolize the loneliness that is concomitant with the very individuality necessary in order to qualify as an autonomous human being. If we die alone are we in fact alone? Of course this movie is about much more than that. No doubt most of the criticism of this movie will be that it is far too ambitious. But what do we want? Do we want movies that only fit within our conventional range of pace dialogue boundaries and cinematography? It seems that conventional movies will continue to appear with great frequency so they will be readily available but movies like Synecdoche are rare. Nevertheless there were quite a few things that I did not like. While Phillip Seymour Hoffman very convincingly depicted the kind of leg tremors that might be caused by neuropathy I found his enactment of a seizure to be so unconvincing that I actually laughed aloud. Interestingly enough there was a gentleman one row up and about 10 seats to my right who clearly did not like my idea of funny.  Although one got the strong impression that the gentleman expected everyone within 200 feet of him to synchronize with his idea of good comedic timing as he outscored us all with his use of laughter aloud  And that is one of the effects of the complexity of this film that is though this film might be easily regarded as despairing there were many funny moments where laughter erupted even while surrounded by loss and brokenness just like real life. Sometimes though brilliance might not be brilliance sometimes it just might be simple depravity disguised as something intellectual and modern. For example while I love Tom Noonan's work in most everything he does I did not like Kaufman's wording of his character's pitch to play Cotard.  Obviously this play is not a real play but a montage of a construct that represents the mind fears and philosophies of Cotard. While I would prefer dialogue that allows for the existence of things like intellectualism the intelligentsia modernity and the avantgarde without requirement for homosexual references don't mistake my preference for a suggestion that anything should be changed in this movie. Since Cotard was not homosexual parts of the movie seem to suggest it par for the course that all men somehow contend with homosexuality. This is not true. This is the movie that Charlie Kaufman wanted to make. No one can say that it should be anything other than what it is. I doubt that any of us will agree on much regarding this movie as we don't agree on much regarding life.".

	schema:headline " The New Charlie Kaufman More Ambition and Less Joy";
	schema:reviewBody "Synecdoche New York feels like the work of a man gripped by fear grief and a sense that time is running out. The most ambitious of Charlie Kaufman's movies by a long shot it is also the bleakest. Though Kaufman's work has always had a streak of comic miserablism running through it his earlier movies are so creative and original that you feel invigorated by watching them. They're consistently delightful and in the case of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind even profound.Synecdoche New York certainly aspires to profundity but it's lost the sense of delight. It follows its protagonist theater director Caden Cotard for about forty years of one bad thing after another. The only good thing that happens to himhe wins a MacArthur Genius Grantturns out to be a curse in disguise as he feels he must prove himself worthy of the grant and spends the rest of his life conceiving and rehearsing a massive theater piece that never opens. Rather than engaging with life he becomes lost in the world that he has created building an exact replica of New York City inside a New York warehouse. The last part of the movie is a blur of deaths and funerals both real and reenacted.Philip Seymour Hoffman perhaps the best sadsack actor working today plays Caden. He gives a fearless performance but he's maybe too passive in the rolenot displaying enough of the madgenius ambition that propels Caden to create such a huge work of art. Catherine Keener who was so sparky and vibrant in Being John Malkovich plays Caden's first wife as a glumfaced shrew with awful hair.Brightening things up a bit is Samantha Morton giving a very charming performance as the guileless boxoffice girl Hazel. And in a brilliant bit of doubling Emily Watson plays the actress who plays Hazel in the playwithinthemovie. Hope Davis in a small role as Caden's therapist seems to have wandered in from another less dour Kaufman movieshe'd fit in with the mad scientists of Eternal Sunshine. For me the scene that encapsulates Synecdoche New York shows Caden working on his magnum opus late at night. He has hired thousands of actors and now needs to tell them what their roles are so he writes short scenarios on pieces of paper and distributes them to his cast the next morning. As the camera pans over the slips of paper which cover the floor of the warehouse as far as the eye can see we note that every scenario is sad and depressing You were raped last night. You just lost your job. Thousands of papers and not a happy one in the bunch.If the movie took a skeptical attitude toward Caden's belief that only unhappy situations can make for great art I probably wouldn't have a problem with it. But because the movie instead reinforces the idea that depression  genius and genius  depression my entire belief system rebels against it. People have called Synecdoche New York a profound commentary on the life of artistsbut if being an artist was always like that who would ever choose to become one? One could see parallels between Kaufman's life and his protagonist's like Caden Kaufman has won a coveted honor and his first project after winning is deliberately big and ambitious. In my opinion Kaufman richly deserved his Oscar for the Eternal Sunshine screenplay. But he won't deserve any more Oscars if he spends the rest of his life selfconsciously trying to make Great Art at the expense of the light and witty touch that is the reason we came to love him in the first place.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yi jang chun shui xiang dong liu was a great commercial success of its' time. After watching it it is easy to understand why it is simply so easy to love and hate the main characters who are wonderfully played by Yang Bai and Tao Jin. Melodramas as strong as this are usually pretty ridiculous but not when the characters are like members of your own family.In the beginning we have a happy family who works in a factory in Shanghai of the 30's. When the Japanese attack the husband leaves her wife mother and son behind to fight against the cruel invaders. For eight years they are separated. In that time the waiting wife has to face all kinds of horrors of the war and poverty while husband marries another woman a rich one in another city. He becomes a bourgeois who lives a sweet life far away from war. So the film deals with the subject that has always been so popular among the leftwinged film makers the comparison between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It has the same message as Die Freundlosse Gasse and Konets SanktPeterburga etc. but it has a far more elegant way of telling it.The mother has too many selfpitying lines and the music becomes very irritating at times. These are about all faults there is. That is a excellent effort for a threehourlong feature. I wonder if we Europeans have ever managed to make as powerful melodrama as this.Highly recommended to those who still believe in great emotions. Others beware.".

	schema:headline " Great book great movie  contains Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "The best film arguably made of its genre. They really don't make movies like this anymore even the socalled heartwrenching movies of today do not have the ability to stir the great emotions of sympathy like this one. I couldn't help but cry buckets towards the ending of the show. I had to contain my overwhelming emotions as the mother finally ended her life in the symbolic river which flows east. The river symbolizes many things in this movie as in accordance with the title a river that flows east reminds one of home hope and a battle against the invading forces of the Japanese. It represents hope for Bai Yang a great actress the home for Tao Jin as he thinks fondly of his home before he is slowly seduced by the riches and decadence of Shanghai. I first read the abridged version of the book when I was about 15 or 14 and it made a great impression on my mind it was one of the very few Chinese classics that I read and unlike other classics it moved me to the core. Strangely I still remembered it at this age and when I discovered the tape I just had to watch it. The book is equally moving do read it if you have a chance.The best scene for me was when Bai Yang braced herself against the howling storm and wind to prevent the entire hut from being blown down. It twisted my poor heartstrings mercilessly. The other scenes like how cruelly the fatherinlaw was made to hang and till the fields despite barely being able to stand or walk also aggravated the wretchedness of the situation. The old woman who could not bear standing in the pool of frosty water who took the risk of escaping and got shot eventually added to the memory of the cruelties of the aggressors. The worst part of course was when she eventually found out that her husband had forgotten about the family altogether and was leading a decadent lifestyle in Shanghai with his new wife and mistress. The ever sacrificial mother and her stoicism naturally crumbled as her hopes of love and a reunion are dashed by the coldheartedness of Zhongliang's words.I have to disagree with comments that the film exhibited the proletariatbourgeois divide as the film was made just after the Japanese Occupation and the film was more to highlight the atrocities of war and the hardships the people had to endure all intricately bound together with the subthemes of patriotism and love. There was little notion of Communism in China during that period that came later on. To emphasize that the whole deal about the richpoor divide was the subplot would be wrong as that was not the whole idea nor was it an idea at all to be Communist in his take. The sympathy for the poor and stoic characters is common in most literature and shouldn't be always confused with Communism particularly in precommunist literature.Lastly I'd like to say that it is easily one of the most moving old Chinese movies which will be remembered by many generations to come. More importantly virtues like patriotism and selfsacrifice would perhaps remain relics of the ancient theatre which would remain solely the stronghold of such films which modern films would fail to emulate. Go watch it!".

But the mission hits a snag when the researcher disappears forcing the government to send her estranged daughter Mayumi  a debtridden bar hostess and the only other person the time machine will accept  back in time to find out what happened. Mayumi arrives at the peak of Japan's bubble economy and finds a society obsessed with material wealth and profligate spending. With her warnings of impending doom falling on deaf ears Mayumi's frustrated efforts to find her mother suggest some kind of conspiracy at work at the highest levels of government.

	schema:reviewBody "It was an amazingly wonderful movie. You must see it a hundred times.This movie is about the time travel to the 1990 in Japan where Japan had the Bubble economy. The Bubble economy started in the late 1980s and lasted until the early 1990s. During the period people spent as much money as possible it was very easy to get a job like students chose a company unlike companies choose students now workers' salary was very high young girls' fashion was very unique. Ex. they had long black hair and their hair was the same length. It was called Wanren. They didn't put layers. At first they had no bangs but later they started to put a few pieces of bangs down and curled the rest of bangs backward and some girls got a very fine curly perm. Female players wore a very tight dress that emphasizes their body line called Bodycon. Young people liked going to a disco. There appeared boys who pick up and drop off girls and had no more progress than that. They were called Asshee. The dessert Tiramisu was popular at that time. Talking about this movie it's set on March 2007. In the movie Japan has a financial crisis like it has 800 trillion yen debt. One guyHiroshi Abe who works for the Finance Ministry asks the daughterRyoko Hirosueof the inventorHiroko Yakushimaru of the time machine to go to the 1990 to save her mother who hasn't come back to the present and stop the breakdown of the Japan's bubble economy. It's a comedy. I laughed a lot. And some TV personalities such as Ai Iijima Naoko Iijima Akiko Yagi Hiroko Moriguchi Ramosu Rui act themselves at that time. Communication gap between a girl from 2007 and people in 1990 1.Club it means a place to dance and drink now but in 1990 it meant a hostess bar. 2....nakunai? people in 1990 were confused wondering it has a positive or negative meaning. 3.Yabai it's used to mean very good among young people now but people in 1990 thought it was a bad meaning. 4. Hirosue from 2007 said to Abe in 1990  I will call you when I get to the station It's a natural conversation now because we have a cellphone but people in 1990 didn't have a cell phone so when they met up with someone they had to set a specific meeting place. Differences in fashion Hirosuefrom 2007 said to the girlKazue Fukiishi in 1990 mentioning her fashion. 1.Mayuge Futo! Your eyebrow is very wide and hairy! 2.Fiku Pitapita!Your clothes is too tight! 3.Dasa! Sono Buatsui Pansuto!Your stockings are too thick and not cool!During the Bubble economy I was little so I didn't remember or know about it very well but I've heard of it on TV or something so when I saw this movie I felt kind of nostalgia. I want to know more about the society in the bubble economy. If you experienced that age please tell me what you remember about it.".

The early 90s were a great time to be in Japan  unemployment was almost nil banks were loaning money at ridiculously low interest rates property values were sky high company bonuses were huge tight bodycon dresses super mini skirts and permed hair were all the rage and the yen value was at an all time high.Of course the bubble era 19861990 would burst towards the late 90's and Japan would plunge into a deep recession from which they are only just now beginning to recover from.Taking a page from Robert Zemeckis' influential Back To The Future series Bubble Fiction is a timetraveling SciFi comedy that waxes nostalgic about the Bubble Keiki of economic prosperity and decadence that Japan experienced during that time and how many Japanese long for a return to that happiness.The story begins in the present and revolves around the recent reported death of a brilliant genius Tanaka Mariko 80's Kadokawa Film Heroine Yakushimaru Hiroko who was a home appliance technician and amateur inventor. This couldn't have happened at a worst time for her troubled daughter Mayumi the fetching Hirosue Ryoko whom had recently come back home to live with her after a particularly bad romantic breakup. Mayumi's previous boyfriend had borrowed money from Yakuza loansharks and fled leaving her to pay off his enormous mounting debts. Forced to take various odd jobs including a hostess at a Ginza Bar to pay off the debts she is continually hounded by a particularly persistent chimbira Yakuza underling Tajima KeiichiGekidan Hitori who oddly enough was a former bank employee until his bank went bankrupt.Mayumi is soon visited by a mysterious Zaimushou MOFMinistry of Finance officer Shimokawaji Isao Abe Hiroshi. He tells her that her mother is not dead but rather stuck in the past in the year 1990. It seems Tanaka Mariko had developed a time machine built within a drumcylinder washing machine  hence the title and had gone into the past to try and convince thenFinance Minister Serizawa the great character actor Fukiishi Kazue to reconsider his disastrous policy decision that plunged the economy into ever increasing debt.Shimokawaji and his team had determined that Mayumi's similar body type to her mother and same genetic DNA make her the only one that can use the machine safely to go back in time. With promise that all her debts will be wiped clean Mayumi agrees to go back in time to get her mother back and stop Serizawa.Along the way she encounters a young Shimokawaji who agrees reluctantly to help her find her mother. Hilarity ensues as Mayumi struggles to adapt to a precellphonepreinternet Japan. She also unexpectedly reunites with her father who had abandoned her while still a child.The screenplay by Kimizuka Ryoichi Odoru Dai Shosakan My Lover Is A Sniper is good fun in a Austin Powers sort of way but doesn't go far enough in exploring the time and explaining just how different an atmosphere it was.While there are numerous funny fish out of water scenes in the movie that explore the cultural evolution which had occurred since 1990 Japanese slang clothing mannerisms they don't go far enough in exploring all of the possibilities.There were so many missed opportunities for ironic humor that could have been done similar to Forrest Gump.Baba Yasuo's direction is fast and breezy and he incorporates a lot of neat visual effects throughout the movie Tokyo's skyline is deconstructed before our eyes back to the 1990's skyline the Yokohama Bay Bridge is also still in preconstruction phase Japanese cars and mini cars are replaced with their 1990 counterparts and the surrounding billboards and signs reflect the products of the time. It's so very natsukashi to revisit the Japan of that time.Current Talents Ijima Ai Ijima Naoko Popular TV Newscaster Yagi Akiko and former JLeague Soccer star Ramos Ruy all have funny cameos in the movie playing themselves in context to the time i.e. before they became famous.I'm a huge fan of Hirosue WasabiRenai Shashin and am continually impressed with her ability to bring her unique sense of girlish charm and likability to her roles. Abe Survive Style 5 Tao No Tsuki Adiantum Blue is also very likable in his role as Shimokawaji. They are supported by an equally stellar cast including Fujiki Kazue Ito Yuko Ogi Shigemitsu Moriguchi Hiroko and Ibu Masato.While it was nice seeing Yakushimaru Hiroko in the role of Mayumi's mother I did find it as a bit of odd casting considering that Yakushimaru is mainly known for her 80s movies like Sailor Fuku To Kikanjyu and Tantei Monogatari. I would have thought a more clever casting would have been for Harada Tomoyo who was in the time leaping movie Toki O Kakeru Shojo.Bubble Fiction is not a perfect movie to be sure and the last half hour in particular will definitely try anyone's patience for believable drama. That being said I did find the movie enjoyable on the whole and worth a look at especially for those who remember what life was like in Japan at the time. We can't relive the past but can at least enjoy the memories.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's no coincidence that just as the perception of the breakdown of family and traditional roles led to nostalgia for Jidaigeki period costume dramas a few years earlier the midto late 2000s similarly saw a surprising amount of timetravel films in Japanese cinema. It was as if the desire to escape from the current period of economic uncertainty and social upheaval was so strong that the only way to restore a sense of order and pride in the nation was to really literally go back in time.Some of these films like Katsuyuki Matohiro's Summer Time Machine Blues 2005 used the idea simply as an excuse for comic adventure while others like Metro Ni Notte 2006 exhibited a disturbing escapist longing to not only turn back the clock and seek refuge in an idealised version of the past but expressed an almost wishfulfilment desire to trace the roots of the malaise and actually alter events  and even the outcome of the war  so that the crisis in the future might never happen. Yasuo Baba's 2007 timeline shifting comedy Bubble Fiction Boom or Bust manages however to indulge a bit of nostalgia for the style music and attitudes of the decadent profligacy of the 1990s boom period in a way that put the seismic cultural shift that has occurred in the intervening period into stark relief while at the same time finding a very humorous way to point out exactly where it all went wrong.Mayumi Tanaka is a not terribly bright nightclub hostess who is in mourning for her recently deceased mother and in grave financial difficulties her boyfriend having skipped town leaving her with a huge debt to pay off the local criminal loan sharks. Mayumi is not the only person with financial problems in 2007 however. The whole Japanese nation is on the brink of complete economic meltdown and  strange as it may seem  Mr. Shimokawaji an official from the Ministry of Finance believes that the debt and griefstricken Mayumi could be the saviour of the nation. But what is it about a photo of her mother Mariko in an old newspaper from 1990 that interests the government official so greatly and leads him to put his faith in Mayumi? Well it's just that her mother looks exactly the same in the 17 year old photograph as she did a week ago when she died.Mariko it seems has stumbled upon a time machine while working on research and development of household appliances. Having converted a washing machine into a time machine Mariko has taken it upon herself to skip back to 1990 to try to convince Mr Serizawa a prominent minister in the Japanese government not to make a crucial announcement about new property legislation and banking deregulation that will end up causing so much damage to the Japanese economy of the future. Mariko has disappeared however clearly without having achieved her goal and only her daughter has the necessary family connection and right shape and size if not the brain cells and financial acumen to go back and help complete the mission which will not only erase Japan's debt but also the 2 million yen that the loan shark is pressuring her for. That's the kind of motivation Mariko understands.The science of building a time machine then is a little bit fuzzy  detergent is added to the washing machine just in case  but obviously there's quite a bit of intentional humour in the treatment here that helps the rather more serious questions to come out in the wash so to speak. With the impact of the economic crisis an unpleasant reality for many there is certainly some amount of wishing to turn back the clock involved here but the film is under no illusions about what really is the underlying cause of the banking meltdown. And no despite what we've been lead to believe it's not all Gordon Brown's fault. While the film has considerable fun with 1990's styles at the fashion and the thickness of women's eyebrows glamorous discos and mobile phones the size of bricks Bubble Fiction Boom or Bust's funny conspiracy theory action drama actually makes it quite clear who is to blame for spending us into a debt crisis. We all are.Maybe I'm just getting older then but when exactly did 1990 become a year to get all nostalgic about? Bubble Fiction does well however to capture the heady decadence of the time in the period detail with some cultural references that are specific to Japanese culture and celebrities but with music style and attitudes and extravagant spending that will be recognisable to everyone. But were men back in 1990 really such lecherous and sleazy operators as Shimokawaji the official from the Ministry of Finance? Actually don't answer that one...Bubble Fiction Boom or Bust does inevitably stretch credibility as much as any film that meddles with timetravel highjinks and alternative timeline paradoxes throwing a good global conspiracy in there for good measure and it does draw what seems to be a rather simplistic moral platitude out of the resolution Work hard and look after your family but in reality it actually has a good point to make and it does so in a clever and often very funny way. And after all they've been through who can deny them a little bit of wish fulfilment.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is about a mother and a daughter team going back in a time machine the mother invented to 1990 when Japan was experiencing an economic bubble.The year is 2007 and Japan's national debt is rising above 8 trillion yen. Isao Shimokawaji Hiroshi Abe sees that Japan will be bankrupt in 2 years. He learns that his ex girlfriend Mariko Hiroko Yakushimaru has accidentally invented a time machine while designing a front loading washing machine. He asks her to go back to March of 1990 when the Japanese government announced a tightening of real estate transactions which triggered the collapse of the bubble economy to stop the passing of this law. She obliges but has lost contact after she gets there. Shimokawaji then asks Mariko's daughter Mayumi Ryoko Hirosue to follow her mother to investigate what happened. Mayumi is sent back to 1990 and contacts Shimokawaji of that era. He of course doesn't know who she is but together they gradually find out their true relationship where her mother is and what was the true intention behind the passing of the law.There is another famous Japanese time travel movie called Girl who leaped through time but this is done with different take on how people react when they become time travelers. Two women are sent back in time but their reaction to the trip are completely different. Somehow the daughter convinces Shimokawaji to buy into her plan by giving him enough evidence to show that she really is from the future. While situations are exploited to their max to get the comical effect the writer of this story was probably seeing a more serious side to his story. This can be seen where Shimokawaji of 1990 express to Mayumi Then the people 17 years from now are feeling that Japan is no longer a good country with no bright prospects for its future. and Mayumi replies I don't know but the future you seems to think so.. This probably sums up the feeling of Japanese people in 2007. The culprit of the economic collapse in this movie was not accidental but was planned by greedy international bankers and investment bankers who had deep connections in the Japanese government. Although there're no proof to this but it is no secret that one of the first western envoy to Japan Thomas Grubber was a Freemason and although they've financed Satsuma and Choshu clan in the Meiji reform it failed to have the kind of effect they had in the Russian revolution. It's also no secret that most of the Japanese prime ministers were masons like Shigeru Yoshida who's adopted family was Japanese outpost of the British East India company and the grandfather of recent prime minister Yukio Hatoyama was a grand mason of the Japanese lodge. Its plausible that such grand scheme is not without its purpose and complete economic control of the country might indeed have been part of its agenda. Otherwise events like the recent theft of 2.4 trillion yen by Ichiro Ozawa doesn't make much sense. This is way too much money for any one person's need to live well for himself.So the movie while kept light hearted has many facets to its story and is a very entertaining piece.This is a great movie and is highly recommended for viewing for all audiences.".

I didn't know how to write a review without referring to the story more closely then the changing history of the 20th century plays an important role.The main character nicknamed Chico is not exactly an angel. Through his father he is raised as a true communist fighting for the world revolution. Chico is originally born in Bolivia but is of JewishHungarianSpanish origin. During his life he acquires maybe a dozen languages and as many nationalities.It is quite painful to follow this character through many failed revolutions BoliviaChile to name a few and many failed identities Secret Agent Journalist Mercenary until he joins the Croatian army during the war against Serbia.This is the breaking point for the character and the watcher. Where the siege of Vukovar is shown with detailed cruelty.I like this movie because the main character is searching for a just cause to fight for realising the more he takes part in the conflicts the more he looses a clear cause. He tries to take refuge in his many identities as a Jew Christian Hungarian Bolivian Journalist Soldier but there is no redemption and no escape as to all his fights are vain.The drawback to this film is that at some points this message doesn't really come clearly out. Chico is very enthusiastic about war speaking with terrorists like he is speaking to friends. He crosses the line between morality and amorality many times.The photography is realistic coarse grained sometimes a little bit cheesy looking. The scenes in Yugoslavia are nothing but terrifying. Real TV news scenes are interspersed giving the movie an even more realistic touch.To some persons maybe it seems too superficial to condense all revolutionary conflicts of the second half of the 20th century into one character but it is well done.This movie is not for kids. For historic interested people it is a must go. But also the performance of the main character is worth the admission.".

Given the fact that the film is shot in multiple locations and in many languages Spanish English Hungarian Croatian German and more it is extremely demanding of the viewer not one minute of concentration can be spared to attain the impact of the message writerdirector Ibolya Fekete spreads before us.Chico Eduardo Rzsa Flores on whose life this film is based and who stuns with his acting skills begins the film as a young boy living in Chile the son of a Bolivian Catholic mother and a Hungarian Jewish father and is caught up in the revolutions of the 1960s very much under the influence of Che Guevara's teachings. He family is Communist but Catholic ! forced to flee Pinochet's Chile and the turnover with Allende and though not speaking any language but Spanish Chico goes to Europe as a young man whose goal is journalism but whose convictions embrace revolution as the means to alter the future. In his confusing role of journalistfreedom fighter he becomes intimately involved with the revolutions in Hungary Albania Israel Croatia and the Balkan War with the Yugoslavian decimation of the 1990s.Throughout his travels from revolution to revolution first as a reporter but always ending up as a freedom fighter we meet a huge cast of characters a cast representing both sides of each revolution and the lines between identities become blurred to the extent that it is impossible to identify the two sides at odds. It is here that Fekete makes his strongest statement war is atrocious cruel meaningless destructive brutal and foolish. Chico sees it all yet continues to actively participate in the killing and the mayhem all the while feeling the pull of his Catholicism and even his Jewish heritage bifurcating his emotional commitment.The huge cast passes in front of our eyes so quickly that few are present long enough to evaluate as actors. One exception stands out Richie Varga plays Jimmie a American from Chicago who steps into the final battle of the film and leaves an indelible impression with his good looks and his sensitive portrayal of a soul searching for meaning in the mess of war. Easily the star of the film is the Chico of Eduardo Rzsa Flores a man who made it through all the changes and chances of the story and maintains the ability to transmit his puzzling life to us in a verismo manner. This is a film that is very difficult to follow just as are the various revolutions and wars in countries that are forever changing boundaries and names. But in the end it teaches us a lot about the concept of 'why revolution' and even more about the absurdity of war. Burningly alive cinema this film is recommended for those who need to understand our global condition from the 1960s to the present. Grady Harp".

Life is hard and definitely not romantic when you are in the trenches fighting a superiour enemy. But life is not miserable I found the other side of war  the humour the laughter and the absurdity a bit scarce in this film. Well the absurdity did come through.I found the film complicated like life the way it should be. The film was never preachy quite a feat considering the intensity with which Chico embraced life according to his principles. I liked Chico even when I didn't agree with him the depiction of Yugoslavia and the Croatian struggle within it was moving but very much lacking in perspective choices are difficult when one's feet are in the fire and perspective comes with time and distance. Yugoslavia was the real victim the US and Germany were the real criminals and the poor Serbians Croatians and Bosnians were very much the pawns. Pawns that had lived peacefully and admirably until the West engineered the economic collapse of Yugoslavia. The references to Che Guevara's book Guerrilla Warfare which so influenced Chico's character might be completely lost in todays generation and on a North American audience. But it would be great for people to see this film and be exposed to a perspective not doctored by the corporate media and the pentagon to get a real feeling about the complexities of war.

	schema:reviewBody "At the outset I'll say I love films with some basis in historical events. The problem is of course that the more a film commits itself to historical events the more a review tends to refer to those events rather than the film.Firstly what I like about this film is that it doesn't try to appease any group or be politically correct. It doesn't go for the soft option as many other recent movies about recent wars doie there is no good or bad both side commit atrocities. Such liberal soppiness is misleading and directly opposed to historical fact and common sense. There are aggressors and there are victims even though the lines of demarcation are occasionally blurred. This film in a way refers back to the films of commitment made in the 1930s in Hollywood or Latin America in the 1960s.Similarly people usually rewrite history to suit their worldview. I note that another reviewer blamed the Yugoslav War on US and German imperialism and that the poor Serbians Croatians and Bosnians were their pawns that had lived peacefully and admirably until the West engineered the collapse of Yugoslavia. What planet did that come from? The Croatians and the Serbians have not got on in since the turn of the 20th century as World War 1 and 2 show. Yugoslavia  both pure and post WW2 was very much held together by force and intimidation. That's a historical fact. If the various ethnic groupings had got on the force of violence that erupted in the Yugoslavian War would not have occurred. That's common sense. I assume such views are based on ones internal beliefs. In this case its standard old style claptrap leftism which unfortunately gives leftism a bad name.History is written by the victors and in Yugoslavia after 1944 the Serbians once again took control of the country. Their history which was passed out as historical fact for the next 50 years was they were leftists and the Croatians were all fascists therefore you should support us in this war. The reality of course is that the Yugoslav army and irregulars in the recent war were dominated by Serbian nationalists seeking a greater Serbia and using ethnic cleansing and murder as a means to achieve this not to mention the fact that during World War 2 up to 1944 in any event most of the Communist Partizans were in fact Croatian.The beauty of course is the film is attempting to overcome the conventionally held history. It doesn't deal with past history though but rather with what is happening now. By dealing with history now the film sheds light on some of the lies that have been passed out as historical fact.The central character Chico is a man of contradictions. A child of a Hungarian Jewish father and a Spanish Catholic mother he is a child of the 1960s Latin revolutions and raised in a leftist family. So he is a Communist but a practicing Catholic he goes to a Catholic priest for confession but prays at the weeping wall he is a humanist but advocates war.These supposed contradictions always existed within people. People are molded from many historical events and social forces surrounding them. The only place pure ideologies exist are in philosophical arguments between half smart raconteurs or in undergrad university assignments . ie you cant believe in that if you believe in that etc. This film never backs away from commitment but it does subtlety and sometimes not so subtlety suggest that there is another side. Accordingly you don't get the feeling you are being preached at whereas you might from this review.The film takes you on Chico's journey through causes around the world like a frenzied 20th century Don Quixote looking for meaning. Chico's humanity ultimately leads him to Yugoslavia and the Croatian Homeland War in the 1990s. And even though it is not a ideologically correct war as his father tells him he knows within himself that he must side with the oppressed.Chico searches and is redeemed but is he content or is he saddened and scarred? At times it seems that Chico like a Zelig was at all the important late 20th century events and the film seems to make comment on them. On that level the film is not always successful its hard enough commenting on one situation. The film is more successful as a personal odyssey through tumultuous events.There are some standard Hollywood war movie clichs ie the outnumbered and besieged forces the sing a long etc but but they are downplayed and I sometimes wonder if clichs became clichs because they actually occurred in times of war. What underpins the whole film though is the upfront in your face reality of it all ... like Sam Fuller with a handheld camera. The photography is not pretty which suits the picture perfectly although I wouldn't have minded a few more scene setting shots. The docudrama works well at drawing you into the story whilst distracting you from the budgetary limitations of the film. The docu is the newsreel footage of the war whilst the drama is Chico's journey both physically and spiritually and people he meets on the way. This is a war film that deals with people rather than action  there is little action and when it does come it is over quickly.The acting is fine and Eduardo Rozsa Flores plays Chico effortlessly not surprisingly as Chico is based on Flores own life in part! Flores fought globe trotted and eventually found a cause in the Croatian Homeland War. The direction  by Ibolya Fekete is handled nicely and the action is gritty. The real stand out though is the directors juxtaposition you have to love that word even if it is overused of live action with news footage.If you want to be confronted and challenged ... watch this.".

I was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting. However I was disappointed by this film. Chico seemed fragmentary with the main character Ricardo staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. As could be expected no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame. The excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained. The result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in various countries.".

I was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting. However I was disappointed by this film. Chico seemed fragmentary with the main character Ricardo staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. As could be expected no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame. The excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained. The result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in various countries.";

It's almost opposite to The Hurt Locker which I honestly dislike on that matter. Ibolya Fekete narrate her story allowing movie watcher to determine who is write and who is wrong. And this is not an easy decision... it's not like a primitive story about straight and heroic American soldiers Hurt Locker.Also people in 'Chico' knows what they are fighting for. They may be wrong and they are cruel but the are not like Americans brought to Iraq by obscure political reasons of W.W...The more you see 'Chico' the more you start to empathize to its main hero... and you're becoming devastated together with him.I suspect though that it would be harder to understand this movie for people who were not born in USSR or other communist country who didn't hear their propaganda for years.".

The protagonist comes from a Chilean intellectual family that idolizes all things socialist but the family's flight to Hungary following the 1973 coup in Chile lets them see the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. The peoples of Eastern Europe soon throw off the chains of Soviet domination and look to the US as a beacon of freedom but the protagonist still remembers the US intervention in his native country. The moral gray area becomes apparent with the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s.The movie doesn't moralize instead simply letting the viewer form hisher own opinion about the sequence of events. It's hard to truly take sides when one sees the raids on people's homes in Chile and later the bulletriddled buildings in the former Yugoslavia. I recommend the movie.".

You won't find a 'how to' here but all the small moves and incidents rang true to me and the result in the end seems quite plausible to me at least.

	schema:reviewBody "Life as We Know It is predictable. Not breaking news. 3 years ago Josh Duhamel as Messer and Katherine Heigl as Holly have a set up date by their best friends Peter and Alison Hayes MacArthur and Christina Hendricks that terminates in Holly's Smart Car. Holly despises Messer way too much. Life happens and tragedy unfolds. Peter and Alison die in a car accident. In their will unbeknownst to Messer and Holly the Novaks' name them as legal guardians to their 1 yearold daughter Sophie. Reluctantly Messer and Holly agree to move into the Novaks' house and raise Sophie until they can figure this out. Did Alison and Peter know something that Holly and Messer were clueless to? Do they fall in love and transform into loving parents? Come on we're smart and have seen our share of romantic comedies. Narrative surprise is not the strong suit of Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson's screenplay. In spite of all this Life as We Know It is touching romantic comedy. Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel are awesome and have a natural chemistry. Deitchman and Robinson's story strongly evolves. Director Greg Berlanti expertly orchestrates the right tone. Although Life is romantic comedy the set up is heart wrenching tragedy. The future of orphaned Sophie played by Brooke and Kiley Liddell hangs in the balance of whether Heigl and Duhamel can get over themselves. Heigl has a charming vulnerability and authenticity as Holly who has dreams of expanding her bakeshop and dearly misses Alison her personal rock. Duhamel is a nice surprise. He casually inhabits Messer the Player who really has a big heart by the numbers. However Duhamel never overplays embodying humanity and humor. With Duhamel we cheer for Messer's transformation. At the story arc he confesses to Heigl Together Somehow we're a family. At times we're smarter than the screenplay. From the beginning we see through Messer's jerk facade and distinguish the good man that he is and great guy he can be. Holly is too obsessed being annoyed to see the obvious. Fortunately Heigl and Duhamel are smarter than the scripthinting at the underlying love Holly and Messer have always had. Chemistry conquers a lot. Validation comes when Baby Whisperer Amy great Britt Flatmo says You guys make an awesome couple. Listen to the 12 yearold. Heigl and Duhamel are an amazing looking couple that has a very comfortable feel. What Berlanti does well is populate Life with quirky supporting characters and nominal narrative twists. Melissa McCarthy is good as the seenitall Mom DeeDee. Andrew Daly and Bill Brochtrup are funny as the gay parents Scott and Gary who faun over the strikingly handsome Duhamel. Sarah Burns is awesome as the social worker Janine Groff who warns Holly and Messer about complicating their relationship. Burns is hysterically touching as she becomes their biggest advocate. Brooke and Kiley Liddell are priceless as Sophie. Though hers is not really a performance she is just being. There are the formulae high jinx with baby poop and babysitting duty. Conflict is manufactured. Messer is offered the sports TV director slot for the Phoenix Suns which would displace him from home in Atlanta. Holly starts a relationship with solid Sam down home charming Josh Lucas Sophie's pediatrician. Life is diverging. Here in Life as We Know It there is an upside to predictability. We cheer for Holly Messer and Sophie because we see before they do They are a family. Heigl and Duhamel are awesome apart or together. They overcome a lot of the formulae. Being predictable is overrated when you have great heart like Life as We Know It.".

Do they fall in love and transform into loving parents? Come on we're smart and have seen our share of romantic comedies. Narrative surprise is not the strong suit of Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson's screenplay. In spite of all this Life as We Know It is touching romantic comedy. Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel are awesome and have a natural chemistry. Deitchman and Robinson's story strongly evolves. Director Greg Berlanti expertly orchestrates the right tone. Although Life is romantic comedy the set up is heart wrenching tragedy. The future of orphaned Sophie played by Brooke and Kiley Liddell hangs in the balance of whether Heigl and Duhamel can get over themselves. Heigl has a charming vulnerability and authenticity as Holly who has dreams of expanding her bakeshop and dearly misses Alison her personal rock. Duhamel is a nice surprise. He casually inhabits Messer the Player who really has a big heart by the numbers. However Duhamel never overplays embodying humanity and humor. With Duhamel we cheer for Messer's transformation. At the story arc he confesses to Heigl Together Somehow we're a family. At times we're smarter than the screenplay. From the beginning we see through Messer's jerk facade and distinguish the good man that he is and great guy he can be. Holly is too obsessed being annoyed to see the obvious. Fortunately Heigl and Duhamel are smarter than the scripthinting at the underlying love Holly and Messer have always had. Chemistry conquers a lot. Validation comes when Baby Whisperer Amy great Britt Flatmo says You guys make an awesome couple. Listen to the 12 yearold. Heigl and Duhamel are an amazing looking couple that has a very comfortable feel. What Berlanti does well is populate Life with quirky supporting characters and nominal narrative twists. Melissa McCarthy is good as the seenitall Mom DeeDee. Andrew Daly and Bill Brochtrup are funny as the gay parents Scott and Gary who faun over the strikingly handsome Duhamel. Sarah Burns is awesome as the social worker Janine Groff who warns Holly and Messer about complicating their relationship. Burns is hysterically touching as she becomes their biggest advocate. Brooke and Kiley Liddell are priceless as Sophie. Though hers is not really a performance she is just being. There are the formulae high jinx with baby poop and babysitting duty. Conflict is manufactured. Messer is offered the sports TV director slot for the Phoenix Suns which would displace him from home in Atlanta. Holly starts a relationship with solid Sam down home charming Josh Lucas Sophie's pediatrician. Life is diverging. Here in Life as We Know It there is an upside to predictability. We cheer for Holly Messer and Sophie because we see before they do They are a family. Heigl and Duhamel are awesome apart or together. They overcome a lot of the formulae. Being predictable is overrated when you have great heart like Life as We Know It.";

The date lasted all of five minutes as each took an instant dislike to one another and rang the gong. However they have had to see each other over the last few years at parties and gatherings thrown by the wedded couple. More so now that the A and P have a little girl named Sophie. A selfdescribed control freak Holly owns a gourmet food shop called Fraiche in the Atlanta area where she has grown interested in a frequent customer Dr. Sam Josh Lucas. For his part Messer works in sports television operating cameras for the Hawks basketball franchise and he has a new girlfriend every five minutes. Into this setting comes a shock. Alison and Peter tragically die in an automobile crash and unbelievably leave custody of Sophie to their unmarried pals Holly and Messer. After the tears and agony the weloatheeachother couple realize that they must move into their friends' large home and learn how to take care of their new daughter with civility. But as both are practicing on the job parenting they still have quite a few arguments and upsets. Juggling jobs and babies is a tough job they quickly concede. Could it also be that despite Dr. Sam's growing presence and Messer's frequent galpals that Holly and Messer will actually grow to like each other? Maybe! This is a lovely new entry into the world of romantic comedies for all of the genre's dedicated fans. Despite the tried and true theme of mismatched argumentative folks falling in love the movie has a few new twists as a result of the adorable baby. Heigl and Duhamel are perfectly wonderful as the main couple although both are such pros in this type of film that they should probably try to branch out in their next projects or be stuck in this kind of thing forever. The supporting cast is also very fine as are the settings costumes and camera work. Add on the zesty direction and polished humorous storyline and a winning flick emerges. Therefore Hollywood please send us more movies like this one and fans take time out from life's more mundane practices and make plans for a view.".

In other words it got to the places that you would expect but it took a different route than you might expect. Josh Duhamel and Katherine Heigl were good eye candy throughout the movie and the baby like most was absolutely adorable. The filming schedule must have been pretty spread out to let her grow probably as much as a year older progressively as the film itself jumps through its seasons similar to how Juno did. In fact one thing really annoyed about this and I'm going to throw it out there right now... we all know that the NBA doesn't run through the summer so why does this movie show the NBA running through the summer? I know there are summer leagues but this wasn't that. Anyway just irritated me a bit.There were many characters in this movie that had to help with the story's stability but they were also in there for the minute giggles and frankly I could have done without most of them. Like I said with clich moments if you've seen one movie with these characters you've seen them all. Josh Lucas was the only person with a halfdecent supporting role IMO.This movie was somewhat divided I don't mean this just in the sense that things start to go well then they don't then they kind of do again but I mean in terms of focus. The first half is very babycentric and the latter half pertains a lot more to Duhamel and Heigl where the baby is obviously used as a device to connect andor separate the two. Said first half is what I really loved about the movie as I just love babies and it dealt more with internal resolutions but it was cute enough to keep me interested anyway.This movie works well with a female crowd and it would help if you brought just one more along with you. Bring your wife girlfriend date... whoever if you plan on seeing it. For what it's worth I enjoyed it with my company. The 6 out of 10 is almost as much as you can get out of me with this kind of movie. In all seriousness a 6 is good... a 2 obviously is not and this movie is not a 2. On a final side note I love how Pearl Jam got a song in this movie. Haven't heard them in one since Eddie Vedder's original soundtrack in Into the Wild.".

And then that married couple is killed in a car accident with the will revealing that the mismatched friends are their baby's new caregivers. I'll just stop there and just say that while I didn't think this movie was all that funny and I didn't completely believe their falling in love when they did I did appreciate that the movie did put some realism concerning the complications of raising a baby financial duties concerning the house and how jobs that take you away from your loved ones can affect lives. At least the characters aren't close to being onedimensional like I feared so that's a plus. So on that note Life as We Know It is worth a look if you're interested.".

I'll just stop there and just say that while I didn't think this movie was all that funny and I didn't completely believe their falling in love when they did I did appreciate that the movie did put some realism concerning the complications of raising a baby financial duties concerning the house and how jobs that take you away from your loved ones can affect lives. At least the characters aren't close to being onedimensional like I feared so that's a plus. So on that note Life as We Know It is worth a look if you're interested.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was actually a lot better then I thought it would be. It has a lot of heart and humour in it from what would be a horrible situation to be in. It tells the story about Holly and Messer who meet in 2007 on a blind date and it goes horribly wrong. They are both great friends of the couple who set them up and always seem to see each other through their friends events. When they find out their friends have passed away in a car accident they are told that their friends wanted them to take care of the baby if anything were to happen to them. This is a shock to them but they decide to live together in their old house so that they grant the wishes of their friends. Throughout the movie you see them trying to raise the baby with often very funny results. It's a very sad premise but the humour does not make this movie depressing. I am curious to see if anything like this would happen in real life with 2 friends who do not know each other well would raise a baby together for the sake of the child. Katherine Heigl plays a typical role here of an overstressed woman who is unlucky in love and Josh Duhamel plays a guy with no responsibilities who ends up growing up in the end. Overall a fun movie to watch and will probably make you cry a bit".

The money makers these days are the hell fire and brimstone movies. Yes but I think that's why we can make some money. This would provide the audience an alternative. What about costs? I believe it would not be too costly to produce. We can just change the characters and modify the story line a bit. We can also sign some popular talent who draw an audience.

You just may have something.This review may be more of a protest against an apparent lack of creativity in Hollywood. Remakes are becoming much too frequent.

Said couple perish in an accident twenty minutes in...plot point one...and their will leaves the paidfor house to atodds godparents Holly Heigl and Eric Duhamel. They fight they make up they clean poop that apparently smells very very ugly they fight they makeup they do all the things Hollywood writers think are cute but are actually so clichd you want to scream at the screen. Add some icky music and songs throughout suspend all believability and it's life as Hollywood knows it.Katherine Heigl proves in this film that she should have stayed on TV because she is not a movie star. Maybe it's the material but didn't we see her do this shtick before? Josh Duhamel is believable in spite of the material he's given to work with. Maybe it's baby guilt that keeps him around because Heigl plays such a convincing shrew he'd have to be a masochist to do otherwise. Loved the Thanksgiving meal Heigl created prior to her final spat with Duhamel. It ends with her walking out of the kitchen perfectly coiffed and dressed in heels no less with this designer golden brown turkey on a platter. Utterly unrealistic and as phony as just about everything in this turkey of a film.Later after still another moment of introspection Miss Heigl finally sees the light and our leads get together once again. Only in Hollywood. Why would anyone living a real life even care about these imaginary characters and their superficial lives?".

	schema:headline " A Chick Flick that is not even that sweet or funny";
	schema:reviewBody "I suppose many of the readers must be asking What is a cool guy like me doing watching a chick flick? Suffice to say the power of a woman over a man should never be underestimated. Now for the film. Life as We Know It is a romantic comedy which means that its success or failure depends on an interesting couple and the plausibility of their relationship. A good romantic comedy should convince us that the couple is really turned on by each other which is the key to making a love story seem erotic. To make a long story short Life as We Know It lacks eroticism and chemistry with the result that we cannot believe in the socalled love story involving Holly Berenson Katherine Heigl and Eric Messer Josh Duhamel. And since I could not believe in their relationship I really did not care about these characters and I was not the least concerned about whether they would remain a couple. This movie not only fails as a love story it also fails as a comedy. Heigl and Duhamel are not funny when they are together and they equally unamusing when they are separated from each other. The filmmakers did try to use the baby Sophie to compensate for Heigl and Duhamel's lacklustre performance only to discover that babies shockingly enough make for bad comedians. Sure the baby can be the inadvertent source of toiletry humour but that kind of humour just disgusted me. So essentially this movie suffers from two uninteresting characters Eric and Holly a boring baby boring neighbours representing the usual stereotypes example the nerd marries a fat woman who really wants to have sex with the muscular Eric because he cannot hook up with the hot Russian girl from the Serebro band and a boring plot.In other words this movie is a nonromanticnoncomedy.".

	onyx:emotionText "I suppose many of the readers must be asking What is a cool guy like me doing watching a chick flick? Suffice to say the power of a woman over a man should never be underestimated. Now for the film. Life as We Know It is a romantic comedy which means that its success or failure depends on an interesting couple and the plausibility of their relationship. A good romantic comedy should convince us that the couple is really turned on by each other which is the key to making a love story seem erotic. To make a long story short Life as We Know It lacks eroticism and chemistry with the result that we cannot believe in the socalled love story involving Holly Berenson Katherine Heigl and Eric Messer Josh Duhamel. And since I could not believe in their relationship I really did not care about these characters and I was not the least concerned about whether they would remain a couple. This movie not only fails as a love story it also fails as a comedy. Heigl and Duhamel are not funny when they are together and they equally unamusing when they are separated from each other. The filmmakers did try to use the baby Sophie to compensate for Heigl and Duhamel's lacklustre performance only to discover that babies shockingly enough make for bad comedians.

A Free Soul is the story of a girl who misuses the freedom her father gave her in her upbringing.The film is based on a story Adela Rogers St. John wrote that drew from her relationship with her father famed criminal defense attorney Earl Rogers. Rogers set the mold for the famous criminal attorneys we've seen in action down to today. Unfortunately he was a man with a severe drinking problem which in the end got the better of him.He did not come from the upper crust that Lionel Barrymore as Stephen Ashe comes from. In fact the real Earl Rogers's father was a minister. Yet Barrymore creates a compelling and brilliant but dissolute figure who raises his daughter to be broadminded and tolerant and to despise some of the snobs from her class.Norma Shearer takes the lessons to heart only too well. She leaves stalwart beau polo playing Leslie Howard for gamblerracketeer Clark Gable. Gable's a client of Barrymore's who Barrymore got off on a gambit that Johnnie Cochran used successfully defending O.J. Simpson and he's rather full of himself.Barrymore turns out to be a bit of a snob himself in the end telling Gable he's not good enough for his little girl. Of course Norma has her own ideas.This film was the first really big break for Clark Gable. Movie audiences went for his animal magnetism in a big way. Even though Barrymore won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance by virtue of an unforgettable courtroom speech at the finish it was Gable who got all the newspaper print.Norma Shearer got a Best Actress nomination but lost to fellow MGM contract player Marie Dressler for Min and Bill. A Free Soul which was a preCode film explored the theme of sexual satisfaction ever so gingerly but in a way after 1935 could not be seen for thirty years on the screen. Shearer is also giving one of her best screen performances.Leslie Howard I'm afraid had real little to do but look patient and noble as the society polo player. Howard exuded class and distinction even when he's penniless as in The Petrified Forest. So much the better for him when he's dressed in tails.A Free Soul is light years better than The Girl Who Had Everything and holds up very well for today's audience.".

I can't believe A Free Soul is so little known or that so many viewers don't get the depth of its meaning then...and now. Throw in three of the most amazing actors of the early 1930sLionel Barrymore Clark Gable and Norma Shearerand you can't help be impressed and moved and intrigued. It's about strength of character three or four characters in fact. It's about being a modern person and having modern problems. And it's about facing them openly honestly.So what holds it back? Well for one thing it has a lot of talk a lot of simple dialog about some very not simple things. If you accept the characters and their need to talk you will see a very honest confrontation with alcoholism and with what is at first a kind of sex addiction or what is later developed to be simply unbridled love for a man outside of marriage. But the parallel between two temptations is real and rather powerful and the sacrifices each of the two afflicted characters make is intense. Barrymore as the one nipping the bottle and Shearer as the one too much in love or in love with lovemaking play their parts perfectly. They have moments of extraordinary clarity and moments of abandonment. And they confront each other in a way that is completely reasonable.There are other aspects here worth at least lifting an eyebrow at namely the very close relationship almost as platonic lovers between these two. Gable as a lovable but brutal and deceptive gangster is perfect toogorgeous and hard charming and untrustworthy. The milieu is well developed from barroom to hotel room to courtroom. This isn't a Warner Brothers knockyouout crime film it isn't even Three on a Match for an example of a compromise between a woman's picture and a gangster flick. It's a heady drama beautifully laid out and progressively involving with director Clarence Brown famous for a whole string of such interpersonal romantic dramas over several decades knowing what makes a film really matter.".

For example at the beginning of the movie Lionel Barrymore gets Clark Gable acquitted of first degree murder when he places the hat found at the scene of the crime on Clark's head ... clearly the hat is too small. The court and jury laugh and Clark is set free! This entire movie was great  much better than I had expected. I saw two Norma Shearer movies recently with a similarsounding plot recap Their Own Desire Norma Shearer falls for the son of her father's illicit lover and this one A Free Soul Norma Shearer falls for her lawyer father's mobster client. Having watched Their Own Desire first and not being impressed with it I wondered if I should even bother with A Free Soul. But bother I did and I'm glad for it. It was an excellent movie.Lionel Barrymore is the black sheep of his snooty wellheeled family. His wife died while giving birth to their only child Jan Norma Shearer. Being the black sheep Lionel raised Norma to be a free soul to not be afraid of anyone or anything to not be afraid to make mistakes and to pick herself up and dust herself off whenever she did find herself in trouble. This has apparently worked well for Norma until she meets and eventually tries to get away from Clark Gable. Norma finally learns there are consequences to all actions that one can't be a free soul without it having some type of repercussion on one's life.We also have Lionel Barrymore whom I always love in anything I see him in this time very compelling as a brilliant alcoholic lawyer who loves his daughter more than anything but who ultimately doesn't know how to protect her. He disappoints her and he disappoints himself but in the end he seeks to right his wrongs by defending Norma's exfianc to say more would be to possibly spoil the movie.This movie was fresh and the characters were sympathetically developed without ever resorting to being maudlin or melodramatic. This movie was also chockfull of great lines. For example Lionel to Clark upon learning Clark wants to marry Norma  The only time I hate democracy is when one of you mongrels forgets where you belong! Norma to Clark trying to get Clark to quit talking and make love to her  Men of action are better in action they don't talk well. Great early precode movie.".

However his fourteen minute monologue stands in cinema history as one of the most riveting and gave him his only Oscar nomination and win for Best Actor even though technically he was not the male lead but shorter performances have won the Academy Award.Not a great movie by all means but it did give Norma yet another Oscar nod and was remade as THE GIRL WHO HAD EVERYTHING starring Elizabeth Taylor. However it has some strong moments especially a tense scene between Gable and Shearer as he threatens her into marriage and to some that can seem a little disturbing especially when he played the hero in subsequent films most notably of course Rhett Butler. It would have been a feast for the people who saw how badly his character treated Shearer here to see the tables turned in GONE WITH THE WIND but of course all intrigues and stories would fall by the wayside and Vivien Leigh would play Scarlett.".

Not a bad cast eh?The story has a lot to it too  too much to go into here. It's basically a fatherdaughter story with the daughter having a good guy and a bad guy both after her and her taking in all the attention she can get. I've only seen two Norma Shearer films but she played a similar character in both. She's likes to giggle show off her body and flirt but doesn't want commitments. The Divorce was the other film in which I saw her. For much of this film this is a genderreversal with the woman being the heel.Barrymore plays her dad an alcoholic defense attorney. If for nothing else in this movie he's remembered for his impassioned speech at the end of the trial. It WILL get your attention! Clark Gable plays the toughie and Howard plays the suave niceguy both vying for Shearer's love.There is truth to a number of things in this film such as Jan Ashe Shearer finding the notsonice guy more exciting over a genuine gentleman. Why many women are like that  preferring the grubbylooking thug  who knows but Shearer is good at playing that role. Shearer's Harlowlike attire and nobra look got my and Gable's attention too.The movie should be enjoyed by most who like this kind of a melodrama andor appreciate good acting and a bit of stargazing.".

A Free Soul was based on a magazine serial Adela Rogers St. John wrote about her attorney father and it was a film with intense performances. Both Lionel Barrymore and Norma Shearer won Academy Award nominations with Barrymore winning because of his shattering performance as an alcoholic lawyer. Gable's performance as an aggressive but sexually exciting gangster was electrifying. The film was extremely popular because it was said the female audiences wanted to see Gable push Shearer around although I also saw no slap. Fans could see Gable at his most brutish in Night Nurse made the same year where he actually knocks Barbara Stanwyck out cold.Jan Norma Shearer is the beloved daughter of alcoholic attorney Stephen Ashe Lionel Barrymore. Because of his drinking and his unreliability his clients represent the dregs of society and he is oblivious to Jan's exposure to the seedier side of life. Jan has also an addiction  to living life as she wants with no restrictions  a free soul. When accompanying her father to court she meets Ace Wilfong Clark Gable a notorious gangster and there is an instant sexual attraction between them. That night after celebrations Ace drops Stephen off at his home but when Jan sees how Ace's presence and Stephen's inebriation get the cold shoulder from other guests she leaves with Ace in disgust. Once they leave they are involved in a drive by shooting and Jan is exhilarated by the danger and excitement. They begin an affair and Ace wants to marry her.

They go to a mountain retreat but Stephen can't stay sober and Jan disillusioned goes back to Ace. But Ace has changed and reveals his true nature by his brutish behaviour of her. He is more than ever determined to marry her and show her who's boss but Jan flees to her apartment and he follows for the showdown.Jan goes looking for her father to defend Dwight Leslie Howardhe has gone to Ace's suite and killed him and she finds him in a seedy doss house. Lionel Barrymore turns in a magnificent performance as the alcoholic Stephen who is riveting in his final court room appearance. Barrymore more than deserved his Academy Award.Today Gable comes across as sympathetic in his genuine love for Jan. His down to earth portrayal is out of place in a sea of high society brittleness.Highly Highly Recommended.".

His down to earth portrayal is out of place in a sea of high society brittleness.Highly Highly Recommended.";

He's got a presence that's riveting exuding an animal magnetism that's no exaggeration. No wonder Shearer's winsome Jan Ashe falls for him on first meeting and pity poor Leslie Howard always a little short in the allure department for having to compete. It's a good solid story well acted with even the scene stealing Barrymore mostly under control. And boy do I like Shearer's clinging gown sans underwear. Move over Harlowe and thank you preCode for the cheap thrill. Okay maybe those exterior camping sets don't measure up to MGM's usual bigbudget standard but who cares since it's the story's momentum that carries us through. Then too I hope there's a place in Hollywood heaven for fine unsung actors like James Gleason Eddie. He's one of those Hollywood grunts who never gave a bad performance. It's those guys and gals who carry the industry on their collective backs.In my little book there's one overriding scene. That's where snooty Dad Barrymore finds out criminalclass Ace Gable wants to marry his wellbred daughter. Offended Dad calls Ace among other things a mongrel for his presumptuousness and lack of upperclass pedigree. It's a startling reversal of their formerly friendly relations showing that some invisible class line has suddenly been crossed. As Dad Barrymore really spits out the lines in impressive fashion but you've got to wonder about his life expectancy from that point on since Ace is one powerful screen presence.Anyhow the movie may be an antique but it's certainly one worth collecting thanks to a good story and fine ensemble acting.".

Barrymore's patriarchal role was just as intense as Scarlet's father.

The coincidence of the similarity of Leslie Howard's role in both films as the jilted lover was striking. His acting got a lot better in Gone with the Wind.

	schema:reviewBody "Norma Shearer is A Free Soul in this 1931 film also starring Lionel Barrymore Clark Gable Leslie Howard and James Gleason. Though this is an early talkie the actors handle the dialogue well and there are not the awkward rhythms pauses or echoes one often hears during these first years.Shearer plays Jan Ashe the daughter of an alcoholic attorney Stephen Ashe Barrymore. Ashe successfully defends a mobster named Ace Wilfong against murder charges by showing that the hat bearing his initials found next to the body doesn't fit him. Shades of O.J. Wonder if Johnny Cochran saw this film. The minute Jan meets Ace Gable there is an instant attraction although she's engaged to Dwight Howard. Soon she is sleeping with Ace. Her father finds this unacceptable. Desperate to get him to stop drinking Jan agrees to stop seeing Ace if he will lay off the booze. They leave the city with Stephen's friend Gleason and rough it for three months. Just before they're due to return to the city Jan catches Stephen drunk. He disappears on a passing train and she returns to Ace. This time however she realizes he's a cruel brute and no longer wants him. It is then that the film takes an unexpected turn.The themes in A Free Soul are dated today having to do with the class system and a woman being a tramp if she sleeps with someone outside of marriage. Norma Shearer gives a very good performance as the flapper Jan conveying a daughter's devotion and a determination to remain independent and not follow the norm. Not a great beauty Shearer was a hardworking actress who had glamor sophistication and was ultrafeminine. The latter is especially evident in newsreels where she's only playing Norma Shearer. Lionel Barrymore is not yet in a wheelchair due to arthritis here. He does a great job as a man who is a shadow of what he was but still retains elements of greatness.It's certainly interesting to see Rhett and Ashley with a woman between them 8 years before Gone With the Wind. This was one of Gable's breakthrough performances. Unmustached and looking very young his persona is fitting into place  when he slaps Jan he packs a wallop and he kisses a woman like he means it. Leslie Howard is an elegant gentle and romantic Dwight. I happen to like his Ashley  his idealism impracticality and mixed signals are what make him attractive to Scarlett. Here he's as honorable as Ashley with his protection of Jan being the only thing that matters to him.A Free Soul is a turgid melodrama and some of the acting may seem a little over the top today but it's still recommended for the performances and especially for the young Gable who would be packing a wallop and kissing like he meant it for another 30 years.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Free Soul is best known as the film which cemented Clark Gable's film reputation and catapulted him into a 30year career as the King of Hollywood's leading men.  In the year of A Free Soul 1931 Gable had no fewer than 10 films in release three of them Possessed Laughing Sinners and Dance Fools Dance with his most frequent screen partner Joan Crawford.  A Free Soul tells the story of the relationship between an alcoholic lawyer Lionel Barrymore and his freespirited daughter Miss Shearer who come to an impasse when she takes up with one of his clients gangster Ace Wilfong Clark Gable.  Miss Shearer is rejected by her high society family and becomes the possession of the brutal gangster who threatens her with a forced marriage hey it was 1931! until her exfiance Leslie Howard shoots him.  The last part of the story details Howard's trial and defense by Lionel Barrymore who's final courtroom scene shot with multiple cameras in one take won him the Best Actor Academy Award. Although there is fine acting all around from Barrymore Miss Shearer Leslie Howard and the always excellent James Gleason it is Gable who makes the greatest impact.  His brutality towards Miss Shearer must have shocked the audience's of 1931 who were used to having her treated with respect by her screen lovers.  But at the end of the picture her relationship with Gable is much easier to understand than her less volatile but more socially acceptable attachment to gentleman Leslie Howard his murder of Gable notwithstanding.  The film vividly illustrates a popular theme of films at the time of a definite social schism. In a diatribe of nonequality between the classes as delivered by lawyer Barrymore he illustrates that beasts like lowerclass Gable can clean themselves up and cross the tracks to the upperclass but they can never really be accepted by their betters. However there were probably very few women in the audience who wouldn't have liked to have been pawed by Gable regardless of his social standing at least once or twice if they were lucky.  Director Clarence Bull ultimately would work with Gable in 10 pictures 6 with his costar Joan Crawford.   Miss Shearer looks beautiful in designer Adrian's loose top tight bottom bias cut gowns a look which would typify MGM leading ladies in the early 30's.  Her final courtroom entrance wearing a hat a big fur and an Adrian gown would be copied onscreen for decades to come Joan Collins first entrance as Alexis Carrington on TV's Dynasty comes to mind. Norma Shearer is obviously from the upper class but passionate enough to take up with lug Gable and make her desire for him completely believable.  Leslie Howard gives an understated but effective performance.  However with the sexual fireworks between Gable and Shearer he quickly fades into the background. This film is a good example of exactly what made Clark Gable into a star.  It was also probably the film that launched the phrase Who do you think you are?  Clark Gable?.".

He does a great job of projecting guilt over and shock at his daughter's behavior as well as giving us an idea of why he feels he must drink I must drink the way other men must breathe he says at one point. Also James Gleason shows why he was one of the great character actors of the 30's and 40's in his role as Barrymore's assistant stealing several scenes. The rest of the cast seems to be a bit stuck in silent filmera performances as they pose and posture for the camera and utter largely unmemorable dialogue. Much of this has to be the fault of the director since many of the members of the cast  Norma Shearer and Clark Gable in particular  had given very good and natural performances in past talkies.The jist of the story is this  Stephen and his daughter Jan have always lived a lifestyle of which the rest of their socialite family disapproved. Stephen has always taught his daughter to go her own way and not pay attention to what other people think. Now this may be good advice when it has to do with priggish conventions rooted in tradition rather than right and wrong. However what Stephen has failed to point out to Jan is that people also generally think it is a bad idea to walk into a busy intersection blindfolded and just because this is a majority opinion does not make it a convention ripe for the testing. Thus completely blindfolded Jan walks into the busy intersection that is the world of gangster Ace Wilfong a murderer that her father has recently managed to get acquitted in one of his more sober moments. Stephen Ashe is faced with a parent's worst nightmare  he has given his daughter what turns out to be very bad advice and she has not only listened but followed it.I love this movie for several reasons. One is the starkness of the precode relationship between Ace and Jan. For example when Jan returns from a long trip Ace tells her make yourself comfortable your things are still hanging in my closet. It is also great to see Clark Gable in the supporting role that finally made him a star plus we get a look at him and Leslie Howard on screen together eight years before Gone with the Wind. Another reason I love this film is that it conveys a subtle probably unintended message. This movie one of the favorite targets of the prodecency and procode crowd in the early 30's takes place during prohibition. However that doesn't even seem to slow down Barrymore's character when it comes to drinking himself to death. It just takes his alcoholism off the main streets. Thus what did the Hayes code proponents really expect to accomplish by making mainstream American feature films unrealistically Grated sanitized fluff? Illicit behavior and illicit movies just didn't go away because some law was passed. It just took the behavior off the screens of the mainstream theatres. If the real purpose of prohibitions on personal behavior and the art forms that portray it are so that Puritans won't have to see it why didn't they don't they just look the other way in the first place and leave everyone else alone?".

The lead character does not speak so if this would bother you then you should not watch this film. I think of this as a German experimental Absolutely Fabulous. Nina Hagen has a bit role in this film and she is spectacular. The tone of this film is a lot like Fassbinder's Satan's Brew in fact Ottlinger could be called the female counterpart to Fassbinder. This is a comedy but a subtle and strange one. Unfortunately I don't think this film is available in the U.S. however a German woman showed it to me and the version she had did have English subtitles so it is out there somewhere.".

The lead character does not speak so if this would bother you then you should not watch this film. I think of this as a German experimental Absolutely Fabulous. Nina Hagen has a bit role in this film and she is spectacular. The tone of this film is a lot like Fassbinder's Satan's Brew in fact Ottlinger could be called the female counterpart to Fassbinder. This is a comedy but a subtle and strange one. Unfortunately I don't think this film is available in the U.S. however a German woman showed it to me and the version she had did have English subtitles so it is out there somewhere.";

	schema:reviewBody "Bildnis einer Trinkerin. Aller jamais retour or Portrait of a Female Drunkard. Ticket of No Return or Ticket of No Return Portrait of a Woman Drinker is a West German Germanlanguage movie from 1979 that is already over 35 years old. It is one of the most known works by writer and director Ulrike Ottinger. The film runs for slightly over 100 minutes and is in color and live action of course. If you understand the title you also understand the very general plot idea. It is a depiction of alcoholism and several people suffering from this terrible disease mostly women but occasionally also a male. I personally think this is a very difficult film to construct a convincing story around as it has to feel very authentic in terms of the writing and the actors have to be good and master the challenge of playing an alcoholic without making it look fake or tryhard but also still be serious enough so that the audience never feels they are watching an actor actually.And I don't think this had been achieved here. One reason may be that the experimental almost avantgarde take on thinks makes it even more difficult to work. It's like Brakhage meets The Lost Weekend. And this is also why I personally am not surprised that this movie here did not receive any awards attention at all apparently even if it has not been forgotten like other Ottinger works. I recommend the likes of Bad Lieutenant or Harald Juhnke's somewhat autobiographical movie Der Trinker which strikes much more on an emotional note than this one here. And I can't deny I was kinda bored by this one here on some occasions and I did not care half as much for the characters as I hoped I would. Thumbs down from me. Not recommended.".

I thought all of the performances were well done and Ben Kingsley was just amazing. I have been in the production of Oliver! the musical three times and have read the book about a million times. It is one of my all time favorite stories and plays and I have been disappointed with the past Oliver Twist films. I remember a few years ago I saw a very poorly done Oliver Twist with Elijah Wood as the Artful Dodger. This one did not disappoint me as a huge fan in the least. I feel Roman Polanski really understood what Dickens was trying to express in his books. And by the way the character Oliver is supposed to faint it is a sign of his weakness. I know I am repeating myself but I really did love the performances. The Artful Dodger was great and Mr.Salsbury was done so justly. Even the smallest characters were performed amazingly. I think the only way someone would foolishly call this off as a poorly written poorly acted or poorly done film was if they were blind and deaf! No offense to anyone who is of course but I was very taken aback as I said by the comment I just read about this film. The only thing it has against it is that it's a bit long. I knew where the story was going at every moment but for someone just being introduced to Oliver Twist it might seem to go on for a while. But if you look back at the history of movies many of the best films are long. If you are a fan of Charles Dickens please see this film  you will love it. If you are a fan of Roman Polanski it is one of his best! If you wish to be entertained in a very classic and nonoffensive way please see this film. I just loved it and could go on and on.

	schema:reviewBody "I was somewhat ambivalent about the thought of one of my favourite directors making a version of the much loved classic tale Oliver Twist. On the one had Roman Polanski crafts wonderful and moving films extremely well so I was intrigued to see how he would weave this one together. From his early 'Knife in the water' through to 'The Pianist' each has his trademark directorial stamp on it whilst still being truly incredible and individual films. On the other hand the Oliver Twist tale has been screened to death both in two highly regarded films as well as multifarious TV versions over the years. In my opinion David Lean's version is fantastic Alec Guiness superb as Fagin and the whole film experience has kept me going back from childhood through to adulthood.So it was with great trepidation that I went to see this spanking brand new version and thankfully I was not disappointed. The character of Fagin so crucial to the story is performed with outstanding ability by Ben Kingsley. He really portrays this grotesque but somehow lovable character well from his slight mannerisms and movements to his vocal abilities. Also finely performed were the parts of the artful dodger Harry Eden Mr Brownlowe Edward Hardwicke and of course Oliver Twist Barney Clarke. There was such sadness and despair in his eyes throughout that he really captured the part well. Less convincing was Bill Sykes Jamie Foreman who was not right for the part nor performed well enough to stand up against the masterful Oliver Reed in a previous version. Foreman is a regular in gangster type films and for me did not really fit into the cast or film well here.The recreation of mid 19th century London is done well with Polanski drawing on the visual inspiration of Dore prints of the period for authenticity. The cinematography is as accomplished as always in a Polanski film and the lighting helped to create dramatic moods well.All in all a very competent and entertaining version with great acting a fine pace and an outstanding final scene of Fagin finished and soon to face death gripping hold of Oliver tightly. I would highly recommend to adults children and die hard fans of other versions. All great directors have different visions and Polanski has used his vision and experienced craftmanship in successfully remaking this much loved tale.".

David Leans version is often talked about but it is overpraised. It tends to be overly sentimental an very slow in certain places. I'm not for fast moving movies but his version can be quite dull at times. Polanski's film has updated a great story with lush photography of pastoral settings and the narrative moves briskly. He manages to develop the characters quite well despite the pace. The acting from all is superb especially Ben Kingsley who is barely recognizable. I've never been a fan of great books that have been adapted to film but Polanski seems to have a real knack for this sort of thing. He filmed Tess also an adaptation 25 years back with an Academy award nominated direction. That film is one of my all time favorites but Oliver Twist is even better.

	schema:reviewBody "Without a doubt the Roman Polanski version of OLIVER TWIST is the greatest straight telling version of this story ever filmed. Yes you will see glimpses of the David Lean version and the Carol Reed musical but this film stands on it's own as a deeply moving interpretation of the Charles Dickens novel. While I was watching this film I couldn't help thinking how proud Dickens would have been if he were alive. Somewhere beyond he is smiling because Polanski captures the grand scope of the film and maintains its intimacy throughout. OLIVER TWIST moved me to tears.What a master filmmaker Polanski is and how clever he was to choose OLIVER TWIST as a follow up film to THE PIANIST. You can feel his compassion for this story and its characters. It's hard to match the performance of Fagin given by Alec Guiness in the Lean version and especially Ron Moody in the Reed musical but Ben Kingsley is incredibly dimensional and moving in the role. He puts his own signature onto the part.Jamie Foreman is the scariest Bill Sykes ever. Barney Clark as Oliver carries the picture on his instinctual little shoulders and is as moving in the role as Ben Kingsley is in his.The art direction and cinematography are oil paintings in motion. Highly atmospheric and gorgeous to look at.My only quibble with this version is that the Nancy isn't as compassionate as the the Nancy played by Shani Wallis in the film musical. Although never mentioned in the story there is no doubt about the profession of Nancy and Bet in this picture. Leanne Rowe is a very sexy Nancy and was a fine choice for the part. However there isn't a scene in this film where Nancy comes into her own and wins the audience over in the way there is for the characters of Fagin Oliver and the Artful Dodger. This is where Polanski needed to reach deep and establish but didn't . It's unfortunate too because Rowe is really good in the part. There just needed to be a definitive moment in the film where we as an audience fall in love with the character so as to make her death all the more disturbing.The death of Nancy in the Carol Reed '68 version was a shocking and disturbing scene. The death scene in the Polanski version is handled similarly off camera so as to leave the image in the imagination of the viewer. But the murder doesn't have the shock value it should. I couldn't help thinking that the the image of the blood at the bottom of the door strangely symbolized the blood at the front door of the house where the murder of his wife Sharon Tate occurred. I also got the feeling that Polanski for this reason didn't want to have a graphic death for Nancy. It's as if he's had enough of murders fictional or otherwise for one lifetime. One can hardly blame him.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perfect there is no better way to describe this wonderful production by Roman Polanski. This time honoured story by one of the world's greatest writers has been given excellent treatment by a fantastic director.First the acting is quite good not just as one would expect from Ben Kingsley who out does himself as the scheming cantankerous Fagin but from the child actors as well most notably Barney Clark and Harry Eden who play Twist and Dodger respectively. Another notable aspect of the cast is they all speak with a thick 19th century British accent and yet manage to be perfectly intelligible to the audience.As for the story well what can I say it's Dickens! Some characters are of course cut from the book and some plot points and elements are missing but that is to be expected when a book is translated into a film. Despite the cuts the movie is very faithful to the book and one could hardly ask for a better translation of written medium to the visual.Despite wonderful acting and excellent story my favourite part of this movie is definitely the visuals. The set and costume crew has done an amazing job of recreating the London in which Oliver lived. Every nuance of London from the slums to the well to do areas has been very faithfully realized on screen. The squalor of the back alleys is almost palpable as the characters trod through the mud and one is almost tempted to doff their hat when the scenery moves to the middle class homes.Overall I can find very little to not praise about this movie the only thing I can find some flaw with is the soundtrack as it seems a bit sparse in some areas and perhaps a bit too repetitive. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of any genre.".

But it's young Barney Clark who steals the show. In past versions Oliver is merely a device upon which the other array of characters are hung. We'll all remember Sir Alec Guinness Richard Dreyfus and Ron Moody's Fagin Oliver Reed and Robert Newton's Bill Syke Elijah Wood Anthony Newley and Jack Wild's Dodger but who were the Olivers? We will remember young Master Barney Clark in this marvelous intriguing and eyepleasing Oliver.".

He's subjected to many awful incidents before finding somebody to worry for him until his rescue from a miserable life by a noble Edward Harwicke who replaced Frank Finlay to whom a sadist thief called Bill Jamie Foreman tries to burgle his house . The picture is a well done coproduction  being specially a British movie of Charles Dickens immortal story . As Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist includes many more characters and subplots than can be fit into a justover2hours film . This version narrows down and streamlines the story to focus on misfortunes of Oliver  the Artful Dodger  scheming Fagin  evilness by fearful Bill Sykes  Nancy  Mr. Brownlow and other criminal elements of London . The novel's other characters Mr. Bumble Mrs. Mann Mrs. Corny Noah Claypole Charlotte Mr. Monks the Maylie family the Fleming family and the Leeford family are all either relegated to brief cameo roles or omitted entirely from the story . Ben Kingsley's Fagin is a treat  he's magnificent as the mean and greedy old man creating an underage army of plunderers  besides  an awesome portrayal by the support casting . The movie has a clever utilization of effects  colour as well as lighting and with highly smartness use of edition to increase suspense in provoking drama  emotion or horrible events as when happens the killing . The idea of making a new version of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist was suggested by Emmanuelle Seigne r director Roman Polanski's wife  while he was looking for a plot that their children would find interesting. Director Roman Polanski's children have parts in the film in fact  Morgane Polanski plays the farmer's daughter and Elvis Polanski plays the boy with the hoop . It's colorfully and sharply photographed by Pawel Edelman . Glowing cinematography of the rustic outdoors in PreRaphaelist style and gorgeous Victorian landscapes  just like urban London  though  all of them were filmed in Czech Republic  at Prague Studies . In addition  excellent scenarios of dingy and dirty settings of the slums where the narration is developed . This is the best along with David Lean version and the musical by Carol Reed of many renditions about the unforgettable novel . Other retelling results to be the followings  by Frank LLoyd 1922  by David Lean 1948  and by Carol Reed 1968 .

	schema:reviewBody "'MORE' will be the last thing on your mind if you can sit through this unnecessary and underwhelming remake of the Dicken's classic. It beggars belief that Polanski the same man responsible for the awardwinning The Pianist could go wrong with such a quality story to work with but he has and spectacularly so. The first mistake was made in his young leading man. Forget pickpocketing Islington lad Barney Clarke is guilty of one of the most ordinary performances in a title role ever seen on the big screen. With a few exceptions his take on the supposedly lovable urchin Oliver involved little more than gratuitous overacting an annoying sulking pout sad puppy dog eyes and the personality and presence of a wooden puppet. When you're half way through the film and your hero has barely uttered a sentence and you couldn't give a damn what happens to him you know you're in trouble. This frustrating lack of character development is not confined to just Oliver. Polanski has managed to stifle the potential of every character in the cast  Nancy Sykes the artful Dodger. None are given any priority in Polanksi's streamlined summary of Dicken's tale hence leaving them all as shallow substanceless souls merely filling up a few minutes screen time here and there. So fleetingly are they presented it's near impossible to become interested in their plights and actions or to understand their motivations and what they should contribute to the story. Even Fagin superbly played by Ben Kingsley is sidelined as an ensemble character despite providing the film's most animated personality and is incredibly wasted in the role of the thieving mentor. David Lean's 1948 version and even Carol Reed's 1968 musical Oliver! are superior to this one both delivering the emotional rollercoaster that Oliver's journey should be. Polanski's film moves from high to low at astonishing speed but the climaxes are painfully dull and appear to be just going through the motions. Polanski is consistent though. The empty plot is wanton right up to the dreary drawn out conclusion. On a positive note the grim vision of 19th century London that he has created is glorious. Looks though aren't everything are they  especially in this case. Please sir no more.".

How to describe that in a lively way you can read in Dickens' book. Some scenery shots were really bad. Was somebody painting glass for you? Who was your gaffer? And then the actors Most of them come from the London area I suppose but does that mean they are authentic ?What about the children? Nice faces put in old clothes don't make poor homeless pickpockets. They speak like well educated middle class kids and their life didn't appear miserable at all. Head of the gang Dodger looked like he enjoyed playing in a movie. The dog was not scary Sykes wasn't scary and what was Toby Crackit for in your version ? Finally Oliver. Well he had to endure some bad treatment but I did not see the desperate yet strong boy that Dickens described so well. Did you?Frankly Roman I was bored. I love books I like movies but this one was all so predictable and uninspired and it is much too long. You had one excellent idea however. Ben Kingsley. What a presence! Fagin is the one character that really lives.

	schema:headline " Polanski  Dickens A Surprising Combination";
	schema:reviewBody "Just the other day I saw the 2005 filming of 'Pride and Prejudice' and yesterday I saw Roman Polanski's 'Oliver Twist'. I didn't like the previous movie adaptations of Dickens's classic and was intending to avoid this one. Only recently I found out that Polanski had sat on the director's chair so I just had to watch it. Like Wright's version of 'Pride and Prejudice' Polanski stays true to Dickens's novel we are presented with some dazzling visuals and the director's attention to the time period and the way he brings it to screen is amazing. His use of slightly washed out colours and a nonintrusive subtle background score and weather effect is fantastic. Of course most of his films have been visually stunning ... and have quite graphic scenes of violence as does this one but he cleverly avoids gore and uses a more suggestive approach.However I found the execution of the ending a little too flawed. Bill's accidental suicide looked a little silly and Oliver had quite a few chances to escape but all he does is stand there for Bill to grab him. Also I Polanski could have done better with the sequence where Oliver visits Fagan in prison and forgives him. It looks as though Oliver has easily forgiven and quickly forgotten all the sins he had committed that he wanted to kill him AND was partially responsible for Nancy's death.The performances are a mixture. Barney Clark performs decently at times but there are certain moments where he fails to convince or appear natural. He seems to lack spontaneity. In the end it is the director's task and I thought Polanski could have worked a little harder on extracting a better performance of the child. Ben Kingsley is very good and he skillfully prevents Fagan from being a caricature villain allowing the viewer to feel some sympathy for him. The other villains are too caricatured for my liking and the actors don't make a difference either. Leanna Rowe is very impressive as Nancy and Edward Hardwicke is very likable as the rich good Samaritan.Thus my opinions are almost exactly the same as that of Wright's 'Pride and Prejudice'. I like that Polanski has chosen a classic novel that revolves around the plight of a child like 'Oliver Twist' I never would have expected him to and made a good but flawed film. I think he could have easily improved the execution of the ending though.".

If you managed not to lose the chimney sweeps guy how could you lose these? Where is his friend Dick and his God bless you? They are necessary to show that despite all there is humanity in many people and you shouldn't give up and that's what carries Oliver on otherwise he'd just succumb and die. This story through Oliver and others teaches about people and issues at the same time. That's its substance. It's packaged up into adventure novel. Polanski however manages to remove both the substance and the packaging. Nothing is left.As you read you realize that each character is a mirror in which you can see inner Oliver through his interactions with this character because on the outside Oliver is not much more than a pale poor boy whom everybody uses left and right. The story truly needs some happy parts where Oliver is grateful to his benefactors and shines as a loving and caring person to contrast with gloom surrounding his life. Polanski removed them and the movie is almost entirely gloomy except summerfair London sets which means children are not going to like it. He then proceeded to remove the suspense element which is the mysterious evil and powerful Monks' plotting against innocent Oliver without him knowing it so you are no longer on the edge of your seat or care to see what's next. He then took out emotional parts where Oliver is redeemed for his suffering and has a chance to show himself. What more do you need to make a gloomy boring movie? No wonder the box office results were boring and gloomy.Some will say those are subplots and can be removed. But just as you don't remove because you are such a celebrity parts from a Mozart symphony you don't cut up a Dickens' story because in the end everything makes sense comes together and makes for a great experience. A great story is like an organism and no matter how famous a doctor you are if you remove key organs your patient will die.Somebody said that eliminating Brownlow's ties to Oliver's family was justified because it was improbable that they would meet in real world. A lot of things are improbable in the real world but they happen and this teaches us not to lose faith the greater good. Plus I find it even less believable that in the real world if Oliver didn't remind Mr. Brownlow of Agnes he would even consider raising him. In the movie he says there's something interesting about this boy What is interesting? Maybe the fetching good looks? The colorful brown rags he's wearing? What? Finally where is Dickens London? Where are those shabby barely standing ugly buildings? Everything's clean pretty and I repeat summer fair looking. I finished reading the book this morning. The story is so interesting it makes you turn those pages you are on the edge of your seat. Quite a contrast to this adaptation which is not really Dickens story at all except maybe character names. I'm surprised at the rating and number of positive reviews for such a dull uninteresting film.P.S. Ladies and gentleman a small correction! Oliver Twist story is NOT set in Victorian era as the queen in question was crowned three months after publication.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the excellent and deeply moving THE PIANIST I thought that Polanski was back on top of his art. His latest work should have been a lusty disturbing gripping and emotional film. Just look at the credentials  Roman Polanski directing Ben Kingsley in an adaptation of Charles Dickens' OLIVER TWIST  sadly it fails to deliver on this fabulous premise.This must rank as the lamest Polanski film after the horrible PIRATES 1986. He simply aims the camera and shoots in a rather obvious manner that hankers after the lazy Sunday afternoon BBC dramas. The pacing of the film is often too brisk and crams in too much plot detail. The viewer never has the time to understand the motivations of the characters and any emotional resonance is lost in the vast sets.The art design of this film is absolutely beautiful and stunningly realized. No cost has been spared in recreating Victorian London. It is as if the George Cruikshank illustrations which graced the interiors of the Penguin editions of the book have literally come to life. The costumes and architecture resemble the monochromatic sepiatoned photographs from the era. The tight narrow alleys infested with rats and dripping with slime and mud all the poverty and filth is on display but the story gets swamped in those very same alleys. The opening and closing credits sequences used the famed woodcuts and etchings by Gustave Dore and they pack a visceral punch. All the crude vitality of Victorian life is captured in these haunting pictures and many will leave the theatre with goosepimples.The soundtrack employed vast symphonic forces but failed to arouse sympathy or create an ambiance to underline the visual action. It would occasionally arrive in a sudden melodramatic phrase and then just as suddenly disappear without trace. Very strange use of the soundstage this. However the hustle and bustle of London street life is well recorded. The change from the quiet solitude of the countryside to the arrival in London with the accompaniment of a cacophony of horses shouting jostling screaming and cursing in the open marketplace was spot on.Unlike the celebrated and poetic David Lean version of this book from 1948 which had the courage to detail some of the racist and antiSemitic sentiments of the controversial novel this new version has Polanski jettison any reference to Fagin's cultural background. We only see him as a Cockney pantomime villain drained of all passionate colour by being overtly politicallycorrect. Kingsley's performance is of the very best ham variety. He produces high melodrama all the way through until the closing scenes when he ushers in a raw poignancy that is truly heartrending. If only he had used such magnificent power earlier in the film.Still in a time of the Summer Blockbuster there is much to recommend in this handsomely mounted production. I just expected much more from a talent like Polanski. Even now I get chills thinking about his emotionally haunting version of Thomas Hardy's TESS...".

The tight narrow alleys infested with rats and dripping with slime and mud all the poverty and filth is on display but the story gets swamped in those very same alleys. The opening and closing credits sequences used the famed woodcuts and etchings by Gustave Dore and they pack a visceral punch. All the crude vitality of Victorian life is captured in these haunting pictures and many will leave the theatre with goosepimples.The soundtrack employed vast symphonic forces but failed to arouse sympathy or create an ambiance to underline the visual action. It would occasionally arrive in a sudden melodramatic phrase and then just as suddenly disappear without trace. Very strange use of the soundstage this. However the hustle and bustle of London street life is well recorded. The change from the quiet solitude of the countryside to the arrival in London with the accompaniment of a cacophony of horses shouting jostling screaming and cursing in the open marketplace was spot on.Unlike the celebrated and poetic David Lean version of this book from 1948 which had the courage to detail some of the racist and antiSemitic sentiments of the controversial novel this new version has Polanski jettison any reference to Fagin's cultural background. We only see him as a Cockney pantomime villain drained of all passionate colour by being overtly politicallycorrect. Kingsley's performance is of the very best ham variety. He produces high melodrama all the way through until the closing scenes when he ushers in a raw poignancy that is truly heartrending. If only he had used such magnificent power earlier in the film.Still in a time of the Summer Blockbuster there is much to recommend in this handsomely mounted production. I just expected much more from a talent like Polanski. Even now I get chills thinking about his emotionally haunting version of Thomas Hardy's TESS...";

WHile I missed the music I found that this version was more emotionally engrossing with great character development of Fagan and Oliver. I was moved by the duality in the characters the scenery and incredible lighting that Polanski used. As well I felt that this version did not sugarcoat the pain and misery of being a child especially an orphan in this time. I found various differences in the plot from the first version. Since I have not read the novel I am unsure which plot was more true to the book. I am guessing that Roman's was the more accurate but I could be wrong. I highly recommend this movie for adults but I am unsure if children would enjoy it. I found it deeply moving and upsetting as you follow the despair of Oliver with glimpses of hope. Bravo to Polanski for creating a movie that is definitely his own which doesn't avoid the pain of being a child and which has the courage to present characters with their strengths and flaws.".

The story has no surprises because we already know it so well but there's a serious lack of energy and star Barney Clarke who plays Oliver is extremely weak and meek. Ben Kingsley does a knockup job with his Fagin and manages to make him sympathetic and fascinating. Polanski and his team built the London on display and certainly spared no expense but it all looks too clean and art directed and there is a distinct lack of threat present in the city's supposedly impoverished laneways.

He was excellent at playing the kindly old gentleman that takes in the poor orphan Oliver. Although I really enjoyed this film it follows the original novel by Charles Dickens very closely a point I am not disappointed about and it may be either difficult for younger children to follow or maybes a little traumatic for some younger children. Given the violence shown between Sykes and Nancy Oliver being beat and shot it is something younger viewers may find disturbing. Extremely good film though. Definitely go back to see it again.".

The actors playing Oliver and Dodger were poor choices in my opinion. They made the characters one dimensional and thin acting without flair and without a real sense of the characters they were playing. They may only be children... but other child actors in other versions of this story have excelled in comparison. Fagin was also a poor choice. The actor made Fagin overlysenile and almost insane. Granted there is a definite side of this to Fagin's character but it was overexaggerated... up to the point where it made Fagin not particularly likable... which I'm sure Dickens never intended to do.I won't go on there were a hundred and one poor factors I could have described... overall I'd say it was a dull retelling of the basic facts of the novel.

Lorraine De Selle is great trying to take the whole thing seriously while Giovanni Lombardo Radice chews the scenery around her with leering bogeyed abandon.

The whole New York subplot stinks of runningtimefiller and could be totally done away with.The gore is minimal but effective  a blink and you'll miss it latex castration and a rather more shocking breastonhook impalement. The much criticized animal cruelty really isn't as bad as everyone tries to make out  usually consisting of little more than Discovery Channel style documentary footage of animals chasing and killing each other. On the few occasions in which people actively kill animals they do so quickly and efficiently and there's no sense that the animals are suffering or no more than they would in the average abattoir. It's interesting that when animals are butchered for your viewing pleasure in Italian exploitation movies it's banned in a dozen countries but when Coppola does it far less humanely in Apocalypse Now it's art.This was my first journey into the Cannibal genre and if I can get my hands on Cannibal Holocaust it won't be my last. Ferox is a fun trashy low budget exploitation fest that is far more enjoyable than some of the bigbudget mainstream dross that I've had to endure Constantine anyone?.".

There are way too many hilarious moments to list but I love the central premise that Lorraine de Selle is going into the jungle to prove that cannibalism DOESN'T exist and NEVER HAS. Right  I just walked home from the pub and didn't get into a fight that proves that no one has ever got in a fight on the way home from the pub. And no one who's seen this film will ever forget John Giovanni Radice Morghen's acting as he wails the immortal line then...THEN THEY ATE HIS GENITALS!!!The commentary track on the DVD is fantastic  Lenzi is a hilariously arrogant idiot while Morghen's camp bitchy comments had me in hysterics.But don't believe this nonsense about how Ferox is sickening for showing a snake crushing something to death or South American tribes killing a turtle. Have you never watched a documentary about snakes on the BBC or the Discovery Channel? Guess what  they show them crushing things too! And if you don't believe that nature documentary crews actually feed innocent animals to predators just to get good footage you're very naive. As for the turtle  these tribal guys live IN THE JUNGLE ok? But you don't have to show them actually cutting the head off a live turtle! Well first of all the fact that it's a live turtle is neither here nor there  if it was a dead one it would still have been killed duh. And secondly what? We can eat our turtle soup but we don't want to watch it being made? Grow up.".

They do show a breast hooking in detail. The special effects are just OK. Nothing here that tells you any of the violence is real. The cannibals are obviously poor people from central  south America who were dressed up as jungle savages and told to act mean. These people were obviously in on the whole picture to get a little money or food or both.

	schema:reviewBody "CANNIBAL FEROX is one of those forbidden gems one of the short list of films that only those with strong stomachs and undying dedication to horror films can endure. Also on that list are films like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE MEN BEHIND THE SUN SALO 120 DAYS OF SODOM and a handful of others that are not for the weak of heart or those easily offended. I have finally seen FEROX and have only good things to say about it.The plot is rather simple a drug dealer and his cohort torture and kill some natives in the Amazon jungle and escape but after encountering a college group they are captured and brutalized for the cruelties they have caused. All of the four main actors are excellent Giovanni Lombardo RadiceJohn Morghen Lorraine de Selle Danilo Mattei Zora Kerova and I plan to seek out all of their films. I seriously enjoyed the acting which may come as a surprise to those who watch this film for yucks. I never once laughed during this film I took it totally seriously and the film actually works this way. I can't stress how unbearable some of the scenes in this film are. There are several instances of real animal killings a turtle an alligator a pig and almost a mongoose castration decapitation mutilation humiliation a piranha attack and poison darts. All of the scenes in the jungle are expertly filmed and create an otherworldy environment that puts us the viewers through hell and back. By the end of the film we have experienced everything that the protagonists have and have come out alive as well. I think that that as well as viewing the film itself gives a sense of triumph as an end result.Now the one problem with the film the NYC scenes. Filmed on location in New York City the scenes are wonderfully nostalgiac and are scored by an irresistible disco score but the acting is horrible except perhaps porn star Richard KermanR. Bolla the dubbing bad and it just breaks the main storyline too much. It tells the story of why Mike Logan and Joe the drug dealers escaped to the Amazon. But does it really matter? Joe explains it during his story so why shoot 20 minutes of new footage with a totally different cast? Director Umberto Lenzi does a wonderful job with the jungle footage some of his best work and had also done cop thrillers. I guess he couldn't resist showing off his ability to shoot action scenes. These NYC scenes are well shot and campy like most Italian cop thrillers but should have been in a different film. Here they just distract from the jungle action and almost ruin what could have been a classic film. Instead this film is for the most part ridiculed and called a ripoff of the stronger CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST.The music by BudyMaglione is superb and is available on CD through some online mail order video companies. It's so good I listen to it every day. The NYC disco theme is marvelous but my favorite is still the morbid symphonic choir piece that accompanies the horrific scenes in the jungle. It is both beautifully composed and effectively filled with dread. I would list some standout scenes but why ruin a good thing? Go into CANNIBAL FEROX by knowing as little about it as possible including the now famous murder sequences and prepare to be shocked beyond belief. Grindhouse Releasing has released the definitive version so seek that out for cool extras including commentaries by John Morghen and Umberto Lenzi and three trailers!".

	schema:headline " Ugly and terrible entry into the cannibal subgenre";
	schema:reviewBody "The film begins with the murder of a drug addict in an unknown apartment by some gangsters looking for a man named Mike Logan. As the police begin their investigation into the shooting the action relocates to the Paraguayan jungle where two students Gloria Lorraine De Selle and Rudy Danilo Mattei and one tagalong Pat Zora Kerova are making their way into the heart of the jungle looking for native tribes who have been accused of cannibalism. Gloria is out to disprove the claims of cannibalism for her dissertation and after they come across two mangled bodies of tribesmen they also come across Mike Logan carrying his injured partner Joe Walter Lucchini who both claim to have been attacked by savage cannibals.Between 1977 and 1981 there was a huge boom in cannibal films. They boasted exotic locations horrific gore real animal killings and the threat of the unknown in the primitive tribes. It was Ferox's director Umberto Lenzi who kickstarted the subgenre with Deep River Savages in 1972 but they only really hit their stride in 1977 when the Grindhouse theatres were at their most popular. The cannibal genre died out pretty quickly thankfully as they represent everything that is ugly about the horror genre and Cannibal Ferox possibly the second most notorious after Cannibal Holocaust is no exception.The gore and violence is by no means convincing or even disturbing but it is clear from the off that the film's sole purpose is to be more repulsive than anything else before it. Multiple cocks are hacked off and one is eaten  yummy a woman is lifted into the air with fish hooks through the breasts there is an eyegouging and of course no cannibal film would be complete without a bit of the ol' brain eating. This is all well and good and what can be expected from an Italian exploitation film at the height of the nasties era but the animal killings are simply needless.I always found myself defending Cannibal Holocaust for the animal cruelty as that is a genuinely good film and the horrific animal scenes really do add to the horrible and deeply unsettling atmosphere. But after seeing Ferox I realised there is really no excuse for it. Regardless of the film's quality there is no place for the pointless killing of animals. Radice refused to wield the knife during the pig killing scene and in the DVD commentary director Lenzi said 'Robert De Niro would have done it!' to which Radice replied 'Robert De Niro would have told you to fk off!'Anyway the film really is pretty damn awful. Why the action keeps shifting back to New York is anyone's guess. Mike is a wanted drug pusher that legged it off to Paraguay in search of cocaine and a fortune in gemstones but surely knowing this is enough? There is a rescue attempt near the end that looks like joining the two stems together but nothing comes of it. It seems to be there only to add a few more minutes onto the running time allowing the film to render itself a feature. As you would expect the actingscriptstory is guff but the strange thing is the moral message it seems to be putting out. When it revealed that Mike was lying and it was in fact him that attacked the tribe shock horror it seems to be a 'don't judge a book by it's cover' type message. But when the tribe acts out their revenge they revel in the torturing.Well anyway the real torture victim was me who had to sit through this. There's a few more cannibal films to get through for the nasties project maybe I'll leave them to Marc and although I'll welcome if that's the right word another viewing of Cannibal Holocaust I have to say that I would be happy not to have to sit through another cannibal film. And there's always the Mondo subgenre I suppose!www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Cannibal films were all the rage in the 70s and 80s. This was mainly in Italy and due to Deodato who directed the acclaimed Cannibal Holocaust and the first real cannibal film Jungle Holocaust that was just a test run before the big show. Cannibal Holocaust's success was due to the films unbelievable brutality and the awesome marketing. The handheld camera the research crew and the accidentally found film wasn't invented by the Blair Witch Project but by Cannibal Holocaust and Ruggero Deaodato. Of course the Italian copies made after the classic are nowhere near the same quality and are lacking in the whole production that surrounded it. One type of copy just kept the cannibals and became an adventure movie the other type just built on the brutality the second is the case with Cannibal Ferox. The producers didn't leave anything to chance so they hired someone who was at home in every genre Umberto Lenzi. Lenzi pounded out two films just to be sure on was Cannibal Ferox. It is one of the best copies of Cannibal Holocaust. Lenzi does his job perfectly 'cause what is the point of a film like this? That is brutal and faced paced and this film is those things. After Holocaust this film has the most brutal visuals but that's just one of the important parts of the film. Apart from that the director gives us a great atmosphere too. Helping it along is the professional cinematography and the awesome music that was also used in Eaten Alive. The actors can't be criticized either they are Italian stars they were just as good at playing Americans as the actors in Cannibal Holocaust. We can just come right out and say the script is garbage but with these types of films it would be a miracle if they weren't that. Unfortunately it follows in Holocausts footsteps by killing animals for real and that's reprehensible. It is interesting that just like all the rest of the great Italian productions it has a bunch of names. In Australia it was Woman from Deep River based on a previous Lenzi film and Make Them Die Slowly in the States and the tagline wasn't even about this film. In conclusion I'll just say if you liked Cannibal Holocaust I Ferox is a must see. If you didn't then run far far away. It's only really problem is that after Holocaust its basically just a copy but it had potential to be more but Lenzi was satisfied with just making a good clone. 610 httpswww.youtube.comusersilverscreenreviews1".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow! Where do I begin with my review on Cannibal Ferox?! There is just so much I want to write about I surely won't be able to fit it all in.I first saw this film just after 911 and it really got me thinking. We live in a world where the West are supposed to be the good guys and we are all very civilised. But then when you look at all the bad things in the world you wonder how this can be true and that's just the point Ferox makes.So anyway the movie begins in New York with a young dude wondering around the city. Some might think that the music is a little bit dumb here but that's just because it was the times and that was very normal back then. All the time this guy is just wondering around you are thinking Okaaaaay who is this guy?!?. Then it happens he runs into two thugs who just blow him away and you are left totally shocked 'cos you think he is the main character or something. Then it goes to the jungle and we meet the real main characters Gloria Rudy and Pat. Gloria is the intelligent young psychology student who wants to finally prove that cannibals are not real. Rudy is her cool and handsome brother and Pat is the free spirited sex bomb! Straight away you warm to Gloria and her brother but maybe Pat not so much especially after she sex with the biggest moustache ever! Then it's time they go into the jungle. They see a butterfly on the boat then when they get off they get trapped in some swamp and have to walk. This is where you know things are not gonna be pleasant. They get a small cat on a rope that I think was kinda cute. But then the first real horror thing happens the cat is on the rope which is on a stick in the ground so it can't escape. Then out of nowhere a huge and poisonous snake comes out of the jungle and strangles it to death! Now I know some people might not like this bit cos you can tell it is all 100 real and the animals had to die. But I think this is just nature and the film has to show it because that is the message it has that we are all in nature and can not escape it. OK they walk some more into the jungle and see an old tribe man eating maggots from the earth. If you have a stomach then turn away at this point. For me it is the worst bit of the movie because you see the old guy biting the maggot and chewing and I think this is worse than the animal kills and man eating that comes later. Then they run into Mike and Joe. Mike has to be one of the worst villains in all of cinema! Straight away you get the worst feeling with this guy. Joe is just his blind henchman too scared to stand up even though he knows he is wrong. Joe is badly injured as well. So they all wonder around some more and Mike tells them a story about a Portuguese guy. Yeah right!!!! This is all just a big lie and we find that out later. So they go to a village and Mike shoots a tribe girl. She dies and her husband runs off. At this point you are thinking oh boy the cannibals are no way gonna be happy when they get back. Joe dies of his illness. The cannibals take his body and eat his guts right in front of Gloria and Rudy!! They all try to escape but get captured. Mike gets what he deserves when his dick gets knifed off. The special effects here are so real that I literally had to hold my nuts and wince the first time I saw it. Someone said it looked like a hairy hernia but I didn't think so. Plus this was 30 years ago and much better than the CGI that is around today and just looks really fake. I won't spoil the rest for you. But I will say that if you are after a dumb horror movie you can just turn your brain off with then this is not for you. This movie is brutal heart breaking and very thought provoking. The scene where Gloria and Pat are singing to keep their spirits up always leaves me in tears. I didn't give this movie 1010 because I think that about half way through there is a black cop who is really not right for the movie. He looks really corny and says such silly lines. It really ruined that bit of the movie for me and I wish Lenzi had got rid of that bit because it is so not right in this film. But the rest of the film is actually perfect and the message is as powerful today as it was 30 years ago. The film's message is just so powerful after all who are the real cannibals?".

	schema:reviewBody "Cannibal Ferox is a really entertaining if mildly flawed cannibal classic.SPOILERSArriving in the Amazon Gloria Davis Lorraine De Selle her brother Rudy Danilo Mattei and their friend Pat Johnson Zora Kerova venture toward an abandoned city to prove her theories about cannibalism being a racist idea towards primitive man. Stuck in the jungle they are soon forced to go by foot to the village. Happening upon Mike Logan Giovanni Lombardo Radice and his wounded friend Joe Costolani Walter Lucchini out in the jungle they tell a tale of running into a cannibal tribe doing off with the rest of their gang and themselves barely getting out alive. Joining up together they come upon the village with the tribe only to find that those remaining are scared and fearful of them rather than torturing them. Spending time there they learn that there's been a series of lies involved in their story and finally the tribe rises up to take revenge on them in vicious ways.The News This is a rather entertaining cannibal entry though it's not without problems. Most notably this one has a series of great bloody kills that result in an overthetop display of gore. This one contains a whole smattering of gags and scenes that are simply gruesome and nauseating. Aside from a large amount of animal deaths there's a general assortment of torture inflicted on others. There's several impaled with a set of spikes through the chest from traps a couple of castrations some really graphic eviscerations dismemberments an infamous scalping done with a gigantic machete and a scene where a victim is dunked into a pool with live piranhas where they begin to gnaw on a wounded leg. It's most legendary scene though is where one is strung up with hooks through a vital part of the anatomy and hung up until they die. This is a long torturous scene that goes on forever and is just agonizing. These look incredibly realistic and are quite disgusting which the film has going for it. The animal violence in here while not as graphic as would originally expect there's certainly enough to make it feel nauseating. There's a lot more in here than expected yet they're not as graphic as others and all of them are obviously taken from elsewhere as they don't really fit in with the rest of the film.

The fact that this also manages to have a reasonable explanation for the trip downward which is also quite creative in it's own right is one of the best aspects of the film.

That the only real problem with the film's pacing is that it insists on cutting away from the unfolding drama to show us these pointless detective scenes in New York City. They really disrupt the flow of the picture and every time he switches venues it feels as if you're being physically pulled out of the movie. Ultimately they go nowhere and do nothing to serve the movie. They don't even capitalize on a golden plot point as the group that goes to South America don't even find them.

There's even a little flaw with that as there's too much interfering in the good parts to go to them and it really ruins the flow the ending develops.

Stuck in the jungle they are soon forced to go by foot to the village. Happening upon Mike Logan Giovanni Lombardo Radice and his wounded friend Joe Costolani Walter Lucchini out in the jungle they tell a tale of running into a cannibal tribe doing off with the rest of their gang and themselves barely getting out alive. Joining up together they come upon the village with the tribe only to find that those remaining are scared and fearful of them rather than torturing them. Spending time there they learn that there's been a series of lies involved in their story and finally the tribe rises up to take revenge on them in vicious ways.The News This is a rather entertaining cannibal entry though it's not without problems. Most notably this one has a series of great bloody kills that result in an overthetop display of gore. This one contains a whole smattering of gags and scenes that are simply gruesome and nauseating. Aside from a large amount of animal deaths there's a general assortment of torture inflicted on others. There's several impaled with a set of spikes through the chest from traps a couple of castrations some really graphic eviscerations dismemberments an infamous scalping done with a gigantic machete and a scene where a victim is dunked into a pool with live piranhas where they begin to gnaw on a wounded leg.

The only decent thing in the movie was the score during the jungle scenes something i thought was much more appropriate for the subject matter than the over dramatic love ballad in cannibal holocaust.

However things don't work out as planned as they soon find themselves in the same village where things take a turn for the worse not long afterward. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting movie for the most part with Zora Kerova providing some attractive scenery along the way. Unfortunately it suffered from a low budget and a somewhat disappointing ending. Additionally although the main intent was to showcase certain scenes of a gory nature I wasn't very impressed and would have preferred a bit more action or suspense instead. That being said I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly below average.".

Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting movie for the most part with Zora Kerova providing some attractive scenery along the way. Unfortunately it suffered from a low budget and a somewhat disappointing ending. Additionally although the main intent was to showcase certain scenes of a gory nature I wasn't very impressed and would have preferred a bit more action or suspense instead. That being said I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly below average.";

It's a deliberately cheesy and darkly comic movie that definitely harks back similar movies from the 80s. Some of the darkest parts of the movie had me stifling guilty giggles that's good black comedy in my book.I thought the performance from the two leads was solid and enjoyable. Megan Fox played up Jennifer's sexiness but gave her a subtle undercurrent of insecurity which gave tension to the character. Amanda Seyfried's Needy might not have been the cheerleader but was really the more settled and selfassured of the two characters.Friendships held since childhood can become somewhat ambiguous as people age. This movie captured that well. To me the kiss between Jennifer and Needy really showed the lowkey battle that was constantly raging between them one they weren't consciously aware of most of the time.Funniest scene for me involved some extremely shallow hipsters involved in some very dark dealings. Deliciously silly.So in conclusion give this movie a try. There's a strong chance that you'll have a very good time.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Jennifer's Body was first announced to me I met the idea with cautious curiosity. The idea of Megan Fox playing an evil high school beauty queen who eats the boys she seduces sounded... interesting to say the least. When the trailer finally emerged I got excited. Seriously. The combination of thrilling and funny hadn't been explored well at the theater in a long time.Unfortunately it still hasn't been explored well at least not very well. The movie understands what it's going for a comic horror film with just enough gore and jumps to be jarring and plenty of witty dialogue to stay fresh. The problem is the two don't seem to meld together very well at any point. It's hard to say whether this has more to do with Diablo Cody's script or Karyn Kusama's direction neither is at it's full potential here. Although on recollection of the film the toorandom use of humor sometimes seems to have been the biggest problem.But let's talk about what works. The leads are both very good. It was Megan Fox who got lots of good buzz about proving she could actually act but Amanda Seyfried really impressed me more with her edgy role. The performances of both are worthy of accolades. They bring honesty and realism to what could have become total caricatures and their performances help paint the deeper themes of the movie quite well.Yes there are deeper themes. It's not too hard to spot what Ms. Cody is trying to talk about here The relationships girls have with each other. The whole 'Frenemies' idea that so defines high school girls. It's an interesting concept to examine and it could have made for a truly entertaining AND thoughtful film.But it simply isn't. While it wants to get there it gets too lost in trying to be hip and current and 'alternative' to really become a film. And while the tension builds decently toward the finale it all leads up to a climax that... doesn't really climax.However this is not to say Jennifer's Body isn't worth watching. Hell I was entertained and there are some sexy little scenes in there. The disappointment lies in thinking about what the premise promised a promise that sadly wasn't quite fulfilled... 610 stars Jay Addison".

	schema:reviewBody "It has been some time since I've written a review on this site but I felt this movie and its current underwhelming performance at the box office warrants some good press. Jennifer's Body is a very entertaining film and is sure to be one that many discover in its DVD release which according to interviews director Karyn Kusama has material she is anxious to release.Make no mistake JB isn't an Oscar contender then again it's not trying to be. It is attempting to throw the viewer into a world of heightened teenage brutality and in that it succeeded. Diablo Cody who seems to draw a love herhate her reaction from audiences writes a script that perhaps has one too many pop culture references or quirky word choices. But that is Cody's world. Why say someone is good looking when you can say they're salty? It may not make a whole lot of sense but Cody captures teen speak in her dialogue and it is a lot of fun to watch her characters say such unusual things with such ease and normalcy. Cody's writing is what separates this film from other evilteen horror films. Also impressive is when Cody is able to create some genuinely sincere moments between the characters amid the violence and chaos occurring.This film does not apologize for its odd premise nor does it try to compensate for it. JB plays it straight recognizing the plot is entirely superficial. This premise doesn't hold the film back. The plot throws enough fun details in the mix that drive this film forward making it a fantastic platform for the starts of the film obviously the cast and Cody's writing.About the cast As Jennifer Megan Fox is quite great! Not only does she have the looks to support her character she creates a girl you love to hate. Jennifer is the ultimate high school goddess but underneath the sexy exterior and projected confidence lies a tortured soul...physically personified by the demon within her. Fox is sexy when she needs to be but wrecked when it calls for it. One short scene has possessed Jennifer disgusted with herself smearing makeup across her face in a very desperate fashion desperate to hide her insecurities from the world. It is an impacting moment. Fox is another lovehate personality these days who draws just as much backlash as praise. Say what you want about her prior efforts but Megan took charge of her character and was creative with her.Amanda Seyfried stood against Fox well. Naturally Fox is a force to be reckon with these days and Amanda playing the gawky nice girl who hides her beauty holds her own. The girl can act and also creates a very sympathetic and relatable character. She manages to create some very humorous moments while being natural. Her admiration for Jennifer is quite clear and Seyfried manages to capture it nicely without making the character seem obsessive.The guys in the cast most who are present so Jennifer can have a meal are each unique. Props to Kyle Gallner who disappears in his emogoth role. I had only seen him in the bland Haunting in Connecticut. Adam Brody who plays the lead singer of the band that sacrifices Jennifer had a lot of fun with his role. He creates a character that is so selfish and evil but seems like a guy who would be fun to have drinks with...if you knew he didn't want to kill you.Finally Kusama's direction is swift and competent. She captures the film well not overusing horror techniques and keeping the look of the film fresh. The film's soundtrack is also offbeat and unusual for the genre but is filled with some great music. The song sung by Brody's band Through the Trees has a great rhythm and lyrics. It's the sort of song that if actually released would undoubtedly be a chart topper.Is JB the best film you will see all year? No. Is it the worst as many have been claiming? Not by a long shot. JB is different. It's star has been the center of a media obsession. JB is taking the brunt end of this. Behind the harsh criticisms of reviewers who seem to be shifting their disappointment lies a very entertaining and wellmade film despite its subject matter being quite superficial. Forget what you've heard against it forget what you were expecting. If you like horror Cody's style clever films character films or any combination of the above go see Jennifer's Body. This film deserves a better box office. I for one would like to see more films like this made and that will only happen if people go see them. Make it happen ya'll.".

	schema:reviewBody "You know how when you meet some really cool girl and you get along really well and you've known her for a couple years and you don't see her all that often but every time you do you remember what a blast you have with her. And then you find out she's got a big sister who's really hot because your friend shows you a picture and your friend says she's gonna introduce you to the sister. So it's all good and you get pumped about the meeting but then when you're at the Bar None and you meet the older sister you find out she's nowhere near as cool as the younger sister and you're disappointed because you thought there'd be some family resemblance not in looks but in the way they act but there just isn't to the point it's harder to get drunk than usually because you're not having the fun you thought you would.It's kinda like that with Juno and Jennifer's Body. Diablo Cody the writer who stripped for a year before she decided to write Juno has presented us with this her latest. But Jennifer leaves an aftertaste that Juno didn't.Here's what i like about Jennifer's Body. The film was written by a woman Diablo Cody directed by a woman Karyn Kusama and stars two women. i like that it's a strong feminine movie where the male and female roles are reversed for what i have baptized a 'Switch Flick'. Megan Fox while maybe at 23 a little old to play a highschool cheerleader does a solid job as Jennifer and Amanda Seyfried makes the most of her portrayal as Jennifer's best friend while even more interestingly the male parts of Jennifer's Body are tiny and insignificant. The chesty victims of traditional horror films are replaced by flat little boys and here the boy's meatier parts are held by women.The downside of the movie is that as a satire of teenager slasher films there is some humor but the basic framework is exactly the same as the movies it mocks. The director and writer should have taken the originality of their treatment of the characters and spread it into the story the directing the plot and all the rest of that stuff. As it is Jennifer doesn't go as far as her little sister Juno.".

So it's all good and you get pumped about the meeting but then when you're at the Bar None and you meet the older sister you find out she's nowhere near as cool as the younger sister and you're disappointed because you thought there'd be some family resemblance not in looks but in the way they act but there just isn't to the point it's harder to get drunk than usually because you're not having the fun you thought you would.It's kinda like that with Juno and Jennifer's Body. Diablo Cody the writer who stripped for a year before she decided to write Juno has presented us with this her latest. But Jennifer leaves an aftertaste that Juno didn't.Here's what i like about Jennifer's Body. The film was written by a woman Diablo Cody directed by a woman Karyn Kusama and stars two women. i like that it's a strong feminine movie where the male and female roles are reversed for what i have baptized a 'Switch Flick'. Megan Fox while maybe at 23 a little old to play a highschool cheerleader does a solid job as Jennifer and Amanda Seyfried makes the most of her portrayal as Jennifer's best friend while even more interestingly the male parts of Jennifer's Body are tiny and insignificant. The chesty victims of traditional horror films are replaced by flat little boys and here the boy's meatier parts are held by women.The downside of the movie is that as a satire of teenager slasher films there is some humor but the basic framework is exactly the same as the movies it mocks. The director and writer should have taken the originality of their treatment of the characters and spread it into the story the directing the plot and all the rest of that stuff. As it is Jennifer doesn't go as far as her little sister Juno.";

I can understand all the people who don't like Diablo Cody's writing because she uses hip language and things like that but that is in fact why I love it! For the film nerds out there No I did not go to film school. I like many different types of movies. I like all the same movies you like and then probably a lot you don't. But the difference between you and me is that I can appreciate a movie for what it is.We can all agree that Jennifer's Body is not going to win the Oscar for best picture....SO WHAT!!! I love it anyway and here is why.A script can only be so good on paper. It really does need great actors to take the film to the next level and thats just what happened with this movie. Jennifer's body does start out with a good script. Yes that's right I think Diablo Cody has a great and unique style of writing...ooooooooooooo get over it. Amanda as the character Needy is fantastic. She is a great actress with a lot of talent. Megan Fox is almost too beautiful to be real and that really helps the character of Jennifer stand out. She is improving as an actress and the movies she are in are meant to be taken as fun. Not some film like Citizen Kane. The character Chip is great along with the goth kid Colin. These two dudes play great awkward teenagers. The teacher played by J.K. Simmons was cool. The sex scene with Needy and Chip was for the most part unlike the typical Hollywood sex scene. It was real and funny. The movie has great direction from Karyn Kusama. And how about the make out scene with Needy and Jennifer?! that was crazy HOT. Low Shoulder were hilarious as the indie band that try to sacrifice Jennifer to the devil. Adam Brody was great and the fact that the band goes to such great lengths to get popular only shows how fake indie bands are anyway. They just want to be rich and famous like other rock stars. I don't know what else to say I could go on forever. I hope Diablo Cody goes on to write more scripts and i hope they get made into great movies because she has a fan for life right here. Thats about it I guess. I love Jennifer's Body!!!!!!!!".

First of all this review contains SPOILERS! This is a horror comedy with a razor sharp script and beautiful music video footage. A lot of the latter part of the movie feels kind of like a Rammstein video  in a good way. But the thing that I like best with this movie is that it doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It doesn't take itself too serious. I suppose that you could compare it to 'The Faculty' although I'd say this one's a lot better. But the movie that I think is most appropriate to compare it to is the eighties movie 'Heathers'. And I believe that it's a fair comparison and that 'Jennifer's Body' is just as good. So if you like 'Heathers' you should definitely see this. If not you might as well give it a miss.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jennifer's body is a movie I actually had a lot of fun with and I'll tell you why. It's a great throwback to the cheesy yet fun 80's horror films only with a bigger budget. I really felt like I was back in the 80's and it made me reminisce a lot heck even the characters feel 80'ish. All I have heard was how terrible this was but those are probably the people who appreciate the neverending pg rated crap that comes out like crazy now a days. I thought it was a nice touch how Needy was telling the story from a Mental institution at the start it set the perfect tone for the movie. Megan Fox is actually pretty arresting as Jennifer not only because of her looks but she shocked the heck out of me with her devilishly funny performance. The gore level is pretty decent and Horror fans will be pretty pleased with that. The character development was also better than usual for this sort of thing. Amanda Seyfreid's geeky yet undeniably dynamic performance often made many highlights for the movie. Jennifer's body is silly fun and never tries to be anything more I really don't understand the hate for this movie.Performances. Megan Fox is the epitome of sexiness no doubt about it. For us guys seeing her swim naked in a lake or act like a complete btch is a major turn on but I think the woman will be quite surprised by her devilishly funny and witty performance. She has come a long way from Transformers and while she's far from an A list actress this is a step in the right direction. Her chemistry with Seyfried is on the ball as well. Amanda Seyfried is the heart of the movie in my opinion. I was impressed with her in Mama Mia and here she delivered big time. Her geeky yet captivating performance was great and she only got better when she was bordering on the edge of obsession. Johnny Simmons is quite likable as Chip. He's nave but not a pig like many are in this sort of genre it was refreshing. Adam Brody is fittingly menacing as Nikolai he did what he had to do well. Kyle Gallner plays a nerd well. J.K. Simmons has a great part as a teacher.Bottom line. I actually enjoyed Jennifer's Body and when the sales price inevitably comes down I am definitely adding it to my DVD collection. It's a wonderful throw back to 80's Horror and hopefully people notice that. Recommended.710P.S Don't turn it off when the credits roll there is stuff you may wanna see.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I watch movies all I ask is to be entertained. This movie did just that. It held my attention the entire way through. I will admit that there were a few scenes where I may have rolled my eyes and wondered why they felt the need to take certain scenes in certain directions.First I must say I adored Adam Brody in this film. I have always been a fan of him since his O.C. days and I enjoyed the few moments in this film where Seth Cohen came shining through! Being an emo rock god works for him...he had my attention that's for sure! Now on to the film. I sat here and read most the board posts and while I was quite enthralled by all the interpretive views of the film I will review as I saw it. What a fantastic idea Diablo! High school is hell and so are teenage girls as was pointed out in the very beginning. Many girls in high school had that one friend who you knew was prettier more popular. And although you were friends you were secretly jealous of her more. This movie did a great job depicting that. It was a fun movie and semirelatable. Minus all the demon crap. I wasn't that thrilled with either of the female characters I found myself getting more annoyed than anything. Although the quote from Jennifer I Am A God cracked me up a bit if for no other reason then it being random. The dialogue was very Junoesquire that's for sure. I mean who says salty and can do so without cracking up? I did enjoy the relationship between Needy and Chip who I loved in this movie he was great. I wanted so bad for them to live happily ever after but that dang Jennifer just had to take a chunk out of his neck...if for no other reason but to prove to Needy she could have and do whatever she wanted. Which seemed to be the main theme of the movie. It was always Jennifer speaking as if or trying to prove that she was an irresistible force in their school. No one had a chance up against her including her supposed BFF. And that was even BEFORE the demon took her over...All in all if you are looking for jump out of your skin scary this isn't your movie. As a matter of fact it wasn't scary at all...at least not in my opinion. But if you think Megan Fox is hot you like lesbian scenes you remember high school and could relate to this or you're looking for an all around fun movie then I recommend renting it. I would never buy it it's not that good but it's worth the 4 or 5 dollars!".

The first 10 mins are beautifully shot not to mention the narration by the main character is pretty good too. The storyline is intriguing even though you decipher the final twist of the movie you are not 100 certain that you are right about it and most of you were not even though you won't admit it now. The horror scenes are extremely unnerving spoiler alert! especially the scene right after Jennifer's possession when she comes back to needy's home. The love scenes rather lust scenes  depict the state of mind of teenagers very truthfully. Most people say that was just stupid why would he walk their? hormones is the answer. Boys would do anything for tail and thats what this film shows. You wouldn't go into a dark street for a pack of cigarettes but you would go running if a girl like Miss Fox is waiting on the other end 2nd Guy. The best thing about this movie is that it has a satisfying end when nowadays capitalist studios make some room for a sequel in the movie's climax when the villain rises again etc  like Homecoming. I am sure you won't be hearing about Jennifer's Body The Black Diamond Curse. The last scene when spoiler alert! Jennifer dies is extremely well shot and written as in screenplay the actual dialogs are OK. You will leave the theater content with the movie's end. Some problems are their that didn't let this movie turn into a great one. For example the dialog at some point is simply vague like Megan saying my tit at the end of the movie. They could have come up with a better deeper line in accordance with the scene. Also even though a minor detail the exchange student is shown as a Sikh whereas his name was Ahmed which is a Muslim name. A bit research would have taken this movie even more higher. Megan fox shows unexpectedly for me the depth of her acting as she makes you believe that she is a evil teenager. Amanda's acting is flawless as her role is affected less by the vague lines I mentioned earlier. I really liked the movie even though I heard bad things about it from friends. 100 recommended to any Miss Fox fan  nonfan and horrorsuspense genre fanatics. Peace.

	schema:headline " Return to High School Horror!";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe I haven't reviewed this movie! Anyways.To be completely honest with you I enjoyed Jennifer's Body for the next reasons1 The HorrorComedy entertainment in fast track fastfood style. 2 It made me remember about the era when Horror Movies from the 80's were placed in junior or high school with plots such like Trick Or Treat Deadly Friend or even Fright Night. I even consider this movie to be very similar to Prom Night III The Last Kiss. That's just me... Heck even the posters look very similar. 3 It has everything to become a cult classic because of it's dialogs and plot.The plot is dynamic and it presents killings and gore very soon. Sure always accompanied by a common bad habit in modern Horror CGI. But which movie doesn't use it?I had doubts before watching the movie mainly because it's writer Diablo Cody was the responsible for creating Juno a movie that generated plenty of controversy and gained plenty of hype to the point to be considered overrated and tendentious.Anyways the scriptplot is nothing new but it joins two very attractive topics that were extremely popular in the 80's 1 Vampirism and Cannibalism but this time it's a sexy succubus. 2 Hard RockMetal bands that worship the devil.All those elements land in a high school atmosphere a situation that isn't bad at all if you take in consideration that the movie is oriented for young adults or teens.Let's keep in mind that this PG13 movie invasion has had good exceptions like Drag Me To Hell and in the case of Jennifer's Body I truly believe it's a worthy option because it adds somehow originality to the genre.I think that the events are treated adequately in order to maintain a cool feeling through the running time for the audience thus making click with the characters. This is made through good acting from Amanda Seyfried who completely believes in her character and demonstrates her versatility as an actress. The good news is that Megan Fox's acting isn't painful. Heck she even delivers signals that she could become a decent actress. Megan's role was perfect for her because she could exploit her obvious sensuality and sexuality and her role model image for young people. The chemistry between Seyfriend and Fox is really good and it's displayed in all the scenes they share. Even in the kinky and passionate kiss that rose the theater's temperature.We got memorable scenes like Jennifer walking in slow motion wearing tight jeans and a pink shirt. Or Jenn wearing the skimpy cheerleader miniskirt the tough guy's split corpse the fire in the bar some junior high students singing the In song Needy walking with a good attitude in the ending the last fight between the two leads the death scenes etc.The negativity of the movie deals with the high expectations towards it created by the poster where it sells Megan's body. Some dialogs that try to be cool the now popular vampiric plot this could be considered as Twilight for men! and the not so good CGI.The Direction is pretty good and I enjoyed the contrast between some colorful atmosphere school bedrooms the band playing flashbacks and the night sequences dirty pool woods mist. A very good cinematography and art direction. I like the movie's look. The soundtrack was good and I even noticed myself moving my foot following the rhyming of some songs!. It's catchy rock from the new millennium but it works for the movie's tone. Gore is just decent although we don't get that much blood we get a cool vampiric creature spitting insects and black blood stabbings harsh beatings and more Megan's demise.The vampiriccannibalistic action is tremendously entertaining. The dialogs are pure trash but highly entertaining trash. Through some dialogs I realized that I'm getting old and I barely understood some injokes such as a thing with Hannah Montana PMS insults like Monistat Vagisil etc. It reminded me of my good days in late 80's Horror. The HorrorComedy aspect is very well handled and delivers some smiles of irreverent. The same goes for the black humor which is the element that saved the movie from being...let's just say another one from the pile.You should definitely check out Jennifer's Body in order to get some nostalgia feelings that deal with Highschool Horror which was often used in the 80's. Sure not adapted to the needs of a consumerist society filled with clichs...you'll understand why. I have the slight impression that we will have many many movies like Jennifer's Body in the future. Not a bad thing.".

If Cody's script can't find a balance between the horror the humor and the pathos director Kusama steers the film even more erratically resulting in a tone that remains unsettled until the very end. Ultimately Jennifer's Body has its share of visually arresting moments and fine performances particularly Seyfried's but it has much less to offer than its obvious and far superior influences Jacques Tourneur's and Paul Schrader's Cat People and the Ginger Snaps trilogy which took the metaphorical monstrosity of puberty and its own clever dialog into much more exciting territory.".

But what do the stupid Oscar voters do? They give DC the Oscar and ignore the fact that she was CARRIED by the others while denying Page and Reitman Oscars. Probably because of DC's personal story of sex worker turned genius as Hollywood loves to reward the sleazy people and DC had a sleazy life.So now we have this movie where there is no strong director no strong actors and we see that DC is a mediocre writer. Not awful but not great either. Predictable and clichd in places just like Juno. Antimen just like Juno. Oscar nomination? Ha not just like Juno. ".

I watched this film on a prerelease viewing and I did not know what it was I was in for until I saw the films' title across the screen.'Jennifers Body' appears to be a dark comedy. There are humorous parts that are related to some sort for sexual innuendo or blatant sexual act such as the charming description of Jennifer played by Megan fox who had to sit on a bag of frozen vegetables after losing her 'backdoor virginity.' But there are good suspenseful horror moments I must admit. There were a lot of screams from the girls in the theater due mostly to what I call 'cheap scares' the typical I know someone is going to jump out now I'm just waiting for it scare. Yet the blood and gore was convincing and I have to say that the scene where Jennifer appears in her best friends house covered in blood giving a demonic blood filled smile and spewing out black goo WAS pretty good horror. As this scene was in the first 1020 I thought we were in for a reasonably good movie. Meh. Not really.The acting wasn't bad. But you could tell that Megan Fox loved every second of being seminaked or sexually flirtatious on screen. Her character was the 'hot chick' who could woo anyone with the flutter of her eyelashes. Yes we all know she is attractive but every second of this film was like HEY GUYS! LOOK AT MEGAN! ISN'T SHE HOT! It got old pretty quick. And Adam Brody was terrible. You'll see why.Yes there were demons AND the mandatory lesbian scene with Megan Fox. Contrasting I know. But apparently that's what the people want so lets give it to them! A little insulting to say the least.To be honest a pretty disappointing script from Diablo Cody especially after Juno which was witty and clever. Overall 510. I would not pay money for a ticket and petrol to go watch it at the cinema but probably would borrow it off a friend to watch if they hired it. Cheap thrills.

	schema:headline " Neither scary nor particularly funny...";
	schema:reviewBody "Predictably the only reason I went to see Jennifer's Body was because of Megan Fox. Not because I think she's a great actress  she's done nothing to prove this  but because... well it's Megan Fox. The only reason why she was discovered by Michael Bay and put in the Transformers movies was because she's hot and that's precisely the only reason why she was given her first starring role with Jennifer's Body. Because really although she isn't particularly awful  I've seen worst performances in porn movies  her performing skills don't deserve as much attention as she has been receiving. Yes that basically means she doesn't give a very good performance in Jennifer's Body. And to be honest that's something of a disappointment  before watching the movie I had a little bit of hope that the reason why Fox had given such horrible performances in the Transformers movies was Michael Bay's inability to direct actors. After watching this movie though I concluded that Fox is nothing more than eye candy  whether she's directed by Bay or Martin Scorsese she'll always give a bad performance.The film tells the story of teenager Needy Amanda Seyfried whose best friend is the ridiculously hot Jennifer Megan Fox. The former has a somehow timid but likable boyfriend Chip Johnny Simmons while the latter loves the fact that she can sleep with whoever she wants whenever she wants. One night Jennifer takes Needy to a bar to watch the semipopular rock band Low Shoulder. The lead singer Adam Brody gives Needy the creeps but Jennifer likes him. After the show is abruptly ended by a fire the group takes her to their van and they disappear... Needy fears the worst. Next day though Jennifer appears to be all right. It turns out that instead of dying a pretty horrible death she was turned into a demon who has to eat boys in order to maintain her hotness.I understand what Diablo Cody screenwritter of the fabulous Juno tried to do. Instead of crafting a straightforward horror story she tried to write something a little more humorous and a little more quirky but the problem with this approach is that the movie doesn't really know what it wants to do. At times it can be hilarious  because the filmmakers are providing with a joke or gag or some weirdish quirky line  while at others it can be unintentionally  and awfully  funny. And when it tries to be scary it utterly  and somehow embarrassingly  fails. You'd have to be either a very small boy or girl or a very frightful person in order to be scared by the movie.Although the aforementioned Fox is not very convincing as Jennifer  okay that's unfair she is convincing when portraying the megahot highschool girl because she's basically playing herself it's when she turns into a boyeating monster that things become laughable  the rest of the cast are pretty much all right. Because Amanda Seyfried  who was delightful in the underrated Mamma Mia  can act Fox's performance seems even more artificial than it already is. What's more  Needy is virtually the only believable character in the whole movie which is a blessing considering she's the main one. Johnny Simmons is also very likable as Chip  his eventual fate was the only scene in the film that got me emotionally involved with what was happening on screen  and a very small supporting performance by J.K. Simmons  as a school teacher  is as memorable as things get in this film.Those who want to watch the movie to catch a glimpse of a naked Megan Fox are definitely going to be disappointed. Although there's plenty of gore guts and language Fox never gets naked. During a weird skinny dipping scene her nude body is hidden from view by tricky camera angles and other techniques and the only really sexual scene in which she gets involved  not even Fox can make cannibalism hot  is a lesbian kissing sequence with Seyfried. Can't say it's not a hot scene  because it is  but it somehow seemed tame for today's standards. Really though these are only very small problems which I could have forgiven had the film worked as a horror flick  the main problem with Jennifer's Body is that it's neither scary nor laughoutloud funny.Having seen and appreciated Juno I was expecting more from screen writer Diablo Cody. This is a case of a very successful  and from what I gathered from her previous movie talented  screen writer trying to do something different and failing. Yes her intentions were really noble but the end result  being in this case a motion picture  is nothing short of a disaster. While Amanda Seyfried tries to give her best  unlike Fox she doesn't embarrass herself  the rest of the production is so mediocre I can't believe someone thought it was worth releasing in theatres. If Jennifer's Body was a way to prove that Diablo Cody could write a successful horror film it failed. And if it was to prove that Megan Fox was something more than eye candy then it also failed. And really Fox isn't that hot either. For my money Seyfried is a million times prettier and she has the advantage that unlike Fox she can act.".

You'd have to be either a very small boy or girl or a very frightful person in order to be scared by the movie.Although the aforementioned Fox is not very convincing as Jennifer  okay that's unfair she is convincing when portraying the megahot highschool girl because she's basically playing herself it's when she turns into a boyeating monster that things become laughable  the rest of the cast are pretty much all right. Because Amanda Seyfried  who was delightful in the underrated Mamma Mia  can act Fox's performance seems even more artificial than it already is. What's more  Needy is virtually the only believable character in the whole movie which is a blessing considering she's the main one. Johnny Simmons is also very likable as Chip  his eventual fate was the only scene in the film that got me emotionally involved with what was happening on screen  and a very small supporting performance by J.K. Simmons  as a school teacher  is as memorable as things get in this film.Those who want to watch the movie to catch a glimpse of a naked Megan Fox are definitely going to be disappointed. Although there's plenty of gore guts and language Fox never gets naked. During a weird skinny dipping scene her nude body is hidden from view by tricky camera angles and other techniques and the only really sexual scene in which she gets involved  not even Fox can make cannibalism hot  is a lesbian kissing sequence with Seyfried. Can't say it's not a hot scene  because it is  but it somehow seemed tame for today's standards. Really though these are only very small problems which I could have forgiven had the film worked as a horror flick  the main problem with Jennifer's Body is that it's neither scary nor laughoutloud funny.Having seen and appreciated Juno I was expecting more from screen writer Diablo Cody. This is a case of a very successful  and from what I gathered from her previous movie talented  screen writer trying to do something different and failing. Yes her intentions were really noble but the end result  being in this case a motion picture  is nothing short of a disaster. While Amanda Seyfried tries to give her best  unlike Fox she doesn't embarrass herself  the rest of the production is so mediocre I can't believe someone thought it was worth releasing in theatres. If Jennifer's Body was a way to prove that Diablo Cody could write a successful horror film it failed. And if it was to prove that Megan Fox was something more than eye candy then it also failed. And really Fox isn't that hot either. For my money Seyfried is a million times prettier and she has the advantage that unlike Fox she can act.";

The whole thing plays like a bad horror comedy. Fox can't act and has a great difficulty portraying anything remotely believable as the lead. She's nothing more than eye candy here.Amanda Seyfriend fresh from Mamma Mia and the hit show Big Love is far better as Jennifer's best friend appropriately named Needy.The ending while a shock sets things up for another film and I heard a lot of whining from the audience by the time the credits rolled.My advise wait for this one on DVD save your money for a better movie.".

The movie starts with Needy in an institution I wonder why? and you see some scars I wonder where they're from?. Btw these questions are answered if you watch the movie. The movie goes on to establish just HOW close these 2 girls are and once you establish that they might be the same person it's very interesting to watch. It explains a lot of things in the film such as Needy going to the door and no one being there and suddenly Jennifer is inside. Anyway the list of fun facts goes on and I really feel like the movie didn't get enough credit.

Jealousy fills so many with rage. She doesn't say all the right things that we expect from celebrities and somehow this causes even more hatred. Curiosity and the fact that she's the reason 'wow' is in our vocabulary has kept me interested and the hatred from everyone for nothing made me even more. Put all three of these people together and you've got Jennifer's Body. It's fun silly disturbing wild sexy and one of the best movies of the year.
