Novarro taking the hero role this time proved he was no flash in the pan. Equally adept as sensitive lover or dueling revolutionary with this performance Novarro was catapulted to Hollywood's upper ranks. Stone gives a finely nuanced performance as the villain of the story slowly revealing layers to the man's personality not readily apparent at first. Miss Terry who was Ingram's wife is lovely but the plot gives her little to do except look distressed or frightened.In the supporting cast special note should be given to George Siegmann striking in the historical role of Danton. Edward Connelly as the King's Minister makes a marvelous grotesque.It is interesting to note that Italianborn British author Rafael Sabatini 18751950 had been a novelist for many years before striking gold with Scaramouche. Its popularity with the public to say nothing of this acclaimed movie adaptation pushed it permanently onto that small shelf of fiction and films  A Tale of Two Cities  The Scarlet Pimpernel  ORPHANS OF THE STORM  forever associated with the French Revolution.

It was also one of the bigger moneymakers of Metro Pictures before it combined the following year as part of the MetroGoldwynMayer colossus. Novarro's box office appeal was one of the bigger assets the newly created MGM acquired.Novarro strikes the right notes of passion romance and swashbuckling derringdo as the young lawyer of questionable parentage who starts an odyssey of adventure when he runs afoul of nobleman Lewis Stone when he calls him out after Stone who is a master swordsman kills young Otto Matieson in a one sided contest.With the authorities looking for him in the France of Louis XVI Novarro takes refuge in a troupe of strolling players and plays the famous clown character Scaramouche. Before the film France falls to the Revolutionary Terror and Novarro discovers his true heritage and his true love. Scaramouche firmly established Novarro as the number one rival of Latin Lover Rudolphe Valentino. In fact Novarro seemed to be able to handle a bigger variety of roles in silent films than Valentino. Of course we'll never know what Valentino might have done in the sound era.Lewis Stone as the villainous nobleman who is the bane of Novarro's existence is a far cry from Judge Hardy of Carvel the ever wise father of Mickey Rooney and Cecilia Parker later on. But Stone from the time he was on stage before the Spanish American War handled a variety of parts in stock companies and Broadway. Those were the days where you had these local theater groups to learn your trade and Stone learned it better than most. He and Lionel Barrymore were mainstays in just about every MGM production of note while they were with the studio.Scaramouche is a deserved silent classic and don't miss it when TCM decides to run it.".

The story is set during the time of the French Revolution. The film begins with Mr. Stone as the Marquis de la Tour killing Mr. Novarro Moreau's best friend which makes them great enemies. Enemies usually like the same woman in this case the coveted Ms. Terry as Aline creates the additional animosity.This is a wellproduced spectacle from director Rex Ingram the film obviously cost a fortune and the money was well spent creating a beautiful looking film. Mr. Ingram does a great job of pacing the approximately two hours of film it retains much of its pace today relative to other 1920s epics. Ingram's cinematographer John F. Seitz and star Ramon Novarro are indispensable. Mr. Seitz' photography is great from the windmilly opening until the final conflicts. Some of the spectacular scenes are still terrific but some do look like they were staged to fit the movie screen where everyone gathers for Action!Mr. Novarro's lead performance is excellent though it might have been wise to let him use more of the aheadoftheirtime skills that are clearly evident. But what's left is fine  best are the looks from the performers which are not overacted mostly. Lewis Terry and most everyone performs well. Novarro must join an acting troupe by the way while ontherun  he becomes Monsieur X and play acts clown Scaramouche giving the film its title. Watch for the relationship between Novarro and a woman from the troupe and the reason he finally rejects her it parallels the major love triangle. Also watch for two of the characters to startlingly look exactly likealike the shocking second revelation at the end of the film.

Scaramouche like his other gorgeously mounted adventure sagas The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse The Prisoner of Zenda or BenHur which he codirected illustrate clearly how the art of cinema took a body blow with the coming of sound recovery from which took several years. The kinds of stunning compositions and environmental detail that were possible before the soundtrack era had to be jettisoned just for the sake of miking so we lost much of this intensive artistry. Visually this film is every bit as impressive as Selznick's A Tale of Two Cities or Korda's The Scarlet Pimpernel both made well into the sound era over a decade later. Ingram was a visionary right up there with Griffith Stroheim and early DeMille. This film is beautiful right down to the title cards.In this tale of the French Revolution we are treated to large doses of The Masses as in the later Selznick Tale of Two Cities. In fact these masses are so vividly presented that one suspects that Selznick borrowed some of his imagery from Ingram. Like The Scarlet Pimpernel Scaramouche is a participant in the events of the era. But whereas the Pimpernel used ingenious disguises and impersonations to save selected aristocrats from the guillotine Scaramouche uses his position as popular comedic stage actor and skilled swordsman to rouse the masses to revolutionary action and successfully duel to the death with reactionary members of the National Assembly. Ramon Novarro who plays the title character was second only to Valentino as a heartthrob of the silent era but his countenance and manner were gentler. Lewis Stone best known for his stern but benign elder patriarch roles in talkies was once the dashing chiselledfeatured leading man on display here. Alice Terry as the love interest reminds us of how cinematic standards of beauty have changed. Her costuming and coiffure notwithstanding there is a pre20thcentury quality to her as if she stepped out of a painting or daguerrotype.".

	schema:headline " An excellent adventure film but not up to the standards of the sound remake";
	schema:reviewBody "Had I never read the original novel Scaramouche by Rafael Sabatini and had I never seen the amazing Stewart Granger film of the 1950s then I probably would have loved this silent movie. However the book was so good and the Granger film so perfect that I found myself forever comparing this silent epic to the others and it usually came up short. In a way that's sad because it IS a very good filmespecially compared to other films of the day.The basic plot is set in the days just following the French Revolution of 1789. For a few short years the country had still not slipped into radicalism and the country was ruled by a coalition of the old elite and young upstarts. Eventually of course most of the elite would be executed or run off to exile but this film is set during the last gasps of the nobleswho STILL exercised some of their old clout.Andre Ramon Novarro is an orphan who hobnobs with the upper crust but is definitely not one of them. When his best friend is murdered by an evil nobleman Lewis Stone he vows revenge and soon becomes a very outspoken critic of the rich. However because of his outspokenness he is marked for death and so he hides with a traveling theater company. He becomes very successful for the plays he writes as well as his rendition of the classic Scaramouche character. During this time he also practices with the sword in the hopes of one day killing Stone. Eventually his fame on stage increases so much that he is invited to serve in the Parlement. Plus they want him because his swordsmanship is so good they figure he'll be able to protect himselfas the nobles are always dueling with their opponents killing them a great way to deplete the nonelite class in Parlement.All this leads to the expected ultimate showdown with Stone though it ends differently than the Granger film and more like the original novel. In some ways this isn't bad but what is missing is the great sword fight between Novarro and Stoneit ends almost as soon as it begins! In the Granger version the fight is the longest and best sword fight in film history and something you can't miss.Apart from the fight that just fizzled the film does have excellent sets cinematography and musical score something many silents do NOT have when shown today. It's good...but I just can't help but prefer the sumptuous and more entertaining remake. This is one of the few cases when I do prefer a remakeso it just goes to show you how wonderful Stewart Granger's version is. If you only want to see one version of the film see that one.".

	schema:headline " Splendid Silent HistoricalMelodrama";
	schema:reviewBody "Those who are familiar with the wellknown 1952 remake of Scaramouche might find it difficult to recognize it in this 1923 silent version. The story in this earlier and seldomseen version is quite different in many respects. Many of the plot points are different the names of some of the principal characters are not the same and some of the principal characters in this earlier version do not even appear in the remake. The earlier version is also quite different in tone being rather more in the nature of HistoricalMelodrama or HistoricalFiction than the later version which is much more of a mere swashbuckler. However the fact is that this earlier version is actually much more faithful to the original book than the remake.Don't be put off by the fact that this is a silent film produced 90 years ago because it's production values are excellent. Clearly no available expense was spared to make this production as lavish and authentic to the period France during the French Revolution as possible. The director Rex Ingram was about as good as one could find at the time. The cast also features some first rate performers including perennial MGM favorite Lewis Stone who was probably with the studio longer than any other actor so long that he appeared in the 1952 remake. The title role is played by Ramon Navarro who was a major star in the 1920s. Like Rudolph Valentino Navarro was a major leading man in the films of the 1920s and had the title role in the silent version of Ben Hur. However unlike Valentino who died young Navarro continued to work for many years though his career as a leading man waned after talkies came in. Navarro's problem in talkies was that he happened to be Mexican and spoke with an accent.All in all Scaramouche comes off as a lavish and well produced melodrama set against the background of the French Revolution. The plot points and tone are so different that it should be rated alongside rather than above or below the betterknown swashbuckling remake. This film is very well worth a look especially to the many fans of the 1952 version.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before anyone gets angry from the summary title let me say this I really enjoy the 1952 Scaramouche. It's the perfect remedy for stress Eleanor Parker is gorgeous the fencing is great and overall it's one of my favorite adventure flicks from the 1950s. However it doesn't work nearly as well as this silent adaptation does. This Rex Ingram adaptation has more focus on character development and the historical setting of the French Revolution which make it a more mature and engaging experience.Ramon Novarro gives one of his greatest performances as the passionate and witty Andre Moreau. It makes me sad that he didn't get to do many more swashbuckling parts like this. Lewis Stone is also worthy of praise though he could have just hammed it up and called it a day he brings depth to the villainous Marquis. Alice Terry is given little to work with as the love interest Aline but she does portray the character's struggle between ambition and love well.Rex Ingram's films are usually beautiful but this is the most gorgeous I've seen yet. The sets and costumes fit the period. Most classic films time stamp their historical pictures by letting modern day fashions seep through. Fortunately this is not the case here.And of course there's all the swashbuckling and adventure you could ask for. There's no climactic lengthy duel in a playhouse as there is in the talkie remake but the amazing mob scenes are enough to compensate. There's so much energy in them that you cannot help but be swept up. The fencing is excellent too.This is one of the best silent epics there is. If you liked the remake and would like to see a more serious novelaccurate version then get your hands on this right away!".

	schema:reviewBody "A year after The Prisoner of Zenda Rex Ingram shoots another film with more or less the same team. This time it takes place during the French Revolution. So we can se Alice Terry Mrs Ingram Lewis Stone and Ramon Novarro. But when you look closely you can recognize Edward Snitz John George Edward Conelly... Scaramouche is the film where the story and the History collide. The story is the one of Andr Louis Moreau Ramon Novarro an orphan whose friend a fighter for freedom is killed in duel by the Marquis de la Tour d'Azyr Lewis Stone. Moreau is also in love with Aline de Kercadiou Alice Terry the niece of the man who raised him. The History is the one of France. But it is rewritten by Hollywood. So when you are French you do not recognize your History. Before there was Griffith's French Revolution Orphans of the Storm 1921 now there is Ingram's. This time Robespierre is not a communist but we can see a very ugly Danton George Siegman with his pockmarked face. There is also a very peculiar Parisian crowd savage shouting bloodthirsty and greedy for aristocratic heads to fall. There are also the historic characters Louis XVI his wife MarieAntoinette and their children Danton and Marat Roy Coulson and a young officer who watches silently Napoleon Slavko Vorkapich. Fortunately we are interested in the story. Ramon Novarro is young bold and handsome Alice Terry is beautiful and cries easily Lewis Stone is as usual very straightup and also a sort of villain for he kills Moreau's friend. Once more we have a fencing dual but this time it is better than in Zenda. But what strikes the spectator are the glittering eyes. In the first sequence a dead man is brought back home. He was killed by the tyranny. We see his wife crying the tears glittering in her eyes. Later Moreau's eyes will glitter when his friend is killed by de la Tour. IN every great moment of the film we have these glittering eyes.Time and space have a very strange aspect in this film. Indeed when you know France you do not understand everything. It seems that the likelihood has been put aside. The events happen in three locations Gavrillac a village in Brittany Rennes and Paris. Gavrillac is the place where Moreau and Alice grow up . Rennes is where Moreau speaks about Freedom. This is also where he meets Marat another famous actor of the Revolution who does not look like him at all except the cloth he wears on his head. Paris is where everything really happens where everyone meets. This is where the Assembly is meeting where the play FigaroScaramouche written by Moreau is performed where Aline de la Tour and Moreau finally meet. Unfortunately if we recognize very well each location there is a big problem of space in 1789 you cannot ride from Rennes to Paris in one day! Nevertheless the characters of the film can be on Sunday in Gavrillac or Rennes and on Monday in Paris! As for the Time of the film I would prefer not to talk about it. One date is right August the 12th 1792. When the people of Paris invades the Tuileries Palace creating in the same time a real bloodbath.Despite all this this Scaramouche movie has much charm. The fencing duel may be shorter than in George Sidney's movie Scaramouche 1952 it is nevertheless a great moment. The final revelation is quite amazing and the actors were really well chosen. And despite the fact that Moreau and the script is naive we feel quite happy for him at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "You'd have a difficult time recognizing this as the same story that the 1952 version was built around. I read the novel when I was a kid but can't say how closely either version sticks to the book. All I remember of the novel is that Rafael Sabatini didn't know anything about fencing.In 1952 Stewart Granger was Andre Moreau. His best friend a social activist in prerevolutionary France is killed by an aristocrat who is a deadly swordsman Mel Ferrer. The remainder of the movie has Granger on the run from the authorities disguising himself as a comic figure in a traveling troupe having an affair with one of the players falling for a rich and delicate young lady putting Herculean efforts into learning how to fence and finally beating Mel Ferrer in a duel but allowing him to live.I don't mean to carry on at too much length about the 1952 version but it's probably more familiar to viewers than the 1923 silent with Ramon Navarro as the hero Andre. After a few similarities in the first half hour the plots pretty much diverge.This version is at least equally expensive and it's well done for the time but the emphasis is placed far more on politics than comedy or swordsmanship.Here Andre spends hardly any time playing Scaramouche on stage. We see him in costume for about two minutes and he does nothing that convinces us he's a comic genius. In 1952 Granger knows nothing of the sword at first and has three encounters with Ferrer the last one rolling or rather tumbling along in a theater for about fifteen minutes. What a duel! As well done any any other I've seen on the screen about as good as that in The Mark of Zorro but more lavishly staged and more extended. In 1923 Navarro also doesn't know anything about fencing but we see him taking a lesson for about one minute after which he is an unbeatable master of the weapon.The 1923 climax has nothing to do with a duel between the hero and the chief heavy. It has to do with the French revolution into which Navarro has been swept up. The French nobility were bad enough you know. Let them eat cake! All the noblesse and none of the oblige.But caramba the mob that took over was crazed and drunk and given to beheading everybody they could get their hands on. Not only did King Louis XVI get the guillotine but so did Robespierre one of the fomenters of the revolution. Not that you see any executions in the film just the outraged savages doing what outraged savages always do in these movies  smash furniture.Anyway the climax is shifted from a duel mano a mano to the epic story of the revolution and its immediate aftermath.This isn't a bad film but I prefer the remake  one of the rare times when the second version is as good or better than the original. It just happens to be one of those stories that benefit from OverwhelmoColor and sound. In 1952 the tinks of the metal swords meeting were created by the tinkling of crystal glass. The 1923 is good the 1952 is phenomenal.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a well known film to most silent film buffs. Rex Ingram films his scenes like a painter. Ingram uses his camera like a paint brush. Indeed some of the scenes look like paintings come to life. This film is based on the novel by Rafael Sabatini and stars Ramon Novarro one of Ingram's favorite actors. It costars Ingram's wife Alice Terry. This film boasts a cast of many wellknown silent film supporting actors. An historical subject Ingram gives great care to accuracy of costumes  history. The score for the film is adequate but tends to drone a bit. Surprisingly Ingrams camera can still be quite static which reminds one of DW Griffith's Orphans of the Storm1921. Both 'Orphans' and 'Scaramouche' take place at the same tiime so a similarity is logical. The picture was made at Metro Studios just prior to the famous merger with Goldwyn  Mayer. Luckily this film survives today to be enjoyed. Rex Ingram Metro Pictures.".

This one has to rank at the top of John Wayne's films.Wayne and fellow outlaws Pedro Armendariz and Harry Carey Jr. arrive at the town of Welcome Arizona and after a brief chance meeting with the marshal Ward Bond proceed to rob the Welcome bank.In pursuit of the robbers Bond shoots the waterbag draped across Wayne's saddle. And then he cleverly stations men at the few sources of water. Nevertheless the three outlaws decide to chance it across the desert.Life takes a peculiar turn for them as they come across a dying Mildred Natwick who has just delivered an infant. Before she goes she exacts a promise from them to rescue her baby.Even though their own freedom is at stake Wayne Armendariz and Carey subordinate it to the care and rescue of the infant. At this point the Christmas parable takes over. The three wise men setting out with the infant in their charge to the nearest town which happens to be New Jerusalem Arizona.I said on another review of a Wayne film that John Wayne had one of the greatest faces for movie closeups ever. Check some of them here especially during the desert trek. They say more than 10 pages of dialog. Ford Hawks Wellman all the great directors who worked with the Duke knew that and took advantage. Pedro Armendariz and John Ford came to blow up on the set of 3 Godfathers according to Harry Carey Jr.'s memoirs. Armendariz almost walked off the film. He finished it though and was great as the fatalistic Mexican outlaw. But he never worked for Ford again.Although he'd done a few films before this John Ford had in the credits introducing Harry Carey Jr. Of course the film is dedicated to his father who in fact had starred in the original silent Three Godfathers. Maybe this should have really been his debut film Dobe Carey is just fine as the callow youth The Abilene Kid.This also marked the last film of veteran actor Guy Kibbee. As the practical and perceptive judge who tries Wayne Kibbee is given a fitting swan song to a great career as a player.This is certainly a more religious work than John Wayne is used to doing. Wayne although he was baptized Catholic at the end of his life was not a particularly religious man. I do wonder if he had lived another decade what he would have made of the religious right. Ford of course got in his obligatory Shall We Gather At the River but also Bringing in the Sheaves was sung. And in the scene where a dehydrated John Wayne arrives at a saloon in New Jerusalem the piano player is first playing The Holy City and then Silent Night. All to great effect by the way.I think people that are not necessarily fans of the Duke will be amazed at the heights he rose to as a player in 3 Godfathers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three Godfathers' is cinematographically one of John Ford's finest looking Westerns.  The location filming is breathtaking and comes as close as can be found in capturing the beauty of Death Valley.  That the story is relatively straightforward pretty fairly untenable and in Ford fashion highly sentimental is rather inconsequential.  This is a great looking movie shot primarily in one of the most starkly striking places on Earth.  John Wayne Pedro Armendriz and Harry Carey Jr. one of his first roles are bank robbers on the run saddled with an infant they have promised to care for to its dying mother.  They plunge into desperate straights as they flee across the desert.  That no part of Death Valley lies close to Arizona the story is set there is of no account but again as in all Ford movies his vision of the American West ignores the hundreds of thousand square miles that is not Utah Monument Valley or as in this case Death Valley. And that he pioneered an American View Of The West is undeniable.  Winton C. Hoch was responsible for the cinematography he later demonstrated his art in The Searchers' most famous and actually won an Oscar for She Wore A Yellow Ribbon'.  His use of color film was extraordinary and any movie he made is best viewed on the big screen.  There are numerous references to Christian views of morality sprinkled throughout the movie Christmas is revered as the traditional American celebration a Bible figures in Wayne's worst moments as he struggles against the wilderness and the songs we hear are primarily religious hymns. That some good comes of the efforts of the trio is redemptive enough to raise this effort above the average Western.   It is doubtful this movie could be shot again.  It is exceedingly unlikely the disturbance a film crew would make while filming in a national park would be permitted.  Try to imagine the rails required for the cameras being laid today.  Score  Three Stars".

	schema:headline " Three bandits led by John Wayne fleeing across the desert to escape their pursuers";
	schema:reviewBody "Firstrate Western masterfully directed by the great John Ford that results to be a marvelous retelling of Peter B Kyne's saga dealing with three desperate who take a newborn baby in the desert  as the group come across a dying woman and her infant child and they promise the woman that they will take care of the child and get it to safety even though none of them knows anything whatsoever about children or babies . After robbing the local bank  three outlaws named Robert Hightower John Wayne  William Kearney Harry Carey Jr and Pedro Roca Fuerte Pedro Armendariz on the run to evade the local Marshal War Bond and his posse . In the wilderness they then find an abandoned wagon in which there is a dying woman Mildred Natwick who asks for help the men . The bandits take care of her child and they swear to bring the infant to safety across the desert  even at the risk of their own lives. The outlaws set out across the desert to deliver it to safety and then decide to do their best by the newborn and not all will survive and for those who get  prison likely awaits them.This nice Western contains interesting characters  full of wide open space and dramatic moments . This classic  sturdy picture ranks as one of the most sentimental of John Ford's work . It contains Ford's usual themes as familiar feeling  a little bit funny humor friendship and and sense of comradeship among people and ample shots on desert landscapes specially on Mojave . Thoughtprovoking  enjoyable screenplay portraying in depth characters and brooding events with interesting issues running beneath script surface by Laurence Stallings and Frank S. Nugent  Ford's usual . Multiple highlights as the raid bank at the beginning and of course the sensible final farewell on the train station . Outdoors are pretty good and well photographed by Winton Hoch and filmed on location in Alabama Hills Lone Pine Carson  Colorado Railroad Owens Valley Death Valley National Park Mojave DesertZabriskie Point and RKO Encino Ranch Los Angeles California . Dedicated to the filmmaker's first actor  Harry Carey Sr . This excellent film featuring a magnificent performance by whole casting  including a topnotch support cast . Awesome John Wayne in a largerthanlife character along with his two likable partners Harry Carey Jr and Pedro Armendariz . In the film appears  as usual  Ford's favourite actors as Jack Pennick  Jane Darwell  Ben Johnson  Francis Ford  Guy Kibbee  Mae Marsh  Hank Worden and of course Ward Bond as obstinate sheriff who sets off in pursuit . Sensible and emotive musical score including wonderful songs by Richard Hageman . The movie is stunningly produced by Merian C Cooper  Argosy Pictures Production and magnificently filmed by Ford . Remade for TV as The Godchild 1974 directed by John Badham with Jack Palance  Keith Carradine Ed Lauter and Jack Warden . This may not be Ford's best Western  as many would claim  but it's still head ad shoulders above most bigscale movies .You'll find the ending overmelodramatic according to your tastes  though it's lovingly composed by John Ford who really picks up the drama and sensibility towards the ending . Rating  Better than average  worthwhile watching . .".

This is the first version I saw so perhaps that colors my opinion somewhat. But I feel this is the most accessible telling of the story.

There is really nothing not to like about this film and its even got a tie in to Christmas! Directed by John Ford as a remake of his silent film The Marked Men 1919 which had already been made twice before the 1919 version lol. It was also John Ford's first Technicolor film and its somewhat unique in that it actually doesn't use Monument Valley as its location.It stars a lot of Ford's stable of actors John Wayne Harry Carry Jr. Ward Bond Hank Worden Ben Johnson and actor Pedro Armendriz who is just great in the role of one of the title's godfathers Wayne  Carry Jr. being the others.This film is now up there with The Searchers as my favorite Ford film. It doesn't have that knock you over the head civics lesson sermonizing that a lot of Fords films have its got a little bit of schmaltz and melodrama in very small dollops that you can swallow  which is OK.But don't get this expecting showdown gunfights there aren't any and the film still works.Basically the story line Three men ride into the town of New Jersusalem Arizona to rob its bank. In the process Carry Jr. is wounded in the shoulder and looses his horse as they ride out of town into the desert pursued by Sheriff Sweet Bond and posse members that include actors Worden and Johnson.Sweet shoots the gangs water bag that they don't discover until they are way out in the desert so they have to make for water. Sweet knows this and hops a train with the posse to the nearest water tank.The gang foiled in their quest for water must make for another water hole to the north there they become the three godfathers of the title I wont give any more away.This film definitely had to have made an impression on Leone. Two things stood out for me the first is the whole film is composed of some of the best scenery I've in a Western scenery that will recall to you vividly Tuco  Blondie in the desert this was shot in Death Valley Lone Pine and the Mojave Desert all fantastic locations it will remind you also of Yellow Sky too bad that film wasn't shot in color. The film takes place almost all in the desert. Its like GBU in that it becomes more than just a Western you'll see what I mean.The second thing that stood out is the great performance of Pedro Armendriz what a great Mexican Actor who should have been a main character in a lot of Westerns whats up with that not only will he remind you a bit of a nice Tuco but it even looks like he's wearing Tuco's hat the one he gets from the gunsmith or vice versa lol.The town sets are again spot on and there is some great steam locomotive footage all in all a beautiful and enjoyable film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1948 version of this Peter B. Kyne novella is a change from the 1930 and 1936 versions. Comparisons with the 1936 version have been made but like athletic performances in different eras comparisons of movies made in different eras are often like the proverbial 'apples and oranges' comparisons. The opinion of the viewer also changes with the advent of maturity.Although I never saw the original silent version 'Marked Men'1919 I have had the opportunity to view the 1930 version 'Hell's Heroes' with Charles Bickford Raymond Hatton and Fred Kohlerthe 1936 version with Chester Morris Lewis Stone and Walter Brennan and the 1948 version with John Wayne Pedro Armendariz and Harry CareyJr. The 1936 version was viewed when I was a teenager. The story by Peter B. Kyne was also read at that time. It left an indelible mark until the last decade or two when both the 1930 and 1948 versions were seen.Unlike most viewers I am disappointed that the 1948 version settled for a 'happy ending'. I feel that it destroyed the author's intent. John Wayne's demise in this 1948 movie might have affected the box office draw but it remains a disappointment to this movie fan that the author's ending was changed. I thought the point of the drinking of the poisoned water was to focus on the hero's conversion. It is not the first time that the author's intent has been subordinated to please the public but in this case wasn't the point of this story about making the ultimate sacrifice?This should not detract from Wayne's performance which was excellent. The film is still well worth seeing and enjoying.".

The opinion of the viewer also changes with the advent of maturity.Although I never saw the original silent version 'Marked Men'1919 I have had the opportunity to view the 1930 version 'Hell's Heroes' with Charles Bickford Raymond Hatton and Fred Kohlerthe 1936 version with Chester Morris Lewis Stone and Walter Brennan and the 1948 version with John Wayne Pedro Armendariz and Harry CareyJr. The 1936 version was viewed when I was a teenager. The story by Peter B. Kyne was also read at that time. It left an indelible mark until the last decade or two when both the 1930 and 1948 versions were seen.Unlike most viewers I am disappointed that the 1948 version settled for a 'happy ending'. I feel that it destroyed the author's intent. John Wayne's demise in this 1948 movie might have affected the box office draw but it remains a disappointment to this movie fan that the author's ending was changed. I thought the point of the drinking of the poisoned water was to focus on the hero's conversion. It is not the first time that the author's intent has been subordinated to please the public but in this case wasn't the point of this story about making the ultimate sacrifice?This should not detract from Wayne's performance which was excellent. The film is still well worth seeing and enjoying.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had not seen this film for some time and I had forgotten what a lovely film it is. I feel this one should be up there with John Ford's masterpieces for the photography and the wonderful performances by the actors. Especially Pedro Armendiaz and John Wayne. This is another film that goes in the category of why do people think John Wayne can't act because when you see him in something like this you just know he is a wonderful actor. When he screams Steal a man's burro in this county. They string ya. You feel all the agony of that walk. And that long scene Wayne does almost without a break That ain't the worst of it. It takes a real actor to be able to do that without even a cut away and to show how much frustration. And when Bob and Pete walk away from the kid's unburied body it just hurts. The pain almost comes off the screen like the sun.Wonderful moments in this film. Harry Carey singing. The whole caring for the baby scenes. The expression on John Wayne's face when Pete and the kid read from the book that the NURSE should grease the baby and they both look at Wayne. John Wayne sitting uncomfortably on a chair to small for him trying not to cross his legs as he holds the baby. Pete sitting on the edge of the wagon after he delivers the baby just dying inside because he cannot save the mother. The argument between Bob and Pete over not breaking their promise to a dying woman. Lots of nice foreshadowing there when they both talk about growing long white beards in Yuma penitentiary and then later Bob's confident belief he can do twenty years standing on his head. And more foreshadowing when they find the woman and Bob declares it can rain until I get religion meaning forever and of course he gets religion.There are some great tributes to Harry Carey and in not jokes exactly but moments. Ward Bond blows the smoke away from the rifle he fires at the water bag just like Harry Carey did. In the scene where the ghosts of Pete and the Kid walk with Bob Pedro calls Bob a saddle tramp which is the role Harry Carey most played. And the way Wayne asks for a cool cool beer for me is almost a mimic of Harry Carey.Also the names of towns clearly biblical Damascus Jerusalem and Cairo. Also the Marhall mentions Dobe  Harry Carey Jr's nickname and I think Tres Hermanos  three brothers.Its also pretty clear where MarmaDUKE comes from. I would bet that Pearly is an in joke too but don't know that one.It also rather fun to try and see when it really is John Wayne's hands with the baby. The baby is not much bigger than his enormous hand. Check the size of them when he hold's Mildred Natwick's hand in his Pretty sure its him greasing it. Sounds like the sort of thing Ford would make him do. And also him in the barroom at the end where the baby holds his finger.".

	schema:reviewBody "PedroArmendariz turned out to be right. The 3 badmen should have stuck with their cattle rustling and abandoned John Wayne's ambition to rob the bank in Welcome AZ. Robbing the bank in broad daylight wasn't a good idea and 'the kid'Harry Carey Jr. was wounded as they made their getaway. Sheriff SweetWard Bond and aids chased them into the desert on a buckboard. Sweet hit their main water bag leaving them with little water. When an aid complained that he hadn't hit the men he quipped I'm not paid to kill folks. He seemed unconcerned about giving up the chase because he was sure where they would headthe water tank for the train. For the rest of the film we periodically switch back and forth between the 3or less desperados and Sweet with his posse who initially wait at the several known water sources then actively hunt them when they aren't found. Their status as desperados is magnified when Sweet visits Terrapin Tank to discover that the spring has been destroyed by dynamiting and his niece and her husband aren't to be found despite the presence of their covered wagon. He finds the discarded vest of one of the desperados hence assumes that they are responsible for these additional crimes. Thus when Sweet finally catches up with Wayne on Christmas several days later in the New Jerusalem saloon he immediately demands that he engage Sweet in a gun duel. Fortunately Wayne is too weak to respond and Sweet is shown the infant that Wayne has 'nursed' through his trials in the desert. Sweet presumably after hearing Wayne's full story takes an entirely different attitude toward him beginning to treat him like a prodigal son.This was John Ford's first color film he generally preferring BW. Not as stunning as the Monument Valley backdrops in his next color film She Wore a Yellow Ribbon but a welcomed plus. Filming locations include several spots in the Death Valley region the Mohave Desert and the Alabama Hills region of Owens Valley with the snowcapped Sierra Nevada sometimes in the background. Their initial journey clearly was in the spectacular if not very colorful erosional badlands of Zabriskie Point on the east side of Death Valley. Next they were tested by an extended sand storm in Death Valley's sand dunes region. Later they have to cross a large salt flats presumably in Death Valley before Wayne has to climb a high mountain range then descend to New Jerusalem his partners having died in the sweltering salt flats crossingcrazy to cross it by day! It's a challenge to try to correctly decipher all of the intended symbolism. I will guess that their trials in the desert represent the trials of Moses and the Israelites as they wandered the Sinai deserts as punishment for their sins before the chosen onesonly Wayne in this case were allowed to enter the 'land of milk and honey'New Jerusalem in Wayne's case. The 3 desperados of course represent the traditional 3 magiThe bible doesn't say there were 3! and the baby they deliver represents ChristThus it must be male although the actual infant clearly is female!. In being faced with the responsibility of delivering and caring for an infant in the wilderness the 3 outlaws are in a sense reborn themselves as caring fathers. They largely atone for their past sins by saving the babe's life.No clue why the mother was so sure she would soon die except it was in the script!. The big 'star' they saw probably was Venus although the 'star 'that guided the biblical magiwhich only they could see! clearly was a divinely prescribed manifestation of God. The miraculous appearance of a donkey and her young to Wayne when he is about at the end of his strength soon after reading about such in his deceased partner's bible presumably is a device to cement his questionable faith in God.One of Ford's key beliefs manifested in some of his films was that criminals are mostly molded by their unfortunate circumstances and experiences rather than being an inborn trait and thus are often reformable given the right guidance and opportunities. This is clearly the main message of this film. History proves this is only sometimes the case.Another key point clearly expressed in this and certain films by other directorsThe Return of Frank James The Last Wagon The Bend in the River is that judges and juries should be flexible in their sentencing of wrong doers taking into consideration their overall character and the positive things they have done. Thus to me the best part of the film is the last part where Wayne's character is undergoing sentencing and he is arguing with the judgeGuy Kibbee in his last film role and Sheriff Sweet about the disposition of the infant. He even attracts some female admirers who anticipate his return from his minimal prison sentence.Despite all the highly improbable events and abundant sentimental corn I think Harry Carey Sr. to whom this film was dedicated would be pleased.

	schema:reviewBody "Nice to watch this hoary old Christmas chestnut at Yuletide almost exactly 60 years after its original release. And yes while it is guilty of a number of sins by way of corniness improbability and sentimentality it still works for me and proves you don't need tinsel and snow to evoke the Christmas spirit. Here old Papa Ford relates his Christmas parable against the background of the searing heat of the Arizona desert as Duke Wayne struggles against the odds to deliver orphan child Robert William Pedro to safety bang on wouldn't you know it Christmas Day. All the usual Ford staples are here the panoramic scenery male camaraderie bawdy humour and of course big John Wayne himself in yet another barnstorming lead role. I'm not the biggest Wayne fan going but Ford invariably got the best out of the big lunk and he certainly carries the film and the baby! manfully. His two confederates the youthful Harry Carey Jr and TexMex Pedro Armendariz both of whom sadly expire along the way offer effective and humorous counterpoint to big John's proselytising. Ford cleverly doesn't reveal his hand too quickly with only the odd Biblical reference alluded to early on but by the time the three amigos are spotlit gazing out at the camera having just accepted the dying mother's infant child into their care it piles on from there. Along the way the humour and sentimentality are mixed up lightly with a little not too much dramatic tension as Wayne completes his epic journey like he was ever going to fail! spurred on by the ghosts of his fallen colleagues and completes his own spiritual regeneration in accepting with good grace his jail sentence at the end in exchange for a guarantee that he'll be reunited with his infant charge once his sentence is complete. Noting that the film is Ford's own remake of his earlier silent movie production of the same story would help explain why some of the scenes are somewhat static and staged tableaustyle. Wayne gets to walk more than he talks no bad thing and the rest of the cast are all at home under the director's loving eye. All told then a colourful check the blue filter shot Ford employs to evoke the desert at night and festive treat. But surely this child wasn't the Son of God...?!".

	schema:headline " Ford 'Christmas' Western Showcases Wayne 'Stock Company'...";
	schema:reviewBody "Three Godfathers John Ford's second version of Peter B. Kyne's oftfilmed story of three outlaws finding redemption has been hailed by some critics as an unsung Ford masterpiece while I wouldn't go quite THAT far it is an exceptional western with Ford's 'Stock Company' headed by John Wayne offering warmly sentimental performances.The film was created as a 'tribute' to legendary actor Harry Carey who had passed away in 1947 and had been young Ford's mentor starring in his first version of the tale Marked Men in 1919. This production would introduce Carey's son Harry Jr. as likable young horse rustler William Kearney They call me 'The Abilene Kid'. Wayne took on the elder Carey's role 'Bob Hightower' in this version the more pragmatic but caring leader of the trio and Mexican starFord regular Pedro Armendriz completed the band as sweetnatured if wildtalking Pedro Roca Fuerte. The three are unrepentant outlaws arriving in Welcome Arizona to rob the bank but it is quickly established that they are not 'bad' men...in fact there are NO real villains in this film. Their antagonist Sheriff Perley 'Buck' Sweet Ward Bond is introduced while gardening outside his home and he and Hightower have a quite jovial conversation...until the trio discover what his occupation is! The bank robbery goes off without a hitch but young Kearney is wounded during the getaway and Sweet and his posse including Ford regulars Hank Worden and Ben Johnson are soon in pursuit.To this point in the film it could be said that this was a fairly standard tale but the trio's convoluted escape through the Arizona desert leads them to a brokendown wagon at a destroyed waterhole and a woman Ford favorite Mildred Natwick stranded dying and about to give birth. Pedro delivers the child whom she names Robert William Pedro Hightower entrusting the men as the child's Godfathers to take him to safety. She dies and the three face a responsibility that will change their lives forever...Released by MGM although filmed by Ford and Merian Cooper's Argosy Pictures which explains why the film lacks the usual MGM 'gloss' the production was ripe with entertaining 'back stories' the most famous involving barrel cacti and Ford's legendary stubbornness. When Ford told his production team that the outlaws would survive by siphoning water from a barrel cactus it was quickly pointed that the plants he selected were the wrong species and wouldn't work. Ford loudly and colorfully disagreed...and secretly the night before shooting liberally soaked all the cacti with so much water that when the cameras began rolling the next morning water flowed freely from the chunks cut out of them! There is a prophetic moment in the story Pedro his leg badly broken is left with Hightower's pistol which he uses to kill himself rather than face a long painful demise. Less than fifteen years later Armendriz dying of cancer would kill himself with a gun rather than face the disease's ravages.Three Godfathers is a western story of redemption set at Christmas making it an essential for the holidays. While it can't be called 'topdrawer' John Ford even an 'average' film by the legendary director is better than 99 of Hollywood's product...and not to be missed!".

He's done a lot of westerns and this is one of the few I've seen. He is an effective actor with emotion and character you'd expect from one of the film veterans. And though I'm not a huge western fan this movie was satisfactory. It doesn't all have to be about shootouts or pistols at dawn. Sometimes a decent western just has to be set in the old West and that's all you need.I recommend this to the Wayne fans out there as well as those looking for a sweet wholesome oldfashioned flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "No masterpiece but a fine piece of work. Three bank robbers in the old West played by John Wayne Pedro Armendriz and Harry Carey Jr. run from the sheriff of Welcome Arizona Ward Bond. The first forty minutes or so consist of this simple but entertaining tale of bandits trying to survive the desert and an intelligent sheriff who tries to get one step ahead of him. Then the film takes an interesting turn. The three bandits find a dying pregnant woman help deliver her child and then are forced to keep him and themselves alive. Like many Ford films there is a ton of religious allegory. Some might consider it heavyhanded but to me it seemed well done. Instead of just setting up parallels with the Biblical tales of the infancy of Christ for those in the know the three bandits themselves discover the parallels and are convinced that they have to get the baby to a town called Jerusalem. The story is often very harrowing. I don't think that the characters are very believable bandits. They're too nice. The other thing I really don't like is the end which seems inconsistent with the mood of the rest of the film. It's a bit anticlimactic. John Ford's direction is good but compared with his previous two films My Darling Clementine and The Fugitive it doesn't register as one of his best. The performers are generally good. Harry Carey Jr. in his screen debut is the best the picture is also dedicated to his father who had recently died. Ward Bond is also quite good. 810.".

However I had a problem with the realism of the story something this kind of plot needs to rely heavily on. Here we have three rough and tough men by no means weak or unable to take care of themselves. Still what they go through in this film along with trying to take care of a newly born infant it boggles my mind as to how it is possible and perhaps it isn't.I think I am reading too much into this and am missing the point John Ford was trying to make. So I will try to understand the movie in its simplest terms. That would be that Ford was a master of imagery and using it to further the story. Here every shot of the desert and swirling winds captures perfectly the atmosphere and mood making the audience feel as if they are in the desert. It is most effective and does pick up some of the slack such as when the three men are first taking care of the infant or the final ten minutes in deciding Wayne's fate. All in all this is not one of the great Ford Westerns. But it shows once again his ability to control the mood and tone of his films and that can go a long way in providing leverage to an audience.".

He turns out to be the law of this town of Welcome Arizona.  His name is B. Sweet but his wife calls him Pearly.The three men are John Wayne Pedro Armendariz and Harry Carey Jr.  The lawman is Ward Bond.  His wife is the charming Anna Lee.This is a characterdriven film.  It is also an allegory and a lovely metaphor.  One of the most poetic and sentimental films John Ford ever directed.  Still Three Godfathers has a great deal to recommend it.The story is both cruel and tender just as Arizona was just before the turn of the century.  The people of that time quoted their Bible chapter and verse and this script is realistic in the way the various characters speak and perform.The greatest character in this film is the desert itself a place that both gives and takes life.  The cinematographer captured the desert and surrounding landscape with the eye of an artist.  Even the great Jack Cardiff could not have created a more gorgeous film.  Three Godfathers reminds me of Black Narcissus in the way it is filmed.John Wayne is wonderful as one of the godfathers.  His struggle to save the baby is sweet and terrifying.  His agony toward the end is real and so is his determination to find New Jerusalem.The scene where Wayne diapers this newborn is delightful.  He literally beams as he smears the child's backside with grease according to the instructions found in a baby book packed with clothes in anticipation of this new baby! As Pedro says This mother she had a heart! Wayne loved children and I wonder if this baby was actually one of his own.  He has such genuine fun playing with him.Ward Bond is gruff stern and charming in one of his best roles.Three Godfathers was dedicated to Harry Carey and introduces his son Harry Carey Jr. Harry Carey Jr. had a pleasant singing voice and a kind of innocence that works in this film.  Pedro Armendariz is the one elected to help the Gringa give birth to her first child because he is the only one of the three with any experience.  He does a fine job as the sympathetic outsider who offers aide and comfort to Mildred Natwick.There is a gritty authentic feel to this film. The people LOOK like old photographs.  There is dust on everything.  Most of all it is hot and arid. Water is more necessary to life than food and without it you will die. Little Robert William Pedro Hightower DID have six precious cans of condensed milk to get him through and he had John Wayne as one of his three Godfathers.  What more could he ask?Three Godfathers is not a great film.  It is not profound really.  It is a good honest look at a time gone by and the people who shaped the future of this country.  It is corny and sentimental.  It is also one of my favorite films.  I reach for it every Christmas Season.  I recommend this one highly.".

The text of the DVD sleeve I own the Anchor Bay version awakens wrong expectations for this movie and contains false information about the story. Instead I found its photography a very beautiful artwork. It is made with a high sense for colors great images perfectionism in detail and a beauty in its pictures that is found rarely in newer movies in the western world. Maybe this is one reason why it may bore some people with a more speedy expectation for films then it is shown in this slowly developing story. The exotic environment of the story is a brothel in Hongkong 1920 where O a French girl surrenders totally to Mr. Steven Klaus Kinski desperately hoping to reach his heart.If this was an American movie it would have surely a happy end  but it is an eastern and sad story of an unfulfilled love. I find it worth to watch it more than once to enjoy its artwork and to understand its deep symbolism. It is not an easy film especially for those used to watch Hollywoodproductions only. Be prepared to watch it consciously and with full attention otherwise you might not like it. I highly recommend it for people with a sense for somehow oldfashioned esthetics art eastern culture beautiful images and of course it is a mustsee for all the fans of the greatest German actor Klaus Kinski.".

But I got the monkey's paw version of my wish here with this sequel to The Story of O based on a novel by the same pseudononymous author Pauline Reage. In this film O Isabella Illiers replacing Corinne Clery has been taken to Asia and put in a brothel by her much older lovermaster Sir Stephen Klaus Kinski. He comes back from time to time to have sex with her or to spy on her with clients or to tie her up and force her to watch as he has wild sex with his other young mistress Arielle Dombasle. A local teenager spies her through the barred windows of the brothel and when Stephen sees her making love to the boy perhaps the most questionable scene as the actor really does look to only be about 14but I'm sure he got over it he realizes that he is beginning to lose control over her.This film has less S and M and bondage than the original Story of O but the sex scenes are much more graphic. There is one obviously unsimulated oral sex scene and another missionary scene with Kinski and Illiers that looks pretty unsimulated as well. If you consider this a hardcore porn film it is a veritable masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the musical score is good. There are a lot of poetic imagesfor instance a long shot of a dead bird floating in the bay outside the convent and later a surreal Jean Rollinesque image of a drowned woman floating on a grand piano ?! in this same bay. Most hardcore porn films wouldn't bother with such arty digressions. As an art film though which this is also obviously trying to be it is less successful mostly because all the characters are pretty thinly drawn.Illiers who was never really to be seen again in films is OK. She's not a great actress she's not even a mole on Corrine Clery's beauteous backside but she can at least look convincingly forlorn something I can't imagine any American porn actress doing. Arielle Dombasle is perhaps most recognizable from Eric Rohmer's Pauline at the Beach where she played the title character's incredibly sexy but slowwitted and slutty older cousin. In Pauline her young character falls madly in love with a balding middleaged cad for some reason. Here she has apparently moved on to the elderly. It is actually pretty damn hard to buy either of these tres gorgeous jeun French filles pardon my Franglish being in love with Klaus Kinski who looks pretty much like grim death here. Kinski is pretty good I guess but he seems rather bored and contemptuous of his rolebut then he was ALWAYS like that except perhaps in his films with Herzog where he sometimes literally had a gun to his head. I'd still rather see his daughter have graphic sex with Illiers and Dombasle of course but heand this whole filmaren't too bad overall I guess.".

	schema:headline " Haunting Tale of Empty Lives Possible Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film by chance when I was visiting my uncle in Arizona about 3 and 12 years ago. The VHS print was a little faded looking but I was very haunted by what I had watched. Did it all make sense? Well honestly no it didn't. However this is a film that requires more than one viewing to understand all of its aspects. The beautifully tragic score haunted me and the bizarre images made quiet an impression.Well when I found out that Anchor Bay had released this oddity on DVD I picked it up immediately. I was very pleased by the transfer though I felt the extras rather lacking. Though the film concerns the O and Sir Stephen characters it really has nothing to do with Pauline Reage's original novel or the 1974 film The Story of O. However the film does pay attention to artistic detail and symbolism of an almost mystic kind. O decides to prostitute herself for Sir Stephen in violent 1920s Hong Kong. Her mission is to prove her unending devotion and love for her master through giving her body to other men. Naturally Sir Stephen enjoys watching her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds himself a mistress. However the tables are turned when O actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer. Suddenly Sir Stephen feels the threat...I feel that the deep meaning behind the film including the tragic score and artistic direction really make this film a classic. The viewer is introduced not only to the lives and pasts of O's fellow brothel mates but the turmoil of 1920s Hong Kong is also explored. Like the political setting the prostitutes all find themselves in need of belonging. No one is happy in the film even if they believe that they are. However O does find a sense of happiness with her young admirer. One prostitute tearfully remembers how her father used to act like a dog when she was drunk naturally leading to a fetish for having her customers act like a dog. Another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. She cannot let that vision go. She treats her clients as costars and even swears she hears a piano in the river. As for O she has a flashback about her father leaving her in a chalk circle. When he leaves she feels a sense of abandonment. Of course in that same flashback Kinski suddenly becomes her father. I was very very disturbed by this image. I truly felt for O at this point in the film. She hardly ever smiles and this scene really explains why. Her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees Sir Stephen as her father and caters to his every obscene demand in hopes of proving her love. Another curious aspect of the film is the young child that ages at the end that sells fortune in a box. It is a very random character but somehow it just adds to the sense of loss and emptiness in the film. At one point the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people. Now if that isn't symbolism for you! Laugh All in all I really love this film. I feel that it is a very deep and somewhat moving experience. It has erotic scenes but the scenes aren't really meant to arouse. Like the lives of the characters the sex acts are empty. They are motions but lack feeling and tenderness. Once again the only tender scene is between O and the young man. O believes she is in love and that lowering herself is an honor however she finds in the end that she has choices. She too can be her own person and pursue her own happiness however she also has the option to stay in that circle that her father drew. The director leaves a lot of unanswered questions however some things don't need answers. The viewer will make the judgment that works for them. I must say that I wish a special edition of this DVD would be released that had director commentary. I think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion of the film and its message years later. It is a shame that the soundtrack was never released. This film has a truly haunting and heart breaking score. There is something about the lingering vocals that send a chill up my spine. I can truly feel the sense of loneliness in the film by just listening to the music.".

	schema:headline " A Confused Tale";
	schema:reviewBody "I never had a chance to watch Kinski much but I think what he had given to us with 'Aguirre  The Wrath of God' 'Woyzeck' 'Fitzcarraldo' 'Nosferatu' and 'Cobra Verde' is something that makes him matchless. His cadaver looks may haunt any mainstream viewer for weeks together. Now I praise Kinski for his artistic abilities and menacing performance but I never intended to see him in this trash called 'Les Fruits de la Passion'. I think that the frequent runins with director Werner Herzog spoiled Kinski's career. Herzog knew to redeem Kinski's talent while the other directors didn't. Shuji Terayama tries to copy Pauline Reage's erotic fantasy novel called 'The Story of O' but has needlessly added his own style and symbolism for the sake of making this soft core porn film a piece of art. Direction wise this is an okay flick but mistreats the audience with lame sequences that either don't mean much or are entirely awry.The film begins with a wealthy western Sir Stephen Klaus Kinski who comes to Shanghai with his mistress or lover? 'O' Isabelle Illiers. Sir Stephen is an aging businessman who has an insatiable hunger for sex. Since he himself is engaged physically with numerous women he wants 'O' to serve herself at a local Chinese brothel to strange customers. The brothel owner 'Madam' Pt is a transvestite or at least this appears the way she dresses herself and speaks with the prostitutes. Sir Stephen wants to test 'O''s love for him by watching her make love with several intolerable men. Someone is a butcher who reeks blood while the other wants to make love cuckooing like a bird! Sir Stephen hopes that 'O' will completely surrender herself to make her partner Sir Stephen happy. But you see there is a condition here. Sir Stephen thinks that 'O' will only physically belong to some man at a point of time but will mentally remain involved with him every time. After testing 'O' with several men Sir Stephen decides to retest 'O' and makes love right before her eyes with his another french girlfriend Nathalie Arielle Dombasle while 'O' is leashed in chains! While Sir Stephen is engaged in sick games the peasants and labors are uniting for a revolution. Unfortunately Sir Stephen goes in the bad books of the revolutionaries when he decides not to aid the revolution. While Sir Stephen feels himself torn between Nathalie and 'O' the kindhearted 'O' finds solace in the arms of a young Chinese revolutionary who secretly loves her. The film ends with Nathalie leaving Sir Stephen and heading to Europe and 'O' fainting when a fortuneteller tells that Sir Stephen killed the very revolutionary who made her feel true love and was trying to kill himself when he was fortunately saved. The fortuneteller hands 'O' a note that says 'She is free to go wherever she wants.' While the film teems with heavy symbolism and vivid imagery some of the sequences are hard to perceive. For instance there is a story associated with almost every prostitute of the brothel. Also Shuji Terayama must have been nuts to show the lovers as fathers as in one of the scenes we see baby O's father magically transforming to Sir Stephen who encircles and thus limits her and walks out. In another scene a prostitute dominates his client with lashes. Soon we see him transforming into prostitute's own father. Then there is a drowned piano and floating dead bird which are uselessly and forcibly included. This was rather an unnecessary film that came in 1981. Shuji Terayama could have excelled had he invested into horror which was at its zenith during the early 80s. Kinski surely degrades himself posing his tuberculous body but is effective as an actor. Illiers has one of the most innocent faces I've ever come across while Dombasle looks like a failedactressclungtoamillionaire. Personally I don't think Kinski's chemistry works out as good with the other directors as it works with Werner Herzog. So this berated film of a berated actor fetches 4 on 10. Once again Kinski proved that he didn't mind selling himself 'For A Few Dollars More'.".

	onyx:emotionText "I never had a chance to watch Kinski much but I think what he had given to us with 'Aguirre  The Wrath of God' 'Woyzeck' 'Fitzcarraldo' 'Nosferatu' and 'Cobra Verde' is something that makes him matchless. His cadaver looks may haunt any mainstream viewer for weeks together. Now I praise Kinski for his artistic abilities and menacing performance but I never intended to see him in this trash called 'Les Fruits de la Passion'. I think that the frequent runins with director Werner Herzog spoiled Kinski's career. Herzog knew to redeem Kinski's talent while the other directors didn't. Shuji Terayama tries to copy Pauline Reage's erotic fantasy novel called 'The Story of O' but has needlessly added his own style and symbolism for the sake of making this soft core porn film a piece of art. Direction wise this is an okay flick but mistreats the audience with lame sequences that either don't mean much or are entirely awry.The film begins with a wealthy western Sir Stephen Klaus Kinski who comes to Shanghai with his mistress or lover? 'O' Isabelle Illiers. Sir Stephen is an aging businessman who has an insatiable hunger for sex. Since he himself is engaged physically with numerous women he wants 'O' to serve herself at a local Chinese brothel to strange customers. The brothel owner 'Madam' Pt is a transvestite or at least this appears the way she dresses herself and speaks with the prostitutes. Sir Stephen wants to test 'O''s love for him by watching her make love with several intolerable men. Someone is a butcher who reeks blood while the other wants to make love cuckooing like a bird! Sir Stephen hopes that 'O' will completely surrender herself to make her partner Sir Stephen happy. But you see there is a condition here. Sir Stephen thinks that 'O' will only physically belong to some man at a point of time but will mentally remain involved with him every time. After testing 'O' with several men Sir Stephen decides to retest 'O' and makes love right before her eyes with his another french girlfriend Nathalie Arielle Dombasle while 'O' is leashed in chains! While Sir Stephen is engaged in sick games the peasants and labors are uniting for a revolution. Unfortunately Sir Stephen goes in the bad books of the revolutionaries when he decides not to aid the revolution. While Sir Stephen feels himself torn between Nathalie and 'O' the kindhearted 'O' finds solace in the arms of a young Chinese revolutionary who secretly loves her. The film ends with Nathalie leaving Sir Stephen and heading to Europe and 'O' fainting when a fortuneteller tells that Sir Stephen killed the very revolutionary who made her feel true love and was trying to kill himself when he was fortunately saved. The fortuneteller hands 'O' a note that says 'She is free to go wherever she wants.' While the film teems with heavy symbolism and vivid imagery some of the sequences are hard to perceive. For instance there is a story associated with almost every prostitute of the brothel. Also Shuji Terayama must have been nuts to show the lovers as fathers as in one of the scenes we see baby O's father magically transforming to Sir Stephen who encircles and thus limits her and walks out. In another scene a prostitute dominates his client with lashes. Soon we see him transforming into prostitute's own father. Then there is a drowned piano and floating dead bird which are uselessly and forcibly included. This was rather an unnecessary film that came in 1981. Shuji Terayama could have excelled had he invested into horror which was at its zenith during the early 80s. Kinski surely degrades himself posing his tuberculous body but is effective as an actor. Illiers has one of the most innocent faces I've ever come across while Dombasle looks like a failedactressclungtoamillionaire. Personally I don't think Kinski's chemistry works out as good with the other directors as it works with Werner Herzog. So this berated film of a berated actor fetches 4 on 10. Once again Kinski proved that he didn't mind selling himself 'For A Few Dollars More'.";

	schema:headline " Now THIS is romance";
	schema:reviewBody "Now THIS is romance Back in the midlate 1930's when Katherine Hepburn though she had already won an Oscar was labeled along with several other actresses box office poison it was Hollywood that suffered. Unfortunately after the Production Code blasted out full throttle strong roles for women disappeared because women no longer had a strong voice in cinema so a lot of the heavierhitters Hepburn Joan Crawford Miriam Hopkins ended up foundering in what they were given. In the case of George Cukor's 1938 film Holiday she had a couple of friends involved with the picture who insisted that she be used she had been the understudy of her film counterpart on the stage which turned out to be an excellent plan since she is one of the many great things about this film.Set in New York Holiday stars Carey Grant as Johnny Case a fledgling businessman who is more concerned about making a career out of something he wants to do and not what he should do in order to make a lot of money. He has a plan he has been working hard at a job that he doesn't particularly like to save enough money to take an indeterminate time off to figure out what he wants to do with himself. While he takes a holiday he meets Julia Seton Nolan the two fall in love and go back to New York to tell Julia's father. What Johnny doesn't know is that Julia comes from an extremely wealthy family and while he is shocked and bemused by this fact he finds himself taken with the other members of Julia's family Linda Seton Hepburn Julia's freethinking and dramatic sister and brother Ned Seton Ayres a kind but dour alcoholic. Both siblings are discontented with being under their father's thumb while he is not a bad person Edward Seton has strong feelings about how things should be handled and both take an instant liking to Johnny particularly Linda who finds herself falling in love with him. As plans for the marriage begin to solidify it becomes clear that Johnny is being forced to quash his dreams not only to gain the approval of their father but because Julia thinks it is the way to go as well.Having never even heard of this film I wasn't sure what to expect out of Holiday I figured it might either be a screwball comedy based on the HepburnGrant collaboration in Bringing up Baby or maybe a regular romantic comedy. What I got was actually a romantic dramedy that was not only charming but heartfelt as well. George Cukor's direction as usual is wonderful and the chemistry between Hepburn and Grant is simply electric. Hepburn clearly the star of this production acts each scene with an emotion and charm that is almost unheard of in the mainstream cinema of the present. While I watched the film I found myself becoming so endeared to her character that I probably would have been completely devastated if she didn't get some sort of happiness in the end probably one of the highest compliments that I can give to an actor's performance since I mainly pay attention to the story and the film itself primarily and the characters are important but seem to be secondary. Grant who is probably most famous for being debonair and dashing often played the goofball in his films of the 30's and early 40's and this was another one of those roles for him. He is such a fresh and passionate character however he often finds himself doing various acrobatic stunts with glee that he quickly proves himself to be more than just the handsome doofus who makes bug eyes at the camera when he's confused. He and Hepburn actually look like they're having a good time together in this film a wonderful thing to see when it seems that 90 of collaborations look like they are phoned in nowadays. If Doris Nolan isn't unremarkable and bland all the time she did a really great job in her role as fiance Julia  at some point you're really wondering what Johnny ever really saw in her and made him declare his bachelorhood over with at the age of 30. Lew Ayres a name I had heard before but didn't recognize by face was also very charming as the alcoholic brother. I found his character to be incredibly endearing especially as the film progressed. A mention also has to be made of the actors who played Johnny's best friends the Potters. Edward Everett Horton  Jean Dixon Anyone would be hard pressed to dislike these two intellectuals with senses of humor that are more arid than the Mojave. Every scene they were in became even more enjoyable.What stuck with me is that between the script and the actors I felt like I was actually watching a real slice of life kind of like Booth Tarkington without the depression. Holiday is a fantastic hidden gem in the classic film catalogue and I would recommend it very highly. Not only is it short in length but also its engaging story steady pacing and brilliant actors made me wish it were longer. Watch this wonderful movie if you have any ounce of appreciation for classic film. 810 Shelly".

	onyx:emotionText "Now THIS is romance Back in the midlate 1930's when Katherine Hepburn though she had already won an Oscar was labeled along with several other actresses box office poison it was Hollywood that suffered. Unfortunately after the Production Code blasted out full throttle strong roles for women disappeared because women no longer had a strong voice in cinema so a lot of the heavierhitters Hepburn Joan Crawford Miriam Hopkins ended up foundering in what they were given. In the case of George Cukor's 1938 film Holiday she had a couple of friends involved with the picture who insisted that she be used she had been the understudy of her film counterpart on the stage which turned out to be an excellent plan since she is one of the many great things about this film.Set in New York Holiday stars Carey Grant as Johnny Case a fledgling businessman who is more concerned about making a career out of something he wants to do and not what he should do in order to make a lot of money. He has a plan he has been working hard at a job that he doesn't particularly like to save enough money to take an indeterminate time off to figure out what he wants to do with himself. While he takes a holiday he meets Julia Seton Nolan the two fall in love and go back to New York to tell Julia's father. What Johnny doesn't know is that Julia comes from an extremely wealthy family and while he is shocked and bemused by this fact he finds himself taken with the other members of Julia's family Linda Seton Hepburn Julia's freethinking and dramatic sister and brother Ned Seton Ayres a kind but dour alcoholic. Both siblings are discontented with being under their father's thumb while he is not a bad person Edward Seton has strong feelings about how things should be handled and both take an instant liking to Johnny particularly Linda who finds herself falling in love with him. As plans for the marriage begin to solidify it becomes clear that Johnny is being forced to quash his dreams not only to gain the approval of their father but because Julia thinks it is the way to go as well.Having never even heard of this film I wasn't sure what to expect out of Holiday I figured it might either be a screwball comedy based on the HepburnGrant collaboration in Bringing up Baby or maybe a regular romantic comedy. What I got was actually a romantic dramedy that was not only charming but heartfelt as well. George Cukor's direction as usual is wonderful and the chemistry between Hepburn and Grant is simply electric. Hepburn clearly the star of this production acts each scene with an emotion and charm that is almost unheard of in the mainstream cinema of the present. While I watched the film I found myself becoming so endeared to her character that I probably would have been completely devastated if she didn't get some sort of happiness in the end probably one of the highest compliments that I can give to an actor's performance since I mainly pay attention to the story and the film itself primarily and the characters are important but seem to be secondary.

Hers is a pure sweet and intelligent love one which we see develop and with which by the end of the movie we wholeheartedly agree. Cary Grant is just delightful in his acrobatics and his naivete and Hepburn has all of her idealism and wisdom and proves once again that the two aren't mutually exclusive.

	schema:reviewBody "Today the world around us may be changing by leaps and bounds but as this film so aptly illustrates this is nothing new the world has always been and always will be in a constant state of flux from one generation to the next.  In Holiday' a delightful romantic comedy directed by George Cukor a young man of thirty has some decisions to make about his life and love that are going to determine the course of his life.  After a whirlwind ten day romance with Julia Seton Doris Nolan a girl he's just met Johnny Case Cary Grant asks her to marry him and she accepts.  But the story really begins when he shows up at her house to meet her widowed father Edward Henry Kolker to ask for Julia's hand in marriage.This is not an early version of Meet the Parents' however Johnny's a regular guy with a good job at an investment firm and he's in love.  All is going well he's about to meet the family of the woman he loves and he's made a decision about his life.  And when he arrives at Julia's house he makes some startling discoveries  First she's filthy rich her house is so big he calls it a museum and she has a beautiful spirited sister named Linda Katharine Hepburn.  But soon he'll be married to Julia and if all goes right with a deal he's been working on for the firm he'll also be able to follow through on his decision.  If the deal at work goes through it'll put some change in his pockets which is all he wants but not because it'll put him on the fast track to getting ahead with the company.  He wants to make enough to get married and quit his job so he can take a holiday' while he's still young enough to enjoy it even if it only turns out to be three months or so and have some time to discover just where he fits into a world that's rapidly changing.  Now all he has to do is explain it all to Julia.  And to her father.  And all while trying to deny the fact that he's attracted to Linda.Cukor takes a lighthearted approach to this story which keeps it upbeat and entertaining and he laces it with warmth and humor that'll give you some laughs and put a smile on your face.  But beyond all that Cukor shows some real insight into human nature and the ways of the world.  And it makes this film timeless.  Consider Johnny's comments about how the world is changing and wanting to find out for himself where he fits in or the comment by one of Julia's cousins Seton Cram Henry Daniell who is already wealthy apparently beyond all comprehension that there would be a lot of money to be made if only The right government was in place.'  To make this film today you'd only have to change the dates on the calendar shoot in color substitute Norton for Grant Danes for Hepburn and bring in Nora Ephron to direct.  But what really makes this one special are the performances of Grant and Hepburn.  Grant is as charming as ever but just a bit looser and slightly less debonair than he is in most of his later roles.  And it becomes him he endows Johnny with youthful exuberance good looks and personality as well as a carefree yet responsible attitude that makes him someone you can't help but like.  And Hepburn fairly sparkles as Linda a role she was born to play this young woman filled with a zest for life and an indomitable spirit.  She imbues Linda with that same trademark Hepburn feistiness you'll find in so many of her characters in films like The Philadelphia Story' Adam's Rib' and The African Queen.'  All of whom she plays with a variation that makes each of them unique.  And it's that personal spark of life that she's able to transfer to her characters that makes Hepburn so special.  Whether she's locking horns with Tracy pouring Bogart's gin into the river or falling in live with Grant nobody does it quite like Kate. And Cukor had an affinity for Hepburn that enabled him to bring out the best in her always.  Arguably her best work was with Cukor.The memorable supporting cast includes Lew Ayres Ned Edward Everett Horton Nick Binnie Barnes Laura Jean Dixon Susan and Mitchell Harris Jennings.  A thoroughly enjoyable film Holiday' makes a subtle statement about embracing the time you have and grabbing for the brass ring while you're still able that in the end life is what you make of it.  But Cukor never lets it get too serious and never lets you forget that the main thing here is to have some fun beginning with this movie.  And by the time it's over the world seems just a little bit brighter somehow.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 810.".

It is her very humanity that makes her the black sheep. She spends half of the movie in love with Johnny but her respect for her sister and decency thwart her desires.

Her upper class upbringing in Connecticut made her the perfect actress for his plays about the fabulously wealthy which Depression Era USA just ate up.Holiday of necessity had to be updated. It debuted on Broadway in the boom year of 1928 so some lines to acknowledge the Great Depression had to be included. When Henry Daniell says his obscene market profits would be better with the right kind of government he's taking dead aim at the New Deal in particularly the newly formed Security Exchange Commission.One guy who wants out of the money making rat race is Cary Grant as Johnny Case. He's a poor kid who's worked his way up probably the same as the founder of the Seton fortune did back in the day. But he's decided there's more to life than just making money. Like Grandpa Vanderhof in You Can't Take It With You or Charles Foster Kane who admittedly inherited his. Henry Kolker as Edward Seton and George Coulouris as Thatcher think exactly alike.Case has a vision of his life and wants to share it with his fianc Doris Nolan. But he's picked the wrong sister it's younger sister Katharine Hepburn of the Seton girls who's his soul mate. As one who's now retired and admittedly not living in the style of the Setons I can empathize with Cary Grant. As long as you have enough to live on and you have interests to occupy yourself and you don't have a family to support why work? In fact make room for the next generation who might have a family to support.In that sense Holiday has a message that applies more for today than it did in 1938. Make what you can take care of those who depend on you but get out and enjoy life. And enjoy Holiday.".

	schema:headline " An Important Lesson";
	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this incredible film for the third time. Unlike what most people comment about this movie it is more than just delightful and whimsical or worst yet calling it a screwball comedy. If you call Holiday a screwball comedy you may as well call It's A Wonderful Life the same thing. There are distinct parallels between these two groundbreaking works. Both deal with strong dreams being crushed. But in the case of Lew Ayres' character it is his place in society that stops him from becoming a serious composer. And though he comes from a wealthy family he does not have the freedom that many believe falsely to chose what he truly wishes to do. In a tightlywound capitalistic society as ours the obligations to continue the legacy of moneymaking overwhelms the individual's desire to create what many believe is frivolous artistry. What many of us as well as his father fail to realize is when this desire is crushed apathy sets in. This brings up the singularly amazing theme of this movie a theme Philip Barry uses in many of his works that a society that chases wealth without conscience that suppresses truly individualistic idealism is a society of superficial meanspirited and backbiting people. The party scene in Holiday is a cleareyed view of our society and how lost we are. Everyone talks down about others under their breath than hypocritically smiles and fawns over these same people to insure their own place in society. Those who refuse to go along with this status quo are relegated as HepburnAyresand the Professor and his wife are to the childrens' playroom until they growup and accept things as they are. This films warms an audience with it's superficial whimsy as ...Wonderful Life did yet can drive a cold stare with its slashing and often hurtful glances at how we are all relegated to the playroom of society if we express criticism of the narrowmindenness and suffocating aspects of capitalism.Holiday should be an important lesson to many of us on not just how important Life is but shows us how much more important it is to grasp on to what truly makes it worth living.".

Unlike what most people comment about this movie it is more than just delightful and whimsical or worst yet calling it a screwball comedy. If you call Holiday a screwball comedy you may as well call It's A Wonderful Life the same thing. There are distinct parallels between these two groundbreaking works. Both deal with strong dreams being crushed. But in the case of Lew Ayres' character it is his place in society that stops him from becoming a serious composer. And though he comes from a wealthy family he does not have the freedom that many believe falsely to chose what he truly wishes to do. In a tightlywound capitalistic society as ours the obligations to continue the legacy of moneymaking overwhelms the individual's desire to create what many believe is frivolous artistry. What many of us as well as his father fail to realize is when this desire is crushed apathy sets in. This brings up the singularly amazing theme of this movie a theme Philip Barry uses in many of his works that a society that chases wealth without conscience that suppresses truly individualistic idealism is a society of superficial meanspirited and backbiting people. The party scene in Holiday is a cleareyed view of our society and how lost we are. Everyone talks down about others under their breath than hypocritically smiles and fawns over these same people to insure their own place in society. Those who refuse to go along with this status quo are relegated as HepburnAyresand the Professor and his wife are to the childrens' playroom until they growup and accept things as they are. This films warms an audience with it's superficial whimsy as ...Wonderful Life did yet can drive a cold stare with its slashing and often hurtful glances at how we are all relegated to the playroom of society if we express criticism of the narrowmindenness and suffocating aspects of capitalism.Holiday should be an important lesson to many of us on not just how important Life is but shows us how much more important it is to grasp on to what truly makes it worth living.";

The setting was perfect but in the movie John Case Cary and Julia were written in the script to go to Lake Placid to meet the father. The director or producer decided to drop it and go along with staying in the city. I thought they made a good choice but it would have been nice if they added deleted scenes of Lake scenes. They did shoot there for a couple of scenes but decided to drop them. Sorry if im repeating myself..In Conclusion to my viewing of the movie Holiday 1938 Great Movie Perfect Setting Great Art Direction Great Actors A Movie I recommend that everyone should see this movie at one point of their life.

The plot is pretty simple but there's just enough to it to show the different sides of the various characters and to allow each of them the chance to show how he or she approaches life.Probably the best part of the movie is the long New Year's Eve party sequence.

It's hard to believe now that when these 2 movies were made Katherine Hepburn was not considered a prime Box Office draw even though she had a dozen or so movies behind her. She and Cary Grant were able to deliver 100 in both types. In this film the comedy arises from the characters and the issues they face rather than the situation comedy and gags of Bringing up Baby. Now don't get me wrong I love both movies  and it only depends on the mood I'm in which one I prefer. But serious comedy is harder to do successfully and rarer so I value it the more.

Contrary to the labels people have assigned it it is NOT a screwball comedyin fact it's quite serious and brings a tremendous amount of character depth to its story much in the way Story would two years later. Hepburn of course plays the sister of a shallow girl who's about to be married and who only thinks of living a luxurious lifestyle. Grant waltzes in and finds that he and Hepburn are soul mates. The scenes in which these two along with an intellectual professor and his wife lambast the vacuous lives of the stinking and very dull rich are the movie's highlights.Holiday is one of those movies that never becomes irrelevant not to people who still think that intelligence imagination creativity and ideas are more valuable commodities than material possessions.Grade A".

	schema:headline " lovely film with a great cast";
	schema:reviewBody "Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant on paper I suppose look like an odd pairing but they were absolutely marvelous together and Holiday directed by George Cukor is no exception. Hepburn plays the unhappy bored but bright Linda in a dysfunctional upper crust New York family. Her brother Ned Lew Ayres is a miserable drunk and her father controls the family with an iron hand and the ethic that money is their god. Their mother who was like Linda is deeply missed by her. Linda adores her younger sister Julia but has idealized her and doesn't see that she has the same upper class values as their father. When Julia brings home her fiance Johnny Case Grant it is immediately obvious to the audience and later to the characters that Johnny fell for the wrong girl.Holiday is a film filled with heart poignancy and some warm humor provided by Johnny's friends played by Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon who come up against the society crowd at a party. Hepburn gives a beautiful performance as a young woman who wants to break free and Ayres is heartbreaking as a man who can't. Grant of course is in the kind of role he did best in his early career a young man from the wrong side of the tracks who is an independent spirit. He does some great gymnastics in the film and he and Hepburn have a wonderful moment where she stands on his shoulders and they fall into head rolls. Really marvelous stuff. The only problem I have is that the character of Julia the younger sister is so uptight and shallow it's amazing that Johnny fell for her at all. Since they met while she was vacationing in Lake Placid the audience must assume that out of the family home she was more fun and playful but when she comes up against her father she falls right in with him.Hepburn and Grant worked together in Bringing Up Baby The Philadelphia Story and this film  actually three films in a row  plus Sylvia Scarlett. One wishes they had appeared together even more. They had great chemistry.".

Linda adores her younger sister Julia but has idealized her and doesn't see that she has the same upper class values as their father. When Julia brings home her fiance Johnny Case Grant it is immediately obvious to the audience and later to the characters that Johnny fell for the wrong girl.Holiday is a film filled with heart poignancy and some warm humor provided by Johnny's friends played by Edward Everett Horton and Jean Dixon who come up against the society crowd at a party. Hepburn gives a beautiful performance as a young woman who wants to break free and Ayres is heartbreaking as a man who can't. Grant of course is in the kind of role he did best in his early career a young man from the wrong side of the tracks who is an independent spirit. He does some great gymnastics in the film and he and Hepburn have a wonderful moment where she stands on his shoulders and they fall into head rolls. Really marvelous stuff. The only problem I have is that the character of Julia the younger sister is so uptight and shallow it's amazing that Johnny fell for her at all. Since they met while she was vacationing in Lake Placid the audience must assume that out of the family home she was more fun and playful but when she comes up against her father she falls right in with him.Hepburn and Grant worked together in Bringing Up Baby The Philadelphia Story and this film  actually three films in a row  plus Sylvia Scarlett. One wishes they had appeared together even more. They had great chemistry.";

Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn were excellent in the film and the writing was topnotch as well. And for once I really don't have any complaints about a film! The movie is a remake of a 1930 film which I have unfortunately not been able to yet see about a funloving guy who thinks he's met the girl of his dreams on a vacation and asks her to marry him. All this actually occurs before the movie begins. As the film starts he is going to her home and finds that she's not the woman he expectedshe comes from an incredibly wealthy family. Grant isn't upset at all about thishe likes the sudden prospect of a rich wife. But what he doesn't realize is that she and her father are supercontrolling and have no intention of letting him live the carefree life he's always envisioned. Over time it becomes obvious that it isn't Grant that the girl loves but her vision of what she can mold him into! Along the way he also meets her alcoholic brother and freespirited sister Hepburn. Hepburn and Grant have a lot in common and eventually it becomes clear Hepburn is falling in love with her future brotherinlaw! I don't really want to discuss the movie further as it would spoil the film. But the film is an excellent tale about finding the balance between money and success as well as happiness and personal freedom. The movie is quite charming and intelligently written and is well worth your time.A final noteAlthough few would consider Ms. Hepburn sexy or even attractive in a traditional Hollywood sense she is at her most radiant in this film. Part of it may be that her cheeks seem a bit fuller and less gaunt than usualregardless it is Hepburn at her most beautiful.".

Though it wasn't quite as fun as Bringing Up Baby it was still a good pairing and a good movie overall. Lew Ayres playing Kate's alcoholic brother was also excellent in his small but striking role.

	schema:reviewBody "Giovanna's Father is another drama set in Pupi Avati's native Bologna during World War II. Once again it centers on a dysfunctional family. But whereas The Second Wedding Night was unable to find any depth beyond its three uneven central performances Avati's latest has a beating heart and as the title suggests that heart lies in Silvio Orlando's moving portrayal of a loving father an effort for which he received the Best Actor award at the Venice Film Festival.Orlando's character Michele Casali is a high school teacher respected by his students and coworkers loved by his wife Delia Francesca Neri and helped financially by his best friend police inspector Emilio Ghia Ezio Greggio. The only problem is his daughter Giovanna Alba Rohrwacher a sweet but troubled girl who has a peculiar connection with the surrounding reality. It doesn't help that Michele has always told her she is better than anyone else and that there's nothing wrong with her so when he asks read bribes one of his students to take Giovanna out on a date she thinks the poor guy really has feelings for her. The situation evolves badly and quickly leads to murder and Giovanna being sentenced to confinement in a mental institution. As this takes place Michele's whole universe falls apart but he never abandons his daughter. In fact he's the only one who keeps visiting her regularly while everyone else is looking for a way to survive with the conflict reaching its final stages.It is actually that context which constitutes the only real flaw of Giovanna's Father the period is recreated with great care and the viewer gets a sense of how different the quality of life was back then that's undeniable and it's obvious Avati chose that specific timeframe to make the situation more poignant and he succeeds more on that later. The downside is that when he actually has to focus on the strictly historical aspect of the matter i.e. the downfall of Fascism it all feels quite rushed and inevitably a bit stereotyped long story short a few people we had come to care for face execution. Then again this was present in The Second Wedding Night and The Heart is Elsewhere as well Avati has always been more interested in the characters with varying results than the context.Thankfully and therein lies the film's saving grace the fatherdaughter bond that constitutes the movie's emotional heart is constructed with real care so that the plot's developments never once fall into the clich trap. It is a universal story that of a parent's unconditioned love for his child and it is given extra power by a committed well chosen cast. Rohrwacher who is quickly becoming the new Italian talent to watch nails Giovanna's troubled psyche without resorting to any cheap acting tricks in other words she doesn't do a Jack Nicholson just for the hell of it. As her estranged mother Neri gives a nuanced fleshand blood performance that makes her believable even in those delicate moments a less talented actress would have ruined and Greggio whose dramatic talent was heavily doubted by most people he's primarily a comedian and not a really subtle one pulls off a less complicated but not less important role with great seriousness there are a few humorous bits but they're dictated by the context and not at all excessive.And then there's Orlando whose chronically sad face even when he's smiling and marvelous facial expressions have made him the ideal presence in Nanni More tti's body of work. Here he embodies the character with a sweet yet realistic naivet that makes Michele easy to empathize with and never pathetic the bittersweet core of a touching family tragedy. He may have been the second choice for the Volpi Cup in Venice Jury President Wim Wenders made it pretty clear he preferred Mickey Rourke's turn in The Wrestler which got the Golden Lion and therefore couldn't receive another award but a very good choice nonetheless his eyes conveying a painful humanity only a rock would fail to respond to. His interaction with Rohrwacher alone is good enough a reason to watch this thoughtful film.".

As this takes place Michele's whole universe falls apart but he never abandons his daughter. In fact he's the only one who keeps visiting her regularly while everyone else is looking for a way to survive with the conflict reaching its final stages.It is actually that context which constitutes the only real flaw of Giovanna's Father the period is recreated with great care and the viewer gets a sense of how different the quality of life was back then that's undeniable and it's obvious Avati chose that specific timeframe to make the situation more poignant and he succeeds more on that later. The downside is that when he actually has to focus on the strictly historical aspect of the matter i.e. the downfall of Fascism it all feels quite rushed and inevitably a bit stereotyped long story short a few people we had come to care for face execution. Then again this was present in The Second Wedding Night and The Heart is Elsewhere as well Avati has always been more interested in the characters with varying results than the context.Thankfully and therein lies the film's saving grace the fatherdaughter bond that constitutes the movie's emotional heart is constructed with real care so that the plot's developments never once fall into the clich trap. It is a universal story that of a parent's unconditioned love for his child and it is given extra power by a committed well chosen cast. Rohrwacher who is quickly becoming the new Italian talent to watch nails Giovanna's troubled psyche without resorting to any cheap acting tricks in other words she doesn't do a Jack Nicholson just for the hell of it. As her estranged mother Neri gives a nuanced fleshand blood performance that makes her believable even in those delicate moments a less talented actress would have ruined and Greggio whose dramatic talent was heavily doubted by most people he's primarily a comedian and not a really subtle one pulls off a less complicated but not less important role with great seriousness there are a few humorous bits but they're dictated by the context and not at all excessive.And then there's Orlando whose chronically sad face even when he's smiling and marvelous facial expressions have made him the ideal presence in Nanni More tti's body of work. Here he embodies the character with a sweet yet realistic naivet that makes Michele easy to empathize with and never pathetic the bittersweet core of a touching family tragedy. He may have been the second choice for the Volpi Cup in Venice Jury President Wim Wenders made it pretty clear he preferred Mickey Rourke's turn in The Wrestler which got the Golden Lion and therefore couldn't receive another award but a very good choice nonetheless his eyes conveying a painful humanity only a rock would fail to respond to. His interaction with Rohrwacher alone is good enough a reason to watch this thoughtful film.";

The result is that none of them seem to be entirely satisfactory other than the one who admittedly has been chosen as the subject of the film's title  Giovanna's father.Giovanna's father Michele Casali is an art teacher at a school in Bologna in the late 1930s just as the grip of Mussolini's fascist goverment is tightening and leading the country toward war. Casali has a teenage daughter who is somewhat delicate childish and socially awkward for her age. Her father cares for her her mother appears indifferent but worries about her ability to lead a normal life meet boys and get married to someone suitable.His concerns grow after Giovanna has a bad experience at a party organised by Giovanna's friend and study partner Marcella whose uncle is a senator in the Mussolini regime. Soon after the party Marcella is found dead in the gymnasium of the school and Michele's suspicions and fears that his daughter was involved in some way are confirmed when Giovanna is accused of the girl's murder. At the end of the trial however Giovanna is deemed not responsible for her actions and is sent to an institution rather than a prison.The handling of the case and Giovanna's involvement isn't handled terribly effectively. We are shown nothing we have seen little of Giovanna's actions or behaviour to be able to understand what has happened certainly nothing to suggest that she might be capable of murder and there is very little detail provided on the presentation of the murder case or the trial. GIovanna confesses giving obscure and unsound reasons for the killing so there is not even any question of did she or didn't she. Everything is seen from her father's perspective.Which is all well and good or at least it's a consistent position if not entirely a satisfactory one. While we learn and come to greatly admire his dedication in looking after his daughter despite the privations he suffers sacrificing his marriage his job his home and his dignity and having to do it all moreover in he middle of a war it means that all those other aspects and the characters involved are not afforded a credible voice or perspective of their own.Giovanna's mother Francesca Neri is silent and brooding offering no sign of inner life or desires other than significant glances she sends the way of their friend and neighbour who is a police officer. Michele eventually notices and it's suggested that Giovanna has noticed and that this instability in the family might be the main reason behind Giovanna's breakdown and leaves her with love and regret.

Despite the grimness of the situation Avanti expects the viewer not only to care about the characters you can barely comprehend never mind like but believe that this could come to any kind of happy ending.

Being pushed into assertive and sometimes aggressive roles and having to overcome the natural hesitation and shyness prominent in the majority of 18  20 year old girls is not a simple task. I thought the actors were totally at ease and natural in their roles. Perhaps they were just playing themselves and reliving their own experiences. I smiled at many of the things I remembered.

	schema:reviewBody "Two 18year old female Israeli soldiers polar opposites in personality patrol a section of Jerusalem from morning until night stopping every Palestinian they see on the street asking for their ID and recording the information on a government form. At checkpoints Arab women must strip down to their underwear while a metal detector scans their bodies their purses are searched their makeup xrayed and food designed for their children is confiscated. Now in limited release Close to Home a film directed by two former Israeli soldiers Dalia Hager and Vidi Bilu examines the Israeli occupation portraying a generation forced to perform invasive military tasks in the name of a state security system they seem barely committed to. Indeed the film suggests that both sides now feel powerless to bring to an end the constant insecurity the terrorist threats and the harassment.At a border crossing an Israeli soldier named Dana tells everyone to stop searching and go home. I don't believe in it she declares but Dana is put in prison for her rebellion and the film shifts elsewhere. Smadar Smadar Sayar an abrasive nonconformist has been placed in a unit with Mirit Neama Shendar an earnest young woman who takes her duties seriously so seriously in fact that she is known as the squealer someone who reports fellow soldiers who slack off during patrol. The two are under orders not to socialize smoke eat talk on a cellphone or go shopping except during two half hour breaks but Smadar routinely breaks these rules as do other girls who alert each other on their cell phones whenever their superiors are in the area.Mirit apologizes to a man whose misplaced ID card causes him to miss his bus and perhaps lose his job but Smadar calls her a moron for apologizing. Mirit barely tolerates Smadar's disdain of authority but things change slowly when a terrorist bomb goes off in their section and Mirit barely escapes injury. Mirit tries to be more like Smadar to the point where she is arrested and put in prison for one week for leaving her post to go dancing with a sleazy pick up while guarding a hotel. Smadar visits her in jail and gives her a gift of a hat she had been eyeing through a store window but Mirit rejects her overtures of friendship.They slowly become friends however and then become enemies then friends again mimicking the clichs of copbuddy movies. The film then chooses to focus on their growing closeness and coming of age rituals such as chasing boys and budding romances and the terrorist threat seems to recede into the background as if it was never that important. While it is good to see the ArabIsraeli conflict from the perspective of women soldiers and to learn more about the reality of the harassment of Palestinians Close to Home raises more questions than it provides answers for and left me confused about the point it was really trying to make. Perhaps it simply mirrors the entire conflict  a maze with no exit.".

Smadar Smadar Sayar an abrasive nonconformist has been placed in a unit with Mirit Neama Shendar an earnest young woman who takes her duties seriously so seriously in fact that she is known as the squealer someone who reports fellow soldiers who slack off during patrol. The two are under orders not to socialize smoke eat talk on a cellphone or go shopping except during two half hour breaks but Smadar routinely breaks these rules as do other girls who alert each other on their cell phones whenever their superiors are in the area.Mirit apologizes to a man whose misplaced ID card causes him to miss his bus and perhaps lose his job but Smadar calls her a moron for apologizing. Mirit barely tolerates Smadar's disdain of authority but things change slowly when a terrorist bomb goes off in their section and Mirit barely escapes injury. Mirit tries to be more like Smadar to the point where she is arrested and put in prison for one week for leaving her post to go dancing with a sleazy pick up while guarding a hotel. Smadar visits her in jail and gives her a gift of a hat she had been eyeing through a store window but Mirit rejects her overtures of friendship.They slowly become friends however and then become enemies then friends again mimicking the clichs of copbuddy movies. The film then chooses to focus on their growing closeness and coming of age rituals such as chasing boys and budding romances and the terrorist threat seems to recede into the background as if it was never that important. While it is good to see the ArabIsraeli conflict from the perspective of women soldiers and to learn more about the reality of the harassment of Palestinians Close to Home raises more questions than it provides answers for and left me confused about the point it was really trying to make. Perhaps it simply mirrors the entire conflict  a maze with no exit.";

How would living in so perpetual a state of high alert affect the things you did the places you went to the people you saw? And how would such an environment determine the structure of the society itself the laws it proscribed and the way in which it treated its people? And could terrorism itself become such a commonplace and familiar fact of everyday life that even it might lose the ability to shock and horrify the very people closest to it? Finding the means of successfully combating terrorism has of course become a lifeordeath necessity for the people of Israel. One of their responses to the threat has been to instigate mandatory military service for all their young people. Another has been to subject Arabs to legal random searches  simply for being Arabs. In the Israeli film Close to Home Smadar and Mirit are two young Army officers whose job it is to check the ID's of anyone in their assigned area who happens to look like a Palestinian. Possibly because they have grown up with terrorism as a regular part of their lives these girls seem to have developed a strange immunity to its effects for neither seems overly impressed with the seriousness of the job they are doing  although of the two Mirit is a little more concerned about what might happen to them were they found to be in any way derelict in their duties. Smadar and Mirit are not exactly natural buddies but over time they develop a certain tenuous closeness that seems sure to blossom into a fullfledged friendship by the end of the story. Or will it?Close to Home is more of a naturalistic study of the daytoday lives of these two women than it is a heavily plotted narrative. Most of the film is spent chronicling their interactions with their military superiors the random people they are forced to interrogate and most importantly each other. Smadar Sayar and Neama Shendar create believable memorable characters who perform their task more out of a sense of duty than a fiery love of country. It's only when an explosion hits a little too close to home that they are at least momentarily shaken out of their lethargy. But even that doesn't last for long as the girls begin to slack off at their jobs once again with Smadar becoming an ever more potentially corrupting influence on the decidedly less rebellious Mirit.If the filmmakers Vardit Bilu and Dalia Hager have a political point to make it is well hidden beneath the deceptively casual surface of the girls' relationship. For this is first and foremost a story about Smadar and Neama about two Israeli youngsters who despite the extraordinary conditions under which they are forced to live are basically interested in the same things that preoccupy young people the world over moving away from home pursuing romantic interests deciding on hairstyles and fashions. If anything the filmmakers seem to be saying that it really isn't possible for the human mind to exist in a state of constant readiness no matter how great the threat that eventually the concerns of common everyday life will rise to the surface and crowd most everything else out. Bilu and Hager clearly acknowledge the reality of the terrorist threat but they also know that a life ruled by fear is no life at all.In a subtle but persuasive way the movie also raises the extremely touchy question of just how far a nation should go in abrogating the civil liberties of any single group in exchange for increased safety. It is an issue Israel has been dealing throughout its entire existence and the movie makers clearly acknowledge that there is no simple solution to that conundrum  a conundrum that has unfortunately become increasingly relevant beyond the limits of the Israeli border.".

If you don't know by now it's the story of two Israeli female recruited soldiers whose task is to check Arrabs ID for national security. Since I too have been recruited by the French army to do my military service I could well identify with some of the feelings expressed by them and other soldiers. The difference between their situation and mine their's had danger mine was more like a game. Yet the situation was  in some ways so similar are they were people drawn to an unusual environment most likely without their consent to perform tasks they had not fully taken on board. Possibly what is going in Israel for them was part of life but not really their life. At least that what I got from the movie this sense of reality. Their life was well above the national security their life was the one most young people go through. their maturing their dream their want. So as I remember too the army was something they had to go through and so be it but it did not stop the more important things in their life. Although the film shows quite a contrast of personality between these two main characters it shows too a similar humanity in both of them that will play a role. It is quite thought provoking. You wonder what was the extent of their power or their feeling to intrude in others life their sense of duty. But reality works at different level and when one bomb explodes it stresses that fact and shows the impact it has on those soldiers. It reminds me of someone I knew a strong headed person who ended up being sent to Algeria in active service. their group was sent to dislodge rebels out of cave. The group gun ho had taken position but as it was their first mission had no idea of reality Whilst they were ordered to lye down one had still his lower leg folded up. Reality struck in the form of a bullet through his ankle. And they learned a new level of reality! This is how I saw this movie.".

It was a case of an illequipped vastly outnumbered army defending land almost all of which had been purchased over the preceding hundred years from its original owners by Zionist groups on behalf of the Jewish National Fund. The Israeli armed forces won a praiseworthy reputation for the manner in which they fought to defend Israel the land and its people.The proportion of land owned by the Jewish National Fund is reported to be around 13 by 2007 according to the Wikipedia entry on that institution. The discrepancy arises from the land obtained by military conquest since 1948.By 2005 when Close to Home was made the young Israeli conscripts have been reduced to the boring and uninspiring task of patrolling the streets of Jerusalem stopping Palestinian passersby asking for their identity cards and to writing down their details on special forms. That is a long way from the training of sabras in the use of military weapons and procedures to be used in defending their homeland against attack by foreign armies.

The conscript is sent to prison where she is required along with other miscreant conscripts to sort buttons. The viewer can not help but wonder which is the more meaningful employment  sorting buttons or harassing Palestinians.The two central characters spend their time looking in shop windows visiting hair dressers smoking contemplating true romance and half heartedly taking down details of a few Palestinians.

The IMDb synopsis by writersdirectors Vidi Bilu and Dalia Hager suggests that As women this film is our own way of soul searching about our army service and the occupation The film like many Israeli films seems to be questioning the policies of the country's leaders.

Chabrol doesn't hide his goals there is even a shot of a From Russia With Love book with Sean Connery on the cover near the start and he tries to give the film some quirks killer dwarf! but he can't really stage fight scenes and he lets some sequences driving opera singing prowrestling etc. play on and on purposelessly. Of course it doesn't help that Roger Hanin is one of the least charismatic spy leads of the period more closely resembling George Lazenby in the way his judo chops are his strongest point. From Russia With Love Bond girl Daniela Bianchi is also here but her role is strictly and almost demeaningly to look beautiful and get captured by the bad guys. She can't have more than 10 lines of dialogue in the entire picture. Oh and not to sound biased or anything but a black  white 1960s Eurospy movie is like a color 1940s film noir  it just doesn't feel right. I will give it credit for one novelty however the gun that fires backwards. I wonder if The Silencers with Matt Helm stole this idea from Code Name Tiger. 12 out of 4.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched this last night having been very intrigued by Audiard's other works esp.the brilliant and somewhat indescribable Read My Lips. See How They Fall was indeed one of the more unusual stories I have seen in film. While the story has 4 main characters it is the two most unassuming characters that anchor and propel the film. One is an overthehill depressive teddy bear of a salesman Yanne. The other is a mentally slowmentally challenged grown up child Kassovitz. The former is searching for his only friend's killer the latter is a puppy dog follower of a seedy petty criminal Trintignant. I've never seen Tr. in this kind of role. He is extremely convincing and completely revolting. Most of the film builds the back story and follows the lives of the 2 pairs of friends. There are certainly elements of Midnight Cowboy and Of Mice and Men but I was very pleased to see that the stories have many unexpected elements mostly to do with Yanne as he gradually leaves behind everything familiar to him and 'becomes' the quest to find his friend's killer. He moves obsequiously and with ease through worlds completely foreign to him and the viewer's empathy is gradually drawn into the essence of who he is. One completely believes that he is who he is playing and the same is true of Trintignant and Kassovitz. The film's resolution occurs close to the end when the 2 stories intersect. Before this the film would have been greatly improved if 30 of it had been edited out but the film's resolution is quick and perfect like a gentle but effective 12 punch. In both Read My Lips and See How They Fall Audiard shows a very unique way with unusual characters and their justasunusual stories. Both films are relatively quiet and contemplative and the many silences lull the viewer into a distinct internal rhythm. Long after the films have ended this rhythm stays on.".

See How They Fall was indeed one of the more unusual stories I have seen in film. While the story has 4 main characters it is the two most unassuming characters that anchor and propel the film. One is an overthehill depressive teddy bear of a salesman Yanne. The other is a mentally slowmentally challenged grown up child Kassovitz. The former is searching for his only friend's killer the latter is a puppy dog follower of a seedy petty criminal Trintignant. I've never seen Tr. in this kind of role.

The tension in the film comes not so much from the 'murder mystery' plot as from the relationship between the characters. The film tells two stories in parallel.The first story involves the characters played by Trintignant and Kassovitz. Trintignant is an ageing drifter with a somewhat ridiculous macho toughness who is followed by a naive young man played by Kassovitz with plenty of goodnatured smiles. Many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters for example when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz how to be intimidating.The second story tells how a salesmanplayed by Jean Yanne gives up his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend. Yanne plays the part with a kind of aggressive irony. I wish I could describe this better.After a while the viewer understands how both stories are connected and they meet indeed in the end in a surprising but also logical ending.The film is a successful mixture of the witty but superficial gangster films the director's father the celebrated Michel Audiard used to write and the typical french film with lots of psychological depth and lots of care in the display of emotions.".

Mathieu Kassovitz is an annoying presence in the way he was asked to play Johnny.

	schema:headline " Mediocre first effort from Audiard.";
	schema:reviewBody "As a massive fan of Jacques Audiard's work in the past decade I was eager to check out his first directorial effort See How They Fall. It wasn't a bad film by any means but I have to admit I was disappointed. Cowritten with his frequent collaborator Alain Le Henry based on a novel by Teri White it tells the story of Simon Jean Yanne a businesscard salesman who hunts down the men that shoot his cop friend Mickey. It's a farfetched concept this mildmannered schlub suddenly deciding to become a pulp investigator but the black comedy tone that Audiard gives the film make it so that a stretch of the imagination isn't hard for the audience to conjure up.Still the story splits it's time between Simon and the homeless wandering duo of Marx and Johnny JeanLouis Trintignant and Mathieu Kassovitz which is one of the few mistakes that it makes. There's a lack of balance in how compelling these men are and whenever we were spending time with Simon I found myself just wanting to see more of Marx and Johnny. The two of them set up an interesting dynamic with Marx being the grizzled old drifter who just wants to be alone and is only looking out for himself while Johnny is the dimwitted lad with a heart of gold who takes a shine to Marx and will do anything for him. That relationship should have been the focal point of the film but instead we spend the majority of our time with Simon on trying to track them down a journey that isn't particularly engaging or memorable.Audiard has worked in the crime genre for his entire career but in the past decade with the films Read My Lips The Beat That My Heart Skipped and A Prophet he has evolved the field in a way that few others have done before. He's orchestrated fully realized worlds around deep complex characters who walk a fine line of moral ambiguity all conducted with his key eye for a gripping aesthetic style. See How They Fall isn't a bad film but it's stripped of all the things that make Audiard one of the best filmmakers we have in modern cinema. The characters are quite thin for the large majority of the picture only getting slight hints towards more layers but never being full developed and the film is stylistically flat despite it's best efforts. It doesn't have emotional resonance of Read My Lips the thematic power of The Beat That My Heart Skipped or the scope of A Prophet.There's an attempt to give it the kind of whipflash editing structure that a lot of these independent crime films were accustomed to in the '90s but it never really lands as strongly as some of them were able to accomplish. It's a fun little movie with fine acting by the young Kassovitz and the veteran Trintignant but overall there really isn't anything to set it apart and leave an impression. It's a pedestrian affair but a mildly interesting first effort from the man who would evolve into the best crime filmmaker of the modern era.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit that before this film I was never a real fan of the Watcher series. A Russian friend of mine advised me to watch Nochnoy Dozor. I was impressed but hardly blown away. So I went into this film expecting another worthless sequel Hollywood seems to be churning out by the dozen. But this is not Hollywood and this is not another worthless sequel. In fact this is surprisingly amazing. Every aspect of the original have been amplified up ten times until you can almost feel the room reverberating. We're spoilt with so much cinematic impact right from the start. The CGI landscapes are breathtaking and the epic battles are just as panoramic as something out of a LoTR film.The cast is kept the same as the original all still pitchperfect in their roles. I can't imagine anyone other than Khabensky playing our helplessly flawed hero. The premise might seem overused Light versus Dark but the background plot is actually very unique. I love how the leaders can joke around with each other when taking time off being sworn mortal enemies. And you can tell that the film is a book adaptation by how deep the story goes. Very few aspects are covered completely leaving you to wonder what motives have some of the characters really got and what was decidedly cut out of the film version. The soundtrack is one of the most erratic ones I've ever heard but works perfectly for this film. One scene a romantic love score the next some adrenaline pumping heavy metal immediately followed by a chirpy joke song. I honestly can't say much about the script since I don't understand Russian but I feel that there are some injokes that would be hilarious if only I understood them. And that's the surprising thing about the film  despite all of its mindblowing action there is still time for the writer to fit in some matured dry humour! I've now been thoroughly converted into a Watcher fan. The first thing I'll do is hunt down some English copies of the books. It feels to me as if the first film is just an introduction to these characters and leads up to the second film where the action heats up. A little surprised by the conclusive ending but can't wait to see what they'll do with it in the next film!".

The relatively huge success of of the first episode obviously allowed the producers to pump more cash into this second installment and it shows throughout the film. The CG sequences are slicker and more impressive and so is pretty much everything else including the consistently confident directing. Even the fact that the premise is so annoyingly weak doesn't spoil the fun as much as it did in the first film.As a Russian though the thing I liked best was the unmistakable Russianness of the movie. As far as filmmaking is concerned I don't normally mean that as a compliment but with Day Watch it is different. While it can definitely appeal to a wider international audience my girlfriend albeit a bit of a Russophile is an indication of that it is at the same time literally packed with all sorts of clever wordplay and references to various realities of Russian life ranging from political satire to hilariously blatant product placement.Even though I can enjoy a less obnoxious arthouse film every now and then on the whole I prefer clever commercial movies and Day Watch falls into that category very neatly.".

This is a world where dark ones and light ones live in an uneasy truce among the unsuspecting living. Once you get your head around this world's rules it starts to make sense and it becomes an action drama like any other yet unlike any other. And for that you should see it but don't expect to understand it very much at first.. it helps if you saw the first film of this series Night Watch but that film sucked in comparison to this one in my opinion and maybe that was just budgetary constraints but hey it still sucked.The good thing about having seen Night Watch is that it will make you like this one a whole lot more because you will understand what's going on and then focus on the plot and the action which is quite an orgy of bizarre circumstance.So suffer through Night Watch then watch this and I think you will get a really unique experience out of this it's fantasy vampires spellcasters and a very omnipresent Russia woven into this all. It's a must see because of it's uniqueness and to be forgiven for the occasional stupidity or clumsiness in transition it presents it has a unique beauty that needs preservation just like a Russian. I must applaud the director for creating a scene with women and high action where you would have expected to see a man. When you see the movie you will see what I mean and it's just one of many of the clever and confounding dreamrules apply plot twists this thing will throw at you with total abandon.".

Sure it had its flaws but still it looked great it was refreshingly original and most of all  it was atmospheric. To sum it up in a short statement It left me longing for more.Then I watched the sequel Day Watch and I just didn't get it... all I could think was God damnit what the hell went wrong there? Day Watch was nothing but flaws. The worst problem of it is probably that it has one of the worst scripts I came around in a long time... there's simply no point to it and no it's not that I wouldn't have understood it. And what is so bad about that is the fact that it not only gives not a damn about the novels it should be supposed to be based on  it also totally ignores its predecessor. I've somewhere read that after Fox bought the rights to it they urged the whole story into an early termination. As a result Day Watch is just a total mess.Part one succeeded in establishing a dark aggrieving setting with more or less strong characters and ended with a bunch of prophecies that really pronounced some major threats to come in part two... But honestly guys what DO we have there? It's a huge mess of story lines some finished some not that really do not help to advance the plot in the slightest. The characters are reduced to bystanders like Bear in the best case and to total clowns in the worst hey what exactly does Anton do in the last hour of the movies? He totters around drunk... what happens to Olga? What happened to the threatening presence of Zavulon? And damn why does Yegor never show any sign of becoming the great fateturning wizard that he's foretold to become? Other characters get way too much screentime only to get an opportunity to establish a goofy romance or show some flesh... and what's the parrot guy doing in it anyway??? It is A TERRIBLY SCRIPTED MOVIE. Face it. The apocalypse is the result of a toyranamok? It's not what I expected. Definitely not.What's maybe the worst thing for me is that there are certain signs that point to all this having happened on purpose. There are at least two scenes shower anyone? that are so horribly cheesy that there's actually only one word to describe it Camp. Now I certainly can take a little bit of camp once in a while and I also did like the humor in some of the scenes in part one and you could even argue if there were not some camp aspects in that as well  but all in all Night Watch was more or less serious in it's tone. Day Watch is not camp in the clever sense  it's just goofy. It's not fun. It's out of place there I think.In fact I thought the movie was so different from part one  and sadly in all the wrong points  that I asked myself how it was possible to send it all down the gutter like that. I thought that maybe the studio or the director got in a fight over something and either one of them tried to pay it back in that way to the other or that somebody lost a bet or so there or... I really don't know. I just can't understand it. And also can't understand why they more or less had it end in a way that there's no sense in really making a part 3 anymore... Guess that's the only good thing I can say about it After that disaster I'm actually glad that there maybe will be no movie to follow.And even if I have to disappoint all you Slavophil guys out there who are just proud to finally have a cool movie you can show to foreign audiences Good special effects and the state as a sequel to a good movie doesn't make this a good movie. I'm afraid so.".

The two things are not of course that far apart as everyone soon finds out.This is epic story telling and it covers a great deal of ground. Do not blink or go to the bathroom with out being able to pause this since this moves like the wind. Unfortunately even with close attention a good deal of the plot is going to be clouded. There are lots of characters lots of plot points many carried over from the first film which in retrospect I should have watched before I dove into this film. You can fee the film's origins as a novel bleeding off the screen giving this version of Moscow a very real sense of place.The action and craftsmanship of this film is almost without equal. The set pieces are spectacular there are things in this movie to make your jaw drop open the influx of American money can be seen on the screen in sequences that top the first film. The cast is amazing creating some really good guys and some vile bad ones. Its first rate all around.I really did like this film a great deal though I am a tad disappointed. I don't know whether its the fact that the story is too big for its two and a half running time or if its the fact that it doesn't go where I expected it to go. I think I'm going to have to see it again preferably when I can see this not long after the first film.If you saw and liked the first film see this.

The CG is awesome the acting first class and the direction of Timur Bekmambetov is breathtaking a point not lost on Hollywood with him signing up to direct his first English language film. The ending of the first film is taken a step further and knitted together beautifully with the second keeping you gripped with questions and answers from start to finish. In fact the pace was so good I barely noticed the fact that it was 3 hours long. The only things that confuse me about this film is where can they possibly go with Dusk Watch..... and could it be even better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before talking about the actual movie I must first get this off my chest the amount of people flocking to see this and me cruising around the city for a few hours while running up a vast bill on futile attempts to advance book a few seats was...inspirational. I have never witnessed such a packed theater not in Russia anyway. I firmly believe that if Mr. Spielberg somehow managed to resurrect Mr. Fellini who for some strange reason invited James Cameron and perhaps Tom Hanks to make a 300 million dollar picture on its opening day the queues in Moscow's cinemas would be shorter compared to this. A slightly sick form of patriotism which I as a future filmmaker could only stand and adore. Thanks for hearing me out on that one...now onto the movie itself. From the very start it looked and felt better than the last time around. The credits are done in quite an original manner and caught me offguard I was all set for the good flick up ahead. However as the movie progressed it began to regress. The acting which seemed pretty good in the first hour fueled by a few unoriginal but damn good scenes slowly but surely began to get annoying. I'd attribute that to the writing but more on that later. Having never read the book and I'm keeping that up I was pleasantly surprised by the twist and turns that the story takes. Again that lasted until about halfway through. Keeping in mind that this experience lasts over two hours it got to a point where the plot degraded into whatever course necessary to show us a few more CGI filled shots. One of such scenes centres on a dog collared vampire driving a Mazda RX8 around a vertical hotel wall at heights over 50 metres. It's an absolute joke one during which I presume 14yr old kids will find themselves breathless. CGI for the sake of CGI is st. Sorry the Matrix this is not. No doubt someone on the other end of the web shall proclaim 'Oh shut up this cost 10 times less!'. Sure but the Matrix wasn't shot in Russia where the average crew member makes less than 30 a day. This could have been a great film if there existed a Russian script doctor. I don't think we have one yet. With careful tailoring this script could been a blast for the mind also rather than just being good old eye candy. Maybe it does not have to last more than 1h45m. Another thing which does not do any favours for the international release of this film are the moments that will be lost in translation and I mean both dialogue and picture wise. An example is the stretched out final showdown. This takes a potshot at the Russian showbiz elite The guests who are supposed to be all on the dark side George Lucas anyone? are played by famous Russian celebrities. One shot was a little disturbing a music producer who died recently is shown getting his chest torn by superpowerful yoyos ?!?. Overall this a good effort hampered by an understandable desire 'to be Hollywood'. I'd like to mention the marketing campaign is quite likely to be in the same budget as the film itself. A redistribution of these funds would have done the movie good in the long run. All style no soul is the motto which I hope pays off when Russians begin applying the professionalism earnedborrowedstolen from America to flicks featuring both of the above.".

Not even Blankman Legally Blonde or Motor Home Massacre can surpass this pile of babble blatantly called a film. I sat in a theater of about twenty people and everyone laughed at how horrible it was!!! Five people walked out. I on the other hand sat dimwitted wondering how in the hell an adult editor director and film designer can gather in a group and agree this is a suitable film to show. First off the plot sounds like a small child came up with it so that means some novels shouldn't be made into a movie. exEragon seriously who can honestly say there was innovation and creativity put forth into creating a plot revolving around a laughable quest item chalk of destiny?? a couple of vampires light and dark watchman agents and a cheesy endoftheworld climax. Second the directing looked like it was done by an ADD stricken nerd swooning over excess explosions and special effects. Every twist and turn seemed lackluster. Every line seemed out of place. And every unique scene poorly constructed was misconstrued through agitating film angles and cartoonish effects. Third the story flatlined at the first of the ten minutes. Especially in the end it is said that the chalk can only be used if it doesn't effect someone else's destiny but in the end the twist made no sense. That change of fate would have effected everyone else. So it makes no sense. Fourth the music was way too cheesy and excruciating for my taste. The palette of music they used was just two songs one that sounds like ice cream truck music and the overbearing heavy metal music that played in every fight scene. I still can't believe that it got such high ratings. Most of the reviews submitted by critics even said it had a silly plot and direction but for some reason they gave it good ratings. Please do not watch this movie! I can fill two more pages with what is wrong with this movie.".

Unfortunately the producers invested lots of money in the movie but forgot the most important and used a confused story that makes no sense indeed we have just watched this film and we did not understand the plot. The storyline seems to be basically that the lead character Anton belongs to the Forces of the Light as well as his powerful girlfriend and apprentice but his son is a powerful teenager from the Darkness and Anton protects him. When the balance between Light and Darkness is affected by the death of some evil vampires Anton is framed and accused of the murders and he chases an ancient chalk that has the power of changing the destiny of its owner. However the screenplay is a complete mess and we were completely lost and did not understand the purpose of the story i.e. what is it about? There are many situations that happen without any explanation in spite of the fantastic special effects and gorgeous actresses in a complete waste of a generous budget. My vote is three.Title Brazil Guardies do Dia Guardians of the Day".

The storyline seems to be basically that the lead character Anton belongs to the Forces of the Light as well as his powerful girlfriend and apprentice but his son is a powerful teenager from the Darkness and Anton protects him. When the balance between Light and Darkness is affected by the death of some evil vampires Anton is framed and accused of the murders and he chases an ancient chalk that has the power of changing the destiny of its owner. However the screenplay is a complete mess and we were completely lost and did not understand the purpose of the story i.e. what is it about? There are many situations that happen without any explanation in spite of the fantastic special effects and gorgeous actresses in a complete waste of a generous budget. My vote is three.Title Brazil Guardies do Dia Guardians of the Day";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a sequel of Nochnoi Dozor English Night Watch the first part of a trilogy on the everlasting fantasy battle Good versus Evil called here Light and Dark respectively. Beware the episodes of this trilogy are hard to watch on their own. Dnevnoi Dozor English Day Watch set in Moscow continues on Nochnoi Dozor in which the main character Anton who chose to join the Light protects a boy who would become a Great One someone mentioned in the prophecy that could decide the battle of Light versus Dark by joining either of them out of free will. At the same time the Night Watch Light side has to deal with a curse a virgin brought into the world.In Devnoi Dozor the boy lives with the Day Watch Dark side where he learns the Dark side is not that evil but just human. The film begins with the warrior Tamarlan finding the Chalk of Destiny a thousand years ago. Then we switch to Moscow present time where Anton and the virgin Svetlana are patrolling for the Night Watch. They are researching the Chalk and decide they need it in the battle with the Dark side. To prevent the boy from choosing the Dark side Anton wants to use the Chalk to change destiny. The film is straightforward the timeline is continuous. There are no big plotturns the thrill is created by fast paced mindboggling scenes racing car driving vertically along a building and well composed soundtracks. The plot consists of Anton trying to change destiny in favor of the Light. A sub plot is Anton being accused of murder because of which he could be sent to the Inquisitors. Another sub plot is the impossible relation Alisa a main person of the Day Watch is trying to fix she has with Kostya a vampire of the Dark side.The theme obviously is the battle of good versus evil which is a proved theme for fantasy stories. Some motives are flashlights Light in the darkness the Chalk history changes as it is written destiny which the Chalk can change free will Light and Dark can't force people to join them and the Chalk can't change free will name Anton meaning worthy of praise name Svetlana meaning star e.g. the Light innocence innocent people don't need to change destiny.Characters Anton Main character he wants to fix everything himself. Svetlana Main character she develops hatelove relations with Anton. Olga she is a sorcerer for the Light ones. Egor the boy who has to choose between Dark and Light. Alisa wants to fix an impossible love relation. The characters are quite flat the personalities don't really evolve. Except for Svetlana who first hates Anton but then gets very close to him.Although the theme nor the plot is very spectacular the camwork the editing the special effects and the soundtracks more than make up for it. There are true astonishing scenes original effects a 'jump' into a poster through the Dusk resulting in a 'jump' out of a billboard some place else. Or Tamarlan attacking the temple which scene could easily compete with some of the best of Japanese  Chinese cinematography. Concluding If you are a fan of ActionFantasy with capital A and F in combination with mythological and ethic elements like The Matrix you should watch this movie definitely. I give it 910 which should outrate the prequel".

Or Tamarlan attacking the temple which scene could easily compete with some of the best of Japanese  Chinese cinematography. Concluding If you are a fan of ActionFantasy with capital A and F in combination with mythological and ethic elements like The Matrix you should watch this movie definitely. I give it 910 which should outrate the prequel";

Polly Bergen is believable as the frightened wife and there is also good acting by Martin Balsam as Bowden's chief of police friend and Telly Savalas as a private detective hired to help the family. But the major credit in this issue goes without doubt to Robert Michum's performance as the dangerous avenger.

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw J. Lee Thompson's film I was on the edge of my seat. It is a scary thriller without showing buckets of blood graphic violence monster makeup or even using the word rape.A bitter amoral psychopathic excon Max Cady the incomparable Robert Mitchum recently released from an eightyear prison term is out for revenge against the man who testified against him at his trial lawyer Sam Bowden the late great Gregory Peck. He infiltrates into Sam's life stalking his lovely wife Peggy Polly Bergen no shrinking violet and his pretty innocent teenage daughter Nancy the appropriately sweet Lori Martin. Sam does everything legally possible for the time before antistalking laws came into place to protect his family but he finds he is powerless under the law and Cady is very intelligent in his planning. It all ends in a showdown on the river Cape Fear.Let me just say that this movie has an advantage over the 1991 remake. Cady doesn't have to be covered in tattoos or act like Freddy Krueger to be terrifying. The word rape doesn't have to be mentioned nor does the offense have to be shown to us graphically since the censors of the time forbade it for the viewer to understand and comprehend what is going on. The performances are all right on and even when Barrie Chase's Diane Taylor is assaulted we don't have to be told that she was raped because it's implied and it's written all over her bruised traumatized face. Her portrayal of this victimized and frightened young woman is impeccable  why didn't she have a longer career?Gregory Peck is compelling and the scenes where Nancy is pursued by Cady outside her school and she escapes inside only to fear that he has also followed her in and she is mistaken is absolutely nailbiting as is the final showdown. Cady's devious plan to accost Peggy on the boat in order to trade her for Nancy is gutwrenching and extremely watchable. We now have a names for guys like that  rapist stalker pedophile murderer  but the first three were either not used or hadn't been made a term yet. A classic don't accept any substitutions. As I usually give so much away in my comments I'll leave the plot details at that. Bernard Hermann's score for the film is perfect and ranks right along with his score for Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO  a masterpiece. And so is the movie. Don't watch it alone or in a dark room! 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sam Bowden is a lawyer who eight years ago acted as a witness against Max Cady to put him behind bars.  Released from prison Cady has studied the law and is set on terrorising the Bowdens without actually overstepping his legal rights.  As Cady toes the line with increasingly worrying results Browden begins to cross the line to deal with him and protect his family.Having seen the remake first I wanted to go back and see it done originally. My first impression was that the remake had done some elements better than this.  For example Nolte's lawyer is a lot less cleancut than Pecks'.  Also the sexual threat to the daughter is a lot more played out in the remake. Getting past this I saw how this was actually a better film in many ways. As a drama it moves along at a good pace  not jumping from one thrill to the next but not dragging either.The film can only hint at the deeds of Cady because of the censors but it is clear even to the blind that Cady is a monster.  This ups the tension as everything is slowly build to and we don't get a bloody or sexually shocking scene as a payoff no here the tension is build on top of other tension. The direction is good giving a dark feel to the look of the film as well as hinting constantly.  Even if some of the thrills are signposted it still works well.However without Mitchum's performance this would be a very different film. With the help of De Niro's sneer or menacing tattoos he is still a better Cady.  He is on top form  where De Niro wore his threat large Mitchum hints at it under a veneer of casual disinterest making the threat seem bigger when he acts.  Peck is good even if his character is too cleancut when he should have been pushed further over the line for my tastes.  Bergen doesn't have much to do but her final scene with Mitchum is powerful and she really lets rip.  Martin is perfectly cast  she looks like a child but also is developed' enough to be a sexual role for Mitchum to prey on.  It is easy to watch her as Mitchum closes in on her almost licking his lips but that's the power of the film.Overall this manages to be powerful and thrilling despite the censors and is a really good drama.  However it is totally carried by a monstrous yet subtle performance by Mitchum.  De Niro was good in the role but once you've seen this you'll realise that menace can be acted subtly and not just by sneering and getting tonnes of tattoos.".

Today modern democracies have antiharrassment laws which carry criminal penalties and there is also the civil remedy of an injunction with power of arrest but back in the early 1960's a man who chose to make a nuisance of himself enjoyed wide latitude.  It was difficult for the law to step in without infringing his civil and constitutional rights.    Sam Bowden Gregory Peck is a smalltown attorney in the southeastern United States.  He has a lovely family and a nice home and is well thought of by neighbours and colleagues alike.  This American idyll is destroyed when a newlyreleased convict shows up intent on harrassing Bowden.  Some years back the lawyer had appeared as a witness at this man's trial and the convict bears an irrational grudge.    Max Cady is one of the cinema's great villains.  Mitchum is irresistible as the heavyeyed smart alec seething with sexual energy.  Cady's sharp but warped intelligence is disturbing to behold the way he obtains Bowden's vacation address is chillingly impressive.  He begins to show up wherever Bowden goes an ominous sarcastic presence to which no objection can be made so long as he stays within the law.  Cady's salient traits are placed before us right from the start of the film.  He is completely callous ignoring the girl who drops her books on the stairs and a nasty sexual predator picking up the waitress in the bowling alley.    Cape Fear is a taut absorbing thriller.  Mitchum's charisma fills the screen and the dark eerie look by Director of Photography Sam Leavitt compounds the feeling of menace.  The incidental music is excellent.    However the film has some implausible ingredients.  Why would a woman who has just been sexually degraded and is clearly traumatised be handed over by the police to the care of a private eye?  Charlie Sievers the gumshoe is played by Telly Savalas  with hair!  Would a criminal attorney really  no matter what the provocation  hire waterfront thugs to beat up a stalker?  How come Sam's gun is still effective after being immersed in the river?  Why doesn't Nancy's phone work?  It is preposterous to suggest that Cady would waste time on the elaborate feint towards Peggy instead of pursuing his real victim.  And how can it be that Cady can defeat three ruffians singlehanded overwhelm a police bodyguard with ease yet fail to defeat Sam even when armed with a stick?Verdict  Allowing for the improbabilities this is a wellmade thriller with a magnificent performance by Mitchum.".

	schema:headline " As Nasty A Creature As Had Ever Been Shown";
	schema:reviewBody "So acclaimed was Robert Mitchum's performance as the amoral animalistic Max Cady it probably escapes most people's attention that Cape Fear was produced by costar Gregory Peck.One film before was the one that united star Gregory Peck with director J. Lee Thompson. That would be The Guns of Navarone which was both a critical and box office success. Thompson and Peck enjoyed working with each other and decided the next film would be light years from The Guns of Navarone.Both Peck and Thompson agreed that this story about a homicidal exconvict terrorizing a man who was a witness against him and his family needed a star of equal stature for the part of the convict as well as the good citizen who Peck was playing. Mitchum was contacted and agreed.I've always felt that it always showed what a class act Gregory Peck was in that even though it was his film and Mitchum got the acclaim for the film Peck never betrayed one hint of jealousy about the plaudits Mitchum got. Max Cady was about as nasty a creature as had ever been shown on screen up to that time. The Production Code was breaking down and Thompson and Peck took great advantage of that. Today it would be nothing but when Cady smeared that egg matter over Polly Bergen's chest it was considered risqu at the time. Polly Bergen was Gregory Peck's wife and Lori Martin his daughter in the film. Other performances of note are of Telly Savalas as a private detective Martin Balsam as the town police chief and Jack Kruschen as Cady's lawyer one bottom feeding shyster. In the remake of Cape Fear which had Nick Nolte as Sam Bowen Peck's part and Robert DeNiro as Cady Both Mitchum and Peck agreed to play some of the minor parts. This time Mitchum was in Balsam's old part as the police chief and Gregory Peck whose most famous role was as Atticus Finch played the bottom feeder. After that remake you could definitely say Peck played the legal profession at both ends.The story of Cape Fear is about an upright moral man not unlike Atticus Finch who has to get down and dirty in order to deal with a totally amoral man who lives by no rules. Kind of like what the western world has to do in dealing with terrorists of all shapes and sizes. Their confrontation on the Cape Fear River where Peck has to catch Mitchum red handed in order to bring him to justice or kill him is one for cinema history.".

It seemed less like Scorsese and more like DePalma.Thompson's original is better  more scary more thrilling more diabolical and realistic. Whereas De Niro's scenerychewing performance in the remake was almost laughable Robert Mitchum's spinetingling turn here as Max Cady is one of the great human movie monsters  he's a demon at spirit no in physicality.He seeks revenge on Gregory Peck and his family after Peck puts him away in jail for a few years.Scorsese's version was more updated and in that sense its general themes were more believable  Cady's psyche was more exposed his violence exploitative  and the romance between Cady and Sam Bowden's daughter in the original is nonexistent. In fact the extent of his harm towards her is when he chases her around an empty school.Still this is a better version of the movie because it has more strengths than the remake. Visually it's not as impressive but it makes more of an impact as a thriller.".

Bergan and Martin are two women I don't see too much in films which is too bad. They did a lot more TV work than movies. Another thing you don't see much anymore  a nice sympathetic policeman  was also portrayed in here nicely by Martin Balsam.The ending has some holes in it to be sure but overall it offers a good 106 minute suspense story.".

Cape Fear should have been named Cape Fear Shudder and Sweat.This is about the last word in stalker movies. More importantly it shows how using less often produces more. Mitchum underplays the stalker role but he also knows how to imply unspeakable evil which is really more effective than blood splatter. It's what's in your imagination that's really scary. Ditto Peck Sam whose onscreen reserve speaks volumes in grim determination he's got to protect his family. Only Bergen as the terrified wife gets to really cut loose. What a firstrate cast plus expert pacing from director Thompson.I guess the movie's moral is that if the law can't protect you you've got to do it yourself. At that primitive level there's no holds barred. So the tension really mounts as we discover Cady's animal cunning is too much for the law or even for hired thugs. In the end then it's going to have to be Cady vs. Sam mano y mano. It's sort of like a modern morality tale of the nuclear family vs. a swamp beast. No doubt about it the movie's a real nailbiter the whole way.".

Brilliant villainy unnerving story and suspense pouring from every frame Cape Fear is an abject lesson in how to produce a quality thriller. Based on a novel called The Executioners written by John D.

Robert Mitchum is Cady a big hulking man with an immoral face he terrifies purely by his undaunted objectives with Mitchum clearly revelling in such a role. As Bowden we have Gregory Peck playing it right as the uptight and stiff lawyer forced to find toughness from within. Backed up by excellent cameos from Martin Balsam Telly Savalas and Polly Bergen Cape Fear also features one of Bernard Herrmann's finest scores a complete and utter nerve shredder that hangs in the ears long after the film has finished. What lifts this above many of its thriller peers is that its dialogue is firmly accentuated by the character portrayals watch as Cady calmly digresses about how he learnt the law in prison or how he seeps with deviant sexual aggression when confronting the Bowden women it's badness personified and literally a force of evil so much so that the breaking of an egg is metaphorically a portent of pain unbound. Director J. Lee Thompson's career shows him to have been a steady if unspectacular director at times but he directs this with no amount of zip and he deftly reins it in for a stifling last quarter at the Cape Fear bayou. Along with his cinematographer Sam Leavitt Thompson expertly uses shadow and light to consistently keep the feeling of dread looming as much of a hostile presence as Bobby Mitchum is throughout the play. By the time the finale reveals its denouement it's hoped that you are as living on your nerves as this particular viewer always is when viewing this clinically sharp piece of thriller cinema. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Former convict Max Cady Robert Mitchum seeks revenge against Sam Bowden Gregory Peck the man whose testimony sent Cady to prison for eight years. But that revenge is not initially physical. Instead it takes the form of intimidation and psychological terror against Bowden's wife Polly Bergen and young daughter Nancy.Cady is a lowlife who hangs out in seedy bars and treats women badly. He smokes cigars and wears a Panama hat. In contrast lawyer Bowden and his goodygoody family live in a big house with a manicured lawn.What's interesting here is that as criminals go Cady is quite smart. His intimidation tactics stay well beyond the law's reach. For example at a boat launch Cady stares lasciviously at Nancy. Bowden notices and in disgust tries to engage Cady in a fight. But Cady refuses noting nearby witnesses who could be called to testify against Bowden the aggressor. And so it goes throughout much of the story wherever Bowden goes Cady is somewhere nearby. He hovers like a hawk over its prey waiting for just the right moment. Cady's terror is what he might do.The last part of the film takes place on or near a houseboat on the Cape Frear River in North Carolina where Bowden's wife and daughter are holed up. Here at night in the midst of wilderness Cady pursues his prey. He's a night stalker or hunter silent like a snake sly ever watchful coldblooded and reptilian. Amid the stillness and dark shadows Cady creeps closer and closer.Bernard Herrmann's eerie background music reminds me of the music in Psycho. Filmed in BW both films use high contrast lighting. The musiclighting combo exudes a high level of tension and suspense.Even though Gregory Peck is the film's protagonist Cape Fear really belongs to Mitchum who gives a very good performance as the villain. Peck's performance is adequate Polly Bergen tries a tad too hard and comes off as melodramatic especially toward the end. The always reliable Martin Balsam shows up in this film as he did in Psycho with a very credible performance as a good guy cop.With great BW cinematography appropriately frenetic Psycholike music effective plot structure and a fine performance by Robert Mitchum Cape Fear is a highly suspenseful film.".

	onyx:emotionText "Former convict Max Cady Robert Mitchum seeks revenge against Sam Bowden Gregory Peck the man whose testimony sent Cady to prison for eight years. But that revenge is not initially physical. Instead it takes the form of intimidation and psychological terror against Bowden's wife Polly Bergen and young daughter Nancy.Cady is a lowlife who hangs out in seedy bars and treats women badly. He smokes cigars and wears a Panama hat. In contrast lawyer Bowden and his goodygoody family live in a big house with a manicured lawn.What's interesting here is that as criminals go Cady is quite smart. His intimidation tactics stay well beyond the law's reach. For example at a boat launch Cady stares lasciviously at Nancy. Bowden notices and in disgust tries to engage Cady in a fight. But Cady refuses noting nearby witnesses who could be called to testify against Bowden the aggressor. And so it goes throughout much of the story wherever Bowden goes Cady is somewhere nearby.

	schema:reviewBody "The original Cape Fear has always been one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Mitchum's sociopathic creepiness is a real powerhouse performance. I was amazed to read under the trivia section here on IMDb that it was a financial failure at the time it was released and caused Gregory Peck's production company to fold. Without any of the tricks used in today's horror films this movie truly frightens. Every time I see it I have a moment where I feel so horribly for anyone who has had to deal with a criminal who they testified against being released from prison. To this day I cannot see Mitchum in any other role without thinking of Max Cady. At one point he silently slips into water and immediately you think of a slithering snake and every fear that comes with imagines associated with snakes floods your mind. His entire character is laid out like an open book in a brilliantly designed opening shot by an extremely simple but utterly effective movement by Mitchum. He is walking up a set of stairs and passes a woman with an armload of books and ever so slightly brushes against her as he passes causing her to spill some books to the floor. Without a glance or a blink or a flinch of any kind he continues up the stairs without breaking a stride. Made even more creepy considering the time the film was made when men would always have stopped to help a lady pick them up. That simple scene brings a sense of foreboding for what is to come. This is a movie I would not watch for the first time alone at night if you are a woman. Absolutely in my top 20 films list.".

Mitchum gives an outstanding performance but the same can not be said of Peck who as someone commented seemed not to be into the story giving a very bland performance curious since this was a particularly good period in his career with his Oscarwinning performance in To Kill a Mockingbid and his role in Guns of Navarone with the same director of this film. I also agree the daughter was miscast. You can't help comparing this film with Scorsese's which has much more depth in character development with bravura direction photography and editing and overall more accomplished in all production aspects except music of course and De Niro's performance in that film while it may be considered overthetop was to me bonechilling. Notwithstanding I prefer the ending in the 1962 version compared to the ludicrous way Scorsese ended his film.".

Gregory Peck's caring and responsible family man plays perfectly against Robert Mitchum's sleazy cigarsmoking prostitutebeating rapist. It would've been nice if Mitchum could've done something like this seven years earlier in Night of the Hunter but I'll gripe about that in its own review. Peck plays one of those heroes that even a villain nut like me can't help but root for and Mitchum couldn't have been a more despicably good villain if he tried.Nearly everything else about this film is perfectly executed. The suspense the relations between the characters the script the believability of the situations and actions and of course the acting...with one rather glaring exception. Where did Lori Martin learn to act? Talk about annoying! No she wasn't bad enough that I didn't care about what would happen to her character but it would've been nice if she had taken a few acting classes before showing up on set. I probably could've given a more believable performance as Gregory Peck's daughter when I was that age. And when I was that age Gregory Peck was eightysix.But in the end the movie came through. If you ask me this not Night of the Hunter is the film Robert Mitchum should be remembered for.

	schema:reviewBody "J. Lee Thompson's blackandwhite revenge thriller is still effective after its debut 45 years ago perhaps even more so today with a growing awareness of sexual predators and child abductions. 'Cape Fear' was a very risqu film for its time receiving numerous edits from the American and British censorship boards and nearly being slapped with an 'X' rating in the United Kingdom. But when all was said and done the material for a good film was there coming down to us with nailbiting suspense for which 'Cape Fear' is known.The adaptation by James Webb of John MacDonald's novel 'The Executioners' was a perfect vehicle for all involved. J. Lee Thompson recently off an Oscar nomination for 'The Guns of Navarone' was still very much within his element after a series of British realist dramas that included 'North West Frontier' and 'Tiger Bay.' Robert Mitchum one of the more underrated strongmen in film history was physically and temperamentally ideal as Max Cady and Gregory Peck eased into the Sam Bowden mix of family man and protector. Peck actually teamed with Universal Pictures to make 'Cape Fear' the entire cast and crew was handpicked resulting in this vintage gem.'Cape Fear' boasts a plot that was extraordinary for its time and has been copied repeatedly. The story follows a Savannah layer named Sam Bowden Peck who is visited by Max Cady Mitchum an imposing man whom Bowden testified against in a Baltimore trial. Cady was sent to jail for raping a woman and eight years removed from entering prison he vows to make Bowden pay for his civic duty. He turns the Bowden family's life into Hell on Earth following Sam his wife Peg Polly Bergen and adolescent daughter Nancy Lori Martin around town. Along the way he fatally poisons their dog and rapes a newcomer to Savannah Diane Taylor Barrie Chase.Sam Bowden a man of law and order uses every legal tactic within his reach to drive Cady out of town. With help from police chief Mark Dutton Martin Balsam and a private detective named Charlie Seavers Telly Savalas he tries to drum up pretentious charges. Cady however has learned a great deal about the justice system while in prison rambling off statute effortlessly. Bowden grows desperate soon offering Cady hard dollars in exchange for leaving his family alone hiring a band of enforcers to rough him up and even considering murder. To make matters worse Sam discovers that Cady is the lowest of all sexual predators targeting his young daughter.Shocking in 1962 'Cape Fear' is no less effective today in an age of Megan's Law and Amber Alerts. The social landscape has changed since this film was made  laws have been passed in an effort to restrict the movement of sex offenders  but the Bowdens an ordinary family in an extraordinary situation a la Hitchcock are still easy to associate with. The danger that Cady brings is excruciating and he also reveals the failures of law enforcement with his own disgusting brand of irony.As J. Lee Thompson has said Max Cady is the focal character a sarcastic man with visibly bad intentions. Robert Mitchum who is listed as 6' 1 in height is such a dominant force both physically and emotionally that he seems closer to 6' 5 or 6' 6. Because of this Sam Bowden comes across as quite ordinary although Gregory Peck's character takes on a bold dimension in the final halfhour. The film could not have managed without an excellent supporting cast and everyone delivers. Martin Balsam is quietly superb as usual Telly Savalas does well as a slick private eye and the portrayals of Bowden's family by Polly Bergan and Lori Martin fit like neat pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Jack Kruschen as Dave Grafton Cady's lawyer and Barrie Chase are not asked for very much but help in spurring the plot.Cinematographer Samuel Leavitt 'Anatomy of a Murder' 'Exodus' uses black and white filming techniques that give 'Cape Fear' a sinister edge not attainable in color. Part of what makes 'Cape' such an effective story is its use of shadow and the 'bare bones' feeling that is common in film noir. In the early 21st century this film takes on an added gloominess seeming to come from an innocent bygone world and yet shattering our illusions. George Tomasini an editor for several of Hitchcock's films including 'North by Northwest' and 'Psycho' is a major complement to Thompson's wellpaced direction. 'Cape Fear' is also not complete without the score of Bernard Herrmann another Hitchcock regular. Writing on the orchestral scale of 50 years ago Herrmann's music is notable for its use of ponderous strings and explosive brass. The score in fact was used almost verbatim in Martin Scorcese's 1991 remake.Largely a potboiler 'Cape Fear' has its flaws. There are plot holes such as the willingness of Dutton to bend laws for Bowden's sake and implausibility such as how easily Cady pushes around the band of enforcers hired by Sam. The final scene taking place between a swamp house and houseboat is confusing at first and Sam swims downstream rather quickly to catch up with the villain. The circa1960 attitudes towards violence against women are also painfully outdated. But none of this takes away from the core storyline a twisted one for all times.Universal has given 'Cape Fear' elite treatment on its DVD offering anamorphic widescreen presentation with English captioning for the hearing impaired and subtitles in Spanish and French. The disc is chock full of bonus material that includes interviews with Peck and Thompson photographs posters and the theatrical trailer. Peck and Thompson offer some fascinating insights including censorship of the film and the original plan to cast Hayley Mills as Nancy. Bernard Herrmann's music is used throughout. The film itself is presented with clean visuals and Dolbyenhanced sound.  out of 4".

	schema:reviewBody "In this film a convicted rapist Robert Mitchum goes after the lawyer who testified against him Gregory Peck and his family.This is pure horror at its finest. All of the performers here are what really make this one work which is usually the key to making a movie work. So let's start off with that.Martin Balsam is great as the Captain of the Police Mark Dutton who tries to help Peck's character. Lori Martin is wonderful as Nancy Bowden the real victim in this movie. She plays the little girl part well without it being overthetop and annoying. Polly Bergen is wonderful as Peggy Bowden Peck's wife in the film who tries to convince him to not resort to murder.But of course no one shines more here than our two leading men Mitchum and Peck. As he has proved in The Night of the Hunter he truly plays the bad guy well and he is completely convincing. As for Peck The same year this was released another very important film in Peck's career came out and it is perhaps his most famous role I'm talking about To Kill a Mockingbird. Once again he plays a lawyer here and he really knows how to play the good guy because in the end you want him to win.The story itself is quite scary but the scariest scene in the movie is when Cady moves in on Nancy towards the end. By this point we've seen what Cady can do and because of this we are scared for Nancy. After all she's just a little girl. Mitchum himself looked very intimidating I can see why Peck wanted him to play the part.Now usually I mention how some movies got a treatment that I despise the remake. This film got that treatment as well and usually I avoid the remake. But I've heard quite a few good things about the remake. First off it's got Martin Scorsese as the director which is almost always a good thing. Secondly you've got Robert De Niro as the bad guy who has acted in many of Scorsese's films Mean Streets Taxi Driver New York New York Raging Bull The King of Comedy and Goodfellas before this role. Third if the stars of the original appear in the remake you know it's a decent remake. So I say if you feel like it go check it out. I might.All in all a really good movie. I only wish that I could give it a 1010 but I can't because the ending was a bit abrupt. So a 910 from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Interestingly considering how tame it appears in direct comparison to Martin Scorsese's remake this film was considered a particularly amoral and brutal affair back in 1962. It may be difficult for audiences now to understand this but if you watch the original Cape Fear and keep in mind its historical context it isn't really that surprising that it met with a howl of outrage. The central problem was the continual threat of sexual violence posed by the character Max Cady. This sadistic psycho constantly goads his nemesis Sam Bowden with the implied but very clear threat of rape directed at Bowden's wife and daughter. The latter is 12 years old. So it isn't too difficult to see how this caused a lot of consternation back on original release. The emphasis on this uncomfortable theme made the original Cape Fear a somewhat transgressive film. And when a film is transgressive in its depiction of social reality history has shown that it usually finds itself in a bit of bother.Unlike in Scorsese's remake the Bowden family here are the epitome of normality. They are thoroughly idealised with patriarch Sam Bowden given an unambiguous upstanding morality by Gregory Peck. This means that there are clear black and white moral certainties here where the remake operated in shades of grey where the psychopath was something of a catalyst for the problems inherent in the troubled family unit. I guess the two movies show not only the shift in screen violence in the intervening years but also the more complex and ambiguous way that families were depicted too.The original is certainly a very good thriller. Robert Mitchum is really the key screen presence here. He effectively plays a very transgressive character essentially a rapist and paedophile. His Max Cady certainly carries a genuine threat its a very good performance. Also of note is the excellent score by the extremely dependable Bernard Herrmann. It was more or less covered for the remake so that tells you all you need to know about its timelessness. Herrmann proved himself with this and the Psycho and Taxi Driver soundtracks that he was a master at menacing film music. Finally director J. Lee Thompson needs to be given a fair bit of credit too for putting together such a direct and gutsy thriller in the first place. I think both versions of Cape Fear work very well together as they really come at the audience from quite different angles while essentially being the same basic narrative. As much as I respect Scorsese I sometimes think that this older flick is the more consistently enjoyable film though.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Original Cape Fear where to start with this classic noir film? First of all let me preface this review by stating  if you came here looking for a compare and contrast job between this and the 1991 Cape Fear with Nick Nolte and Robert De Niro you have come to the wrong place. Now that I have that off my chest let us begin.The plot consists of a southern lawyer Sam Bowden Peck being visited by a felon he helped put away eight years ago Max Cady Mitchum. Following the initial reintroduction Cady begins to slowly and deliberately annoy and harass Bowden and his family. As the film progresses this harassment turns more and more dangerous as Cady first targets the family dog and then takes an interest in Bowden's young teenage Daughter Nancy Lori Martin. We see a man of the law Bowden confronted with the limitations of that law despite his friendship with the police department. This film is visually stunning shot in classic black and white with a haunting tension filled score that scares the bejesus out of you. You feel the growing desperation of Bowden as Cady skates at the edge of the law and forces Bowden to the other side of the law. Just how far is Bowden willing to compromise his principles to protect his family. You can't really help but put yourself in the same situation while watching the film and wondering what you would do.The whole cast of this film is fabulous. Peck's portrayal of Bowden as the anitAtticus Finch is great but not as great as Mitchum who steals the movie as the increasingly creepy and lecherous Max Cady. His portrayal is even more amazing when you consider what sensors would allow to be seen when this film was made. Mitchum imparts more meaning out of a leer and tip of his hat than many modern films can with crazy CGI effects. The supporting cast is rock solid as well Martin Balsam is great as the Police Chief Mark Dutton and Telly Savalas is outstanding as Private investigator Charles Sievers even if he does not have a lollypop. The level of fear and uneasy sexual tension in this film will have you on the edge of the couch. I highly recommend seeing this film if you haven't in the past or revisiting it as it never gets stale. This is what great film noir is all about.".

	schema:reviewBody "J Lee Thompson's Cape Fear is an account of a straightforward battle between good and evil. Good is represented by Sam Bowden Gregory Peck who is both a respectable lawyer and a decent family man. Max Cady Robert Mitchum on the other hand is an evil psychopathic rapist who having spent eight years in prison comes to Bowden's neighbourhood to terrorise him and his family because Bowden had previously given testimony in the court case which led to Cady's incarceration.Initially it appears that Bowden is in a very strong position to counter the threat from Cady because he has a long established friendship with the local police chief Mark Dutton Martin Balsam. Dutton is sympathetic to Bowden's plight and comes up with some useful ideas for getting rid of Cady. These ideas are unsuccessful however because what Bowden and Dutton don't realise is just how methodically Cady has been planning his revenge and how well he is able to anticipate what actions the police are likely to take. Being the honest law abiding man that he is Bowden makes every attempt to deal with Cady's threats by legal means but when none of them work in desperation he eventually takes a more unorthodox course of action which leads to him being threatened with being disbarred. Events come to a head and are ultimately resolved only after a long and hard physical battle between the two men.An excellent script by James R Webb and some intelligent direction from J Lee Thompson combine to provide increasing pace and suspense as Cady moves from implied levels of intimidation through psychological pressure all the way up to very serious physical threats. The tension and drama are also brilliantly enhanced by Bernard Herrmann's excellent score. Peck and Balsam are thoroughly convincing in their roles but are inevitably outshone by a truly exceptional performance by Robert Mitchum. His portrayal of a character who is a thoroughly debased violent monster is genuinely scary and a remarkable achievement considering the strict standards of censorship which prevailed at the time.".

	schema:headline " Haunting is the only way to describe the melancholic film Gloomy Sunday.";
	schema:reviewBody "The adultorientated film explores such heavy issues as love jealousy hatred and betrayal in a graphic way that leaves the viewer reeling for hours afterwards. The German film with English subtitles begins in modern times at a Budapest restaurant where an elderly couple are enjoying a meal to celebrate the man's 80th birthday. He asks for the musicians to play that famous song' as he focuses on a photograph of a beautiful young woman at the piano. As the violin plays the notes of Gloomy Sunday he keels over and dies. What follows is not so much a whodunit' but who died and why. The audience is taken to prewar Budapest restaurant owned by Lszl Szab Joachim Krl a Jew and his waitress and sometimes girlfriend Ilona Varni Erika Marozn. As the story unfolds the audience is introduced to the pianist Andrs Aradi Stefana Dionisi who falls for Ilona and composes the haunting Gloomy Sunday in her honour. A German industrialist Hans Eberhard Wieker Ben Becker becomes a regular at the restaurant and he too falls for Ilona's charms. As the film progresses and the men are vying for Ilona's affections the song is recorded and sweeps the world. So heartbreaking is the song that more than one hundred people commit suicide while listening to it on their gramaphone. Some of these suicides are shown on screen. As World War II breaks out Wieker becomes a colonel in the German army and has a power over the other two men that ultimately leads to disaster for all involved. From a production point of view Gloomy Sunday cannot be faulted with authentic locales clothes and music. Gloomy Sunday is a complex story that deals with the depravity of man and its disastrous effects as the three male leads share one women. Set against the backdrop of the holocaust there are elements of Schindler's List and a tone that matches Jane Campion's The Piano. Definitely an adult movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "The adultorientated film explores such heavy issues as love jealousy hatred and betrayal in a graphic way that leaves the viewer reeling for hours afterwards. The German film with English subtitles begins in modern times at a Budapest restaurant where an elderly couple are enjoying a meal to celebrate the man's 80th birthday. He asks for the musicians to play that famous song' as he focuses on a photograph of a beautiful young woman at the piano. As the violin plays the notes of Gloomy Sunday he keels over and dies. What follows is not so much a whodunit' but who died and why. The audience is taken to prewar Budapest restaurant owned by Lszl Szab Joachim Krl a Jew and his waitress and sometimes girlfriend Ilona Varni Erika Marozn. As the story unfolds the audience is introduced to the pianist Andrs Aradi Stefana Dionisi who falls for Ilona and composes the haunting Gloomy Sunday in her honour. A German industrialist Hans Eberhard Wieker Ben Becker becomes a regular at the restaurant and he too falls for Ilona's charms. As the film progresses and the men are vying for Ilona's affections the song is recorded and sweeps the world. So heartbreaking is the song that more than one hundred people commit suicide while listening to it on their gramaphone. Some of these suicides are shown on screen. As World War II breaks out Wieker becomes a colonel in the German army and has a power over the other two men that ultimately leads to disaster for all involved. From a production point of view Gloomy Sunday cannot be faulted with authentic locales clothes and music. Gloomy Sunday is a complex story that deals with the depravity of man and its disastrous effects as the three male leads share one women. Set against the backdrop of the holocaust there are elements of Schindler's List and a tone that matches Jane Campion's The Piano. Definitely an adult movie.";

Unfortunately the good times do come to an end when the Nazis sweep into Hungary and decide forthwith to eliminate the Jewish population.Strange as it may seem the whole theme of the film revolves around a plaintive tune which first gained popularity in Budapest later in Europe and then the whole world.  The words to the song called Gloomy Sunday are full of despair.The clients who came to the restaurant always asked for this particular melody to be played on the grand piano.  It is played many times during the film. It is haunting and addictive.  We find ourselves wanting to hear it again and again such is its hypnotic power.All praise to Erika Marozsan who provides the romantic interest as Ilona in the story.  I am told she is a newcomer to the screen but as an actor she will surely be much sought after in the future.  She is beautiful and her closeups full of feeling.  She has lovely hands that caress a lover's face with such gentle charm.  She is much admired by Lazlo Joachim Krol owner of the restaurant and also by Andras Stefano Dionisi newly appointed pianist and composer of Gloomy Sunday.All goes well for the threesome until the arrival of a Nazi officer Ben Becker who takes a fancy to Ilona despite her constant rebuttals. In their position of power Nazis have the means of disposing of people who stand in their way.This is a film of contrasts.  First we have the beautiful setting which is Budapest romantic songs and people in love.  Then we have the Nazi occupation loss of freedom and threats of Auschwitz.This film must be seen to the end.  There is an amazing twist of Fate in the last few minutes and it seems to me that at last in some remarkable way justice is seen to be done.".

For another you may or may not believe that a song could drive people to suicide but you must admit it is a beautiful sad and haunting melody. The story held my interest as did the characters. The other obvious appeal was the opportunity to gaze endlessly at the incredibly lovely and angelic Erika Marozsn. I am female and straight and I could not get enough of looking at her I could easily believe that she might inspire a piece of music that conveyed its composer's hopeless longing for her. And he wasn't so hard to look at himself! The only thing I couldn't figure out about Mr. Simpson's comments was what the film had to do with New Zealand. Now I know nothing! According to the Los Angeles Times review of this film The song was actually composed in 1935 by Rezs Seress with lyrics by Lszl Jvor and did in fact accompany a number of suicides as Europe grew darker Billie Holliday recorded a popular American version. So I guess it's not so farfetched after all! Who knew?".

To my surprise I found that I had actually enjoyed the movie. My expectations were low only because I didn't have a clue as to what to expect but I'm very happy I saw this film. It's one of the best films I've seen so far this year. The movie is about a few things. One of it's main storylines concerns a love triangle concerning Laszlo Joachim Krol Ilona Erika Marazan and Andras Stefano Dionisi. Laszlo owns a restaurant and Ilona is his girlfriend. Laszlo is hoping to have some music in his restaurant and hires a piano player Andras. Andras likes Ilona. And Ilona it seems likes Andras. So he movie it seems will be a love story set during the beginning of WW2. But there's also another story building. Andras has written a song called Gloomy Sunday. He has written for Ilona. But soon the song becomes a hit. It's a beautiful song that seems to have a very strange effect on whoever listens to it. Soon afterwards people are committing suicide. And here we have a case of fact stranger than fiction. For it is this part of the story that is actually true. Gloomy Sunday is based on this story with the love theme used as a backdrop. I don't know if or when this movie will be wider release in North America. But I hope people will go see this movie. In fact though I doubt that people from this country have even heard of this movie. Here is a movie that NEEDS to be better known. It is a small gem.  out of   or a 710.".

	schema:headline " A triangle of love in the time of the Nazis";
	schema:reviewBody "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.This is the kind of movie that brings to us a deep and abiding sadness that ultimately results in what the Greek tragedians called catharsis. Set in Budapest just before and during World War II we see the tragedy that engulfed Europe played out in a triangle of love involving a Jewish restaurateur Laszlo Joachim Krol a brilliant young pianist Andras Stefano Dionisi and a beautiful waitress Ilone Ericka Marozsan. That triangle is besieged by an outsider who is the antithesis of all that love should be. He is Hans Wieck BenBecker a German Nazi.Ericka Marozsan who plays the waitress Ilone is strikingly beautiful and sweetly and irresistibly charming as she must be since the two men agree to share her. They can't help themselves and in differing ways she loves them both. Whom she doesn't love is Hans Wieck.Like so many movies set during this most shameful time for Europe and much of humankind in general there is something close to an idyllic scene before the deluge and then it all come apart in the most horrific way with the cattle cars and the mindless brutality of genocide and war. And yet there were those who endured signified in the movie as Ilone puts it aprs le deluge nouswhich is a play on the words of France's Louis XV who supposed said in the face of revolution  aprs moi le deluge meaning after they kill me the flood.This is an almost totally irrelevant aside but as I looked up the Louis XV quote I ran across a surprising but strangely apt usage of the phrase by Roger Bannister the first person to break the four minute barrier in the mile race. He is quoted as saying aprs moi le deluge meaning in his case after I break four minute mile barrier there will be many others. He was right. The plot revolves around a song Gloomy Sunday composed by the piano player. The song is sadly beautiful and for some people the effect is so intense that they kill themselves.Now to a kind of explication of the story from the point of view of who got what and what the moral or existential lesson of the movie might be.The film begins in the present. We see a maitre d' of a restaurant in Budapestor perhaps he is the ownerawaiting an important party that will dine at his restaurant. They arrive. They are German. They dine. The song is played and the important man who had been there many years before during the war falls dead. We don't know it but he is the last victim of the song and he is the exNazi Hans now a very successful business man. The maitre d' is the son of the beautiful waitress. But we don't know that yet. This is the kind of film that when it is over you will want to go back and see the initial scene again. When you do you will realize that it wasn't the song that killed him. The only way most people will realize that is to see the opening scene again. If you missed it don't feel bad. I didn't even get it completely until just few moments ago.Who got what? The evil Nazi who betrayed a friend and forced himself upon a woman he supposed loved and then betrayed her became rich successful and lived into his eighties. The brilliant composer died by his own hand ironically with the gun of the Nazi oppressor. The Jewish restaurateur who is a wise and deeply loving man is sent away on a cattle car and is never heard from again. Ilone is given the restaurant and bears a son. There is some ambiguity about who the father might be. He could be any of the three men. Since the way the scenes are ordered forcing us to see her pregnant at the grave of the young composer yet only after she has been forced into intercourse by the Nazi we are uncertain. The cinematic timing would suggest Hans but what she says to the grave of the composer suggests the child is his. However when we see in retrospect in the first scene of the movie the man identified as her son the maitre d' it is clear that the restaurateur is the father.So who triumphs? Nobody of course. The seduction of Europe by fascism was a great tragedy for Europe. Ilone survives and the restaurateur survives in the person of his son. Again what is the message? And I think the answer is there is no message there is no contrived or ordered moral to the story. There are only the blunt and mindless facts of what happened to these people and to Europe leading to a sense of the melancholy mystery of life for which we have no answer.Ericka Marozsan is my new true love. She is talented captivating sensuous smooth and very winning. She is a bit too beautiful for these old eyes to bear. It is funny that I had never seen her before but she plays mostly in Hungarian productions.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gloomy Sunday  Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod directed by Rolf Schbel in 1999 is a romantic absorbing beautiful and heartbreaking movie. It started like Jules and Jim it ended as one of Agatha Christie's books and in between it said something about love friendship devotion jealousy war Holocaust dignity and betrayal and it did better than The Black Book which is much more popular. It is not perfect and it made me a cynic wonder in the end on the complexity of the relationships and sensational revelations and who is who to whom but the movie simply overwhelmed me. Perfect or not it is unforgettable. All four actors as the parts of the tragic not even a triangle but a rectangle were terrific. I do believe that three men could fell deeply for one girl as beautiful and dignified as Ilona in a starmaking performance by young Hungarian actress Erica Marozsn and who would not? The titular song is haunting sad and beautiful and no doubt deserves the movie been made about it and its effect on the countless listeners. I love the movie and I am surprised that it is so little known in this country. It is a gem.The fact that it is based on a story of the song that had played such important role in the lives of all characters made me do some research and the real story behind the song of Love and Death seems as fascinating as the fictional one. The song was composed in 1930s by Rezs Seress and was believed to have caused many suicides in Hungary and all over Europe as the world was moving toward the most devastating War of the last century. Rezs Seress a JewishHungarian pianist and composer was thrown to the Concentration Camp but survived unlike his mother. In January 1968 Seress committed suicide in Budapest by jumping out of a window. According to his obituary in the New York Times Mr. Seres complained that the success of Gloomy Sunday actually increased his unhappiness because he knew he would never be able to write a second hit. Many singers from all over the world have recorded their versions of the songs in different languages. Over 70 performers have covered the song since 1935 and some famous names include Billie Holiday Paul Robeson Pyotr Leschenko in Russian under title Mratschnoje Woskresenje Bjork Sarah McLachlan and many more. The one that really got to me and made me shiver is by Diamanda Gals the Greek born American singerpianistperformer with the voice of such tragic power that I still can't get over her singing. Gals has been described as capable of the most unnerving vocal terror and in her work she mostly concentrates on the topics of suffering despair condemnation injustice and loss of dignity. When she sings the Song of Love and Death her voice that could've belonged to the most tragic heroines of Ancient Greece leaves no hope and brings the horror and grief of love lost forever to the unbearable and incomparable heights.8.510".

The background for all this is the 30s and 40s in Budapest Hungary the Nazi threat right before your entrance door.You might argue that the song itself isn't as powerful as you might expect it. All right. But the script is superb a story that could really have happened like this a narrative that doesn't bore you and develops it's characters properly so you understand them. Without inflating them to some unrealistic capsules. The figures aren't painted black and white there is the grey you usually find in real life. The performances of the main actors are superb. Thinking of Ben Becker and Joachim Krl this isn't a surprise. But also Erika Marozn and Stefano Dionisi which I haven't seen in another movie before do everything to grant them an Academy Award.Maybe I can't express my admiration properly in English which is a foreign language for me but if anything I wrote gave you the idea that the movie might be interesting ... give it a try!".

It is a poor imitation of the great movies of Istvn Szab  like Sunshine in this subject and genre. The basic tone of the plot is far too sentimental the protagonists  show no or little personal improvement they are just being dragged powerlessly by the stream of  events and are locked into their own prison. The pictured love triangle or quadrant??? is very unlikely to happen. The only reason I watched the movie from the beginning to end was the fascinating beauty and magic acting of Erika Marozsn Ilona. The truly great  scene was when she started singing the title song at the piano just before the suicide of Andrs.I don't think that younger audience or people not familiar with Hungary at WWII would get from this film a realistic picture of the time and place.Ivan Fenyves Johannesburg South Africa".

The worse part of the film were the characters who I couldn't identify with or hold sympathy for any of them.

I thought the most despicable character was Ilona who expects the world to revolve around her fingers selfabsorbed manipulative depraved and unadaptable. At least Andre had some sort of conscience and killed himself knowing that his music caused suffering instead of getting rich off dead people unlike Laslo. It was war people Jews Poles Gypsies etc. where being hauled off in cattle trains by the minute Nazis shoot people as sport and seize control of government homes businesses and yet a menage a trois was living a happy dissolute life because they have each other... that's suppose to be touching?!

The Americans just know how to entertain whereas the German actors even the so called good actors always look clumsy and helpless when they act. I can't think of any German actor that could probably deliver the same performance like the top American actors. Please don't get me wrong There are some good German films Das Boot Sophie Scholl but usually they have to do with WW II and then it's very often not the actors that make the movie interesting but rather the plot which is so good that even German actors can't mess it up. There are very many bad American films too but still even bad American movies have sometimes very fine actors in it. Anyway regarding GLOOMY Sunday Krol doesn't deliver a convincing performance he just knows how to look sad and happy at the same time. The pathos and melodrama was overdone and the news reel about the people that committed suicide because of the song just made me laugh. Ben Becker displays no passion for his role he just blurts out the lines of his script and intermittently he tries to look the mean Nazi which doesn't work either. The song of gloomy Sunday is played far too often throughout the movie I almost had the impression that the director thought every time that he discovered a whole in the plot Oh no problem we'll just play the theme song again. The ending was ridiculous too and had a very controversial message It says that revenge is OK and that Eichmann deserved to die an eye for an eye and all that BS. You should watch Dead Man walking instead. So hopefully we'll be getting some better German movies in the future I still can't believe that people wasted their money on this one.

	schema:reviewBody "Contains minor spoilers Well as you can see in the trivia the film has been playing at the Arts Center Academy Cinema in Chch NZ for the past 5 years. I live in Chch NZ and went to see it yesterday in this very cinema. Cinema well it's actually a black room with 11 seats 2 speakers and a 60 inch screen and a small caf outside of it. Going 5 years and still going apparently...Now I'm no drama lover. Gimme action horror scifi any day. Anything with sex and violence and explosions are good. So I had reservations about seeing this. But wow I must say this is a contemporary classic. It's the sort of film they must be showing film students in Germany since the film is in German with subtitles.The 4 main characters are Laszlow restaurant manager Ilona Waitress Andras Composer and Hans Nazi corporal. It's set in Nazi occupied Hungary during the time Hitler was effecting his 'final solution'. The title 'Gloomy Sunday' comes from the song the composer writes which gains him notoriety and attracts attention to the Jewish restaurant. The film is largely about the love triangle between Andras Ilona and Laslow. At least until Hans returns half way through the film.The character of Hans appears initially as a lonely rejected young German man who after being rejected by Ilona comes back years later a changed man a Nazi colonel on charge of the rounding up of Jews in his area. He turns out to be one of the films most 'important' characters. I won't give away the ending.So all in all there's romance there's some comedy there's mystery and it's all tied in with the Nazi's 'final solution'. After you finish the film you walk away feeling the film is very thought provoking... still thinking about each of the characters and how they changed during the course of the film. It's also worth noting too that this is not an 'artsy fartsy' film. The dialouge is simple and the story is easy to follow. WHich is appreciated since I don't speak German and was reading subtitles.So anyway if you don't like dramas but you do like a genuinely good movie then give this one a try.".

With the menage a trois the film has some of the giddiness of Jules and Jim but at the same time strongly recalls for me the novels of Alan Furth set in the same period.  I came across the film when I was researching the work of Joachim Krol a secondary character in Tom Tykwer's Princess and the Warrior and Inspector Brunetti in the four   madeforGermantelevision movies based on Donna Leon's detective stories.  As Laszlo a businessman restauranteurromantic with a generous heart Krol again shows his vulnerability and sense of fatality.  Erika Marozan is wonderfully attractive one sees why the restaurant owner and the pianist both fall for her as does Ben Becker as the German businessman initially hapless and despairing later in uniform with a confusion of feelings between tenderness and ruthless exploitation.The German DVD of the film offers no subtitles in any language which is frustrating for a nonnative speaker.  Interviews with the actors and director are entertaining.  Krol is just as thoughtful and sensitive as the character he plays. Both Erika Marozan Hungarian and Stefano Dionisi Italian speak in English the contrast between their contemporary selves and the vivid delicately shaded characters they play reminds us how well written and directed the film is.  Among the extras on the DVD is a half hour program on the tune in the title  Gloomy Sunday.  The program opens with a languid despairing recording of the song by Billy Holiday nothing short of electrifying.  The tune is authentic it was written in Budapest at that period and in fact it was associated with love suicides first in Budapest and then later abroad a powerful plot element here and emphasized in a newsreel that the pianistcomposer  watches with profound unease.  Hungarian authorities formally prohibited the playing of it for decades.  Sinead O'Connor is one of the more than 30 artists who have recorded itThe characters linger in the mind and I puzzle at the plot elements.  The contemporary epilogue set in the same restaurant deliberately recalls the flow of certain events of more than half a century earlier.  There is a profoundly satisfying twist at the end that leads one to question in retrospect identities relationships and outcomes both for the survivors and for those who perished.".

	schema:headline " Exquisitely sad and yet uplifting!";
	schema:reviewBody "Gloomy Sunday A song of Love and Death is one of my very favorite Hungarian films although it is actually a German film shot in Budapest with an international cast. One winning point is the astounding beauty of Armenian Hungarian actress Erika Marozsan but it is the story itself and the unforgettable music that makes the picture into an instant classic.  In prewar Hungary with Fascism on the rise the beautifully sad hit song Szomor Vasrnap made such an impact that many love lorn young women were said to have committed suicide listening to it. It was translated into many languages and recorded by the cream of international vocalists among them American jazz legend Billy Holiday.In the film directed with unerring savvy by German Rolf Schbel and set entirely in recognizable central Budapest locations the story follows three men who are in love with a most enticingly beautiful waitress an intellectual restaurant owner a mysterious musician and a German businessman taking place during the thirties leading up to the war and the holocaust.The Jewish restaurant owner is played by German actor Joachim Krl the Hungarian pianist composer of the restaurant by Italian actor Stefano Dionisi and a German businessman later a Wehrmacht officer by top notch German actor Ben Becker. The enticing love object of all three simultaneously is the beautiful Hungarian waitress played by a new Hungarian actress Erika Marozsn.The pianist is a stand in for Rezs Seress the actual composer of the haunting melody that would become known as the Hungarian suicide song. Seress worked most of his life as a restaurant pianist in Budapest but achieved everlasting fame with this one song.In the film the pianist and the owner both share Marozsan's affection in a loose triangle reminiscent of Truffaut's Jules and Jim but this is soon complicated with the arrival on the scene of a wealthy German businessman Ben Becker who also falls for her hook line and sinker  who wouldn't. The triangle now has an extra angle which the scrumptious waitress simply takes in stride.When the war breaks out Becker goes back to Germany and becomes a highranking officer. He returns to war beleaguered Budapest imposes himself on the beauteous waitress and saves some Jews from deportation but only to serve his own purposes. The song of love and despair hovers in the air.For a German to take up such an essentially Hungarian subject and handle it with such finesse is an accomplishment in itself.The result is simply exquisite. Lush cinematography by ace Polish cameraman Edward Klosinski makes the film as lovely to look at as the music is lovely to hear. An undeniably sad story so deftly handled that it becomes an uplifting cinema experience.".

One winning point is the astounding beauty of Armenian Hungarian actress Erika Marozsan but it is the story itself and the unforgettable music that makes the picture into an instant classic.  In prewar Hungary with Fascism on the rise the beautifully sad hit song Szomor Vasrnap made such an impact that many love lorn young women were said to have committed suicide listening to it. It was translated into many languages and recorded by the cream of international vocalists among them American jazz legend Billy Holiday.In the film directed with unerring savvy by German Rolf Schbel and set entirely in recognizable central Budapest locations the story follows three men who are in love with a most enticingly beautiful waitress an intellectual restaurant owner a mysterious musician and a German businessman taking place during the thirties leading up to the war and the holocaust.The Jewish restaurant owner is played by German actor Joachim Krl the Hungarian pianist composer of the restaurant by Italian actor Stefano Dionisi and a German businessman later a Wehrmacht officer by top notch German actor Ben Becker. The enticing love object of all three simultaneously is the beautiful Hungarian waitress played by a new Hungarian actress Erika Marozsn.The pianist is a stand in for Rezs Seress the actual composer of the haunting melody that would become known as the Hungarian suicide song. Seress worked most of his life as a restaurant pianist in Budapest but achieved everlasting fame with this one song.In the film the pianist and the owner both share Marozsan's affection in a loose triangle reminiscent of Truffaut's Jules and Jim but this is soon complicated with the arrival on the scene of a wealthy German businessman Ben Becker who also falls for her hook line and sinker  who wouldn't. The triangle now has an extra angle which the scrumptious waitress simply takes in stride.When the war breaks out Becker goes back to Germany and becomes a highranking officer. He returns to war beleaguered Budapest imposes himself on the beauteous waitress and saves some Jews from deportation but only to serve his own purposes. The song of love and despair hovers in the air.For a German to take up such an essentially Hungarian subject and handle it with such finesse is an accomplishment in itself.The result is simply exquisite. Lush cinematography by ace Polish cameraman Edward Klosinski makes the film as lovely to look at as the music is lovely to hear. An undeniably sad story so deftly handled that it becomes an uplifting cinema experience.";

	schema:reviewBody "So here we have our first Warhammer 40000 movie.Immediately there are some flaws that need to be addressed Codex Pictures the company responsible have created this movie out of nothing less than a love of the background. While this is not a problem and you can tell that they're not about to make any mistakes with the lore this does mean that they've done it out of their own pocket. Games Workshop who own Warhammer 40000 did not put any money into the movie! What we're left with is a CGI movie which suffers from bad CGI in many places. At worst this can mean that shots look like they're from ancient video games Ages of Empires I's cutscenes spring to mind. At best which seems to be just as frequent the shots are actually quite stunning. Mostly it averages between the two.There you have the first fault the second is camerawork. Yet again this is variable and at the start of the film I thought it was awesome. However as the film progressed I felt that the camera shots managed to spot and point out the bad CGI. And while the beginning is strong in this film the middle seems to hold on to lingering camera shots just a little too much. This I fear is the reason a lot of the action is not quite as exciting as in the beginning. That and a lack of the mighty soundtrack to accompany these scenes.Now before I commence with the good I must address that this film is for fans of 40k. An ingrained knowledge of the background and understanding of Space Marines and Chaos is required to get full enjoyment out of the movie. It is not to say that you won't find it entertaining as a newcomer but you may find certain mannerisms of the protagonists strange or not understand what an astropath is or find it difficult to believe that this elite squad is after a relic that happens to be a book... the list goes on.Warhammer 40000 is an established background which started rooting itself in '87. No exceptions are made to explain it's immensely vast background in this movie. As a matter of fact it focuses on relatively little when you look at ALL of the other things that didn't make it into this movie.Now for the goodThe first thing that springs to mind is the Story. Given reign over the script for the first 40k film is top 40k novelist Dan Abnett. He delivers. Whenever there wasn't enough happening a timely line would add depth humour or character to the film keeping my interest throughout. It's great how the soldiers who refer to themselves as brothers feel like a brotherhood and that each character acts as an individual though it may be a little hard to tell more than four apart when they don helmets with their own personalities and motivations.The plot is pretty strong for a 70minute flick. As far as I could see there were no plot holes and as far as plots go this one seems straight forward but still manages to pack a few surprises.Next for kudos is the soundtrack. Though tastes may dictate whether or not you like this soundtrack it is very appropriate for the movie. The kind of Latin chant is very fitting for Astartes warriors and their monasticmilitant lifestyles. The sound of these chants are very strong and evoke powerful emotion. The opening scene aboard the Ultramarines' Strike Cruiser is a high example of this and is used well to implement the action and dialogue.Thirdly comes the voice actors. These voice actors are brilliant and fill the boots of Astartes perfectly. Though you may prefer the baritone thunder of THQ's Space Marines in Dawn of War II the voices chosen make characters more distinguishable and less like generic action heroes.Lastly a mention goes to all the parts in this movie that rang true to fans like me. With any other company such a movie would look a hundred times better but would be at massive risk of not being true to the lore. We've seen it a million times before it's just good to see it done right.Overall the film starts strong wavers in the middle and builds again in momentum near the end. It isn't perfect but with all considerations on the table  it's good  710.A Final Note If you love Warhammer 40000 and want to see better movies in future go and buy this. Buy it for you buy it for other people you know'll like it. Buy it even if you didn't like it. It took Games Workshop 20 years before they let any company make a move and it was this one. Future Warhammer 40000 movies with other races and new stories maybe even Horus Heresy movies rest with the amount of money this film makes. Codex are out on a limb here. Furthermore if you've watched this and are able to make videos upload a review to the Ultramarines website. They can't improve their movies without knowing what they need to improve and I'm sure they'll be happy to hear the positive feedback too!.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is an easy 10 for long time Warhammer 40k fans like myself but I am looking at it through the viewpoint of the average viewer for the sake of fareness.The plot was good and was very true to the lore of the gamesworkshops Warhammer universe. While the dialogue was sometimes short one liners and cheesy the voice acting was magnificent. Terrance stamp and John hurt offer up truly inspiring performances along with the rest of the cast. The choral and atmospheric music is very well done and they avoided using gloomy or intense mash ups of sounds clearly stating what the mood should be telling you how to feel. The downside is that the animation is somewhat low quality CGI although not as bad as many people make it out to be. The story grabs your attention so well that you soon forget about the low quality animation. As far as run time 76 minutes is not ideal but you rarely realize how short it was unit you actually inspect the clock. Lastly this film is aimed at a very small fanbase being us Gamesworkshops wargamers. I look forward to more Warhammer 40k films in the future and I hope that Codex Pictures continues to produce them with the same quality and attention to detail as this one.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is an easy 10 for long time Warhammer 40k fans like myself but I am looking at it through the viewpoint of the average viewer for the sake of fareness.The plot was good and was very true to the lore of the gamesworkshops Warhammer universe. While the dialogue was sometimes short one liners and cheesy the voice acting was magnificent. Terrance stamp and John hurt offer up truly inspiring performances along with the rest of the cast. The choral and atmospheric music is very well done and they avoided using gloomy or intense mash ups of sounds clearly stating what the mood should be telling you how to feel. The downside is that the animation is somewhat low quality CGI although not as bad as many people make it out to be. The story grabs your attention so well that you soon forget about the low quality animation. As far as run time 76 minutes is not ideal but you rarely realize how short it was unit you actually inspect the clock. Lastly this film is aimed at a very small fanbase being us Gamesworkshops wargamers. I look forward to more Warhammer 40k films in the future and I hope that Codex Pictures continues to produce them with the same quality and attention to detail as this one.";

Close up shots of the faces looked especially badly done but the vehicles looked good and for the most part the marines did too.In terms of story it's pretty basic. There's no real introduction to the setting probably because most viewers are going to be familiar with it but I thought this was a missed opportunity to explain the background for a few minutes with some nice sweeping shots of Terra and maybe the golden throne that kind of thing.There's no really good pitched battles enemies appear in handfuls so you never get a sense of a decent fight which was a shame. There were also a few oddities which don't really seem to fit in. For example the captain is commanding a squad that's never been in battle? That's a command squad of veterans that's never had a battle? Good one. I can see why they did it for the plot but it makes no sense in the 40k universe. Nor does ripping on the apothecary for being a coward. In the 40k universe he is one of the most important marines in the chapter and certainly outranks a bog standard marine that's never been in battle by quite some way. By the way all those first timers would be scouts not full marines..and I could go on and on but of course none of this really spoils the movie at all but for a film made for fanboys it's a bit slack.Overall it's worth a watch if you like 40k. Hopefully this is the first in a series and they will improve. A better storyline and animation would be required though to appeal to a wider audience.".

This was covered by the included minicomic but it would have been far better if it were included in the movie itself possibly as a flashback.As CGI movies go the production team have taken a more stylised approach rather than a photorealistic one which in some ways reduces the specific detailing while giving the movie a more distant almost fantasy feeling. Some of the settings are absolutely perfect for the setting others are more bland or generic. The CGI is definitely not perfect but the occasional issues are not enough to reduce immersion in the story.For first viewing we were a varied group. Ages between 25  50 3 male 2 female 2 fans of the 40K background 1 who knew a little of it 2 with very little exposure. All were engaged by the movie with very little of our usual heckling and virtually none of the usual irrelevant chatter. After the movie finished there was even a small discussion about our differing interpretations of what we had seen.As a longterm fan of the setting for me it rated 1010 if only for the number of little bits in there just for the fans but for general viewers I'd have to go with a 7 to 8 though my bias towards the setting may have inflated this. Overall a competent movie.".

I was therefore nervous that the result would be awful  but it's actually a great 70 minutes. I've watched this film once on my own and my son has had it on twice now. I found myself entertained  all three times. That's three more times than either the Transformers movies I sat through which had x100 the budget.The CGI was mostly fine  only a couple of scenes looked rushed. I think the story perfectly fitted the 70 minutes the makers had to tell it. The opening act set the scene and built the tension well. In my opinion the fight scenes were well directed and choreographed. The final battle was particularly good and conclusion affecting.Identifying the characters was difficult with helmets  but it not obvious how that could be addressed without going sans helmet... Which they did fairly often. The armours were all different so it is visually possible.At the time of writing the film is only available as a collector's edition at about 25. However that's about the same money as a family trip to the cinema so in those terms I judge it worth the money. I guess it will be about 12 in the spring so I hope many more 40K fans buy then. I really hope the producersinvestors see a great return and we see more 40K films.This is a positive start to seeing the 40K universe in film.".

Unfortunately the animation is so poor that it constantly pulls you back out of the story. Characters look wooden and reminded me of older animated TV series e.g. starship troopers. The special effects such as explosions and gunfire look terrible. There is only one half decent fight scene but even there the characters move as if they have arthritis and clunk about the place with as much grace as the miniature figurines upon which this movie gets its source material.

The characters are shallow and have the personality of a rock and power armor certainly doesn't help. Most of the time there's a group of identical marines excluding the Captain and the Apothecary wandering around. The movie starts slowly and the first half of the movie consists mostly of the new space marines playing macho and wandering aimlessly.I tried to enjoy the movie by ignoring the CGI but in some parts it rears its ugly head. Half of the movie the marines wander in a sandstorm because Codex Pictures didn't bother to model the environment which is quite absurd as the movie was hyped to use thestateoftheart technology. In the only part where a Chaos Space Marine is seen without a helmet it's a nasty sight. In a bad way. Sometimes the facial animation is frankly awkward like in this poor Chaos Space Marine's case. Sometimes it seemed that they were aware of the lacking visuals and tried to cover it with excessive use of the smoke effect. Or then they just really love smoke.I could also complain about the lore errors prometheum not being gel bolter rounds not exploding and Crozius shooting magic beams but I spare you.The movie had good parts the story as predictable as it was did entertain even though the pacing needed more attention. But hey it's warhammer and I doubt you expecting anything deep from the movie. Right? They did try hard. They tried to add 'thrill' to the movie with Chaos Marines whispering in the bushes and unintentionally amusing sudden face zooms. There were nice little details like thoughts for the day flashing on the marine's visor screen. While the CGI makes me wonder whether to laugh cry or take a blowtorch to my retinas the audio content compensated it if not totally well. I've heard differing opinions about the voice acting. Some say it is good a few say it is bad. But here I'd like to remind you that bad voice acting and voice acting that doesn't fit are two different things. I think the cast was chosen well with one exception. Donald Sumpter did well as Pythol even though his lines ranged from Captain Obvious to just downright hilarious. And sometimes he just sounded like an old man whining about his prostate which doesn't really match my image of a Space Marine. Music and voice effects they were good but nothing exceptional.A bad movie? Nah. A good movie? Nah. After watching the movie I'm still more or less sane so I guess it's not a bad way to spent an hour. But still would I pay 40? No. If you expected the movie to be the messiah 40k movie the mankind has been waiting for you're gonna be disappointed. But if you were like me watching the trailers with zero expectations it ain't a bad movie. Just don't expect too much.".

Some say it is good a few say it is bad. But here I'd like to remind you that bad voice acting and voice acting that doesn't fit are two different things. I think the cast was chosen well with one exception. Donald Sumpter did well as Pythol even though his lines ranged from Captain Obvious to just downright hilarious. And sometimes he just sounded like an old man whining about his prostate which doesn't really match my image of a Space Marine. Music and voice effects they were good but nothing exceptional.A bad movie? Nah. A good movie? Nah. After watching the movie I'm still more or less sane so I guess it's not a bad way to spent an hour. But still would I pay 40? No. If you expected the movie to be the messiah 40k movie the mankind has been waiting for you're gonna be disappointed. But if you were like me watching the trailers with zero expectations it ain't a bad movie. Just don't expect too much.";

It doesn't distract the casual viewer and it probably wets the palate of the diehard Warhammer 40.000 nerd.

The action sequences range from boring to fascinating. Here too I have some conflicting impressions.The characters are clichd but one is really not expected to care much about them in a personal way. They are all warriors and in that sense the Warhammer 40.000 universe's flavor comes through and it probably doesn't disturb too much.All in all I think I could have spent these 70 minutes in worse ways and hope most viewers will gain at least the same amount of fun as I did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I was going to post a review yesterday after I had just watched the film for the first time but it was getting late and I didn't get around to it and now I am glad I didn't. After first viewing I wasn't impressed however I have since rewatched the film and enjoyed it far much more the second time around.True it has its flaws but it has its moments as well. On the plus side the voice acting is excellent the action is well paced and the sound is quality particularly the choiric chanting. There is enough storyline to keep the film turning and even managed t included an unexpected twist but the film is more action based probably due to the main feature being the monosyllabic Space Marines. However most of the dialogue fits this one line mentality and they managed to get across the major themes and tag lines associated with the Adeptus Astartes.On the down side for me there seemed to be two major elements which disappointed. The first being caused by lacklustre dull scenery which often looked grainy and basic whilst the second was occasion incidents where character movement lacked fluidity and pose though I think both these problems could be easily rectified. It has also been mentioned that there were a few long silences but I think this actually added to some scenes as is more in keeping with the search and destroy mission which this film is essential based upon rather than a pitched battle.On a minor note though I know he is not the intended base of the film but one of the most interesting characters Chaplain Carnak was under used he really only had one scene and I though it was one of the highlights of the film. On the flips side I can see a great number of blue Space Marines called Proteus and Verenor appear at my local gaming store in the not too distant future.I think another highlight is the graphic novel I read this before rewatching the film for and enjoyed it and consequently the film as a whole more it sets up the film quiet nicely and is an element utilised elsewhere in the media at large.All in all it was a decent solid if not spectacular opening and I think it could open many doors for future projects if sales are forthcoming. Go in to watching this film with an open mind and I think you will enjoy it.P.S.

I watched the movie in hope of maybe learning a thing or two since it seems like an extremely rich and well crafted universe. But instead of answers I'm left with a hundred new questions. Like why is the emperor so divine? Why would anyone build a shrinetemple on an uninhabited planet? What is Chaos and what do they want and why? Why is the hammer sacred or special and if it's so powerful why doesn't everyone wield one? What did the guy with the white armor extract from the dead bodies and why? Etc.My guess is that humans have become some kind of religious fanatics that go around space building churches on empty rocks. And maybe those super hammers are really difficult to manufacture. Or maybe only the worthy may have one this would be even more stupid. Anyway my point is that people who know nothing or little about 40k will probably have a very hard time making sense of any of this.The quality of the CGI is OK in some areas and abysmal in others. The armors of the marines are the highpoint of the movie. They look great. Textures lightning and shadow effects lots of details etc all comes together perfectly to make them look really cool and bad ass  As long as they don't move. Animations are terrible and make these huge intimidating war machines appear light as feathers. This breaks the magic throughout the entire movie. Headface models are extremely poor and makes all the characters look like old old men. The fire effect from the flamethrower is so bad it ruins every shot it's in.None of this matters though since this is a small budget movie made for fans and fans only. Everyone else will probably not be as forgiving and ultimately disappointed as there is neither story nor special effects to entertain.".

Never played the game and am certainly not going to.After watching a few minutes I thought I should write down the stuff that annoys me. So here's the list.Lot of religious crap god is called emperor.  First 2728 min of 70 in total nothing happens just some more crappy talking and waling around.  Walking around with some stupid flag they never heard of stealth.  The scout ship they send ahead is utterly unprotected.  The ridiculously fat suits they are wearing seems to be utterly useless. So why hinder your movement like that?  Enemy is zombie like but they do not even aim for the head well sometimes.  Everything is rather primitively drawn looks like a computer animation from many years ago.  A chainsaw blade seems to have more damaging effects than guns. Lots of shooting very little damage.  The bad guys seem to be much stronger Ultramarines are dropping like flies. I would think an Ultramarine should be able to take a generous beating before actually taking damage. The Ultra really doesn't show anywhere.  More religious crap...  Again more than 20min without any action just some walking around.  Even an Axe gets trough their armor with ease.  They're flying trough space in churches.  The fight with the demon at the end was mildly entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "A real honest to goodness 40K movie has been a long time coming. This is a genuine if short glimpse into the far future where there is only WAR  The biggest hurdle that the crew have to overcome is that 40K is huge. Over 20 years in creation there is more backstory in the word Ultramarine than they can fit into a single 70 film. So in a brave move they don't try. These Ultramarines are kickass soldiers with big armour and bigger guns. The rest of it is implied and there are enough queues for fans without boring everyone else to death by explaining it explicitly. Even Chaos is skimmed over apart from being the bad guys and like us once. I think the only time the Emperor gets mentioned is as Emperor protects.The Dan Abnett story is a simple but well told one. It's actually a fairly good representation of a few linked 40K games which is a good start. The animation works fairly well if a little stilted at times. The voices are fairly well acted and mostly fit the faces. Although I did think that the veteran Marines looked rather old the newlypromoted Novices looked ready for battle but the Captain and Apothecary seemed too old for running around a desert with a bolter.I enjoyed this. I think it's a good window on the 40K universe although I naturally wish it could be longer deeper more involved. It's a little cheesy in places but certainly no more so than many action movies. The Collector's Edition is OK the added prequel graphic novella is a nice intro as to why a squad is on the world. 25 may be a little steep but I'm a hobby obsessive so I don't mind paying for a nice package. And I guess that if they make money on it more may follow.".

This being the first Warhammer 40k movie this is a great start and sets the bar pretty high for other to come. I've watched the movie now about 3 times and each time it gets better and better. The voice acting is great. I'll admit the animation of the character's faces in the beginning bothered me but after watching the special features disc it is a feat of technology they used for the animation. Of course with new technology there is room for improvement.The story for this movie is amazing. I liked the fact that when it came to the script for this movie they brought in one of the best writers for the Warhammer 40K book series. Not going to lie now that I've watched this movie I'll need to buy one of the books by this man.If you have not seen this movie yet you should see it.".

I would have imagined growing up handicapped would feel so sad and lonely but as an audience you get to see just how excited and how much fun these kids have despite their handicaps. Watching Karen jump up and down on the bed is absolutely heart warming and the excitement Jonathan a blind child gets from blowing out the candles on his birthday cake is remarkable. Their hearts are opened up and their souls our poured out onto the celluloid for all to see. In fact the scene where the parents tell the children about their grandma's death has to be the most moving piece in the entire film. There were no fake emotions there it was all real exactly like any other family would be even those without disabilities.This film was also great to watch because it showed the world what ONE family could do to help others in this world. The message this film sends to its audience is one of solidarity and commitment to help those around us. I really liked the one excerpt on how the one reporter wanted to know what part of Korea the boys were from as if race or wars should dictate who out there in this world needs help and support to survive. Someone's race religion OR handicap for that matter should not halt someone from providing the same support and need they would give their own brother.The film was so entertaining I wish I could see what they were up to now thirty years later.After writing this I went and found this website on the internet.httpwww.debolts.comfamily.html".

Mr. and Mrs. DeBolt had as of the making of this film nineteen kidsmost of which were handicapped orphans from around the world and were considered pretty much unadoptable. However the DeBolts seemed to like the challenge of melding all these kids into an enormous family. Most of the film simply shows the family going through their days. What I particularly liked is that although this appeared to be a close family the parents were certain NOT to do too much for the kidsencouraging them to do things for themselves regardless of their disabilities.The film is pretty well made and interesting. It is also a bit sticky sweet but inspiring as well. Apparently the Academy was quite impressed by the documentary because it was awarded the Oscar for this category in 1978. Well worth seeing.By the way it would be very interesting if a followup film was made about the family more than three decades later. The 'kids' are all now independent adults with their own children and I am sure their stories would be worth hearing.".

	schema:headline " The Duke At His Best";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the Duke at his twofisted brawling best along with Maureen O'Hara who lights up the screen in McLintock!' a rousing westerncomedy directed by Andrew W. McLaglen.  John Wayne is George Washington McLintock cattle baron and owner of just about everything around for as far as the eye can see.  He owns cattle mines and lumber and even the town is named after him.  And he's a fair man and a good employer to boot who pays a fair wage for a good day's work.  He even hires a young man Devlin Warren Patrick Wayne who has come in with a group of homesteaders who have been given land by the government and plan to farm the Mesa Verde even though as McLintock warns them it's impossible to farm at 6000 feet above sea level. In the meantime young Devlin has to support his mother Louise Yvonne De Carlo and his sister Alice Aissa Wayne.  So G.W. even hires Louise to be the cook for his outfit.  McLintock is The Man in these parts and he earns the respect he is accorded by most of the good citizens of the territory. But he has one problem and it's a big one and it comes in quite a package His estranged wife Katherine O'Hara who has just come back to town to settle a certain issue with her husband.  And the fireworks begin the minute she steps off the train.The main bone of contention has to do with their daughter Becky Stefanie Powers who will be returning home from college soon.  Katherine wants to take her east to live G.W. in having none of it.  And shades of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' that's his final answer.  The real rub is that G.W. still loves Katherine and he still doesn't know what put the burr in her saddle and caused her to leave him two years earlier.  It's also obvious that Katherine still loves G.W. but she apparently can't get past whatever it was that caused the split in the first place.  But her eyes sparkle whenever Drago Chill Wills G.W.'s right hand man brings up the good ol' days' and she's reminded of when they started out with nothing but each other and a lot of love and courage.There's a touch of Taming of the Shrew' in this story and near the end Wayne and O'Hara virtually reenact one of their own scenes from The Quiet Man' all of which adds up to a couple of hours worth of good old fashioned fun.  This movie never pretends or aspires to be anything other than what it is which is good wholesome entertainment that features some memorable characters lots of humor and some classic lines.  The Duke is trim and healthy and never swaggered better and O'Hara in a green dress against which her gorgeous red hair absolutely glows makes you wonder if there's ever been a more beautiful actress ever to grace the silver screen.  And the two of them have a chemistry together that ranks right up there with the best pairings the movies ever had to offer.  The Duke may be in command but he certainly has his hands full with that fighting Irish wildcat O'Hara. Together they've created some moments on screen that will live forever.Adding to the merriment is an allstar supporting cast that includes Jerry Van Dyke Matt Jr. Hank Worden Curly Bruce Cabot Ben Jack Kruschen Jake Edgar Buchanan Bunny Perry Lopez Davey Elk Michael Pate Puma Strother Martin Agard Gordon Jones Douglas Robert Lowery Governor Humphrey H.W. Gim Ching Edward Faulkner Young Ben Chuck Roberson Sheriff Mari Blanchard Camille Leo Gordon Jones Bob Steele Train Engineer and Big John Hamilton Fauntleroy.  McLaglen sets the pace and keeps this vintage WayneO'Hara vehicle right on task which makes McLintock!' a classic in it's own right.  It's a timeless film that captures the attitude and freedom of a time gone by that simply does not exist anymore in this our advanced' era of political correctness which often stifles the very freedom it espouses.  And watching this movie it makes you wonder about the progress' we've made in the past thirty years or so.  As far as movies go this one is magic and it proves that they just don't make em like they used to.  I rate this one 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "McClintock is loosely based on William Skakespesre's The Taming of the Shrew. It is not your usual John Wayne western in fact he doesn't draw his six shooter even once but is more of a broad comedy with a tip of the hat to John Ford.This film was the first to be produced by Wayne's son Michael who had basically taken over the running of Wayne's production company Batjac. It also was the first major feature to be directed by Andrew V. McLaglen who had learned his trade as an assistant on previous Wayne features and on TV. He is also the son of former Wayne costar Victor McLaglan.The story is simple. G.W. McClintock Wayne is rough and tumble hard drinking rancher whose estranged wife of two years Katherine Maureen O'Hara has returned to try to gain custody of their daughter Becky Stephanie Powers. The conflict between the two forms the basis for the rest of the picture. Into the mix comes a widowed settler Mrs. Warren Yvonne DeCarlo and her son Devlin Patrick Wayne who becomes enamored of Becky. The chemistry between Wayne and O'Hara makes this film go. The big gruff Wayne vs. the fiery Irish redhead provides much of the humor of the piece.The scene for which this film is probably best remembered is the fight at the top of a mud slide Most of the combatants including the two stars wind up going down the slide into a pool of mud below. And then there's the climatic chase through the streets.The film features most of the members of the John Wayne stock company. Chill Wills plays Wayne's foreman Drago Bruce Cabot as a rival rancher Hank Worden as Curley Ed Faulkner as Cabot's son Chuck Roberson as the Sheriff and Bob Steele as a train engineer.Other familiar faces include Jack Kruschen as storekeeper Jake Birnbaum Jerry Van Dyke as Junior a rival suitor for Becky Perry Lopez as Davey Elk an educated Indian Strother Martin as Agard the Indian agent Gordon Jones as Douglas McClintock's longtime nemesis Robert Lowery as the governor Michael Pate as Puma the Commanche chief Marie Blanchard as saloon girl Camille and Leo Gordon as the settler who is the first to go down the famous mud slide.A little devoid of action there are no gunfights or saloon brawls McClintock remains one of Wayne's most popular films.The Paramount DVD release is billed as the Authentic Collector's Edition. Some years ago the film somehow fell into the public domain and an inferior version of the film has been floating about the bargain bins as a result. This release however restores the film to its widescreen aspect ratio as well as showing its rich and vibrant colors. There is also interviews with the ageless Maureen O'Hara still looking as beautiful as ever in her 80s and Stephanie Powers who looks better now than she did in the film. Leonard Maltin hosts the various segments and provides a feature length commentary along with film historian Frank Thompson O'Hara Powers and Michael Pate.Great fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once in a while even The Duke liked to have a good laugh.That's obvious in McLintock! where nearly every scene is a laugh riot. This is about the most boisterous rambunctuous slapstickdriven Western ever made.  In fact it's easy to see why this is one of Wayne's most popular efforts.Everyone puts in a good performance even a young Powers as McLintock's daughter and is willing to give their all in the name of the classic Western and classic comedy.  There are a few Mexican Indian and Chinese stereotypes that could have been left out but there are so many good spirits herein it's hard to notice them.Just look at the chemistry between Wayne and O'Hara as the longsuffering Mrs. McLintock.  Small wonder they made a large number of movies together. Fire and brimstone mixes with mud and water until it's obvious that every laugh they generate has been earned honestly.  Not an easy thing to do in any movie especially nowadays.Look you can see a movie like True Grit The Searchers and Rio Lobo anytime you want to see The Duke in all his glory.  But for good old raucous fun give McLintock! a try.Ten stars.  The Duke and slapstick.  Two great things that go great together.".

	onyx:emotionText "Once in a while even The Duke liked to have a good laugh.That's obvious in McLintock! where nearly every scene is a laugh riot. This is about the most boisterous rambunctuous slapstickdriven Western ever made.  In fact it's easy to see why this is one of Wayne's most popular efforts.Everyone puts in a good performance even a young Powers as McLintock's daughter and is willing to give their all in the name of the classic Western and classic comedy.  There are a few Mexican Indian and Chinese stereotypes that could have been left out but there are so many good spirits herein it's hard to notice them.Just look at the chemistry between Wayne and O'Hara as the longsuffering Mrs. McLintock.  Small wonder they made a large number of movies together. Fire and brimstone mixes with mud and water until it's obvious that every laugh they generate has been earned honestly.

	schema:headline " John Wayne's GREAT Western Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Since its opening in 1963 I'd had seen 'McLintock!' four or five times over the years. I'd always considered it a fun albeit chauvinistic western 'battle of the sexes.' Only after viewing it again after the recent 'loosening of the grips' of the Wayne family estate did I come to realize its greatness. All great westerns have great themes and 'McLintock!' is no exception. 'McLintock!' is about forgiveness the forgiveness that comes with letting go of the animosities of the past and acceptance of those things in the present that will only with time and understanding.WARNING SPOILERSIt's Wayne's most lyrical movie as well as his funniest. Wayne plays George Washington McLintock GW to his wife and friends the wealthiest rancher on the Mesa Verde. GW is roughly 50 and the changes in him over those fifty years reflects the coming of civilization to the Mesa Verde in particular and to the west in general. GW has become wise to ways of human nature and thus more prepared for the changes which are beyond his control. But GW is a tormented man for his wife Kathryn Maureen O'Hara has left him. So GW spends each and every night getting drunk and whoring ending up every night tossing his two pound Stetson onto to the weather vane on his roof. This is the first real clue there is something going in 'McClintock' beside the standard story. If GW is happy drinking and whoring why does he return home EVERY night to sleep in an empty bed marking his lonely days by each Stetson on that weather vane?GW and his foreman Drago Chill Wills arrives in the town named after McLintock and run into Bunny an old halfbreed drunk. GW an easy touch orders Drago to give Bunny a dollar for a drink which Drago does reluctantly. GW and Drago enter the Jake Birnbaum's General Store. There GW finds out that Kathryn is visiting town awaiting the return of their only child Becky from college. GW learns this by a telegram given to him by Jaime Birnbaum's Indian assistant. These scenes establish the history of a close relationship between GW Jake and Jaime a long relationship unmarked by prejudice since Jake's a Jew and Jaime's a young Indian. Knowing that Kathryn must be staying in the town's only hotel GW goes there running into his favorite whore Camille Mari Blanchard in the process. When GW finally confronts Kathryn in her room Kathryn is pretentious and downright hostile. GW can barely keep his hands off her clumsily trying to show Kathryn how much he loves her. However both Kathryn and the audience know GW is an adulterer and it is only Wayne's persona O'Hara's gifted obnoxiousness and the preceeding scenes establishing GW's basic decency which allow us to sympathize with him. We don't dislike Kathryn for her treatment of GW we dislike Kathryn for her treatment of everyone else. This makes it possible for us to root for GW in his pursuit of reconciliation with Kathryn.The turning point of the movie for GW and Kathryn actually comes early. I call it the 'Queens in Danger' scene. After Kathryn moves back to the ranch and gives GW an especially bad time GW goes into town to get drunk and 'see' Camille. Suddenly GW changes his mind remembering his buddy Jake's last chess move GW and Jake play chess as frequently as possible. When Camille's asks where GW is going GW remarks 'Queen's in danger.' On the surface he simply appears to be pondering a chess strategy. Actually the 'queen' to which GW is referring is Kathryn. One slip up with Camille and GW can forget ever getting Kathryn back. After this episode it's only a matter of time and some VERY funny situations before GW will regain his 'Queen'.The extended 'chase' of Kathryn by at the end of the movie has always bothered me for its apparent chauvinism. However in addition to being an homage to 'The Quiet Man' this 'chase' represents GW and Kathryn finally coming to terms with their feelings for each other. Kathryn had a legitimate gripe against GW's infidelity even when it becomes apparent Kathryn herself has been unfaithful and GW knows it. However Kathryn has been cruel to EVERYBODY. Finally her cutting remark to GW after he has failed to sway the governor regarding the plight of the Indians was too much. Kathryn herself could have done more but she had done nothing. Kathryn had been itching for a confrontation with GW from the beginning and when he finally offers her one she runs from him. Like a naughty schoolgirl Kathryn runs from GW and like a naughty schoolgirl she eventually gets spanked for her boorish behavior.END OF SPOILERS As Kathryn Maureen O'Hara has never been better. Alternately overbearing vulnerable coquettish combative and sexy O'Hara would have easily garnered an Oscar had her work appeared in a more 'serious' movie.There are so many rich subplots and themes in 'McLintock' it would be very difficult and a waste of time to go into them here. Some include the changing West mistreatment of the Indians honor hypocrisy malefemale roles male bonding class struggle and misguided patronage. I think there are more of these in this film than many other 'great' westerns combined. It's all presented so goodnaturedly it's easy to dismiss McClintock! as a piece of cinematic fluff. It's anything but. Not perfect in fact somewhat cheapened by some less than stellar supporting actors 'McLintock' is still worth a '9.'".

	schema:reviewBody "Whatever you think of John Wayne's politics they were never better expressed more convincingly or with more entertainment than they are in McLintock. At first glance this film is a rough house western version of The Taming of the Shrew. But it is far more than that it is the closest thing we have to a film manifesto of the world as John Wayne saw it.As G.W. McLintock the Duke is the American dream personified. The man who came west and by dint of his own sweat and labor built a cattle empire. He did it without the government's help and note how he tells the settlers the government doesn't 'give' anything away. One of the three people identified as villains in his world view is land agent Gordon Jones. He's a liberal in McLintock peddling the view that government help is the answer to all of our problems.McLintock rather broadly satirizes other people who Wayne considers liberals. The knowitall college kid Jerry Van Dyke the tanglefooted bureaucrat Indian agent Strother Martin the oily politician Robert Lowery these people get quite a going over. Wayne doesn't 'give' anybody anything. As he says to son Patrick Wayne in my favorite line in all John Wayne movies I don't give jobs I hire men. That's a creed he followed in real life as well.Sad to say though the world isn't as simple as McLintock would have us believe. McLintock takes place in the age of the robber barons and those folks were not as noble in character as G.W. McLintock. Maybe the world ought to be like it is in McLintock but it ain't.McLintock is one grand piece of entertainment though. The comedy is as broad and unsophisticated as you would find in any John Ford film and with good reason as Wayne and Director Andrew McLaglen learned the movie trade from him. In addition to dealing with the assorted 'liberals' mentioned above the Duke has some domestic concerns. Wife Maureen O'Hara has left him but is back over where their daughter Stefanie Powers will reside. Maureen is playing the same role she did in Rio Grande and later on in Big Jake the estranged wife who circumstances force her back with Wayne. In the case of McLintock though these are circumstances that Wayne makes on his own with some inspiration from The Taming of the Shrew.The cast is populated with a grand cast of regulars from previous Wayne films like Chill Wills Edgar Buchanan Hank Worden Leo Gordon Michael Pate and some already mentioned. Jack Kruschen makes his one and only film appearance in a Wayne film here. He does very well as the kindly benevolent and obviously Jewish storekeeper. He's got an important function also here as another self made American success story in the same film.Yvonne DeCarlo got cast in this film after her husband who was a stunt man was injured badly on another film. She had heavy duty medical expenses and Wayne was not about charity. But he was legendary for taking care of fellow performers giving them a pay day in his films if they needed it. He didn't give jobs he hired men and women. Yvonne is Pat Wayne's mother in the film who Maureen suspects of being Wayne's mistress when she's hired as a housekeeper.We also get an economics lecture from the Duke as well. He works for every man who goes to a butcher shop and wants a TBone steak. And Pat Wayne works for him. It's what makes the capitalist system go.If you take some of the politics expressed with a critical eye McLintock is fabulous entertainment one of the Duke's best films.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Tales of the American West and the Western Film are two inseparable American Cultural Institutions. They are highly visible and closely related to each other. Both are exaggerated and distorted versions of American History. Whatever the images we harbor in the deep recesses of our widdle heads they are colored by people like Zane Gray Louis Lamour William S. Hart and John Ford.Then of course we have so many types of western film as we have other kinds of genres of stories. So some films are historically correct some are strictly fairy tale material. So we even have Western Farce a subject well represented by today's 'victim' the John Wayne starring vehicle McLINTOCK Batjac ProductionsUnited Artists 1963.Being an original screenplay the story is a custom fit for the Duke whose Batjac Productions made the picture and released it through United Artists. Long on characters and characterizations the picture uses the slimmest plot as just a reason for presenting political postulates and providing its audience with many a reason to laugh.OUR STORY..It is to be a Great Celebration of the 4th of July in the Western Town of McLintock. Having been named after its local patriarch the Multimillionaire RancherFarmerMiner one George Washington McLintock the Duke the town and its people have prospered.Added to the mix we have the return from College back East of G.W.'s daughter Becky McLintock Stephanie PowersWoo woo woo woo!. Her affections were being sought after by College Boy and Glee Club Varsity Letterman Matt Douglas Jr. Jerry Van Dyke the son of U.S. Government Agent Matt Douglas Gordon Jones. Jerry Van Dyke does as fine a job as ever in doing comic relief. He gives a Stan Laurelesque interpretation to his character. The biggest development in the whole chain of happenings is the return of G.W.'s estranged firebrand of a wife Katherine Gilhooley McLintock Maureen O'Hara who has a real lovehate relationship with G.W. The climax of the film has an open air domestic quarrel that takes Mrs. Mc down the streets of the town clad in strictly nonrevealing foundation undergarments with G.W. in pursuit ah it's true love! Many who have viewed both films agree that this was a sort of obvious attempt to recreate the high spot in John Ford's THE QUIET MAN Argosy PicturesRepublic Pictures Corporation 1952 in which both the Duke and Maureen O'Hara also coincidentally were the belligerents.In the viewing of McLINTOCK! we witness a real hybrid of a production. As we have mentioned before we have a particular sort of Horse Opera here. It is a true farce. Unlike Mel Brooks' BLAZING SADDLES Crossbow Productions Warner Brothers 1974 which was a spoof of the Western the John Wayne film was a farce all the way. If anything we can describe it as a sort of latter day or modern if you will Mack Sennett Comedy. And it is with confidence we offer this thesis for it seems to have all the same elements namely a central hero having some unusual difficulties family troubles bad business conditions and high expectations of his ability to weather the storm. In the process of getting through the 2 hours the Duke manages to instruct us on what his ideas were on the way things are and should be.If you notice any Governmental Representative is seen with a dim view not only of his intent but also of the underlying intent and outright necessity of whatever their function is. He is obviously a Conservative a believer in self help. His is truly a far cry from the Cradle to Grave creeping socialism that we see so much today.One thing we do know about Mr. Marion Michael Morrison was his generosity and his loyalty toward his friends both old and new. In McLINTOCK! We had a film that could have gotten by with a much smaller cast. But if they did that so many of Mr. Wayne's friends wouldn't have a pay day. Subsequently we have people like the Director Andrew V. McLaglen Victor's son and a host of actors such as Patrick Wayne Stephanie Powers Jack Kruschen Chill Wills Yvonne De Carlo Jerry Van Dyke Edgar Buchanan Bruce Cabot Perry Lopez Strother Martin Gordon Jones Robert Lowery Hank Worden Michael Pate Leo Gordon Bob Steele and many others.Whatever the classification McLINTOCK! is worth taking in. It's never dull and certainly won't be hard to watch that's for sure. And we dare you not to have your full share of laughs before it's over!".

	onyx:emotionText "The Tales of the American West and the Western Film are two inseparable American Cultural Institutions. They are highly visible and closely related to each other. Both are exaggerated and distorted versions of American History. Whatever the images we harbor in the deep recesses of our widdle heads they are colored by people like Zane Gray Louis Lamour William S. Hart and John Ford.Then of course we have so many types of western film as we have other kinds of genres of stories. So some films are historically correct some are strictly fairy tale material. So we even have Western Farce a subject well represented by today's 'victim' the John Wayne starring vehicle McLINTOCK Batjac ProductionsUnited Artists 1963.Being an original screenplay the story is a custom fit for the Duke whose Batjac Productions made the picture and released it through United Artists. Long on characters and characterizations the picture uses the slimmest plot as just a reason for presenting political postulates and providing its audience with many a reason to laugh.OUR STORY..It is to be a Great Celebration of the 4th of July in the Western Town of McLintock. Having been named after its local patriarch the Multimillionaire RancherFarmerMiner one George Washington McLintock the Duke the town and its people have prospered.Added to the mix we have the return from College back East of G.W.'s daughter Becky McLintock Stephanie PowersWoo woo woo woo!. Her affections were being sought after by College Boy and Glee Club Varsity Letterman Matt Douglas Jr. Jerry Van Dyke the son of U.S. Government Agent Matt Douglas Gordon Jones. Jerry Van Dyke does as fine a job as ever in doing comic relief. He gives a Stan Laurelesque interpretation to his character. The biggest development in the whole chain of happenings is the return of G.W.'s estranged firebrand of a wife Katherine Gilhooley McLintock Maureen O'Hara who has a real lovehate relationship with G.W. The climax of the film has an open air domestic quarrel that takes Mrs. Mc down the streets of the town clad in strictly nonrevealing foundation undergarments with G.W. in pursuit ah it's true love! Many who have viewed both films agree that this was a sort of obvious attempt to recreate the high spot in John Ford's THE QUIET MAN Argosy PicturesRepublic Pictures Corporation 1952 in which both the Duke and Maureen O'Hara also coincidentally were the belligerents.In the viewing of McLINTOCK! we witness a real hybrid of a production. As we have mentioned before we have a particular sort of Horse Opera here. It is a true farce. Unlike Mel Brooks' BLAZING SADDLES Crossbow Productions Warner Brothers 1974 which was a spoof of the Western the John Wayne film was a farce all the way.

It's all done in a very comical way and Maureen O'Hara was an excellent comic actress. For this reason this film remains popular. In some ways it is similar to another John Wayne film The Quiet Man also starring with Maureen O'Hara. In that film John also plays the patient guy trying hard not to become violent but to no avail. Both films represent the rawness of the land they live in the rough American West and the bucolic but tough Irish country where fist fighting is very much a man's art.

He also gets plenty of mud on that most American of icons himself.All he needs is a McGovern button and he's be Billy Jack right? Maybe not but this is a very different kind of star vehicle for Wayne in 1963 kicking back in his third full decade of screen stardom. Here aided and abetted by director Andrew V. McLaglen and Maureen O'Hara playing his wife Wayne gives his comedic side a thorough airing as G.W. McLintock rancher and head citizen of the town of McLintock Arizona circa the 1870s who must deal with changing times and a wife who doesn't understand him.What's 'reactionary' mean? asks McLintock's righthand man Drago Chill Wills.Me I guess McLintock replies.McLintock! is knocked by some for its sexual politics a variation on Shakespeare's Taming Of The Shrew where McLintock must take a hand to his wife Katherine don't call her Kate in order to win her back. Let it be said that O'Hara makes a great shrew and as Leonard Maltin and Frank Thompson point out in their engaging DVD commentary everything here is played too broadly to take at all seriously.O'Hara sells the movie as much as Wayne. She was in her element playing broad comedy and clearly relishes the chance to reteam with her Quiet Man costar in a more farcical vein. McLaglen also worked on The Quiet Man as assistant director to John Ford and if anything seems bent on a film more Fordian than Ford himself. Let it be said McLaglen here and in other films got very good ensemble work from his cast and created some extremely fun fight sequences. Here in McLintock! there's a huge wellstaged and sustained brawl early on in a mudhole. Even O'Hara takes part putting her hatpin on assorted cowboy keisters with an insane grin.Nothing about McLintock! really bears up to scrutiny. Screenwriter James Edward Grant gives us many memorable lines but no real story to hang your Stetson on except Katherine and G.W.'s battle of wills. Some mention is made of homesteaders coming to McLintock though that plot is quickly dropped unresolved. Later the Comanches come peaceful and batted around by an uncaring government but other than giving Wayne some time in the spotlight to speak on their behalf they come and go too fast to make an impression.Impressions are made by a number of McLintock's supporting cast. Yvonne De Carlo has fun playing the mother of a fullgrown son Patrick Wayne Duke's son who G.W. hires as cook sparking further rage from Katherine. Strother Martin amusingly suffers from failure to communicate as a ninny Indian agent while Jerry Van Dyke shows off some of the goofiest dance moves west of the Pecos. Stefanie Powers as the McLintock daughter gets more mileage from her part than did most Waynemovie ingnues. Shoot him Daddy! is a hard line to sell for a laugh but she does it.There are other aspects of the film that bog it down particularly a subplot involving a Chinese cook and some tinny line readings throughout many by Patrick Wayne the cast's weak link though he does a good fight scene very important in this film. The best thing you can say about the groaner moments of McLintock! is that they are soon over to be replaced by something fun.Something fun is what McLintock! gives you in the end not profound or even that clever but satisfying. It's not Wayne's finest hour just one of his more pleasant.".

Although he is stubborn and ornery he has earned the respect and trust of most everyone maybe even a little though begrudgingly from Matthew Douglas.The only thing he is remotely afraid of is Katherine played by Maureen O'Hara. She is wonderfully entertaining as a bitterly estranged wife. It seems as though she is so outlandish and malicious because she is trying to guard her heart against being hurt again. Even though you feel someone should throttle her for her rood and obscene behavior another part of you wants to root for reconciliation between her and McLintock throughout the movie and there couldn't be a better one! The final scenes especially the wacky chase make this movie unforgettable.Speaking of rooting adding a full depth to this movie is the shy and uncertain romance between McLintock's daughter Becky and a young hired help Devlin Warren. Becky is a sweet girl loved by all but she taunts Devlin with her beau Junior Douglas. Junior was courting Becky long before she recently met Devlin and fell in love with him. Devlin is charming in his attempt to impress Miss Becky and his raw jealousy of Junior. It is exciting when he finally wins his lady.This movie shows a true spirit and lightly touches on fairness to the Native Americans by some  and brashness by others. And who could forget strong reliable Drago? Or humorous mumbler Bunny? Other memorable characters are Jake Birnbaum Davey Agard and of course Ching who is comical and strangely charming. Who couldn't love that adorable accent and frantic plea Call me family! This movie has so many untouchable moments that I love! Especially the mud fight towards the beginning! Those intriguing and compellingly unique moments are seldom ever seen in movies today. McLintock! Is truly a classic and one of John Wayne's best.".

Music is by Frank De Vol and cinematography by William H. Clothier. It's a PanavisionTechnicolor production and locations used for the shoot were Nogales Old Tucson and San Rafael Ranch State Park Arizona USA. A loose reworking of William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew plot finds Duke Wayne as cattle baron George Washington McLintock whose estranged wife Katherine O'Hara returns with daughter Becky Powers to the family town after a two year absence. Having left George originally on suspicion of him committing adultery she now wants a divorce and with it full custody of Becky. George isn't keen on the idea and Katherine's arrival in town also signals the arrival of chaos.Produced out of John Wayne's own Batjac Productions company McLintock! became one of Wayne's most successful and popular movies of the 60's. Played for laughs film sees Wayne surrounded by family and friends and this shines thru in the final product. It looks and was a fun production its values may be dated a great deal now but it's easy to see why the paying public warmed to it. Wayne is in his element as the tough hard drinking and no nonsense title character and those playing off of him are in tune with what's needed to make the comedy work. The action is well staged by McLaglen especially a free for all punch up at a mud pit and Clothier's photography beautifully brings the Arizona locales out from the screen. A touch too long at just over two hours it still manages to last the course to deliver the goods for the westerncomedy seeker. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Nice film with the Duke as a tough Cattle baron  this is a Western screen version of the classic Shakespearean comedy . John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara are perfectly cast as Taming of the shrew couple . The inspiration for this raucous John Wayne comedy was none other than William Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew which producer Michael Wayne and director Andrew V. McLaglen thought would have even more of a comedic kick if it were set in the Old West . Starring John Wayne as George Washington whose refined wife Maureen O'Hara returns from the east after a twoyear separation . She wants a divorce and custody of their 17yearold daughter Stefanie Powers who's been away at school . In the meantime George's contracted a housekeeper Yvonne De Carlo whose son reallife son Patrick Wayne promptly falls for his daughter . McLintock then battles his spouse  his daughter and landgrabbers  finally taming them all .This Westerncomedy contains a love story  wonderful friendship  thrills  emotion and loads of fistplay . Western comedy with Taming of the Shrew overtones with a magnificent main cast and topnotch support cast . In MacLintock Andrew McLagen does the human touch including lots of nice moments  it is a very fine picture that could become another western worthy of any anthology . The mudhole in which the famous brawl took place wasn't actually made of mud. It was made of a material called Bentonite which is used in the drilling of oil wells and has the consistency of chocolate syrup  according to actor Leo Gordon  the first one to be knocked down it that scene took a week to shoot. In this film the spectator enjoys because it has a lot of issues that make it enjoyable . Even the female characters played by attractive Maureen O'Hara and Stefanie Powers  reveal two women who know that they wish and makes it irresistible . Other John Wayne family members involved in this pleasant production include son Michael G. Wayne who produced the movie  his daughter Aissa as the housekeeper's daughter and mainly Patrick Wayne . John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara are perfectly cast as Taming of the shrew couple giving extraordinary performances . This is the fourth of five movies that paired John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara  such as The big Jack  Rio Grande  The Wings of Eagles  and of course The quite man . Although often seen as simply a knockabout comedy  John Wayne also intended the film to be a statement of his own conservative political views . Large support cast formed by Western usual players as Edgar Buchanan  Michael Pataki  Jack Krushen  Mari Blanchard  Leo Gordon  Edward Faulkner  Chuck Robertson  Strother Martin  Perry Lopez and other actors  John Ford's favourite  such as  Bruce Cabot  Chill Wills  Hank Worden and Bob Steele . Jolly and lively musical score by De Vol . Colorful and spectacular cinematography in Cinemascope by William H Clothier  John Ford's ordinary .This wellpaced film was compellingly directed by Andrew V. McLagen  son of great actor Victor McLagen . Although Stefanie Powers claims that John Ford came to the set to direct the movie for a week Andrew V. McLaglen the director says that it never happened  he says he was there for the entire shoot of the movie . The pic contains McLagen's usual themes as familiar feeling  a little bit enjoyable humor friendship and and sense of comradeship among people . Andrew does the human touch and full of insight that accompanied him during most of his films and the story develops pleasantly in a large frame with an interesting plot and fully adjusted to the requirements of the comedy . Andrew McLagen is a known Ford's disciple introducing similar themes in his films . Andrew holds the distinction of directing the most episodes of Gunsmoke . Furthermore  he holds the honor of filmmaking the most episodes of Have gun  Will travel 1957. And is one of the few directors to have directed both Clint Eastwood and John Wayne . He's a Western expert McLintock  Shenandoah  Bandolero Chisum  Cahill Way West and warlike specialist  such as proved in several films Return to Kwai Wild Geese  Dirty dozen the next mission Sea wolves Breakthrough . Rating MacLintock  Nice  acceptable and passable  6'5 . The picture will appeal to John Wayne fans . Worthwhile watching .".

The movie supports a position of modern progress and political enlightenment. The old ways die hard. I have no problems with the politically incorrect moments. And neither should you. Embrace them. People should lighten up a bit and enjoy the movie for what it is a slapstick farce. Maureen O'Hara is a shock of red hair and fiery words. She keeps Wayne on his spurs begging for divine intervention. Yvonne DeCarlo exits semiretirement and enters the frame with Wayne's character exclaiming your mother! No one could mistake her for someone's mother. Those eyes. They could make a drunk man cry. And sober. No one then or now ever quite looked like Yvonne DeCarlo. No one. Wayne and Yvonne have a drinking scene that is comic bliss. O'Hara enters the scene and they all tumble down a long flight of stairs into a heap at the bottom. O'Hara grabs DeCarlo and flings her over her shoulder like a sack of flour. She carries the very intoxicated DeCarlo off to bed. A threesome ruined. But the rest of the picture survives intact. Now where's the firewater? And my paddle.".

People should lighten up a bit and enjoy the movie for what it is a slapstick farce. Maureen O'Hara is a shock of red hair and fiery words. She keeps Wayne on his spurs begging for divine intervention. Yvonne DeCarlo exits semiretirement and enters the frame with Wayne's character exclaiming your mother! No one could mistake her for someone's mother. Those eyes. They could make a drunk man cry. And sober. No one then or now ever quite looked like Yvonne DeCarlo. No one. Wayne and Yvonne have a drinking scene that is comic bliss. O'Hara enters the scene and they all tumble down a long flight of stairs into a heap at the bottom. O'Hara grabs DeCarlo and flings her over her shoulder like a sack of flour. She carries the very intoxicated DeCarlo off to bed. A threesome ruined. But the rest of the picture survives intact. Now where's the firewater? And my paddle.";

Unfortunately for them already residing in the area is grizzled old Scottish miner Silas McGee Heston who's not as friendly as he initially seems to be. Heston directing from a screenplay by his son Fraser Fraser was also the producer does a capable job of drawing us into this story with good acting and well orchestrated thrills the second unit direction was the work of Joe Canutt son of another legend Yakima Canutt so there are two second generation filmmakers filling out important roles here. The film is well shot by Richard Leiterman in claustrophobic settings and paced well. Mainly it's worth seeing for Heston's fine performance there's a major twist regarding his character but you won't hear it from me as he completely immerses himself in the character and does a good job with the accent to boot. Basinger looks great as usual and she and Mancuso are both quite capable. John Marley is Elijha the forest dweller who lends some much needed assistance and he's just a delight. This is quite well made technically with some breathtaking aerial photography and lots of gorgeous rural scenery. Ken Wannbergs' music likewise adds to the overall enjoyment. It's too bad that this little film is not that well known nowadays but it is on DVD now so more people can discover it for themselves. Not that it's anything truly great necessarily but it's tense and gripping stuff and entertaining all the way. Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before there was Bigfoot there was ogrelike Silas McGee and his shadowy twin Ian to provide virtually unfindable scary primates in the nearly uninhabited BC outback. The opening scene involving a murder by pick ax in a narrow mining tunnel gives us a glimpse of how much of the film will play out. From Silas's later conversation we can assume that the murderer was Ian and that the victim was the mysteriously missing George mining company bush pilot boyfriendhusband? of AndreaKim Basinger.The McGee brothers remind me of nothing so much as Ted Kaczynski the Unibomber who somehow eked out an existence in the wilds of Idaho as a hermit while making bombs to explode upon reception in the mail. Like Kaczynski the McGees were murderous psychopaths but also had an obsession with finding the underground source of gold occasionally found in nearby rivers. The McGee's claimed silver veins were apparently a sham. However their tortuous and deep mine tunnels served as a perfect place to dispose of bodies as long as no outsider entered the relevant tunnel regions. So where did they get their funds to sustain their existence and mining activities for the past 30 years?? The film doesn't go into this but the reviewer must assume that either they were finding a bit of gold or they scavenged what they couldlike planes from the occasional murdered curiosity seekers. Although not usually classed as a film noirto me this is a rather extreme form of this genre. After the first part of the film takes us flying around the spectacular sunny backcountry of BC and we enter the McGee's cabin the action mostly takes place in the dimlylit cabin or narrow mine tunnels and shafts mirky underwaters or in the often misty or dark nearby forest. For a claustrophobe and aquaphobe like me I often felt uncomfortable.Jean DupreNick Mancusois a devilmaycare adrenaline junkie doing stunt pilot flying tricks while on a business run for the Mollyco mining company often flying just above the surface like a crop duster and returning to explore the McGee's tunnel system after he was told to stay out or else. He recklessly jumps out of the company plane he has just landed leaving it to taxi in front of a plane trying to take off with a passenger still inside. He must have more than 9 lives as he should have died that many times in the film. ...Kim Basinger as George's wifegirlfriend? Andrea becomes his partner in their adventure to try to find George while looking for gold. She is mostly a passive partner serving mainly to add eye candy and someone for Dupre to rescue from the McGees.... John Marley as outback fisherman Elijah has a small but very essential role acting as the young couple's saviour when their plane's engine quits and when they need a quick way home after eliminating the McGee menace.According to producer Fraser Heston's DVD documentary the crash landing of the float plane on the lake we see was unplanned but provided a perfect excuse for Dupre and Andrea to go scouting around the wilderness for someone to help them get home... The mine tunnel system was all fake although very well done. Care was taken to make its essential features realistic based primarily on Fraser's experiences in exploring old mines in the Death Valley region.".

The pair run afoul of hearty yet insane possessive and reclusive Irish minor Silas McGee and his oddball twin brother Ian.

Moreover Heston does firstrate work in a juicy dual role and essays the part of the nocount Silas with deliciously wicked and intense relish. Veteran character actor John Marley lends wonderfully engaging support as wise and crusty oldtimer Elijha. The clammy and cramped caves add substantially to the claustrophobic suspense and authentically grimy atmosphere. In addition there's even a strong central message about how greed and obsession can corrupt a man's soul. Richard Leiterman's sharp cinematography provides an appropriately gritty look makes inspired use of dim natural light and comes through with a wealth of striking images of the breathtaking British Columbia countryside. Kenneth Wannberg's moody score hits the brooding and stirring spot. Recommended viewing for those with a taste for something different.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charlton Heston's Mother Lode is one of those neat flicks that not only is filmed in my hometown of Vancouver like every movie ever and the surrounding British Columbia region but is also set there as well. It's an entertaining if slight little adventure story that's perfect to put on for a rainy afternoon on the iPad. Heston in addition to both writing and directing plays two roles here but it's a bit of a sly trick saying that because he mostly appears as one and only briefly as the other but no matter the old pro works his butt off to steal every scene. He plays loner mountain man Silas McGee an eccentric prospector whose stairs don't quite reach the attic living alone in the wilderness looking for that perfect gold strike. The excellent Nick Mancuso in a role originally meant for James Brolin is Jean Dupre a cocky bush pilot who heads McGee's way with his high strung girlfriend Kim Basinger looking for a fellow pilot who got lost and a little of the gold stuff for himself while he's at it. As soon as they run into McGee it's clear the old dog is crazy as shit and not to be trusted creating a nice atmosphere of isolated paranoia and mystery as the man's true intentions come to dark light. Mancuso is always terrifically intense and so great at subtle comic moments this is one of his great early roles and not to be missed for any fan. Poor Basinger suffered a miscarriage while production was underway and as such seems understandably distracted but she's a trooper and carries her end well. Heston either does a brilliant Scottish accent a slipshod one or a bit of both it's hard to tell with his rapid fire banter and eloquent robust verbosity. He's electric though and freaky as all hell as the type of dodgy fellow you better pray you don't run into out there. The action is pretty run of the mill and the film loses the tautness a thriller like this should have in parts but it's solid enough to not change the channel. For B.C. residents it's an absolute treat though especially as Mancuso's rickety float plane arcs up over the Vancouver harbour towards the Cassiar mountains and we get to see what our city looked like back in the 80's. Cool stuff.".

The plane crashes in a lake in the middle of nowhere and the twosome find themselves cut off from civilisation. They stumble across a mysterious old Scottish miner who lives in a remote mountain shack and seems to be digging around in the hills for something. He seems to be a nasty type and gradually they learn that he is in search of gold.... indeed he is so obsessed with his unfound gold that he will kill to keep it a secret.The film is pretty to look at during the early passages especially when the young couple are flying in their plane and the action is beautifully and panoramically captured by the camera. But the later scenes are undone by darkness with far too much action occuring in virtual pitch black darkness which makes it tough to see exactly what's going on. Heston gives a wild and rugged performance which doesn't weigh up with the rest of the film and Basinger is a bit bland in her part. This is OK for a rainy day but nothing more than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "MOTHER LODE is an all but forgotten tale of survival in the wilderness and the hunt for a golden treasure. I'd never heard of it before I saw it was on TV so I thought I'd give it a go I quite like Charlton Heston when he's at his most bombastic so I thought I'd see what he was like here.The good news is that Heston is the best thing in the film and his larger than life portrayal of a mountain man is hugely entertaining. It's a shame that the rest of the film can't match really as MOTHER LODE is saddled with a slowmoving plot and some rather unlikeable protagonists. Nick Mancuso and Kim Basinger play characters who seem selfcentred and indeed rather selfish and I couldn't warm to them despite their various misadventures. Basinger's screaming soon becomes annoying too.What MOTHER LODE does have going for it is some stunning outdoor location photography of the British Columbian wilds. A lot of the aerial shots are simply breathtaking and truly bring to life this rather neglected part of the world at least neglected when it comes to cinema. It's certainly an amiable enough watch overall containing a little of that early '80s spirit of adventure that infused the likes of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK although this is much darker and more realistic and not as entertaining. But it'll do.".

I'd never heard of it before I saw it was on TV so I thought I'd give it a go I quite like Charlton Heston when he's at his most bombastic so I thought I'd see what he was like here.The good news is that Heston is the best thing in the film and his larger than life portrayal of a mountain man is hugely entertaining. It's a shame that the rest of the film can't match really as MOTHER LODE is saddled with a slowmoving plot and some rather unlikeable protagonists. Nick Mancuso and Kim Basinger play characters who seem selfcentred and indeed rather selfish and I couldn't warm to them despite their various misadventures. Basinger's screaming soon becomes annoying too.What MOTHER LODE does have going for it is some stunning outdoor location photography of the British Columbian wilds. A lot of the aerial shots are simply breathtaking and truly bring to life this rather neglected part of the world at least neglected when it comes to cinema. It's certainly an amiable enough watch overall containing a little of that early '80s spirit of adventure that infused the likes of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK although this is much darker and more realistic and not as entertaining. But it'll do.";

Rembrandt's life from his mid 20's to his death played by Klaus Maria Brandauer is a bulls eye. He is one of the most talented prolific and high caliber contemporary Austrian actors and I always loved his performances on stage and on screen. He is mesmerising and believably characterises the artist. The movie is biographically and historically totally accurate which I appreciate enormously. I loved the didactic story telling this is how an intelligent BIOPIC ought to be. All acting is fittingly theatrical and very well cast with many very well known French actors. The cinematography is astounding colours and lighting are sumptuous just like Rembrandt's paintings. Many everyday scenes are staged as if coordinated after the painters works which means that the 'trompel'oeil' dioramas are perfectly orchestrated much to my personal ravishment. Many of Rembrandt's canvasses are depicted and some even with a 'miseenscne' how they came to be. Beautiful! Important historical figurers are interacting with Rembrandt and teach us about his life and his character development. We learn about his triumphs tragedies and important female relationships through an arty movie which transfers us into the 17th century Dutch Republic accompanied with a perfectly chosen score. Highly recommended to ArtFreaks and MovieBuffs!".

A movie that is fortythree years old isn't going to be a modern example of people places and things. Sheesh! Anyway what I'll take from this film is that Ronny Howard WAS the finest child actor in films and television. Consider that in 1963 at 9 years old he was already doing the Opiething for 3 years. In this film he acts nothing like Opie he turns into a whole different child Eddie Corbitt. The underused Shirley Jones big crush was marvelous again and Glenn Ford was supremely good at his selfstyled nonacting. Stella Stevens's drum solo scene is an excellent highlight.

The Courtship of Eddie's Father is about two very real individuals trying to work through the hurt that's surrounding a very big hole in their lives. Ford plays the manager of a radio station and Jerry Van Dyke has a nice role as Ford's best friend and one of the disc jockeys.

And this film is not that ancient. I and many viewers grew up in the era in which this movie was made and considering things nowadays I wouldn't mind going back. Anyway the film does have its flaws primarily the speed with which Eddie goes from mourning to trying to get his Dad hitched again. It's a bit unnatural but we should just suspend disbelief. The chemistry between father and son is what makes the film shine and in this age of broken families and parents willing to discard their children it's sadly nostalgic to see such devotion. The film never overplays Tom's relationship with his two paramours. Character development is well done including the housemaid Mrs. Livngstone who finally learns Spanish only to find out she studied the wrong language. It's a charming and tender movie and the production values are great. The color technology in films of that era was so superior to today's.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having only seen the sitcom that was made for television we decided to take a look at the 1963 original film directed by none other than Vincente Minnelli a man that almost always delivered. It's sad to see that neither Mr. Minnelli nor the screen adapter John Gay had any clear ideas about what to make of the material. The movie could have done much more but ends up as a typical comedy of that period.Tom Corbett a widower with a young son Eddie is at the center of the story. Being still relatively young Tom is the object of desire by women that are looking for a husband. The problem is that it's obvious the girl next door Elizabeth is really the one for him from the moment we set our eyes on her. Eddie who is going through some bereavement pains has a problem accepting his mother's death.Tom and Elizabeth irritate one another when they are together.

That becomes quite clear when Rita suggests to send Eddie to be with relatives for a while when they get married. This suggestion is what triggers Tom to realize how wonderful Elizabeth is after all.Glenn Ford was good as Tom. Mr. Ford always gave an honest performance as he does here. The lovely Shirley Jones is perfect as Elizabeth. It is however Dina Merrill who makes is a joy to watch her as Rita. Ms. Merrill is an actress that deserved much better parts. She was radiantly beautiful and projects such an elegant figure in the movie. Ron Howard was at a cute stage of his career. Roberta Sherwood is fun as the housekeeper.This is a film to watch as a curiosity. Vincente Minnelli's direction doesn't go anywhere.".

It's sad to see that neither Mr. Minnelli nor the screen adapter John Gay had any clear ideas about what to make of the material. The movie could have done much more but ends up as a typical comedy of that period.Tom Corbett a widower with a young son Eddie is at the center of the story. Being still relatively young Tom is the object of desire by women that are looking for a husband. The problem is that it's obvious the girl next door Elizabeth is really the one for him from the moment we set our eyes on her. Eddie who is going through some bereavement pains has a problem accepting his mother's death.Tom and Elizabeth irritate one another when they are together.

I at least thought little Eddie would be doing some cutesy matchmaking with the three prospects blonde redhead and brunetteand creating the same sort of domestic comedy of errors you find in THE PARENT TRAP. But the relationships and storylines are strangely separate especially the one featuring the ditsy Stella Stevens character who should have been called Holly Golightly Lite.Little Ronnie Howard was one of the cutest Hollywood child actors and if not one of the best little actors one of the most endearingly natural. The running bit about the skinny eyes of the bad ladies is a gem. When Glenn Ford quotes it angrily in a serious scene it's honestly hilarious. The best thing you can say about the movie is that it's uniquely truetolife in its mixture of tragedy and whimsy and grief and yuks. Or is that the worst? The whole thing just seems so off. Take the scene with the dead goldfish and little Eddie's screeching. Funny for four seconds than disturbing even shocking in the way it plays out for three minutes. Then there's the fact that Ford has been a widower for only a week or two when the matchmaking zaniness starts. The way that his grief is either crassly patronized or totally ignored. Minnelli's elegant camerawork seems jarringly illsuited to the genre in spots. Ford makes Eddie's Father an idiosyncratically edgy and fidgety notallthere nuerotic. Quite different from the stalwart and wise and only slightly goofy generic American Pop you imagine just from the title. Similar to the one Brian Keith played in THE PARENT TRAP.A mustsee for nostalgic boomers just for the art direction. Dig that indigo blue on Dina Merrill's walls! As for Ford's final choice let's just say that Eddie in the wisdom of his six years might have goofed.".

Ford plays Tom Corbett a widower and Ron Howard plays Eddie his son. I was somewhat surprised at some of the adult lines they gave Ron Howard to say which I thought were unnecessary and inappropriate. There were also some pretty dramatic scenes e.g. Eddie screaming bloody murder after finding one of his goldfish had died etc. that I hadn't expected which just didn't seem to fit too well in this movie. Ford's character was somewhat likable but too detached and dull. He really didn't have much personality at all. I was expecting some humor but there were hardly any funny parts and the whole story involving Norman Jones Jerry Van Dykehis employee at the radio station he and Corbett worked at and Dolly Daily a woman Corbett met in town who was working on her selfesteem so she could fulfill her aspiration of becoming a beauty queen was boring and superfluous to the story. I found both Norman and Dolly to be wooden and vapid characters. If you want to see a clean witty funny romance I highly recommend The Mating of Millie over this disappointment.".

The story can really only go on for so long and still be interesting. However as a two hour movie the story fits in well and although very obviously a 60's movie it's really quite enjoyable if you can lighten up and not get too offended by some of the sexist attitudes toward women etc.The performances here were generally of a high calibre. Glenn Ford was quite good as the recently widowed Tom Corbet far superior to Bill Bixby in the TV series and the supporting cast of Roberta Sherwood as the housekeeper Mrs. Livingston and Shirley Jones Stella Stevens and Dina Merrill as the various women who turn Corbet's head from time to time all did well in their roles. I was really taken with young Ron Howard though. He must surely have been one of the finest child actors ever. His performance as Eddie in this picture was so realistic as he deals with his emotions around his mother's death and his feelings about his father moving on with life was wonderful. Watch this if only to see Howard in the scene when he discovers the dead fish his emotion in this scene was raw and powerful. There's some amusing if politically incorrect scenes in this with a surprising for 1963 amount of sexual innuendo all innocent of course given the year.Disappointments? Well Jerry Van Dyke did nothing for me as radio DJ Norman Jones. Having heard the few snippets of his radio show that the movie includes I have to ask  why would anyone listen to him? I have to concede that I also found it a bit offensive that apparently within a relatively short time after his wife's death Corbett is out playing the field again. But of course that was necessary to the story.Overall it's dated but still an enjoyable couple of hours.810".

He also didn't touch Eddie when he came home. I am not trying to rant but the movie really lost me as to it's appeal in the sixties or even the 80's or 90's.

	schema:reviewBody "I'd always avoided seeing this partly because of the title The Courtship of Eddy's Father. Seeing the father of some kid named Eddy being courted was not in itself an attractive subject. Then somebody told me that Shirley Jones was yummy in it and an obscure but ovviously puerile impulse forced me to sit through it.It was everything I'd feared. Yes Shirley Jones was pretty and buoyant as always but the rest is terribly dated. Marriage for Glenn Ford's handsome charming steady wealthy widower is on the mind of all the women he meets especially Dina Merrill wearing a black wig to signal us that she won't win the prize. I guess to be fair Stella Stevens as the luscious but stupefied girl in the penny arcade isn't interested in marrying him. The movie wouldn't allow it because it would be infra dig for Ford to show an interest in anyone less wholesome than Shirley Jones.There's no reason this couldn't have been a winner. The presence of a kid not even a cute redheaded little Ron Howard who asks all these precocious questions is not necessarily poison to a movie. And it was directed by Vincente Minelli who knows how to handle this kind of material with aplomb.The Doris Day series that preceded this  beginning with Pillow Talk  were an expression of similar mores. Nice women don't put out and they all want to get married and build a home. The Day series had good gags and funny situations good farces even the sequels. But this? It has an element of melancholy running through it. Ford isn't a reckless bachelor. He's a sorrowful widower and there's too much revolting sentimentality attached to it as if the script wanted us to cry instead of just laugh. Maybe most repugnant is the scene in which the kid goes into a screaming fit because the death of his goldfish reminds him of his mother's death. And the laughs just aren't good enough to compensate for this facile tearjerking. Here's an example of a gag.Stella Steven in a tight skirt is on a date with Jerry Van Dyke. They're bowling and he can't bowl so she tells him she going to show him how to do it. She takes the ball bends over and instructs him to keep his hips loose. She wiggles her pert little behind innocently. Do you see my hips? He's gawking at them. It could have been worth a smile if Van Dyke had never taken his eyes from her face and said his lines sensibly as if they had nothing to do with her buns. But as in a cartoon his eyes are bulging out and his lines are emphatic I DO I DO! I'm reminded of a scene in Frank Tashlin's The Girl Can't Help It. Jayne Mansfield she of the mammoth mammaries in a low cut dress and holding two milk bottles at her chest leans over a table and asks Tom Ewell if he thinks she's equipped for motherhood. Ewell with a fixed agonized smile never breaks his gaze as much as he's dying to but replies in a slow and deliberate manner that yes  yes she is equipped for motherhood. THAT'S funny. Courting somebody's father is a pretty crude business when you get right down to it. It needs to be a little subversive to be really successful. Maybe all comedies do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ash Adams wrote directed produced and acted in this very raw story of a family challenged by a life of crime in San Pedro California. While the film has some brittle edges editing flaws that disturb the flow of the story the acting is so fine that these flaws become minor. It is a small budget film populated with some of the finest actors in the business and the result makes for a film that deserves more attention than it received in the theater. Chance Brian Presley in a career changing role has been released from five years in prison for a crime in which he took the blame for a number of his friends and family. Upon release he discovers that his exgirlfriend Kat Alison Eastwood gave birth to their son August while Chance was in jail. Kat promptly walks out on Chance and August leaving Chance to parent a child he didn't even know he fathered. Chance's friend Beat Chad Lindberg is a damaged man having witnessed with Chance the brutal slaughter of a man by Chance's father Liam Ed Harris a man who has been in prison since and has become the leader of the Aryan Brotherhood. Beat has a debt that must be paid and pleads with Chance to do one more Cocaine sale for dirty cop Rath Ash Adams to free himself from that debt and get on with life. Chance wants to turn his life around tries to pay off Beat's debt by participating in a knuckle fight for the operator Eddie Peter Weller but when he loses the fight all bets are off. Chance visits his blind aunt Rose Amy Madigan and her friend Sue Sharon Gless and Rose insists Chance visit his father Liam in the jail. Chance also becomes attached to a friend of Kat's named Pearl Taraji P. Henson and Pearl helps Chance to find fatherhood with August and a relationship with her. From all of these setups come encounters that alter the story with realistic views of the corruption of San Pedro as well as a coming together of Chance and his father whose turbulent family history is revealed at the end of the film. The cast is excellent Ed Harris Amy Madigan Taraji P. Henson Peter Weller Ash Adams Chad Lindberg and especially Brian Presley give high quality performances as do the supporting cast members. This little film may be tough and raw but the underlying importance of family is strong and well worth attention from a wider audience. Grady Harp".

Apart from these problems Chance has just found out that his exgirlfriend Kat Alison Eastwood  Tightrope has been raising his child while he was in jail but now decides to split and leave the kid with him all the while Rath is hassling him Beat and Liam.Chance gets some help from his old pal barowner Eddie Peter Weller  RoboCop who in return expects Chance to do some streetfighting for him. Random fights is the only job Chance can get apart from dealing drugs but as he now has a young son to raise and recently finds new love in Pearl Taraji P. Henson  Hustle  Flow who just happens to be black  something Liam's fellow Aryan brothers certainly doesn't approve of and they send their number two Sonny Peter Greene  Pulp Fiction to tell him about it in person.The thing about this film that makes it fall beneath the cracks of goodness is the sheer lack of common sense. For starters it doesn't make any sense that 1 Liam became the head of the Aryan nation but doesn't seem very wellliked by ANY of the other Aryans. 2 Chance's girlfriend just leaving her son with him  an almost complete stranger  after raising the kid for 5 years! 3 The part about Rath ending the way it did  made NO sense whatsoever. In the end it all just feels like the story could've gone in SO many other directions which would've been better. And the producers had an allstar stellar cast of characteractors which they didn't use for anything at all! I mean the movie has Richard Tyson Kindergarten Cop Antonio Vargas Starsky  Hutch Jesse D. Goins RoboCop Sticky Fingaz Onyx Rance Howard Ed Wood and Steve friggin' Railsback Lifeforce and a LOT of other great characteractors but they're all just completely WASTED in this production only half of them getting any lines and the rest just appearing in a few minutes with hardly any screentime at all... it makes no sense not to use any of them for anything.. why not just cast some random unknowns instead?I felt like a good opportunity was missed here. Some of the points came across well but mostly it was just wasted.".

His father Liam Ed Harris is currently in prison for beating a man to death and has been elected head of the Aryan Nation which gives him certain privileges but also some obligations that he must fulfill.Chance's best friend Beat Chad Lindberg  The Fast and the Furious has a lot of psychological problems and is currently involved with a notorious drugdealer Rath Ash Adams  Lionheart who also happens to be a crooked cop and doesn't take no for an answer. Apart from these problems Chance has just found out that his exgirlfriend Kat Alison Eastwood  Tightrope has been raising his child while he was in jail but now decides to split and leave the kid with him all the while Rath is hassling him Beat and Liam.Chance gets some help from his old pal barowner Eddie Peter Weller  RoboCop who in return expects Chance to do some streetfighting for him. Random fights is the only job Chance can get apart from dealing drugs but as he now has a young son to raise and recently finds new love in Pearl Taraji P. Henson  Hustle  Flow who just happens to be black  something Liam's fellow Aryan brothers certainly doesn't approve of and they send their number two Sonny Peter Greene  Pulp Fiction to tell him about it in person.The thing about this film that makes it fall beneath the cracks of goodness is the sheer lack of common sense. For starters it doesn't make any sense that 1 Liam became the head of the Aryan nation but doesn't seem very wellliked by ANY of the other Aryans. 2 Chance's girlfriend just leaving her son with him  an almost complete stranger  after raising the kid for 5 years! 3 The part about Rath ending the way it did  made NO sense whatsoever. In the end it all just feels like the story could've gone in SO many other directions which would've been better. And the producers had an allstar stellar cast of characteractors which they didn't use for anything at all! I mean the movie has Richard Tyson Kindergarten Cop Antonio Vargas Starsky  Hutch Jesse D. Goins RoboCop Sticky Fingaz Onyx Rance Howard Ed Wood and Steve friggin' Railsback Lifeforce and a LOT of other great characteractors but they're all just completely WASTED in this production only half of them getting any lines and the rest just appearing in a few minutes with hardly any screentime at all... it makes no sense not to use any of them for anything.. why not just cast some random unknowns instead?I felt like a good opportunity was missed here. Some of the points came across well but mostly it was just wasted.";

Everything is OK  music shooting story action feelings space for viewers to muse about relations and such. I wonder why so many people give relatively bad rating it's just very nice movie.

Give it a chance if you are not eager to watch big Hollywood blasts and chases but realistic story of people on the edge of society but still part of it.".

The only watchable factor is that you want to see what happens to the main character whose trying to go straight but apart from that I didn't find it that interesting. Disappointing!RoundUp At the age of 64 Ed Harris is still churning out movies with great performances. From Pain  Gain to a brief role in Gravity he still makes some decent movies but a lot of them go straight to DVD. He has a unique cool way of acting which is great to watch but he has made some bad choices of late. I was surprised to see Sharon Glees who used to play Cagney in Cagney  Lacey but she only had a small role without much lines. I think that everyone thought that she would have been a bigger star than she was. As for this movie it started off well and the storyline looked promising but it went downhill after the main character came out of prison.I recommend this movie to people who are into their dramacrime movies about a guy who comes out of prison and tries to go straight now that he has to look after his 5 year old boy but he keeps on getting pulled in the wrong direction. 310".

This is Ron Shelton.  Sure he cowrote THE GREAT WHITE HYPE which was disappointing but he didn't direct that one.  He did write and direct BULL DURHAM WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP COBB and TIN CUPwell he cowrote the last one but let's not split hairs all great sports movies so he could probably do a boxing movie in his sleep. Well unfortunately that's what he seems to have done in this disappointing movie.Shelton was reportedly inspired by a truelife fight where the preliminary match also turned out to be much more compelling than the featured attraction which would seem tailormade for him.  And like the other Shelton heroes the characters of VinceHarrelson and CesarBanderas aren't among the great ones though they've flirted with greatness. Finally certainly the idea is right in place that the point is not who of these best friends wins the fightwithout revealing the ending I will say it's not only logical but feels right but the fact they each got this last shot and put on a good show.  The problem until the fight scenes is the execution.Shelton usually has a gift for dialogue and character especially when romantic comedy is concerned but he seems to have mislaid it here.  Vince and Cesar are pretty much ciphers from the beginning despite the obvious chemistry Harrelson and Banderas have between them.  There are traits which are mildly funnylike the fact that a boxer would watch soaps but nothing that adds up.  Even the fact that Vince is a Jesus freak seems incoherent rather than part of the character.  And the dialogue between them except in the scenes when they're talking at the same time seems lame relying on easy homophobia and vulgarity rather than being funnycompare that to the clever trash talk in WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP.  And even when Davidovich enters the picture though she gamely tries she's got nothing to work with and seems oddly mismatched with Banderas.  Harrelson at least she seems comfortable with but they don't have enough scenes together.The fight scenes are where Shelton finally comes alive.  The behindthescenes details of how the fight gets into place and such are familiar but wellhandled.  And the fight is compelling to us so it's believable that the rest of the arena would find it so as well.  We see the fighters being given advice but since they think they know each other they sometimes ignore it to do their own thing.  And you really believe at the end they're both fighting on pure adrenaline.  Even Davidovich becomes believable here as she realizes she loves both of them and while she understands they need this can't bear to watch them hurt each other.  Yet even here Shelton messes up.  There are too many TA shots which are supposed to reflect how the fighters' minds are fogged up but are more likely there to get people to hoot.  Ultimately I hope this is a blip on Shelton's career rather than a sign he's losing it.".

	schema:headline " Good boxing weak characters";
	schema:reviewBody "Play It To The Bone' is really two movies.  One is a movie about boxing and the other is a comedic character study of the boxers.  As a boxing film it succeeds nicely.  As a comedy it has its moments.  As a character study it hits the canvas hard.The storyline was sort of Rocky' times two.  Two washed up middleweight boxers Vince and Cesar Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas who are also best friends get a last minute chance to fight in Las Vegas on the undercard of a Mike Tyson heavyweight bout when the two scheduled fighters are unable to fight.  They are promised that the winner will get a chance to fight for the championship but they have to be in Las Vegas tonight.  The trouble is they have to fight each other.So they climb into a car with Cesar's girlfriend and Vince's exgirlfriend Grace Lolita Davidovich and drive from L.A. to Las Vegas.  Most of the rest of the movie is about the drive followed by the fight.Director Ron Shelton has had quite a few sports oriented success stories to his credit Bull Durham White Men Can't Jump and Tin Cup.  The best part of the film was the boxing.  The boxing was well choreographed and both actors were athletic and fought like real boxers.  Shelton was also excellent at creating the feel of a boxing match.  Anyone who has ever watched an HBO bout will recognize ring announcers Jim Lampley Larry Merchant and George Foreman.  Mike Tyson made a cameo as well as numerous celebrity boxing fans Kevin Costner Rod Stewart Wesley Snipes and a host of others.  The makeup for the cuts and puffiness was also very realistic.Unfortunately the rest of the film was not as good as the fight.  Shelton spends a good deal of time developing the characters but it is all for naught because they have no substance.  They are two hapless jocks obvious mental lightweights who spend most of the trip to Las Vegas fighting over Grace cutting up and strutting around like peacocks.  Shelton takes great pains to try to make us love these characters equally by making them equally pathetic.  But that doesn't work because it leaves the audience without anyone to pull for in the fight.  The ending is utterly predictable and the film whimpers off into the sunset with no more than a stagger.Banderas and Harrelson both gave journeyman performances.  They had good chemistry and some decent comedy between them but there was nothing special here.  The best performance by far was by Davidovich who transcended her normal sex kitten role and took command of the entire film with a character that was a flaming bitch on wheels.  She was smart tough sexy and manipulative and dominated every scene.  Once again she shows that she is talented as well as attractive which makes me wonder why she has never gotten more substantial roles.This is a tough one to rate because it does some things very well and other things poorly.  I gave it a 610.  It had some good comedic moments but not enough of them.  It had some excellent boxing scenes but a disappointing outcome.  And the character study simply failed due to vacant characters. If you like boxing Harrelson Banderas or especially Davidovich you will enjoy this film.  Otherwise enter at your own risk.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you think of sports films one name comes to mind Ron Shelton. Five of his last six directorial efforts not to mention writing efforts like Blue Chips have been about sports. Bull Durham of course is his touchstone film but White Men Can't Jump and Tin Cup are both excellent. Baseball basketball golf and now with Play It to the Bone boxing. But are they really sports films or are they simply characterdriven comedies that use the sports world as a backdrop?Only Shelton knows if it's intentional but almost all of these stories follow a similar formula he takes three characters two men one woman who are all different things to each other. Sometimes it's a love triangle sometimes it's notbut the woman always has a lot to teach one of the men in particular Susan Sarandon's character in Bull Durham to Tim Robbins' Rosie Perez's character in WMCJ to Woody Harrelson's etc..One of the men is a washed up hasbeen or neverwas and the other is the egomaniacal flavorofthemonth Kevin Costner and Don Johnson in Tin Cup Costner and Robbins in Bull Durham. The lone woman always uses psychology to enlighten the men on how to play the Game better both of sports and of love Rene Russo's character in Tin Cup is a psychiatrist. The entire story is about the contrast between the men's and the woman's view of life. Somehow the woman always ends up the wisest of the three while the men are allowed to behave irrationally because that's what men do. In the end she finds that one of them is hopeless and chooses him because of it. A woman never met a man she couldn't fix at least not in a Ron Shelton film the exception being WMCJ Rosie Perez' character does actually leave Harrelson's.Play It to the Bone is more of the same. This time however both men are washedup hasbeensboxersVince and Cesar Harrelson and Antonio Banderas. They both have a lot of kinks to work out in their lives. The only issue either of them acknowledges at first is moneythey have none and are offered fifty grand apiece to fight as replacements on a Mike Tyson undercard. The two are best friends both have been ranked as middleweight or super middleweight boxers but they've never met in the ring. Instead of flying to Las Vegas they drive from Los Angeles in Cesar's girlfriend's Lolita Davidovich car.Davidovich plays Grace the aforementioned allknowing woman a Ron Shelton staple. She's dated both Vince and Cesar and knows exactly what buttons to push. She knows what makes each man fight better and over the course of the road trip that eats up the film's first two acts brings each to the proper mental state.Play It is like a rubber band you keep pulling it back farther and farther building up the tension until it's ready to break then release. When the opening bell of Vince and Cesar's bout rings Shelton's rubber band snaps. Grace's intention was for the two to fight each other and for both to do well allowing each to unleash some of the frustrations they have in their lives. Her mistake was thinking that either man would hold back. By the fifth round when they've beaten each other's faces bloody we see the two aren't fighting each other any more they're fighting themselves. Every woman knows that men don't talk about what's really on their minds. I admit it We men generally deny what is true about ourselves until we're ready to explode. Shelton has a way of hitting the bullseye when it comes to human interaction and does so again here.The film's centerpiece the final fight is exciting and entertaining. It's more visual than anything Shelton has tried. As the men fight they have visions that represent their respective life struggles. I found myself missing the Shelton of old the one that just told it straight. Everything just felt more free and fun loose. The story was always a freeforall a game with no rules where absolutely anything can happen. With Play It he seems too intent on making a point and becomes gasp a filmmaker. The story actually has gulp structure whereas his others were directionless but in a good way. For once Shelton wrote the characters rather than letting the characters write themselves.Mr. Shelton leave structure to the hacks and keep making great films.Grade C".

What was the epiphany reached and what was the point of characters like Lucy Liu being in the story?  90 of the film is spent during the car ride to Vegas which is good and bad it gives a personal touch to a movie yet does get kind of old after a while.  I like Woody Harelson's character bc I can relate to him in a lot of respects.  One thing I found unrealistic no chick would ever ditch Antonio 'de sexy' Banderas I almost laughed when she 'broke up' with him.  Antonio also looked a little weak for a boxer but the fight scene in the end was not effected by it.  The end is actually the best part of the movie yet it is very predictable.  Overall not a bad friday night movie if you have some time to kill and a few beers to pounce. 610".

	schema:headline " It looks to the journey as the focal point but the writing is far too bland and underdone to make it interesting";
	schema:reviewBody "With the Tyson fight coming to Vegas organisers Hank Goody and Joe Domino have put together quite a few big names on the undercard. However when one of their fighters turns up drugged out with two hookers and his opponent is pronounced dead at the scene of a car accident they are forced to try and rustle up two fighters with a few hours notice and turns to friends Vince and Cesar. Taking the offer the friends set off with Cesar's girlfriend to make the trip to Vegas for the fight  a trip that sees them learning more about one another while also trying to prepare to try and knock each other out.I looked at the cast list for this film and wondered why such a film had managed to come and go in the UK without me even having heard of it. So many wellknown actors a big sports director and loads of star cameos  surely it must be great well in a word no. This is not to say that it is awful because it isn't it is just that the writing is nowhere near good enough to sustain the film and as a result the film is never engaging on any level. The film has a fight over the final 30 minutes including set up but the majority of the film sees us riding in the car with the three main characters. This focus puts a lot of onus onto them as characters and their stories to be interesting and engaging  the dynamics and the history in that car needs to be the edge to be the hook that kept me interested. It has its interesting stuff but major things like Grace's relationship with the two men but it doesn't do anything with it whatsoever. Even during the fight her split emotions are made very clear but the actual script never bothers to develop it or make it more than very obvious padding. Sadly the majority of the dialogue was just bickering that didn't develop the characters at all and made their stories just fall flat in the telling because we don't really care about them. Bickering as White Men Can't Jump showed us can be fun when it is delivered as a source of comedy but here there are no laughs because it doesn't seem to want to be a comedy either. Its target seemed to have been a character sports film with laughs  but it pretty much misses all of those.This is not to say that the actual fight isn't fun because it is pretty enjoyable if you like that sort of thing. Yes it is all a bit unrealistic but it is pretty exciting at points and only gets silly at key moments. It isn't a great fight but it is at least a relief to get away from the empty bickering of the majority of the film. Sadly it ends on a low point and then drags back into the empty script again for about 10 minutes before just ending without really telling us anything. Physically Harrelson and Banderas both look good  although Woody looks the buffest and is an imposing presence. Sadly he just plays his usual character and without the material he is exposed. Banderas tries harder to bring some character out in his role but he is just shadow boxing because the script is not there with him. Davidovich is OK but it is evident that she had no idea why her character feels for both the men or why it is so persistent  nor does she know what to do with it and although light and fun she alone cannot add substance. Lucy Liu is annoying and seems only there to fill time flash flesh and fake an orgasm for the audience. Sizemore is fun but obvious as is Wagner but both men are very underused. The cameos all roll in at the end of the film but other than saying 'oh look it's' they don't really add anything.Overall this is a pretty poor film. It could have been better if the writing had developed the characters and made the dialogue relevant and interesting instead of just making it a load of bickering but it didn't. The fight is enjoyable but mainly because it is a welcome break from the average stuff that has gone before but fans of boxing will scoff at it even if it is quite fun for the most part. Generally it is a missed opportunity with an average script and no real aspirations not bad just really weak.".

	schema:reviewBody "A boxing film from minor or no league sports milieu chronicler Ron Shelton Bull Durham White Men Can't Jump with the not exactly untested talents of Antonio Banderas Woody Harrelson Tom Sizemore Robert Wagner Richard Masur Lolita Davidovich and Lucy Liu. What's wrong with this picture? Nothing once you get to the last third and the actual fight ensues. It's the first 90 minutes that's not quite a knock out. In our overly commercialized and celebrity athlete obsessed world culture Shelton has made a career out of showing us the world of the alsorans and jumped and hit and thrown etc.. For every record breaking multimillioned contract holder making even more telling the world to guzzle the Gatorade there's a hundred guys like Durham's Crash Davis trying to eke out one more season before taking a job at the sports shop or hardware store. This is Bone's big stumble not really establishing what kinda of lives these two hasbeens lead now that they are reduced to working as sparring partners at a noname local L.A. gym. Shelton would have written this a whole lot smarter if he had picked a venue he knew better back east say New Orleans or St. Louis for Banderas' Cesar and Harrelson's Vince to hail from. It would have made the road trip a helluva lot more interesting visually moving through prairie to mountains to desert. Instead we get dried brush and rocks as back drop for Cesar and Vince's back and forth that is supposed to tell us who they are. And who they are isn't all that interesting which is what's going to doom this film with audiences. This is story that starts off in the most contrived way. In a chain of events that starts with the undercard of a Mike Tyson fight in Vegas getting hopelessly stoned and haplessly dead respectively we are then asked to believe that the promoter would even in panic call two guys who don't even really fight any more. The film really needs the audience to believe and believe in these guys after this and Shelton fails to make Vince and Cesar unique enough. People might plunk down their eight bucks for a flick with stupendous special effects but a great fight? Which is the one thing that Play It To The Bone has  a helluva fight. For filmgoers who thought the book had been written on showing a boxing match with either the high art stylization of Raging Bull or the pop art sequences of the Rocky franchise prepare for the most brutally realistic display of the sweet science yet shown. In a sequence that uses a refreshing paucity of slowmo shots we are taken through ten rounds of sympathyweltraising fisticuffs. At least we know the time Shelton didn't spend on researching his characters wasn't wasted hobnobbing with Tyson and the other reallife boxing personalities who pop up in cameos during this section. It was spent watching God knows how many hours of old boxing film.The sequence also manages a subtle commentary on the empty spectacle of such event sporting events as the oblivious main event crowd gets sucked into Vince and Cesar's career defining contest. Here's what a boxing match is supposed to be about two hungry guys out to prove they are top dog. And right up to the conclusion Shelton is on his way to making the first uninspired 90 minutes disappear  then he pulls his last punches and ruins it. This is when the anemic character develpment and unorginality catches up with him. The audience feels suckerpunched going out the door.".

	schema:headline " What could really be done with this film?";
	schema:reviewBody "Warning may contain spoilers and is not very kind to Bette MidlerAs a frequent film goer I have what you may call a virus or a disease.  It is not necessarily a bad one but it is one that definelty controls me in some way.  My disease is what is known as havetoseeeverymoviethatcomesoutinthetheaters. I've had it since I was about 18.  I couldn't help it.  There is nothing better that to sit in a cool theater on a warm summers day or in a warm theater on a cold winters day  more the norm here in Southern Ontario  and kick back with MM's and a Diet Coke and watch the latest instalment of trash that Hollywood unleashes on us.  Because let's face it for every Indiana Jones film there is a film like Double Jeopardy.  For every film like Saving Private Ryan or JFK or American Beauty there is a film like Magnolia and Play It To The Bone.  This is the kind of film that as a seasoned film goer I saw the preview for it in the theater and I groaned silently because I knew there really wasn't much they could with it.  They showed two actors that are great to watch as part of an ensemble cast but way too average to open a film on the strength of their names alone.  They told us that it was directed by the same guy that did Bull Durham and Hollywood has been using that fact to sell Ron Shelton films ever since even though he hasn't done anything good or box office noteworthy since.  They tell us that there is supposed to be some humour by showing us Tom Sizemore as a sleazy promoter doing his sleazy promoter thing and they show us that there may be some sex and some sort of love story because they have a slutty sounding Lucy Lui and a tough as nails sounding Lolita Dovidovich.  And then they have a promised boxing match and a drive across America to get there. And that is what we the public are left with.  Is it any surprise that this film is going to the same kind of business as Silent Night Deadly Night part 7 would if it was released at the theater?  There is no intrigue and nothing that you can really sink your teeth into to make you want to run out and see the film.  People like me don't really count seeing as we have that terrible disease I was telling you about.  The only actors that can cure this disease is Bette Midler and ocassionally Woody Allen but then there is even times when he is powerless against it but not Midler.  She is like Tylenol to a headache she will stop havetoseeeverymoviethatcomesoutatthetheater syndrome every time.  Play It To The Bone is a boring ride with three people where three quarters of the film takes place in a convertable and the three characters are given dialogue about their past their future their vices their lovelives their fears and well you get the picture.  There really is only so much you can do with a film like this.  Very quickly it becomes lethargic and tedious.  I do have to admit that the boxing match was exciting but it was also the same after the second round.  Every time someone gets knocked down they are going to get up at nine and then the fight will continue and eventually the noncaring sparse crowd is going to really care for the two combatants in the ring.  Can you say Rocky vs. Drago all over again? Folks seriously Stallone and Scorsese did it better and to try improve or to even emulate what they did is futile.  Ron Shelton had one good film and he has been living off that reputation ever since.  I have said it before and I'll say it again..... if you can make one good film in Hollywood then you have a grace period of usually five years in Shelton's case it has lasted about a decade.  This film is boring pretenscious and tiresome. Unless you have this terrible disease that I suffer with then my advise to you is to stay away.  Or look for the next Bette Midler film.3 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "Warning may contain spoilers and is not very kind to Bette MidlerAs a frequent film goer I have what you may call a virus or a disease.  It is not necessarily a bad one but it is one that definelty controls me in some way.  My disease is what is known as havetoseeeverymoviethatcomesoutinthetheaters. I've had it since I was about 18.  I couldn't help it.  There is nothing better that to sit in a cool theater on a warm summers day or in a warm theater on a cold winters day  more the norm here in Southern Ontario  and kick back with MM's and a Diet Coke and watch the latest instalment of trash that Hollywood unleashes on us.  Because let's face it for every Indiana Jones film there is a film like Double Jeopardy.  For every film like Saving Private Ryan or JFK or American Beauty there is a film like Magnolia and Play It To The Bone.  This is the kind of film that as a seasoned film goer I saw the preview for it in the theater and I groaned silently because I knew there really wasn't much they could with it.  They showed two actors that are great to watch as part of an ensemble cast but way too average to open a film on the strength of their names alone.  They told us that it was directed by the same guy that did Bull Durham and Hollywood has been using that fact to sell Ron Shelton films ever since even though he hasn't done anything good or box office noteworthy since.  They tell us that there is supposed to be some humour by showing us Tom Sizemore as a sleazy promoter doing his sleazy promoter thing and they show us that there may be some sex and some sort of love story because they have a slutty sounding Lucy Lui and a tough as nails sounding Lolita Dovidovich.  And then they have a promised boxing match and a drive across America to get there. And that is what we the public are left with.  Is it any surprise that this film is going to the same kind of business as Silent Night Deadly Night part 7 would if it was released at the theater?  There is no intrigue and nothing that you can really sink your teeth into to make you want to run out and see the film.  People like me don't really count seeing as we have that terrible disease I was telling you about.  The only actors that can cure this disease is Bette Midler and ocassionally Woody Allen but then there is even times when he is powerless against it but not Midler.  She is like Tylenol to a headache she will stop havetoseeeverymoviethatcomesoutatthetheater syndrome every time.  Play It To The Bone is a boring ride with three people where three quarters of the film takes place in a convertable and the three characters are given dialogue about their past their future their vices their lovelives their fears and well you get the picture.  There really is only so much you can do with a film like this.  Very quickly it becomes lethargic and tedious.  I do have to admit that the boxing match was exciting but it was also the same after the second round.  Every time someone gets knocked down they are going to get up at nine and then the fight will continue and eventually the noncaring sparse crowd is going to really care for the two combatants in the ring.

Harrelson Banderas and Davidovich have great banter during the road trip to Vegas from LA. The fight itself is enjoyable as boxing matches go but the movie put itself in a bind in how it framed the two fighters and the conclusion is a bit predictable. The ending of the movie is a bit anticlimactic. A good movie to watch as a TV movie when you have some time to kill. You get to see which actors were on the rise at the time and who the producers thought would be big celebrities. For example getting Kevin Costner was a big deal in the '90s though by 1999 his star was beginning to fade. On the whole a middling movie.".

Now don't get me wrong it has some nice boxing scenes and both Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas do an excellent job as boxers and friends and have really great chemistry together.

The story is mostly a road trip with Antonio's current and Woody's ex girlfriendpromoter along for the ride and to create conflict. The guys do have good chemistry though and along the way we get flashbacks of their careers and competitive friendship over the years.The final fight in Vegas was the best part of the movie exciting and well choreographed in a Rocky sort of way.

	schema:reviewBody "Play it to the Bone features a great core concept the idea of two friends pitted against each other in a match that looms over every event of the movie. That idea and what could happen leading up to the fight is the great potential this movie just doesn't quite tap. The 3 lead actors were wellcast and have some good interactions with some fun oneliners and fairly believable acting about their characters in regards to how real they were. Their chemistry was good but they weren't given enough to do. I understand they were trying for the minimalist route by making it a simple road film but the driving scenes get to be a bit much and I feel as if the movie could've used more events happening in the trip leading up to the fight making it a bit more of an adventure than a semiserious character study. It does that decently but not well enough to keep the tone from becoming a little dull eventually. I again have to stress that having more wacky and adventurous events maybe not too over the top would've helped the movie and a greater sense that they might barely make it to the fight thus increasing the suspense and the audience's desire to see them make it. In this case extending the road trip over a series of days or a week would've allowed for many events to packed into the same amount of time the hours long car ride takes in the film. There is a cameo from Lucy Liu who essentially only does one thing to really advance the charactersmovie and then doesn't really serve a purpose aside from being a foil to Lolita Davidovich's character and a gratuitous sex scene. They totally missed the opportunity to add another dynamic to the pseudo love triangle that had gotten a little old at that point in the movie. Speaking of cameos there's a good number of surprises from various celebrities and boxing personalities which is fun and adds authenticity to the boxing. Speaking of the boxing it's definitely a refresher after the road portion and one thing that Play it to the Bone does well is creates a sense of nervousness before the big fight. I liked the sense of unease they established before the fight began it really spoke to both character's feelings about the fight and having to do this. The fight itself is not bad considering that for most of the movie you might not buy Harrelson and Banderas as boxers even middleweights. However their prepwork does show and the boxing is much more real and technical than in the Rocky films and many other boxing movies. The problem with the match however is the camerawork pacing and choreography. Without spoilers the tension built to the fight is spoiled on very very repetitive unimaginative choreography.The ending is arguably the weakest part about Play it to the Bone. Everything is left unresolved with the worst of the end of the movie events going to Davidovich's character. Events I thought would lead to a large brawl filled climax instead end on a whimper that although somewhat realistic is pretty depressing. The actual ending is very disappointing and explained by the observation that there is no real arc or change for any of the lead characters or any character really which is bad for what is largely a character driven piece. None of them change from the results in the movie or have a revelation or improve their relationship they simply play out to the bone their functions in the plot without any true substance. Not making the fight a way for the 2 boxerfriends to resolve something was a huge missed opportunity. Having more conflict between them build up and then get resolved by the end battle would've been great. On a side note the movie hints at but doesn't skewer strongly enough the corruption behind boxing promotion which would've been more bold if fully carried out and provide for more entertaining material. What we're left with is occasionally entertaining but pretty illconceived. Play it to the Bone is watchable and fun but it's an exhibition fight not to be archived in the classics. 6 out of 10 slightly above average.".

	schema:reviewBody "Play it to the Bone was almost a good sport themed film with some good performances by Antonio Banderas Woody Harrelson and Lolita Davidovich. As I said almost a good film because it tries too hard to be a funny experience finishes in a very obvious way and in the end it has nothing much to say.The premise is good and the story has its moments. Woody and Antonio play two boxers who have many things in common both of them were called to a big fight in Las Vegas they're gonna have to fight each other both of them are coming from shameful defeats and they're traumatize with that and both of them dated the same women Davidovich and they're gonna take her along with them driving all the way by car. This part of the film is a road movie with good moments when some of the laughing parts appears when Woody's character shares his about Jesus or his sexual relationship with a crazy nymphomaniac Lucy Liu Banderas goes well in funny scenes where he's dumped by Lolita's character and his story of how he become gay for one year after losing a fight for a gay boxer.When these characters get to Vegas the movie slowed down it becomes a sleepy and not interesting experience although some parts of the road movie doesn't work very well it was difficult to pay attention to some of the things which is quite odd if you consider that this is just a simple entertainment.The third act is the so awaited fight and it drags down for too long starts without any kind of appeal from the part of the extras you can't hear no one cheering in the audience and the cameos from actors like James Woods Kevin Costner Tony Curtis and others who are there to try to make this event more interesting but they don't speak at all and that is disappointing. Some of Woody's delusional moments during the fight were distracting slowed down the fight's rhythm intended to be a funny thing well it wasn't. The rest of the fight and its ending are great but predictable all the way.Master and commander of this film Ron Shelton is a good creator when the deal is to make good sport themed films. He gave us Bull Durham baseball White Man Can't Jump basketball and Cobb baseball again all equally great but from 1996 with his weak Tin Cup golf his career started to slowed it down and Play it to the Bone almost got there along with his best films but it lacked enthusiasm more interesting moments and the sport itself only appears in the ending and in some flashbacks something that doesn't occur in his previous works. Again the principal cast is good it also has some good performances from Richard Masur Tom Sizemore Robert Wagner even though his last scenes were so dull and there's some enjoyable moments but it never recovered his potential. 510".

Those seeking a character driven comedy piece will be turned off by the limited info we receive about the protagonists and the simple plot.Yet there is a certain sweet spot of viewers that are wellsuited for the film. It's important that the audience be enthusiastic about boxing and the lifestyle of fighters as the greatest payoffs come from Banderas and Harrelson's career backstories and ultimate combative showdown. At the same time moviegoers cannot be too pretentious or demand awardwinning plot lines and ideologically challenging messages. Instead it's important to take the film's purpose for what it is to tell the story of two almost washedup guys who learn they've reached a point in their lives that demands they lay everything on the line if they want any chance to still make a name for themselves.The fight scenes are superbly shot and are among the most realistic in movie history. You won't find Sly Stallone and Carl Weathers alternating between haymakers here instead shots are crisp cuts and swelling look brutally realistic and the announcers cornermen and patrons that are so distinctive to boxing's atmosphere are transposed from real life to the screen.This movie will not change your life. You will not be laughing out loud until your sides split. You already need to know enough about boxing to enjoy Play it to the Bone that you probably won't gain any insight about fighters from it. But you'll have some laughs remember some moments and get paid off with some remarkable boxing action at the end of your two hour journey.".

How many times did one of them get knocked down and struggle to barely get up at the count of nine? Too many to count. And in real boxing matches whenever someone struggles to get up at the count of nine it is all they can do just to hang on until the end of the round.

The script is full of funny situations without being that funny touching moments that aren't that touching and characters that come and go in a heartbeat.There were a lot of times in PLAY IT TO THE BONE that I felt like I missed something.  Scenes seemed to skip into one another without mentioning how they got to that point.  At other times I felt the plot points were rushed and therefore lacked substance.  It appears to look like the filmmakers just gave us a quickie reason to move on to other things.  Even the characters seemed to be missed.  Robert Wagner's character shows up briefly with no real reason for being there in the first place.  Some celebrities are there yet they go by so quickly you never really know who it was you were supposed to know.  Even Lucy Liu's character so well advertised in the trailer was only in the film for about 10 minutes total and really served no specific purpose.  She was really wasted in this film role.  Her character shows up for no real reason stays for a few fleeting moments and then goes away.  One gets the feeling that the filmmakers just threw her in because she was an up and coming star.And then finally after over an hour of traveling and meeting people of no consequence we finally get to Las Vegas and to the fight scene... but not before of course fifteen minutes of dressing room thoughts regrets and flashbacks.  Then once we really do finally get to the fight scene between the two friends it is filled with slow moving action in closeups and very bizarre dream sequences.  The whole movie buildup of a climatic boxing match ends up looking like something out of a David Lynch flick.  There was no real action.  No real release of tension.  No real enjoyment to the waiting around for something to happen.  It just results into one huge letdown.And in the end nothing gets resolved.  It has no payoff... for neither the characters or the audience.  The characters could and will still live their lives the same way even if they never did take the trip to Vegas.Perhaps the only thing I found that really worked was the relationship between Harrelson Banderas and Davidovich.  They seemed to perform well over a lackluster script and made the best of what they had.  And their performances did reflect a sincere and caring bond between the three friends.There isn't much to recommend PLAY IT TO THE BONE.  The only reasons would be for the few very few funny moments and the performances of the three leads.  This film is by no means ROCKY.  Then again... it's no ROCKY 3 either.".

That foundation is profoundly rocked when Andrea dies in a scuba diving accident. Although the usual arrangements run smoothly the emotional harm is profound. Giovanni begins to obsessively dwell on the missed chances he had with his son that might have saved his life even blaming his patients. In addition  his wife is inconsolable and his daughter is becoming anti social in their loss. In the midst of this turmoil a secret of their son's life is revealed that provides healing in a way they never anticipated.";

	schema:headline " The sincerity of a reformed satirist";
	schema:reviewBody "s p o i l e r s The Son's Room La stanza del figlio in a way is really two stories.The first rather humorous one more typical of directorwriterstar Nanni Moretti's previous work concerns a somewhat ineffectual Italian psychiatrist played by Moretti himself. Italian' and psychiatrist' sounds like a funny combination to start with. Giovanni the analyst Moretti has a passive Freudian professional persona that sets him up for criticism and even abuse by his egocentric patients. This gently satirical situation underlines the idleness of middleclass people enmeshed in their mostly selfcreated problems.' The second story is the much sadder one of how the psychiatrist's little family Giovanni Laura Morante as Paula his wife and Jasmine Trinca as Irene their daughter lose their beautiful young son and brother Andrea Giuseppe Sanfelice of Gabriele Muccino's Io come te nessuno mai in a tragic accident and must come to terms with their irreparable loss. Both stories are sketched in briefly the family idealized the patients' personalities reduced to types. What surprises is that Moretti's movie achieves real emotional authenticity precisely because if its light Italian touch.The two threads intertwine when Andrea's sudden death leads Moretti's character to realize his psychiatric work is pointless. He quits at least temporarily and some of his patients' reactions are not what we'd expect. We don't know if he'll go back or not. His wife falls apart too husband and wife stop sleeping together and their daughter is so sad and angry she gets herself suspended from her high school basketball team of which she's a star breaks up with her boyfriend and says she doesn't miss him a bit. Giovanni is plagued by guilt because he went off in a car to see a farflung patient in need instead of jogging with Andrea as originally planned and thus preventing him from going diving with his friends. He keeps having flashbacks to what might have been blaming himself the diving equipment and the patient. A metaphor from the priest at the funeral that's meant to be comforting enrages him.Eventually a chance event turns things around. Paola opens a letter to Andrea from a girl called Arianna Sofia Vigliar who met him briefly in the summer and fell in love. She calls the girl and tells her what has happened. Arianna drops by with another boy waiting below who's about to hitchhike to France with her. They take the two youths to the border. Somehow this trip leads the family to emerge from their grief and take a few timid hopeful steps toward a return to living.What makes The Son's Room emotionally convincing is the unmanipulative way Andrea's death is handled. It's completely sudden and unexpected. Nothing is done to pump up the tragedy. The boy had flaws. He has admitted he was involved in a theft at school  but it was only done as a prank. He lacks the will to win at tennis and loses on purpose' in a game the family and Sandro the sister's boyfriend are present to watch. But these minor flaws only underline what a nice handsome likeable young guy he is and help us to feel the survivors' grief with them. Above all the actor playing Andrea simply seems happy. The style itself is the simplest none of the sweeping camera pans flowing music or squealing telefonini of Gabriele Muccino or other contemporary Italian directors.They grieve briefly and intensely. The scene where they take last looks and plant last kisses on Andrea's body before the coffin is soldered and nailed shut is heartwrenching and as sudden mysterious and traumatic as his drowning. The parents and the daughter return to their lives but it's too soon. They aren't ready they haven't had enough time. Such a death doesn't provide any preparation for the process of grieving. They're left shattered and angry and they go through a period of bitterness and rebellion. It's not denial because they have responded immediately to the loss of Andrea with tears and crying. But it's obvious that Giovanni is obsessively trying to replay the events in his mind. The rebellion has to play itself out for some time and this is what we see beginning to end. The movie doesn't say what will happen in the future. It only shows that the family has tentatively begun to live again.What's authentic and good about this little movie is that nothing is overdrawn. Italian restraint prevails. Everyone has been depicted as normal' typical and presentable qualities Italians are more comfortable with than Americans may be but no one is glamorized or falsified. Nothing is done to tweak' the tragedy to make it heavy with foreshadowing or pumped up with excessive details or excitement' or supporting actors. The utter simplicity of the production allows the tragedy to speak for itself simply and powerfully.As a psychiatrist Moretti seems a bit buffoonish as he does in his earlier diaristic films his patients a tad overdrawn particularly a sex fiend portrayed by Last Kiss star Stefano Accorsi. But they'd be tedious otherwise and would detract from the main action. One wonders why Andrea isn't given a few more evident accomplishments aside from looking pretty and being sweet.  But the point here is valid that a teenager is unformed and teenage boys are inarticulate and therefore mysterious. The excellent Laura Morante does splendid work here as the grieving mother. Jasmine Trinca as the sister like the others is appealing and real.Altogether this is Moretti's most emotionally powerful movie and one of his most successful. He yields his former efforts to be conceptual and clever in favor of authenticity and universality and the gamble succeeds.As a person who myself lost a sibling in a tragic childhood accident I find it hard to understand those who scoff at this movie which feels sincere and true to me. Consider this prejudice or specialized knowledge as you like.".

	onyx:emotionText "s p o i l e r s The Son's Room La stanza del figlio in a way is really two stories.The first rather humorous one more typical of directorwriterstar Nanni Moretti's previous work concerns a somewhat ineffectual Italian psychiatrist played by Moretti himself. Italian' and psychiatrist' sounds like a funny combination to start with. Giovanni the analyst Moretti has a passive Freudian professional persona that sets him up for criticism and even abuse by his egocentric patients. This gently satirical situation underlines the idleness of middleclass people enmeshed in their mostly selfcreated problems.' The second story is the much sadder one of how the psychiatrist's little family Giovanni Laura Morante as Paula his wife and Jasmine Trinca as Irene their daughter lose their beautiful young son and brother Andrea Giuseppe Sanfelice of Gabriele Muccino's Io come te nessuno mai in a tragic accident and must come to terms with their irreparable loss. Both stories are sketched in briefly the family idealized the patients' personalities reduced to types. What surprises is that Moretti's movie achieves real emotional authenticity precisely because if its light Italian touch.The two threads intertwine when Andrea's sudden death leads Moretti's character to realize his psychiatric work is pointless. He quits at least temporarily and some of his patients' reactions are not what we'd expect. We don't know if he'll go back or not. His wife falls apart too husband and wife stop sleeping together and their daughter is so sad and angry she gets herself suspended from her high school basketball team of which she's a star breaks up with her boyfriend and says she doesn't miss him a bit. Giovanni is plagued by guilt because he went off in a car to see a farflung patient in need instead of jogging with Andrea as originally planned and thus preventing him from going diving with his friends. He keeps having flashbacks to what might have been blaming himself the diving equipment and the patient.

Kieslowsky for instance filmed all of Juliette Binoches angle shots in Trois Couleurs bleu  like a mother and wife  trying to live a normal life again after the car accident that has taken away her children and husband. La stanza dei figlio is Nanni Morettis viewpoint over the same kind of suffering. A psychoanalyst lives in a small italian town. He appears to be a happy man happily married and a father of two well behaved teenagers. He spends his days listening to complaints from his patients. But the job is one thing the family another thing far from mind games and existencial questions. Giovanni the psychoanalyst has a comfortable and relaxed life. However his young son dies while he was scubadiving in the sea. The movie is about the impact of this fact in the life of Giovannis family mainly affecting his own life. How would he be able to take care of other peoples souls if his own soul had been destroyed? Nanni Moretti wrote directed and played in this simple and sad movie that won the most important prize of the international cinema  Cannes. It is not an easy movie to watch not so much because the screenplay which is direct hardly daring in terms of language. The sons bedroom  brings the audience to point of tears because of the authenticity in which the actors show their emotions and contradictions revealed to the naked eye after a tragedy capable of changing people lives from one day to the next. It is a story about strong relationships and their delicated balance. Those who are thinking of going to see this movie should be open minded to receive all the reduced gestures on personalities portrayed in it. They are looking for something which had been lost within themselves . This is a human tale about how much of us belongs to those people who we have met along our own ways.".

	schema:headline " Breaks no new ground not the slightest bit trendy  I loved it.";
	schema:reviewBody "Affecting drama about a comfortable  perhaps TOO comfortable  Italian family who must deal with the sudden and unexpected loss of one of their own. The Son's Room is directed and written by Nanni Moretti he also stars in the lead role of the psychiatrist patriarch. After watching the movie I Googled a bit about Moretti and learned that the Italians consider him to be their version of Woody Allen. This reputation must rest on an earlier satirical body of work because I found little of Allen's influence here. In fact the way this film critiques psychiatrists and analysis in general Moretti may very well be the UNWoody Allen. I guess I'll have to take their word for it as only two of his films have actually received distribution here in the States. If The Son's Room is any guide we're missing out on a lot.It's not that the film shows us something new in fact the case is rather the reverse. American viewers who remember Redford's Ordinary People may accuse Moretti of plagiarism but he can hardly be accused of plagiarizing the hysteria the hammy overacting and the evidently sincere belief in the utility of psychoanalysis that constitute the primary elements of that earlier American film. In this movie there is no hack writer's fantasy about uptight welltodo WASPs denying their grief or hiding it from their country club friends. The Son's Room is a daytoday chronicle of how a family deals with the grinding course of grief and as such strikes me as an unusual undertaking. Why? Because there are no gimmicks here no deep dark secrets no ethnic shrink one of the Hack Writer's favorite stereotypes to instruct the family on how to be emotional. Heck the hero of the film IS a shrink and they're all Italians! but these facts don't mitigate the agonizing loss of a child. Indeed the family suffers the usual episodes of derangement Moretti breaks things in the kitchen and lashes out at his patients his wife is inconsolable and banishes her husband from the bed their daughter gets in fights on the basketball court. Nope nothing new . . . and perhaps this is why The Son's Room won the Palme d'Or in 2001. It ain't new but it's Real.Even better the movie is not wholly a slog through depression. The mood is lightened by the scenes in the analyst's office in which Moretti listens to a parade of neurotics nattering away about their largely nonexistent problems we get the sexaddict the hypochondriac the obsessivecompulsive etc. Obviously one of the film's main functions is to expose the psychoanalysis racket. Even before Moretti's son dies he never seems inspired by his work never seems to actually help his patients and barely contains his boredom. The movie goes out of its way to demonstrate that when issues of real consequence occur psychiatry offers no anodynes. When one of his patients gets cancer Moretti  in a real unguarded moment after his son has already died  bitterly suggests that mental attitude has nothing to with the chances for survival. And of course Moretti himself finds no professionally applied salve for his pain . . . such amelioration can only come from time and from his family. Psychiatry is obviously useless in these cases it works much better when you don't have any real problems.I want to finish by saluting the fine naturalistic performances by Moretti the lovely Laura Morante as his wife Jasmine Trinca as the teenage daughter and Giuseppe Sanfelice  appropriately closelipped and mysterious with just the right amount of a 16yearold's childish mischievousness  as the son Andrea. I also appreciated the topnotch transitions that Moretti gets from his editor the scenes tend to end abruptly jarring us out of a prolonged involvement with the characters and situations like rude interruptions. This is a fitting editorial style for a film that concerns itself with an ultimate rude interruption.9 stars out of 10.".

This is a film first and foremost about every day life and incidentally about the way things of no great import and little consequence make up the weeks and months of our lives. People drift through. Nobody pays really close attention to the texture of their day because as elections may prove people can get by for years and decades without ever really examining what they are doing how and why they are doing it and the things around them.In the films funniest moment a patient vows to leave her therapy because her visits to the shrink depress her. In the next breath the doctor says Okay see you Tuesday almost as if he hadn't heard her. She agrees in a word and leaves. But he has heard her. Before the death of his son which some other posters here think is the single thing that disables him as a therapist the psychiatrist was droll and more than a little touched by habit in his dealings with his patients.This witty moment sums up the films often sardonic style. Even the patient's complaint is funny. She says that it is common knowledge that the patients of this particular doctor are so relieved by the end of a session that they go buy a new dress or go eat a good meal right after in order to feel better. She says she should tip off her sister so she can set up a shop near his office. Nice dry moment. In fact this film could be called a totally European film experience. Nothing is rushed. We move to the crucial emotional engagement of the story the death of one of the nuclear family at a pace that will bore a lot of people used to a diet based solely on mainstream movies. And when that crucial moment comes it passes by quickly enough and with an oblique focus that would make it easy to miss. We see more of aftermath than the event itself the preparation for burial the anguished postponed call to the girlfriend the efforts to 'do the math' as to why the death even occurred to understand it in purely physical terms. I don't see any dishonesty in the film. At its worst it stretches the heartache and misery on too long. We may begin to feel we are in the midst of an emotional wallow. Stopped just short of Spielberg style manipulation.Then deliverance if that's what it is comes in the form of a visit from a girl the family has taken to be the deceased son's fledgling girlfriend. Meeting her for the first time they embrace her warmly as a member of the family insisting she spend the night and go out on the town with the remaining members of the family. She pulls back a bit and tells them she is hiking to France with a friend who is downstairs waiting for her. The friend is a him. They agree as a courtesy to drive her and her friend closer to a major highway and let them off. This intothenight trip provides the balance and the return to normalcy the family needs. In the resilience of youth there's a lesson to be learned that is always too pithy when stated verbally aloud but it is this Life goes on.The Son's Room is about human resilience and about the unexamined life perhaps. It takes us to these places without being too pat or too Hollywood. Ten stars. See it.".

We all have had those moments where we've second guessed ourselves over life's crucial decisions and the way it is was done was just so natural that you didn't feel cheated in any way that you had foreseen his reaction because you foresaw it on the basis of your own experience...you can imagine the exact same thoughts going through your own head counting the seconds before you say yes and wishing you had said no...One comment on the question of psychoanalysis as many comments seem to suggest that Moretti is panning it. I hold no brief for the practice but I don't think that's what he's saying. The people are feeling real pain. Some are yes just the ordinary neurotic. But others are the sex addict who as he says is not well and knows it. And Moretti does help the patients...he doesn't seem to realize it himself but in the end the woman who says ...I'll wait for you I'll make it my next date is representative of the good he has done her. Moretti has given the man who has cancer the means to face up to it instead of bemoaning his own life.

I try to write down what I think but somehow I prefer scribbling some jargon on a note pad... there are also a lot of hidden details to previous films that you have to watch out for with your eyes wide shut. The images haunt you and leave you mourning. Ecstasy for having encountered cinema at it's most powerful. How to portray pain in film? the symptoms of anguish? the rituals involved... The most striking scene for me is at the fairground. It hits you like a freight train and leaves you mesmerized for the second half of the film. The son's room is at the bottom of the sea on the surface of an instant photo a secret path though many a different door... Press replay on what is not past nor future but pure emotion of imagining what will never be love streams the loneliness of long distant runner... Tragedy and crisis individual and social and it's many other meanings! have always been present in Nanni's cinema but here he's reached an unprecedented maturity. One minor flaw is the stereotypical portrayal of the patients treated by Moretti playing a psychoanalyst. It's a little too predictable for such an original filmmaker although I'm well aware that the patients are all movie projectors projecting the artist's own constant obsessions. I do hope English speaking viewers will have a chance to see it.".

This man still wants sex with his wife after 25 years of marriage this fact alone is enough to scare you off.

The actors are wooden except the daughter and some patients....would you want this guy for a psychoanalyst? maybe a hairdresser or someone taking your order at McDonald'sis it that he looks dumb or the scrip is dumb or he can't act? Of course it doesn't help that the director has the actors freeze in full face emotional meaningful poses 5 times a minute.After writing this I noticed that the writer director and main actor are all one and the same Nanni Moretti. I didn't like him in any of those roles.It always amazes me which movies win all the prizesthese awards are basically meaningless barometers for assessing a movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes watching a lot of famous awardwinning or cult films can be desensitizing and you start to wonder why you fell in love with cinema in the first place. Then along comes a film like The Son's Room! This is a film I didn't even want to see. I didn't like Ordinary People and I thought this would be a ripoff and a boring film. Instead it blew me away completely. The Son's Room is one of the most heartfelt and moving films to come out in the past decade. It is an emotional rollercoaster and as a viewer I was part of the ride all the way.Much of the credit has to go to writerdirectorproducerstar Nanni Moretti. The story he has crafted is admittedly not unique. But the treatment is beautiful. Like the family I as a viewer lived the entire experience of the loss  the denial the breakdown the pain and the coming to terms with a terrible family tragedy. The tragedy itself comes as a big shock. All this despite the fact that its not an event or plot based film. Its a gently paced story of normal people leading normal lives. There is nothing brilliant about the lives of the central characters or their interests. Even the patients of psychiatrist Giovanni are very ordinary and their problems and lives are actually quite mundane because they are lazy and selfish.Moretti's direction is superb. I loved the camera movements. When you see this notice the long steadicam take near the beginning of the movie when Giovanni comes home. There is a similar shot close to the end. But so much has changed. Music plays a central role in the movie. There is the music score which is lovely. After the tragedy the tempo slows down and it moves from wind instruments to the piano and really has a major psychological impact. One of the best scores in modern times. There is a 1970's song By This River towards the end and if you watch the movie you'll understand how appropriate it is. Moretti's brilliance in writing and directing this lovely film would have been more than enough. But he is also the central figure in the movie and gives a wonderful restrained performance. I'm talking Anthony Hopkins Remains of the Day caliber. In fact all the performances were very natural and realistic. No star turns  just total emphasis on the story. This is a rare and very special achievement.".

	schema:reviewBody "I rented La Stanza del figlio on DVD expecting a mediocre probably enjoyable mainstream family melodrama.  I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent acting the wellcrafted story line and above all the thoughtprovoking denouement and ending.SPOILER FOLLOWS  By offering a lift to the dead son's girlfriend of brief acquaintance who at first hadn't even wanted to meet her friend's parents and her new boyfriend the boy's grieving parents find themselves unexpectedly performing a kind of fitting memorial service for their missing son.  The psychiatristfather probably an atheist though this is not explicitly brought out had objected to the Mass offered for his son.  Now stretching their legs just after dawn at the French border it seems the family may be attaining a new level of understanding in their grieving process.  Sometimes the gift that a person leaves us by his or her death may be an enhanced ability to understand and help others.  I believe this is what the family in the film are about to experience.  The more I reflect on it the more I am pleased by this unusually appropriate ending so many films are wrapped up too tidily too happily or just have endings tacked on.  In this case the ending is undramatic yet has the nature of a Joycean epiphany and that's what we often experience at key moments in our own lives.I was amused by the hostility of the dad's psychiatric patients and the compassion that one in particular showed him.  Some of this behavior should seem familiar to anybody who's particpated in psychotherapy for any length of time.  A good psychiatrist learns from his patients as well as the other way round and I got the impression this man ought to return to his practice.  He obviously has a lot to give.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a well crafted film. The actors are good especially the women. However the script is less than inspired. In the first part of the movie we are introduced to Nanni Moretti a happily married psychiatrist with two teenaged children a daughter and a son. Then the son dies in an accident. Given that scenario in the normal course of events you would expect despair denial guilt what ifs marital difficulties the questioning of life goals and so forth. And that is exactly what you get. The ending did supply some ambiguity. Just when you though the family was on the road to acceptance and coming back together they are seen walking on the beach with each one going in a different direction. Nanni's dilemma with staying in his job is nicely set up by several scenes showing what he has to deal with as a psychiatrist. If what is presented is a typical cross section of patients then it would seem inevitable that a major life crisis would precipitate the shakedown in Nanni's professional life. In fact Nanni was showing some signs of feeling ineffective in being able to help his patients before the tragedy. After having seen what it is like from the other side of the couch I came away from this movie wondering how a psychiatrist can avoid early burnout.With scenes like the family's last viewing of the body in a casket before it is sealed it is hard to avoid getting wrapped up in the tragedy that befalls this family but the emotional investment did not pay off for me in the end. Movies with a similar theme the loss of a child that I found more interesting and engaging are Ordinary People and In the Bedroom.".

It's a drama that despite the cruel events that portraits opens your heart to hope and puts you on the quest for transcendence. As The Mission this new Joffe's film uses the paralel life of two friends to show how difficult it is to make a fair decision while you are under stressful circumstances. Some people may judge this film as the Opus Dei answer to the Da Vinci Code attacks and in a certain sense it is but the film is not a propaganda movie but a deep meditation from an agnostic point of view of the sense of life.".

	schema:headline " Good and deep really interesting maybe not a classic but must seen!";
	schema:reviewBody "Roland Joffe wakes up after two decades of bad cinema. Like a the phoenix bird he come again with interesting cinema.The film is technically quite interesting. It starts with a short sequence that shows the deepest Spanish soul in a lost village near France. This sequence has an impeccable cut and setting and works as introduction of the characters and situation. In my opinion the best sequence speaking as cinema freak. The best thing in the film is the photography which takes the viewer 1920s Spain.The script is also quite interesting. Although the main character in the film is the Spanish priest Josemaria Escriva he is not the protagonist of the story. This makes the film more interesting as it plays with 2 people weighting their importance by their personality and their role in the story. Josemaria is the alterego Manolo both are attractive persons that keep the attention of the viewer which at the end should judge. Another success of the script is the usage of time. The main story happens in 1920 and 1930 but it is told as memories in the 80s when the son of Manolo has to write an article about Josemaria which is going to be canonized by the Catholic Church. Robert discovers that his father came from the same little village of Josemaria and asks to his father about him. The answer give the title to the film there be dragons.Now let's go with the dragons. The makers knew that the film was going to be surrounded by dragons. Opus Dei communism revolution Catholics and the Spanish Civil War... this film has all the ingredients to be a big scandal. The film has the collaboration of some members of the Opus Dei at least 2 of the producers are and the organization has given information and access to the documentation about Josemaria. The film also shows a period of the Spanish history which still is a taboo in this country. In Spain still today there are mainly 2 opposite streams profranquists and prorepublicans. The film success in my opinion to show that as in any war there were no good and bads which has shocked the Spanish population that in both sides there were good and bad people good goals but bad means. My personal opinion is that it success to show the real left of Spain breaking with the franquist propaganda of the left as communist criminals but also breaking the view given to Americans by Hemingway that the left in Spain was the advocate of Democracy and freedom. Maybe the film fails to show the rightside of the war but nevertheless is in my opinion the best representation of the civil war that I have seen in art. Only a nonSpanish could make such a good representation of the Civil War and only a person like Joffe could dive enough to make such a good representation. I like Joffe because he takes a field and goes deep enough to explain the reasons. It was shown in the Mission and in Killing Fields and here we are in front of the same Joffe. I admire him because he forgets his own point of view I have read that he is agnostic investigates and tries to find the keystone. Some people has said that this film is the answer of the Opus to the Da Vinci Code well I think it comes to late because the DVC was released 5 or 6 years ago. On the other hand if it is an answer it works well. The DVC shows us a people that in my opinion is impossible that are real I don't know but I don't believe that in the World are people so crazy for example they are shown flagellating themselves which is also shown in There Be Dragons but in the DVC they are doing so while they know that Christ wasn't God! It makes no sense no one does something like that to offer to a God that they know is not God at all As this the film is full of incoherences on the other hand There Be Dragons shows both what they do not the myth and also explains why In my opinion this is what makes the difference between good and bad cinema when your idea is to speak about real things. I would also like to answer to some of the critics please speak about the film because people wants to know about it. If we would like to know about the Opus we could go to their web page or just write Opus in Google. Here we come to speak about cinema. Also someone said that the rating is not trustful because all the Opus Dei's people will vote 10 well they rate 10 because they liked it as a 10 and have the same right as the people that are not members of the association IMDb works democratically so their vote counts as well. The only problem would be if they vote without having watched the film if the organization has commanded to vote in IMDb but well there are some 150 high votes it doesn't seem to be the result of some strange conspiracy Well my final advice is you will hear a lot about the film. Some people will speak really well about it some really bad and some will just speak about the Civil War or the Opus Dei with this film is gonna be really difficult to know if it is good or not so I suggest you to watch it and make your own opinion. It maybe not one of the best films in the last 10 years but nevertheless it's a must watch.".

It's a deep movie that engages the mind and heart hopefully engaging the viewer to think of the morally pivotal moments in life and the choices made. I think there is a little bit of a Manolo in each of our lives... something each one of us needs to come to terns with. Hopefully as with Manolo there is a Josemaria in each of our paths.

	schema:reviewBody "Roland Joff did not disappoint me with this film. I am a first generation spaniard and I find Joff's portrayal of the Civil War honest and fair. The story is not engulfed by facts of history it takes great care in exploring the mysteries of the characters' backgrounds.On one side we have the historical figure of Jose Maria Escribar tormented in his search for God and holding firmly to his ideals while submerged in a world of hatred and chaos. On the other Manolo haunted by vengeance and confusion fighting without a cause and desperately searching for something he can believe him an answer to his inner chaos. Finally Roberto son of Manolo must slowly unveil the terrible secrets his father has hidden within him and come to terms with finding out who the man that brought him up was.The film explores the senseless nature of war and its consequences the spiral of hatred that slowly engulfs men the repentance for terrible mistakes and the struggle to forgive them. Each character follows a path filled with dilemmas and suffering at the end of which they must fight themselves and their dragons.Technicalwise the film is faultless. There is great care in every scene and as I can testify Joff has done his homework. The detail to which the history and scenery of 1937 Spain has been recreated is astounding. Even so the story talks about people about soldiers never about leaders or politicians. The film captures the essence of human conflict in its most raw form.Do not expect an action packed war film. For those who have interest in the roots of Opus Dei this film will not help you there. It deals with the repercussions of war and strife in people it does not deal with the grander scale of things.If nothing else this film will reassure you that war is and always will be a futile tragedy all victories are Pyrrhic and the aftermath leaves bitter resentment and pain. An interesting perspective in this film is that of the many bystanders who are forced to choose the side they support and so they must be separated from loved ones forever. When a few want war the rest have no say. As long as the hatred of so few is not buried war will rise once more.There Be Dragons is a deeply personal and spiritual film. It is very intense and reflects unapologetically the worst side of humanity. It is true to the title where this film takes you there be dragons.".

Encontrars Dragones is not the official biopic of San Josemara Escriv though everything that is narrated about him in the movie has a historical support. The movie is well directed the photography is excellent and it's recreation of prewar Madrid is simply astonishing. Besides it is a story that compels viewers to consider topics such as forgiveness love hope and goodness. A movie everyone should watch".

My friends described it a powerful and well done movie. I find it particularly appropriate as a reflection applicable to our current political and social fights. I went to the theater with low expectations since the critics were giving really bad reviews. I consider myself as having pretty high standards for movie quality and frankly I cannot make sense of the critics. Probably it is not a politically correct movie so it is not surprise that critics unable to give up political correctness offer many straw man arguments. Beautiful photography plenty of leitmotifs and crossreferences good acting. As a Spaniard living in the US I was glad to see a movie about the war that does not take sides.".

My dad had more money ... but Jose Maria had more dad. Excuse me! And also Like or not most young men were celibate at least as a priest you got paid for it. What? Excuse me! So my advice is really don't waste your two hours trying to stay awake during this if you're interested in the Opus Dei and Escriva De Balaguer find a more serious and reliable source if you only want to go the movies find a better film.

Starting with the purely dramatic aspect you're in for an attempt of the sentimental that tries to follow in the footsteps of a number of past epics without ever succeeding.

Which would be bad enough. But the specific contents and their implications are simply uncomfortable in an unwelcome sense. What is seen of murder and injustice is mainly committed by revolutionaries e.g. the killings of priests the unthinking mobbehavior against a single wrongly accused. While one shouldn't doubt that each side in a civil war 'misbehaves' Franco's forces appear simply as an army in contrast and the only crimes on behalf of that side we see are committed by one of the two main protagonists who in the end receives his personal absolution on the death bed to sweetest music. The red rebells appear to a large part as the barbaric culprits. When this is not contrasted by what else happened the message is morally doubtful. No mentioning either that the pursue of priests had one of its roots in the catholic church indeed collaborating with Franco's regime. Does this excuse the killings? No. Does it help to make the rage a tad more understandable? Yes. But the movie doesn't intend to pay reference to what the above mentioned character called much more complicated. Latest with the end credits we know that it's a celebration of Josemaria Escriva the founder of  Opus Dei??? Yes indeed. And thus we follow the young priest through what the filmmakers intend to call his ordeals. Not that he has the opportunity to realize much action that makes his supposed later saintly status comprehensible. He flees not that he shouldn't hides which is recommendable crosses the Pyrenees where the music reaches its intolerable climax. In between he has terrible moments of doubt which perhaps moves us deeply if we are priests ourselves.

I found it equally fascinating that a man who had once moved audiences with The Killing Fields and The Mission should believe that this overly plain almost amateur feeltoit film  which I had seen the week before  could ever be expected to transmit to postAvatar 3D audiences far less caught up than Roland Joff in the importance and purpose of redemption in modernday society.I for one agree that learning to forgive is essential and that without it we can never find our humanity. Also I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with 'amateur' the word implies love and vocation and I'm good with that. 'Overly plain' however did alltoofrequently smack of 'lowbudget tinny dialogs' and 'shallow performances'  with to some extent the exception of Derek Jacobi.I simply think that people turn to movie theaters for an experience they could never get from multimedia and home cinema and movie theaters agree to deliver such an experience. And though some of the action scenes were not entirely uninteresting and we're honestly not asking for Terminators and Jurassics to make  for general release  an entertaining and viable movie about the value of 'redemption' would appear to be as commercially unlikely as would making a movie about generosity or about humility. Such 'virtues' will either seep through the plot and hit viewers  and hopefully stay with them long  after they have left the theater or they won't! Yet to play such virtues so close to the plot is  I feel  sadly counterproductive from both a storytelling and a filmviewing point of view.Mr. Joff is sure to have enjoyed the experience engulfed  as he will have been throughout the filmmaking process  by this ubiquitous purpose impregnating so many of his thoughts and actions. It's a shame he didn't give a little more importance to his side of this mutual selfishness pact we call 'filmgoing' that way many thousands more might have enjoyed the experience too.".

Enjoyable biographic movie well written and played  being compellingly directed by Roland Joff . Arising out of the terror of the Spanish Civil War a candidate for canonization is investigated by a reporter Dougray Scott who aware his own estranged father Wes Bentley had a deep dark and devastating connection to the saint's Charlie Cox life .This interesting film is full of compelling drama with love  passion and subsequent betrayal  touching scenes  historical events and good feeling . It is a simple  dramatic and intelligent portrait of a time when the Spanish people live taking on among them . This is an agreeable account of the survival of the human spirit against difficulties  an epic portrayal of Faith Forgiveness and Redemption . The movie is plenty of graphic  striking and memorable moments about timeless power of forgiveness and dictating a strong emotional response from the spectator  though some moments is unrealistic . Interesting and thoughtprovoking movie with evident excitement that can sometimes be undercut by inadequacies in the screenplay  being written and adapted by the same Roland Joff . This moving picture results to be a breathtaking spectacle about dramatic consequences of Spanish civil war  including strong emotions  brooding dialog and a heartbreaking final . There be dragons or Encontrars Dragones results to be other of the innumerable stories to deal with dramatic deeds regarding the Civil War background  a familiar theme about the global horrors of a fratricide war  impossible to forget to Spanish cinema . However the story needs a vibration more real than the one offered in this slowmoving and sometimes dull film . But anyway its is compensated with the great performances from main cast as Charlie Cox as Josemara Escriv  Wes Bentley as Manolo Torres as Dougray Scott as Roberto Torres as Rodrigo Santoro as Oriol  Olga Kurylenko as Ildiko and sensational support cast  mostly Spanish  such as Unax Ugalde  Ana Torrent and Jordi Molla  interpreters who provided a considerable boost to the result . Furthermore  a spotless pictorial cinematography by Gabriel Beristain and a willingness  almost perfect of the elements of each shot  every sequence every space .The film develops an intrigue by means of flashbacks and dealing with Jose Maria Escriba De Balaguer's life . The events were the following  during the Spanish Civil War  Escriv was hidden in a psychiatric sanatorium and fled from Madrid which was under republican control via Andorra and France to the city of Burgos held by the nationalist forces of General Francisco Franco. After the war ended in 1939 with Franco's victory Escriv was able to resume his studies in Madrid and complete a doctorate in law. His principal work was the foundation government and expansion of Opus Dei.The motion picture was well directed by the British Roland Joff  being realized in academic style and general coldness  filmed in his usual formal and stylistic scholarship  without leaving a trace the thoughtprovoking issues  in terms of dramatic and narrative excitement . He is a good filmmaker mainly of epic subjects . After a long career filming for television  he made his movie debut in a big way with The killing fields winner of three Oscar and dealing with madness and atrocities committed by humans  Joffe's usual theme. The mission one of his greatest hits  had Palme d'or at Cannes  a graphic monument to Portuguese oppression in SouthAmerica  but Joffe has not quite held his place at the top level . He subsequently directed Fat Man and Little Boy referring to two atomic bombs dropped by America on Japan . Joffe's meagre output for the cinema makes it all the more surprising that he has turned out three splendid films and several others neardisasters such as The scarlet letter Captivity and You and me. Rating Encontraras Dragones  Better than average  worthwhile watching .".

	schema:headline " Radey's infamy. Jancs's portrayal of a cruel bleak torture centre";
	schema:reviewBody "With these early films of Mikls Jancs people don't realise he's still making films with one slated for 2009 and his technique is now totally different where he shows dehumanised power systems there's always a dual interest for me. You get the kind of political comment but you also get the love of nature as a counterpoint I think one observer noted of the Red and the White that the main character was the river Volga. Perhaps he's proffering country walks as an alternative to power games as wise a suggestion as any you'll see in a film.Anyway in the Roundup we have a whitewashed stockade out on the Hungarian plains. One Count Gedeon Radey has been given the task by the Apostolic Emperor of rounding up all the bad sorts the outlaws. This is back in the late 1800s we are led to believe that the monarchy has become ignorant and hardhearted to the populace in the countryside banditry and revolt foment. Radey interns all these bad sorts in the stockade. He wants to find out which of them are undesirables which he does through a series of psychological games. It's reasonably clear that all the men rounded up aren't ignorant thieves one for example has travelled extensively and speaks four languages.It's almost fetishistic the setting you've got an achingly beautiful shimmering plain of grass that reminded me of when I was a child strange sensations linked to nature and storytelling. Then you've got all these military men with their advanced piping tabs epaulets and sabres. The wild birds are trilling throughout the entire film except at night when the cicadas chirp. The wind flutters the black feathered cockades on the hats of the officers. You can feel the flaming June heat radiate off the whitewash. Jancso appears to have fetishistically had the sets reconstructed from drawings in historical documents along with a gibbet that Pasolini would have been proud to display in Salo.We see for example a man being lead out of solitary confinement a soldier asks him his name and the man replies You already know Varj Bla the soldier replies almost lovingly Ah yes Bla Varj you've had many a beating from me haven't you?. Horses ride in circles men are marched in circles insanity abounds. The film is basically an exercise in dehumanisation. For me it's not offering much in the way of commentary unlike the Red and the White which is setting out the aleatory nature of war. The Roundup is perhaps a protest about what went on in the past an ode to the dead who died for a free Hungary.The important person in the film is Lajos Kossuth although you'll never see him. He is one of the famous personages in Hungarian History. He became famous via a series of letters he wrote that were very well received whilst he was a deputy to a Count at the National Diet. He was a liberal of note he wanted an end to feudalism and he wanted taxation of the aristocracy and to remove their right to pass their lands and castles and such like on from one generation to the next without taxation. Anyway he had an interesting life which I'm sure you can read about elsewhere. And his was the spirit of the majority of the interned although there were brigands too. I think it's key to understand history in the movies of Jancs otherwise in this case you might be led to believe that all the prisoners are simply bad people.Radey I believe is only seen once in the film but he stands against the spirit of Kossuth and behind the apostolic emperor.This is not a nasty film in the sense that it doesn't stand up much to the level of horror you would see in a modern exposition on the same subject or anything like the torture porn of current sensation. That for me I think is a good thing. There is one scene though of terrible evil genius. Every day womenfolk are allowed to come to the stockade and deliver food for the prisoners. One man who is threatened with strangulation unless he turns informant peaches to the authorities that one of the women is in league with a rebel leaders she is probably his sweetheart. It is arranged for many of the rebels to be sat high atop the stockade wall perhaps 50ft high. They are then forced to watch this women whipped to death as she runs down a corridor of sadistic soldiers on the open plain. It is too much for three of the men who plunge head first down to their deaths. The techniques of the Radey and his soldiers are ingeniously cruel they make you complicit in your own demise and the demise of comrades they bewilder you. It may surprise you that throughout the entire film the soldiers appear almost gentle.Obviously essential watching.".

	schema:headline " THE ROUNDUP Miklos Jancso' 1966 ";
	schema:reviewBody "I have made of this most notable of Hungarian films a personal holy grail ever since I laid eyes on an illustrated twopage spread found in an old British magazine of my father's entitled The Movie  and now over 20 years later I have finally managed to track the thing down and thanks to the valiant R2 DVD label Second Run add it to my everincreasing eclectic home video collection. For the record despite knowing of its imminent release on DVD I was seriously contemplating traveling to London for last week's bigscreen showing of THE ROUNDUP at the Curzon Mayfair with Jancso' in attendance no less  but alas it is just as well that I didn't go because of what occurred over here a couple of days prior to the event a tragically unnecessary death in the family which worse still turned into a national tragedy with longterm social and legal repercussions to boot. But life pitiless and unjust as it is has to go on and slowly but surely I have now jumped back into my old routine of film watching and reviewing... Although there have been other noteworthy Hungarian filmmakers before Paul Fejos and since Istvan Szabo Miklos Jancso' is still perhaps the most important. Ironically while he was the first one I personally became aware of my viewing of THE ROUNDUP has actually been my very first encounter with his work  although now that the first step has been taken it will be followed by three more in a few days' time. Sometimes it can happen to a film buff that the actual experience of watching the movie about which one has heard a lot and eagerly longed for turns out to be underwhelming but thankfully this has not proved to be the case for me with THE ROUNDUP. Indeed the phrase unlike anything you've ever seen before is often freely banded about by unimaginative film reviewers  but this description is unquestionably apt when applied to Jancso''s masterpiece.In that enticing and insightful article I mentioned above written by Jancso''s first assistant director on the film itself and which I immediately reread upon the film's termination it is stated that while THE ROUNDUP was based on factual events which had taken place in Hungary in 1869 and could have easily been shot on the actual locations of castles and fortresses Jancso' sought a different visual approach altogether with regards to sets and costumes  halfway between reality and abstraction as he brilliantly puts it. Since I found myself wholeheartedly agreeing with other observations he made on the film I don't see why I can't quote him some more It has a coherent easytoread story  comprehensible at a single viewing  and at the same time a deep intellectual almost abstract parable.The abstraction being alluded to is not restricted to visual literally black and white terms alone  where the stark whiteness of the prisonfortress walls and the hooded Hungarian convicts memorably contrast with the black capes and uniforms of the Austrian oppressors  but also to its very narrative style while it becomes clear early on that the subject of the relentless interrogations is the identification and capture of legendary rebel leader Sandor who never actually appears in person but whose presence permeates the entire film people appear and disappear with insistent frequency and although there are definite characters which take precedence over others there is no true main central figure one can clearly identify with and root for.Thematically it is oppression and degradation which are the key elements right from the animated prologue at the start displaying a succession of torture devices we later watch men made to stand in the rain and a woman stripped naked and whipped to death with canes the sight of which sends her despairing spouse leaping to his death. But the oppressors' ultimate weapon of humiliation is treachery through vain promises of instant freedom prisoners  and at one point a grieving mother and later still father and son  are repeatedly induced to betray one another via abrupt silent motions but instead of liberty they are rewarded with a bullet in the back the retribution of their own people and in the supremely ironic finale coldblooded mass extermination. In this context the character of Gajdor is especially poignant and even amusing in a blackly comedic way as he pathetically keeps reminding his captors that even though he has already fingered several worse criminals than himself he is a prisoner still. Interestingly this paradox can also be applied to the ingenious location of the prisonfortress within which practically the whole film is set  rebuilt specifically for this production in the middle of uninhabited plains that stretch as far and wide as the eye can see.Miklos Jancso' is renowned for his rigorous visual style and even from this one sampling of his work  albeit that which is generally perceived as being his chef d'oeuvre  to say that I was rightfully impressed would be putting it mildly. The constantly moving camera on the one hand encircling the prisoners as if it was one of them and encompassing wide vistas of soldiers astride their horses on the other necessarily limits the utilization of closeups to the barest minimum  as if purposefully adopting the impassive stance of an historical observer. For this viewer it literally wove a mesmeric spell the likes of which I have only experienced once before during a movie  Robert Bresson's A MAN ESCAPED 1956 which perhaps significantly also deals with incarceration.".

It was short enough ranked in certain quarters as a classic and had made it onto those most worthy of cinaste lists as an undeservedly overlooked masterpiece. It sounded like one of those films like Koyaanisqatsi that like Twain's classics everyone wants to have watched and nobody much wants to watch one which I would sit through with a lot of deep and meaningful thoughts in my mind which would stay with me for years but be approximately as enjoyable as the last three fifths of all those long form essays on climate change crypto currencies or the situation in the Ukraine I mean to get round to. Some of the write ups on it made it sound as if there was barely any dialogue.In fact though the dialogue is reasonably sparse there are few long scenes without any dialogue. Indeed it is important enough that the subtitles caused me problems. I have been watching films with Czech subtitles for a few years now and have few problems with that from a language point of view. What I do tend to notice though is that the comprehensibility of subtitles varies widely. Sometimes subtitles flash up and are cancelled so quickly you don't have time to scan them. This can be the case even where they are not replaced with others. The viewer in these films begins to distrust the subtitles and scans the text quicker than is natural taking little in even in those moments where the subtitles remain in place. This is far more often a problem than the poor idiom often seen in Czech subtitles. I don't know much about the technology of subtitles but it looked as if the text was applied to the copy of the film in this instance probably many years ago and being essentially burned into the film itself parts of the text disappeared for a number of frames. I missed a number of exchanges because of this and would like to watch the film again with English subtitles for this reason.I'm in two minds too about the need to read up on the background of the film beforehand. As with a Forward in a classic novel I find that knowing too much about a film before first seeing it can detract from its immediacy. With The Roundup though I might perhaps have benefited from knowing a little more. At least with a film and certainly a film of this length I can see it again more easily than I might find time to read a Victorian novel.Knowing as little as I did about the background however it is certainly true that was plenty to keep my interest both on the human level which in places I would have understood better had the subtitles been a touch better and on the visual level. As far as the human level goes there are scenes here that could gainfully be projected in lectures on game theory and the prisoner's dilemma. The psychological methods used by the captors are brutally effective and it is impossible to watch without thinking how well you would fare in such circumstances. Purely aesthetically both the landscape here and the people are so full of character. Jnos Gajdar's face is just one of those that fills the screen and though stoic almost static much of the time speaks of many years of rough breaks and a dangerous contained emotion.They don't make films like this anymore in part because they don't make men like that anymore.".

It is the scene of betrayal of the whole rebel troop until then in disguise which he does in a rather awkward manner.But what powerful devices before that!The main setting is a forced labor camp in the middle of nowhere. We start with a 'real place' the white stucco on adobe walls reflecting barren sunlight. This is gradually abstracted into something else by repetition and time. It is done so well it deserves to be studied.The place as the totality of existence there is no way out people languish in mindless work and routine having to please a higher moral authority that decides life and death. Love is always kept at arm's reach. They are all sinners in that place most of them murderers. It is a bleak view of life very Hungarian but you can work with it. A man who must find another prisoner to take his place in the executioner's scaffold someone worse than him. Someone who has killed more. He does the rounds of the place pleading with officers cajoling betraying a spineless coward despised by everyone.

	schema:reviewBody "Life comes along at a variable pace and we are constantly repositioning our gaze to obtain the optimum information in order to understand the situation we are in. This is replicated in the cinema through the mise en scne and editing of the scenes. Since the 1930s there has been an either explicit or implicit debate as to whether editing within the scene is a good or bad thing with Andre Bazin rooting for the unity of the image against montage editing. Fifteen years before this film Hitchcock set down a marker with 'Rope' and to a lesser extent 'Under Capricorn' that scenes indeed whole films can be made without much in the way of editing by simply organising the action and camera movement to reveal the same information in a more continuous way. Enter Miklos Jancso. With this film he became something of a celebrity in intellectually active film circles by structuring it to be shot in the main in long takes. Does it work? Well it works in one way and that is that it draws attention to the Hungarian plains in which it was shot and which during the numerous long slow pans that we see seem to stretch forever across the landscape. Looking at it again after almost forty years I find it difficult to believe that it made such a big kerfuffle. Long held takes DO enhance suspense  hence Hitchcock's temporary enthusiasm for them  but they seem artificial as they do not mimic the action of the eye which is always on the lookout for something more interesting elsewhere hence Hitchcock's enthusiasm being only temporary!. The 'roundingup' of prisoners that it portrays is an OK subject for a film but I think we would have been much more emotionally involved with the characters if we had been treated to reaction shots and the like. Still see it as a theoreticalhistorical curiosity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Do I believe that some films are only for filmmakers? Yes! This is a film only for the absolute lover of cinema. Not for those who proclaim loudly I love movies! but have never seen a film by Ingmar Bergman Luis Bunuel and Federico Fellini. In fact if you have never heard those three names or if you have only heard those names but are not familiar with their work and are not interested in their work then you are not a lover of cinema and The Round Up is not the film for you!The Round Up is directed by Miklos Jancso pronounced Yahncho who is considered to be one of the first stars of the Hungarian New Wave. Jancso had studied law holds a doctorate ethnography and art history before he entered the Budapest Academy from which he graduated in 1950. The style for which Jancso would become famous a style of extended long takes sustained by rhythmic tracking movements of the camera and optical traveling through the zoom lens was displayed to the world at Cannes in 1966. Incidents of historical events from the Hungarian past are the focus of many Jancso films and is the focus of The Round Up. It is a film about the political police of the Austro Hungarian monarchy as they attempt to unmask Sandor Rozsa the chief of a Rebel army group during the 1848 Revolution which was led by Lajos Kossuth who is now operating as a local bandit. The police round up hundreds of prisoners who are mostly peasants herdsmen suspected outlaws but most of them innocent civilians. From then on the viewer gets to see scenes of interrogation torture and political terror to force inmates into mutual betrayal. This is a film that is aesthetically stark and visually stunning. The mise en scene camera work will impress most filmmakers but their is no linear three act structure storytelling here. This is another reason why I say this is a film only for cinema lovers. What you get from this film is great visual style not a manipulated emotional connection to the story. Yes it is horrific to see scenes of torture but because you don't get to truly know and identify with one or a few characters emotions don't resonate. This film is only to be watched to observe a director with great visual style. The Round Up demonstrates that Jancso was a master of the Hungarian New Wave aesthetic whose cinematic structure was dependent upon widescreen composition the long take and the zoom lens. Introduction of Jancso's mature personal symbols and stylistic obsessions are put forth in this film they include the use of nudity to signify humiliation the totally impersonal depiction of cruelty and violence the menacing image of incessantly circling horsemen on the empty spaces of the plain the balletic choreography of the camera and groups of actors within the frame the replacement of characterization through dialogue with bureaucratic jargon slogans and songs and a densely interwoven music track combining folk and classical melodies with incidental sound. To sum up this is a work for those only interested in seeing great artistic visual style! Works Cited Cook David A. A History of Narrative Film Third Edition 721722 Emory University W.W. Norton and Company 1996".

The film focuses on Christopher Hitchens' charges against Henry Kissinger as a war criminal  allegations documented in Hitchens' book of the same title  based on his role in countries such as Cambodia Chile and Indonesia. Kissinger's story raises profound questions about American foreign policy and highlights a new era of human rights. Increasing evidence about one man's role in a long history of human rights abuses leads to a critical examination of American diplomacy through the lens of international standards of justice.";

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a book by journalist Christopher Hitchens The Trials of Henry Kissinger a documentary by Eugene Jarecki argues that the former U.S. Secretary of State and Nobel Peace Prize recipient should be tried for war crimes for his role in the overthrow of the democratically elected government in Chile in 1973 the secret bombing of Cambodia in 1969 and U.S. support for Indonesia's 1975 invasion of East Timor events that led to the slaughter of millions. Applying the same legal standards to which Pinochet and Milosevic have been held Hitchens branded Dr. Kissinger as a war criminal who should be brought to justice for crimes against humanity. Narrated by actor Brian Cox the documentary is presented in lively 60 Minutes fashion using archival footage background music and a combination of interviews with Kissinger associates and journalists such as Seymour Hersh William Safire and Hitchens himself. The film attempts to maintain a balanced tone but Dr. Kissinger's only defenders are former staff members William Shawcross and Alexander Haig and there are no interviews with Dr. Kissinger himself who refused to be interviewed. A refugee from Nazi Germany Kissinger. rose to prominence in American politics thanks to his realpolitik approach to improving America's power position in the world relative to Russia and China. One of the main contentions of the film is that Kissinger as a member of the Johnson team at the Paris Peace Talks was also a secret advisor to Richard Nixon's presidential campaign of 1968. In that double role he torpedoed the Paris Peace Talks by persuading South Vietnam Premier Thiu to back out of the talks in order to prevent the Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey from taking political advantage of a Vietnam settlement before the election.Another supporting piece of evidence is that Kissinger bombed Cambodia without the knowledge of Congress an action that led to the death of 500000 Cambodians the destabilization of the country and the rise of the bloody Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot. Jarecki also argues that Kissinger's clandestine support of Indonesia President Suharto's invasion of East Timor suppressed an independent movement and led to the deaths of 100000 Timorese. Jarecki's case is built on a series of recently declassified documents that contradict Kissinger's written memoirs and show that Washington had supported Suharto using American weapons designed only for defensive purposes. They also indicate that Kissinger played a major role in Chile in the kidnapping and murder of General Ren Schneider and was deeply involved in the overthrow of the government of Salvador Allend in Chile on September 11 1973. Jarecki interviews Gen. Schneider's son who reveals that he is considering pressing charges against Kissinger for his part in the murder. The Trials of Henry Kissinger is timely and the idea that statesman should be held accountable for their actions under International Law is a compelling issue that deserves to be debated in public forums.Yet to me the real culprit is not the role of one man nefarious as it may be but a shortsighted policy that sees third world people only as tools in a U.S. global economic and political power struggle. Assassination of foreign leaders secret foreign policy decisions and lying to the American people did not start with Kissinger and as we see in today's news did not end when he stepped off the world stage.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Trials of Henry Kissinger' directed by Eugene Jarecki and written by Alex Gibney adapted from Christopher Hitchens' book is definitely a film that if it were actually given a wide enough audience would provoke some fairly strong reactions. Not knowing a lot about Kissinger other than he is a successful and generally wellrespected American diplomat I wasn't sure what to expect but I knew that the subject matter would be fairly inflammatory. My assumption was correct and the film provides some very compelling facts that aren't just food for thought it is a veritable feast. Essentially Kissinger is accused of throughout his career orchestrating actions and events that not only make him appear to be egotistical and Machiavellian but basically a war criminal as well. Among the many topics covered in this 80 minute documentary are Kissinger's rise to prominence the bombing of Cambodia his involvement with the genocide in East Timor and the coup in Chile. Kissinger's rise hit a crescendo during the Nixon administration and while Alexander Haig is still staunchly supportive of him others such as William Safire are calling him a liar and criminal on camera. I have not read Hitchens' book of the same name though I am familiar with his work with the publication Vanity Fair but if the excellent research in 'The Trials of Henry Kissinger' is any indication the book must be an intelligent and compelling one worth looking at.I am honestly not remotely familiar enough with the events and topics that were raised to form a solid enough opinion regarding Kissinger himself but 'The Trials of Henry Kissinger' serves as a wellresearched and thorough primer regarding Kissinger's rise and involvement in said events and topics.The film also gets my greatest stamp of approval  I want to dig deeper into this subject so that I CAN form an opinion and 'The Trials of Henry Kissinger' is the reason behind this need for further research. Inflammatory but extremely thoughtprovoking 'The Trials of Henry Kissinger' is a film that should be viewed. 810Shelly".

The filmmaker here interviews people from all sides of the political spectrum to illustrate why this man who seems so likeable in the public eye is in fact responsible for the most secretive heinous attrocities in modern American history. The film also offers a disturbing portrait of American foreign policy and is made more poignant by the climate of current events. Clearly one also has to wonder how we can justify bringing people like Radovan Karadic for heinous war crimes when we have such criminals in our own backyard. And if we truly are the policemen of the world then maybe it's time we clean up the force. Very good film. Should be considered the best of 2002 with The Two Towns of Jasper a close second.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an indictment. You'll have to read Kissinger's memoirs for the defense. I'm not planning on doing that myself time constraints and other things to do being what they are.In this 80minute documentary director Eugene Jarecki follows the intent of the book by Christopher Hitchens which was to put Kissinger on trial before a world court with himself as prosecutor. By the way note the slight but perhaps significant difference in the title the book is The Trial singular of Henry Kissinger. In a strange way the plural title of this documentary almost suggests The Struggles of Henry Kissinger which would be irony number one.I also thought it strange that Jarecki doesn't include Hitchens in the credits. I would say one wonders why but I really don't care.What I care about here isFirst the incredible irony of Kissinger being a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. But then one recalls that Yasser Arafat also won one of those. Maybe I should win the literary prize for writing this review.Second the bizarre irony of Kissinger being a German Jew with relatives who died in the concentration camps becoming a man who ends up regarding his fellow human beings with the same sort of cattle to the slaughter mentality that characterized the Nazis. I think Henry called it realpolitik.Third the slippery irony of Kissinger working for Democrat Lyndon Johnson liberal Republican Nelson Rockefeller and conservative Republican Richard Nixon while having loyalty only to his own lust to power and his delight in exercising it.Fourth the comedic irony that now in the 21st century decades after the fact with Kissinger in his eighties we get a call for a war crimes trial. Is this some kind of joke?Fifth the theoretical irony of realizing that it is Kissinger himself who believed that heads of state and their top lieutenants operate according to laws different than those imposed on private citizens because people in such elevated positions are often faced with only a choice of evils and so inevitably end up doing evil themselves.Sixth the media circus irony of Henry Kissinger being thought of as sexy and a Playgirl kind of centerfold because power is the ultimate aphrodisiac an image that delighted Kissinger who was quoted in the New York Times Jan 19 1971 as saying Power is the great aphrodisiac.Seventh the judicial irony of Kissinger being put on trial for war crimes when it was his boss the President of the United States Richard Nixon who had the ultimate responsibility for what happened in for example Cambodia.Finally it may be a kind of historical irony that it is George W. Bush who is most adamant that the US not give authority to a World Court that might try American government officials.This is an easy documentary to view done according to the Sixty Minutes formula. We are shown official documents with blacked out lines archival footage and interviews with some of the people who are still alive. There's Nixon's one time Chief of Staff Alexander Haig who sticks up for Kissinger his old boss but there is also the son of Chilean General Schneider who was assassinated in order to bring the horrific Pinochet to power and to protect American interests. And of course the documentary reports that the principal indictee himself Henry Kissinger refused to be interviewed.However I think the emphasis in any documentary that covers the material that this one covered should have been on our Cold War foreign policy itself hardly original or unique to Kissinger a policy that led the United States to commit and support the most amazing atrocities in the name of anticommunism atrocities for which we are still paying the cost in world opinion especially in the Middle East.I should note that there's something wrong with the DVD in that it gives great close ups of the talking heads but truncates their names and titles.I also didn't care much about that.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:headline " Hitchens would be appalled";
	schema:reviewBody "How ironic that a movie that takes its name and basic thesis from the work of Christopher Hitchens and features interviews with Hitchens should go against all that Hitchens represents. I urge anyone who sees Thr Trials of Henry Kissinger to read Hitchens' review of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911 httpslate.msn.comid2102723 to get a real sense of what Hitchens believes about propaganda films. What would he make for example of the juxtaposition of Kissinger with Hess Pinochet and other murderous dictators. I would further recommend the superior documentary The Fog of War to shed just a tiny bit of light on the context in which these alleged war crimes occurred. This is not to diminish the excellent work Hitchens did in chronicling U.S. foreign policy just to make the point that this doc would have been improved if the director stuck with Hitchens and didn't go off on all these tangents. It is telling how enthralled these directors were with their alternative cult of personality that they should try to bring down Kissinger with their own charismatic nutbar  Michael Tigar. Tigar has little to say about Kissinger but weaves a wonderful if loaded story about Pinochet's arrest by a London bobby. You can almost see the spittle forming at the mouth of this man which kind of gives away all sense of objectivity the filmmakers might have had. We're going after rightwing political figures and we'll use all tools at our disposal to make the case. Never mind that Tigar's story has nothing to do with Kissinger except to suggest this is the time to nail him. Never mind if we use pop songs Mr. Bigstuff. No really very subtle rapidfire editing of war images to illustrate points about diplomacy the whole bag of tricks. I half expected a stuttering Charlton Heston to appear and defend Kissinger although Alexander Haig is a good substitute. Note to documentarians leave your agendas at the door. The only people who will be swayed by your pastiche storytelling techniques are the converted and the ignorant everyone else can see right through you even if they lack the sophistication to pinpoint their skepticism. Countering propaganda with more propaganda brings your arguments down to the level of propaganda. While I realize telling stories about people who won't cooperate with you is difficult that does not make it right to sweep their side under the carpet.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie deserves anywhere from 6.5 stars to 7. No more no less. The editing  narration is done in such a shuffled  boring way that I had to stop the movie 3 times in 2 days. I couldn't finish it in one sitting. The reason why this is important is because I've been watching war documentaries all this week hoping to compile my own with all I've seen. I've taken notes on SuperPower Manufacturing Consent Sicko Commanding Heights The Secret Government 911 Road to Tyranny Fog of War and this. This by far as been the most boring movie I've had to take notes on. Not just boring but depressing as well. How a man like this can assume so much power is beyond me but then again he is a Rockefeller man so I shouldn't be surprised one bit. As far as I knew he was Rockefeller pawn in that the evil bastard used him to do his bidding. I know the 2 were in cahoots so this explains why he gave Nixon  himself so much power as well as the CIA etc. These evil men acted as a cancer to an already sick democratic society and it is all but Game Over. I have learned enough to know that a lot of sick men like HK have spread their influence too wide  too covertly to show any difference. Too the unaware anyway.This movie has good information and it's about the only documentary I know of that investigates Henry Kissinger solely. As someone mentioned he was involved with the 911 commission. More proof in my eyes that it was an inside job carried about by the Masons. Henry even gives a masonic handshake to one of the Vietnamese prime ministers or what not. As shown in the video 1013 seconds at the very beginning. Don't think of me as a conspiracy theorist but as a historical analyst. There's lot's of proof showing the plansteps for a New World Order. Don't underestimate the Free Masonic influence in America  all across the world either. You shall see one day. I'll be working to prove it.".

I'm not sure if that is good or bad but as far as his Foreign Policy issues are concerned he would do whatever he had to or follow whoever he thought would win an election so he could stay in power. This is mildly interesting but again you only get one side. Everyone attacks him  it seems no one stands up for him at all. I must say that his wiretapping of his own people is quite unforgivable no matter who you are. He reminds me a lot of J.

	schema:reviewBody "Hong Sangsoo whose films have been frequently featured at the New York Film Festival weaves tales of men and women wandering in and out of relationships and doing a lot of talking about them. He's a kind of South Korean Eric Rohmer except that his men and women aren't quite as ostentatiously presentable as Rohmer's and his men have an often gently satirized gauche sense of macho entitlement that's more Korean than French. A debt to the New Wave is nonetheless there but Hong hasn't ever actually sent his characters to Paris as Tsai MingLiang and Hou Hsiauhsien havetill now.The protagonist of 'Night and Day''Bam gua nat' Sungnam Kim Yungho is a 40something Seoul painter of cloudy landscapes who smokes pot with some American visitors to Korea. One of them gets caught and mentions Sungnam's name and he has fled abruptly to Paris. The film unreels as a daytoday account of his sojourn which includes involvement with a bunch of fellow countrymen and in particular several attractive younger women. Sungnam being a rather naive unsuave and clueless person of decidedly rumpled good looks his success with the other sex is a little surprising but he's a typical Hong Sangsoo male. He knows not a word of French and is uncomfortable trying to buy a condom in a pharmacy an inconvenience that leads to others.What propels 'Night and Day' most of the way is its sense of specificity and anecdotal observation. Sungnam stays at a kind of Korean hostel presided over by a diminutive older man Mr. Jang Go Kibong who offers Sungnam comfort at moments of stress. Sungnam drifts from day to day at first just hanging out and meeting some of the other Koreans in Paris who tend to all know each otherand reading a Bible which happens to be there and which he says he takes just as a story. Notably he runs across Minsun Kim Yujin whom he runs after knowing she looks familiar. Absurdly he's forgotten that he was in a passionate affair with Minsun years ago. She's now living in Paris and married to a Frenchman. She's not at all pleased with Sungnam's memory lapse but nonetheless willing to talk to him.Eventually Sungnam takes Minsun to a hotel room where she takes a shower and is ready to have sex when he begins quoting from the Bible and expresses misgivings. No sex.Meanwhile Sungnam calls his wife in Seoul frequently and they both declare how much they miss each other. She says she'll ask his mother to give her money so she can come and stay with him. There is an air of mutual desperation about their conversations but above all he seems in limbo unable to make a decision.Mr. Jang introduces Sungnam to a BeauxArts student named Hyunju Seo Minjeong but he is more interested in her thinner and prettier roommate Yujung Park Yunhye. Sungnam is comically inept and forward with these women hanging around and forcing himself upon them and yet Yujung succumbs and Sungnam takes her to Deauville their second trip but this time without Hyunju. Once again as in Hong's 'Woman on the Beach' there are conversations on a resort beach in the winter time only it's actually early October and Sungnam never has to wear anything but shirtsleeves.Sungnam also is at a dinner where he naively is shocked that one person is from North Korea. He is confrontational and as a result is forced to beat a hasty retreat. He also meets the best known Korean artist living and practicing in Paris and feels ashamed at having suspended his own career with this sojourn. The movie's scenes often end with some mild debacle or a sudden departure usually with mildly comic effect. At the same time that Sungnam's various prospects for a Paris lovelife he seems in his phone conversations with his wife to be all the more filled with a sense of desperation and confusion it's as if he's increasingly aware that he's living the kind of Paris adventure a young Asian artist might better have had at 20 or 30 instead of 45 and this isn't going to work. Eventually surprise news leads Sungnam to return to Korea and his wife Hwang Sujung and he faces the consequences of the pot incident and not without some bumps along the way begins to resume his life.The recurrent theme from Beethoven's Seventh Symphony gives a surprise note of European high culture and perhaps further irony but it seems pushed a little too hard.'Night and Day' remains interesting and textured as Hong Sangsoo's other films but at 144 minutes it's longer than it has any justification for being and the touristic aspect and an obtrusive use of the zoom lens seem out of character. Every scene is interesting but they go in a few too many directions and pursue too many strands. Tightening up and paring down would have added significantly to quality. It's as if Hong was distracted by the European sojourn himself. Maybe the director would do better to stay at home next time. Nonetheless Hong is an auteur well worth keeping track of. Seen at the NYFF 2008no US release pending. It opened in Paris in July along with 'Woman on the Beach.'".

Sensing her mood Edvard surprises her by whisking her off to a fictitious unspoiled little Scandinavian country instead. It's heaven. There is skiing tall fir trees and togetherness. Alas the new prime minister under Eddie is secretly wicked and has been planning to spoil the tiny country's landscape with mining. And no one informed him of the honeymoon's changed venue either. Afraid that the king will find out what he has been up to the PM sends a former Yankee boyfriend of Paige to the country to distract them. It works in part for Scott talks up a storm and turns up wherever the couple goes. But is it too big a deception to hide? Maybe! Then too Ed gets somewhat concerned that Scott may be trying to woo his bride away from him! Is he? Maybe again! Ho ho ho what have we here? This is a nice third installment to a truly wonderful series. Heskin is a spunky beauty and Geere who replaces the original Ed for the first time has a nice look and manner. The rest of the cast is also quite wonderful especially the gentleman playing the evil minister. Then the scenery is so gorgeous that you want to hop on a plane while the costumes story and direction are absolutely worthy of praise.

Scott I think. he was great. on a more serious note i think this movie is great for the careers of Kam and Chris because they were great. it shows how great their acting abilities are. some of the other British folk were great also in terms of acting. i thought the sword fight was great too. it was pretty great and awesome almost to the degree of the pirates of the caribbean movies. the part with the snow mobiles was pretty awesome and great too. i thought it was cool how they used them. i had a pretty great experience with that scene. that great scene. this might not be for people who are haters of great movies. however if you're just sitting around one night and you wana have a great time watch this movie. it really is great. i'm not kidding. just please watch it. i'm serious.";

I think most of the acting was dead on and others not so much. The plot could have been executed better and obviously the ex boyfriend conveniently showing up knew the crooked man who wanted control. That is too easily guessed by watching closely. The movie could have been better but somethings weren't executed.

He and Kam actually look like they are in love. One believes in their love story. Kam Heskin has apart from enthusiasm added charm sweetness and dignity to her Queen Paige that Julia Stiles lacked. But 'sweetness' and 'dignity' is not very trendy these days which may be why so many seem to be overly negative towards her. That is SO unfair. She does a great job as queen Paige! I didn't believe in Julia Stiles' Paige or Luke Mably's Eddie. Todd Jensen does a great job as the evil Polonius with a devilish smile that almost make Jack Nicholson look like a boy scout  and Joshua Rubin is hilarious as the oily and fawning crook Oliver.

The Portuguese community sided with its errant sons rather than their victim and Cheryl Araujo was basically driven out of town by the animosity of her neighbors.  She was killed in an automobile accident in Florida in 1986 leaving behind two children.This film was loosely based on the Araujo case.  Several of Jodie Foster's scenes were so powerful they nearly brought me to tears  specifically the scene where she confronts lawyer Kelly McGillis in the latter's apartment during a dinner party her courtroom testimony and the horrifying rape scene.Kelly McGillis seemed to be sleepwalking through this entire film with only a few moments when she roused herself a bit but not enough to help.  Even so she appeared more sensitive than the volunteer from the rape crisis center who stood NEXT TO the ER doctor during the postassault pelvic exam. If I had been on that table I'd have wrenched a foot out of the stirrups and kicked her.  A woman who has just been gang raped doesn't need one more person invading her privacy.I agree with an earlier poster who noted the difficult roles of the cheer and clap trio.  It must have been extremely challenging for a guy who has any sensitivity at all about women to convincingly portray the kind of jerks those three were.  My hat's off to all three of them.".

Foster is far from being an angel herself and every little thing in her past seems to come back and haunt her. A great supporting turn from Kelly McGillis who plays Foster's lawyer just adds to Foster's showstopping role. Not a film I love but a good film that displays the seemingly ungodly cinematic talents of Jodie Foster. 4 stars out of 5.".

A great supporting turn from Kelly McGillis who plays Foster's lawyer just adds to Foster's showstopping role. Not a film I love but a good film that displays the seemingly ungodly cinematic talents of Jodie Foster. 4 stars out of 5.";

Jodie Foster offers a courageous performance as the tough but vulnerable Sarah Tobias whose behavior on the night of the crime was certainly provocative but as the flashback reenactment shows all too clearly no amount of provocation could justify such a brutal response. Up until those final scenes the film is a wellcrafted but largely conventional topical drama with lots of predictable bonding between Foster and her conscience stricken attorney Kelly McGillis. But the attack itself teasingly saved until the final reel is so graphic and degrading it obliterates the memory of everything that happened earlier. The scene is pure exploitation but it serves a purpose putting audiences in the same ugly position as the cheering onlookers in the bar who in many ways were even guiltier than the rapists themselves.".

The screenwriters have played only one masterstroke by showing the whole rape incident much later in a flashback which perhaps helps us to relate better to the victim's emotions.However predictable and blunt the film appears in its formation it delivers it message right with the help of the outstanding and Oscarwinning performance of Jodie Foster. She just plays her part with so much passion that sometimes it would seem that she really IS the victim. I wonder how she could get such a driving force for her role which is so powerful and vengeful yet so helpless and fragile.

	schema:reviewBody "It is very hard watching this movie because it is such a shocking story. A girl is gang raped by 3 men in a bar where a crowd of male customers are shouting clapping and cheering it on like it's a show.Jodie Foster plays Sarah Tobias the girl who is raped. She is not shown as this good virgin but someone who has made mistakes in the past and on the night she was raped but in no way deserved what happened to her. It is shown that before she was raped she was drunk had smoked pot flirted with the men and even made a joke about taking one of them back to her trailer and sleeping with him in front of her boyfriend's face. It must have been a very demanding role for Jodie Foster to do especially near the end of the film where we see a flashback of the rape and it is very realistic and goes a lot further than any other films about rape has. It must have been very hard for Jodie to do that sequence most of all. She is totally amazing in this role where her character comes across as tough but has a vulnerable side and doesn't have anyone to look out for her until Kathryn Murphy Kelly McGillis comes into her life.Kelly McGillis does start off as cool but as the story goes on we see a compassionate woman who wants to stand up for Sarah's rights and wants to right the wrong she did when she accepted a plea bargain for the charge of reckless endangerment with Sarah's rapists. She then decides the only way she can make up for it is to prosecute the men who egged the rapists on and feels she can prosecute them using the charge of criminal solicitation which means the rapists will stay in jail for the whole sentence.I liked the relationship between McGillis and Foster who are completely different people. Sarah is more loose she's been arrested for drugs in the past she smokes pot and drinks she lives in a trailer park and is into astrology. Kathryn on the other hand comes across as squeaky clean a goodytwo shoes conservative educated in Law school and is very middleclass. You wouldn't think these two could ever bond but they do over this case and end up caring for one another in a way neither thought they would.The film is very graphic and leaves nothing to the imagination in the rape sequence and the language that is used. The language during the rape when the crowd is shouting 'Hold her down' 'needledick' 'poke that pussy' is very colourful and cruel. It shows these men have a total disregard of the feelings for women particularly the callous way they talk about the rape as being a show Sarah put on and the rapists were only following her actions and don't have any reason to feel guilty for what they did to her.It is a difficult film to watch but when the film ends you have a positive feeling that justice has been served as the men who egged on the rape are just as bad and guilty as the rapists.".

It increases constantly the thought about getting the criminal rapists their due. The acting is good enough for the story and the moral lesson is powerful. But are there any bars out there where something like this could even happen? This is supposedly based on a true story though certain details have been left out and some even altered. I am a barfly partly from prior work and social networking. My drinking is limited to 3 drinks on any night and I am personal friends with many other bartenders having been one for almost 17 years. Unless the bar is practically empty and the bartender is in the back room loading up the roller with cases of beer for restocking I don't see this story as even being possible. Almost every bar I've ever been in and that's many have a few early evening middle and late night regulars. Almost every one of them if they saw something like this happening would step in to stop it or call the police. Other guys and girls would jump in and the scene wouldn't be pretty. The rapists would probably get their asses kicked maybe crippled maybe killed. I can picture it What the f are you doing? This is MY BAR!!!!! People who are regulars at a bar don't want the bar to get shut down and they don't want police constantly walking in and looking suspiciously at them. Most regulars at a bar look at the other regulars as practically part of their family even the ones they never talk to. Family members look after one another even the slutty women whether or not they have ever been to the bar before. It's our second home!!! Don't even think about doing that f sh in our house!!!!!!!! I can't help but wonder if there are any bars out in the REAL WORLD where this story could happen..??".

	schema:reviewBody "One thing I found interesting about The Accused  a film that's famous for the vicious rape of a young bluecollar woman  is just how they chose to go about making such a movie. You know going in that there's a bad scene and that the rest of the movie deals with the repercussions. But the film begins immediately after the atrocity went down. We open with Jodie Foster desperately flagging down a ride to make good her escape and flow right into the doctor's examination of her ghastly welts claw marks and bruising. The tone is set without any on screen violence. Now there's still a bad scene involved but it doesn't happen until we've spent some time in the courtroom. It's a flashback although the tension and foreboding have been ratcheted to obscene heights that it's still to this day beyond brutal nauseating would be the better way to put it. The whole of the movie is not easy to watch and it's one that doesn't hold a lot of replay value. But the reason to recommend it and I'm sure it has been for 25 years is the performances from the two leads. Both are exceptional but Foster won that Oscar for a reason. At the center of this movie are two women who are fighting one for her side of the story to be heard after her character assassination in the eyes of the public and the attorney who's out to help her find justice. The Accused is not as harrowing as Leaving Las Vegas but it's still no day at the beach. Regardless should this movie ever come up in conversation my recommendation will be based entirely on those performances from Jodie Foster and Kelly McGillis.710".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember this being somewhat of a controversial film when it came out probably because the rape scene was too graphic for many people. The subject of rape in itself is not new to films so it must have been the way it was presented. I am writing this from memory. I do remember the scene as extremely uncomfortable to watch.In a nutshell Jodie Foster plays a woman Sarah Tobias who goes looking for trouble in a bar and gets much more than she bargained for being gangraped on top of a pinball machine. She then goes to court to prosecute the men involved.This was an outandout women's lib movie and since they are given favorable press by the politicallycorrect media the film got extra publicity. Even for feminists though this story has too many holes in it to be as credible as we would like it to be. The had a female prosecutor of course and Kelly McGillis just didn't cut it in that role just not convincing. Also with Hollywood when you hear based on a true story you know facts will be few and far between and the dramatic parts will be very exaggerated. None of this implies by the way that the victim deserved what she got. In fact I hope some women learned from this movie and never put themselves in a spot where something horrific like this could happen. Alcohol and sex desires are a lethal combination and a bar with a number of drunks is not where you want to start arousing people.Jodie Foster is a fine actress but I did question her winning an Oscar over this. Too much of the Academy Awards in the last two decades have become nothing but political forums always favoring the latest left wing cause. In this case the feminists were appeased. Foster has done better work in other films and not been recognized.Overall I think this film is good for one viewing but a little too unpleasant for more than that.".

Inspired by a real life crimeceleb.The wooden Kelly McGillis plays the adventurous gogetting prosecuting council and  in near perfect contrast  the versatile and talented Jodie Foster plays the central crime victim. Foster won an Oscar for a sensitive performance of a lessthanperfect person who has had very bad things happen to her. I agree with her award even though this is a unpleasant and ramshackle film. IMPORTANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION STARTSI have to review the film as a total piece of fiction because the difference between the inspirational case and the one presented on celluloid are bar the instance of unquestionable gang rape so totally different.Big Dan's Bar  the now closed real crime scene  was a disreputable dive ignored by everyone but hard drinking immigrant types. Not a jot like the modern preppy student bar presented in this film.Crime investigation showed that the victims income was much boosted by social security fraud and was well known locally as a vamp a very kindly way of putting it who often turned her back on her own children in search of a party. This isn't to diminish the fact that she was also the victim of a horrific crime  for which the actual perpetrators received appropriate sentences  but because we deserve to know these facts for comparingandcontrasting reasons. She died soon after in an unrelated motor accident.The case got nationwide publicity mostly because of false reporting. The bar was not crowded  there may only have been less than 12 people present  and it is possible sparing you the technical detail that some were present were genuinely ignorant of ongoing events. It certainly didn't feature the crowds of cheering onlookers that the media had originally seized upon. Ironically some of the sensational pretrial misreporting of the case  which both sides of the argument took time to dismiss for the benefit of the newspaper reading jurors  reappears in this fictionalised film!IMPORTANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION ENDSThis is on the face of it a simple movie with a simple message. But the more you think about it the more you realize how false and dangerous it is. Rape is a terrible crime and my heart goes out to all that suffer it. Be they male or female. It is violence that is both physical and psychological.However this film wants to spread the guilt to everyone short of the victims' dressmaker and this is not fair to everyday reality. Naturally the film makes it own environment  but even in this it fails to prove its own case beyond reasonable doubt.The Accused argues that onlookers with no possible way of knowing a crime was about to be committed and play no active part in it are equally guilty by not lifting a finger to prevent it.Crudely we have two types of do nothings  people that encourage vocally and those that simply do nothing but look on. How on earth could a court distinguish between these types without credible independent witnesses? Or is the victim able to divide them while being both being attacked?There are no women apart from the victim present. Women are half of the population and they are present in the main bar itself  but are totally absent in the games room where the attack takes place. Nor is their any kind of visible security monitoring or CCTV security which any bar insurer would insist upon. Very  Hollywood  convenient. To make things even more bizarre the working waitress friend of the victim mistakes the sexual act as consenting and takes no steps to interrupt it or call the police. Despite one of the rapists gagging Foster's mouth with his hand! Confused  I certainly am!Let's be frank if that had been a male bar worker it would have been read as another crime witness that was looking the other way!The reason why this film was made is that it addresses rape through freak show sensation and cutting edge law. A more normal date rape  the stats for which are included in the closing titles  would be of no interest to Hollywood.I came in to this film thinking that the mainstream couldn't take on and do justice to a tough subject like gang rape and I now know it for certain.".

You don't kick another man's dog you don't run down the bible and you don't push women around in public. Any of those will get you a country beat down right now or worse. It would have been far more believable had it been set in a club in the hood a place where women are referred to as bitch and ho not Miss Mrs and Mam. But then it looses it's propaganda value doesn't it?";

	schema:reviewBody "In 2002 Dreamworks released a movie on American theaters called THE RING by Gore Verbenski. It expanded to great lengths around the world. People claimed they had never been so scared while watching a movie in their entire life. Critics had mixed opinions of it most for the better. But while the entire world was screaming to THE RING others decided to reach out for the original version that Dreamworks decided to hide while THE RING was in it's theatrical run. The 1998 Japanese phenomenon RINGU a.k.a RING.Based on a 1991 novel by Koji Suzuki claimed as the Japanese Stephen King RINGU tells the story of reporter Asakawa Reiko Nanako Matsushima a middleclass Japanese single mother. Her latest story is the investigation of a mysterious urban legend that circulates around high schools about a tape that kills whoever watches it seven days later. She learns that five teenagers recently died from a heart attack at the exact same time and that they were all friends who spent a vacation on a cabin resort exactly one week before. It becomes up close and personal when she finds out one of them was her recently deceased cousin Tomoko Yuku Takeuchi.Reiko eventually tracks down and watches the mysterious tape and in one of the movie's many chilling moments receives a strange phone call confirming that the urban legend is true an element that reminded me of the 1992's similar CANDYMAN. She finds help from her exhusband Ryiuji Hirouyuki Sanada a psychic with paranormal powers an element obviously removed from the US version. Both Reiko and Ryiuji examine the tape carefully and realize it was shot in a nearby volcanic island. With only a few days left they travel to the island where the dark disturbing truth remains hidden waiting to be discovered.Taking liberties from the infilmable novel director Hideo Nakata DARK WATER CHAOS and screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi DON'T LOOK UP were able to create what is perhaps one of the most impressive horror films of recent memory challenged maybe only by the lesssubliminal AUDITION. Nakata's direction already explains what makes RINGU so unique The absence of music limited photography simple camera movements and no cheap jump scares. The fear in RINGU comes from skindeep slow burn. If you are looking for jumps watch the American remake instead. Which brings us to the infamous RINGU vs. THE RING internet battle A pointless one.The 2002 remake had more technological resources and a stronger desire to freak out the audience. Director Gore Verbenski decided not to copy the original and went for a less subliminal more artsy Dario Argento dreamy approach with a Nine Inch Nails vibe and a David Fischer love for rain. While THE RING improved on the upcoming flaws of the original it had problems of it's own. Not wanting to change the subject let me tell you the Japanese version is the one to see. The problem is that most people who watch the recent remake will hate RINGU and viceversa.Unlike THE RING RINGU avoids CGI shocks and cheap jump scares like a plague. You won't find any suspenseful moments chases or any physical struggles between the cast here. While the remake scared you with fast zooms weird camera tricks and inhuman freaky bursts of weird noises RINGU scares you with it's lack of... sadism. A good example are the videotapes. The videotape seen in THE RING is a Nine Inch Nails video in a good way with very weird supernatural images and weird grossout quick glimpses. The original's videotape is shorter and maybe even weirder. It shows you different but equally impressive images that belong to a David Lynch nightmare while a scratching noise is heard on the background. A noise that was unfortunately omitted in the remake. The Japanese tape can be either laughable or scary depending on the mentality of whoever watches it.But what makes RINGU the phenomenon that it is today is the character of Yamura Sadako who turns out to be pulling the strings. Not wanting to spoil the plot I will just say that never since Hanniball Lacter has a character with such little screen time terrorized the audience as good. The American doppelganger Samara was badly used in the remake. While what made Sadako scary was that she was pure evil the remake's screenwriter Ehren Kruger tried to turn her into a Batmanlike repressed character that you are supposed to feel sorry for. This terribly reduces the impact of the scene. Which leads me to the scene itself. If you ask anyone who watched either version what the scene is they will probably know. Let me tell you that the scene is done much better in this version. I will go as far as saying the scene is hands down one of the scariest moments in cinematographic history very close to the shower scene and the climax of DON'T LOOK NOW. The remake tried to hard with it's own scene adding CGI effects quick cuts and many other grossout elements that the original didn't need.But RINGU is not without it's flaws. Either the fact that I am not Asian or maybe that I am not familiar with psychics but the whole Ryiuji character left me wishing for more. Maybe the subtitle translation didn't make it clear enough but I couldn't connect to that way he always had an answer to everything. Not that Sanada's performance is lacking. He steals the scene and carries out most of the movie. Remember Bruce Lee in GREEN HORNET? Maybe not but that is Ryiuji here. And Matsushima is equally good although she is given less to do than her American counterpart Naomi Watts. I will give credit to the US remake by eliminating the psychic subplot. I won't forgive the fact that Ryuji's American counterpart is a pointless and boring sidekick which is what ironically gives Watts her chance to shine.RINGU is still a superior horrifying experience that you will not easily forget. Forget the sequels RING 2 forget the spinoffs RASEN the ripoffs FEARDOTCOM or remakes RING VIRUS and THE RING. It all rounds up to here. Be sure to watch Nakata's equally good DARK WATER which is already getting a remake on early works. Oh the humanity...phone rings4.55".

Ringu has the look and feel production wise of a TV movie but this only adds to the objective of it to terrify.The story unfolds of an everyday Japanese single mother the backdrop is nothing unusual but this is required as the bizarre begins to unravel before the eyes of the watcher. The woman has a child whom appears to be a strange little boy and in many ways he parents her in her hectic schedule. Her ex husband is an amiable fellow though he has an annoying quality to any female whom observes him which one assumes is the reason for the couple's politely handled split.The story takes a turn for the more macabre when a videotape emerges which is shrouded in urban myth. The short synopsis is you watch the tape and die within seven days of doing so. A group of teenagers inexplicably die one of which is the niece of our leading lady. Being the plucky reporter that she is she begins to investigate the eerie tape initially by watching it herself and embroiling her ex in this grim fairytale by seeking his counsel on technical matters relating to the tape itself. The two find themselves in a race against time to discover the secret of the tape when their son watches a copy that was made. The bogeyman of this psychologically rattling outing is Sada a child or a demon? perhaps a freak of nature? No answer is given and the viewer is left to their own conclusion and speculation. This reliance upon the viewers observational conclusion is what makes Ringu a truly adult horror movie above all others we are not told what to think or moralised. Ringu simply displays the evidence on the nature of Sada and leaves you to suppose whether she is a tortured victim cast from society or simply a demon and nothing more.If the objective of any horror movie is to scare then Ringu succeeds with flying colours. Everything about this movie is genuinely disturbing and unsettling. From the mythology of the tale to the ghastly contorted faces of the corpses that Sada the demon of the story leaves in her wake.The grainy gritty production plays and builds upon anybody who dares to watch. The bittersweet relationship between the two leads encourages us to care about them and their plight. The story piques the curious child in all of us and dares us to look when we should not and tamper with things that are beyond our understanding.The absolutely heart ripping and bone chilling climax to this movie is unmissable. You will not be able to stop watching but be wishing that you could rip out your eyes simultaneously!This movie is a quiet and unpretentious if imaginative little piece from Japan which displays something that Hollywood has lacked in the horror genre in many years. The director has a true innate gift for knowing exactly what it is that we can not put our finger on that horrifies the human mind. This film is very Japanese and I cannot imagine it doing well when converted to Hollywood form.Ringu is a movie made to be watched on your TV at home exactly the way I did renting the DVD from your local store. This plays upon the very nature of the story. The TV is something we all think of as safe it's in all our homes and it is exactly this that adds such an overtone of terror to this particular filmAs an additional note my boyfriend was flicking through the extra features on the DVD and came across the cursed video clip and proceeded to watch it. I couldn't I left the room. This fact serves as the best conclusion that I can muster as to the brilliance of Ringu. It is not to be missed but do not watch it alone!1010".

One such victim is a seventeen year old girl and it is up to her aunt hotshot newspaper reporter Reiko to solve the mystery of the strange video.Like the American remake The Ring Ringu is not a perfect film. It leaves more than a couple of unanswered questions and may move too slowly in some parts to hold the attention of horror film fans who are used to a bloody slaughter scene every seven minutes. But for fans of good spooky old fashioned ghost stories Ringu has a lot to recommend it.One of the things I appreciated the most about this movie is the complete and utter lack of gore. There's not a drop of blood to be found in this film which makes the sight of so many dead bodies their faces frozen in hideous screams of horror all the more effective. The character of Sadako also has more of an impact than the child from the remake. Sadako never speaks her face is never seen but for one hideous floating eye and her presence is solid unlike her staticy American sister. Sadako's emergence from the TV screen in the films final moments is worth waiting through the rest of the movie to see it is a truly creepy moment which looks to have been filmed backwards as Sadako creeps with jerky inhuman movements across the floor and up swiveling to face her victim. That scene haunted me no pun intended for two full nights of broken sleep...mostly because Sadako seemed so terribly human as sad as she was frightening. You pity her before you see her merciless side and this throws the balance way out of whack. Unsettling to say the least.This is a film about dread about knowing that something dark and terrible is waiting for you and not knowing how to stop it. You can only wait and hope for the best...but the wait itself is the real horror and the unseen unknown is the most frightening monster of all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike some reviewers here I'm happy to have seen Hollywood's 'The Ring' first. Now that I've seen both I would have to say that 'Ringu' is the better film marginally.The Hollywood version was quite an unsettling experience in it's own right and having seen it first I rather expected 'Ringu' would be a 'ruined' experience as I was already familiar with the overall story and of course THE scene. After all when the scene finally occurs in 'The Ring' the unexpectedness of it very much increases the shock of it. I hadn't been truly frightened by a scene from a horror movie for a very long time so I was unequivocally impressed.So when I got around to watching 'Ringu' my expectation was low. I assumed that the absence of surprise would diminish the experience greatly but as it turns out the difference in the styles and some of the substance as well was adequate enough to scare me all over again even though I thought I knew what to expect. Somehow I doubt that this would have been the case if I'd watched these movies in reverse order. I believe 'The Ring' would have been less enjoyable as it likely would have suffered from comparison.The familiarity actually served as a primer for watching the original. I've found that reading subtitles often detracts from the complete enjoyment of a film as one's appreciation of the visual content usually suffers from the distraction. In this case though I found it to be less of a problem. Of course it certainly doesn't hurt to have the ability to rewind and in instances where I was unable to finish reading the dialogue completely you can be sure that I made use of it.The first difference that struck me was the teens found in the car. Like the girl in the closet in 'The Ring' their faces are frozen into grotesque masks but the more terrifying aspect is that they have been 'gotten to' outside of their homes and all at the same time. This really drives home the realization that there may be no way to escape this thing. Safety in numbers? Nope. Don't go home? Nope won't help.'Ringu' is somewhat more detailed in providing background than is 'The Ring'. The demonic child is shown in a scene that was omitted from the copied version and it adds a little something extra to our understanding of this terrifying entity. Also I found that the valiant attempt to lift the curse by trying to 'free' the spirit from the well was more intense and claustrophobic not to mention yuckier than the American film.But what is it exactly that is so disquieting about both versions? Well to begin with the seemingly unrelated disjointed and positively eerie imagery that is seen on the mysterious videotape really gets under the skin. The first time we see these we are troubled by the strangeness of them and thoroughly perplexed as to their meaning. We come to realize that a seed of uneasiness has been planted within us. The direction is masterful at nourishing this seed not only by showing short repeats of these images but also by giving us incremental hints of what is still to come. We are briefly shown the well. Briefly again the beginning of emergence. Briefly again it's almost out. More and more I found myself getting cold shivers at each progression. The uneasiness is becoming dread.But there's something else that frightens apart from the film's construction. Is it the ultimate realization that this thing will not be placated no matter the heroic and wellintentioned efforts of the film's principal leads? Yes that's an acutely chilling slant to be sure. But ultimately I feel that the most disturbing element is that were we to find ourselves in this position we would be faced with a terrible choice  face the horror ourselves or deliberately inflict it on another. Escape it and you condemn your own soul. Now that's some scary sht".

	schema:headline " Just plain creepy  really unnerving film";
	schema:reviewBody "Rumours abound about a video tape that once you watch it you have a week before you die.  When a relative dies in a way that suggests she saw the video journalist Reiko tracks down the tape and recklessly watches it.  She finds she is under the curse and shows it to her exhusband to get his help. When her son watches the tape Reiko and Ryuji race against time to discover the meaning behind the curse to be able to lift it.I came to this only knowing the hype and the barest bits of the story.  I knew it was meant to be scary and I wasn't disappointed.  The plot is good in it's one word description but there are a few holes in it and something's aren't well explained.  However it is a good story to follow as it is a form of a ghost hunt as they try to unravel the mystery.  The whole thing has an air of uneasiness about it.The film has some very scary moments  especially the ending which I won't even hint at.  However for the most part it is just plain creepy  which is even worse.  There's no blood or gore  just a real sense of being uncomfortable.  The director has seen teen horrors before so he teases us  he has shots of people with doors just over their shoulder or the TV lingering in the rear of the shot  knowing that we are conditioned to expect something to jump out  but then nothing does.  Instead the scares come slowly and blatantly really not being shocking but just making your skin crawl.The acting is superb all round although Sanada is a little stony at times but he gets better.  The real star is the director who uses music and sound effects to get the eerie effect but also uses images that are weird to just creep out the whole film.  I hope Hollywood directors learn what can be done with subtly rather than multimillion pound monsters or effects.I have said before that Fire Walk With Me was one of the creepiest films I've seen.

	onyx:emotionText "Rumours abound about a video tape that once you watch it you have a week before you die.  When a relative dies in a way that suggests she saw the video journalist Reiko tracks down the tape and recklessly watches it.  She finds she is under the curse and shows it to her exhusband to get his help. When her son watches the tape Reiko and Ryuji race against time to discover the meaning behind the curse to be able to lift it.I came to this only knowing the hype and the barest bits of the story.  I knew it was meant to be scary and I wasn't disappointed.  The plot is good in it's one word description but there are a few holes in it and something's aren't well explained.  However it is a good story to follow as it is a form of a ghost hunt as they try to unravel the mystery.  The whole thing has an air of uneasiness about it.The film has some very scary moments  especially the ending which I won't even hint at.  However for the most part it is just plain creepy  which is even worse.  There's no blood or gore  just a real sense of being uncomfortable.  The director has seen teen horrors before so he teases us  he has shots of people with doors just over their shoulder or the TV lingering in the rear of the shot  knowing that we are conditioned to expect something to jump out  but then nothing does.  Instead the scares come slowly and blatantly really not being shocking but just making your skin crawl.The acting is superb all round although Sanada is a little stony at times but he gets better.  The real star is the director who uses music and sound effects to get the eerie effect but also uses images that are weird to just creep out the whole film.  I hope Hollywood directors learn what can be done with subtly rather than multimillion pound monsters or effects.I have said before that Fire Walk With Me was one of the creepiest films I've seen.  And that was for the same reason just making me feel uncomfortable and unnerved.  Here this little gem takes that to a whole new level.";

This movie is great with characters welldefined excellent cast and direction and a screenplay focused on the story and not in special effects. An original horror movie with a tight plot. Why Americans insist in spoiling excellent movies? It is amazing the quantity of expensive remakes of marvelous foreign movies that Hollywood spoils. Once I heard that American people would not like to read subtitles but I refuse to believe in such nonsense. The American remake 'The Ring' is not a bad movie and Naomi Watts is a great actress.

In fact oh god save me I enjoyed the American version of the movie more so than this one. Perhaps it was due to cultural differences that I simply couldn't 'get' this movie but I'm somehow don't think so.Ringu simply did not draw me in and make me really believe in what the characters were doing. Like many Japanese movies I simply could not accept that the character would really do what they were doing it just didn't make sense to me that these people would go running around Japan trying to discover the mystery of the 'video' based on some people dying. The american version seemed to give characters some extra motivation to go in search of the truth with unexplained supernatural events scary dreams etc. Perhaps its a testament to Japanese work ethic or American laziness but I just thought there wasn't enough to back up the characters actions.I realize it might somehow be hip to say that you enjoy foreign films more than their domestic counterparts and insult the Hollywood 'money machine' and decry the end of american cinema but I simply can't do it with this movie. The ultimate and final test to determine whether a horror movie is good is of course whether or not you are scared. And I can say that the american version of The Ring made me ruin a perfectly good pair of underpants whereas the Japanese version made me jump maybe twice and laugh once. The main problem this poses is which movie do you see first because seeing either film will ruin the ending of the other. And so not to take anything away from Ringu which is in and of itself a great movie I can honestly tell you that you should see the American version first... and bring an extra pair of underpants.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ring was such a sensation on release that it led to a cycle of Japanese horror films. This Japanese invasion became known as JHorror and they had quite an impact. Ring is a perfect example of why these movies were so effective. The cultural difference between the West and Japan meant that these films seemed somewhat unpredictable some of the horror concepts and imagery were genuinely unsettling. We in the West could never have conceived of these ideas they grew organically from Japanese culture. The unknown is often the scariest thing of all and the success of JHorror is a perfect illustration of this.The basic idea of Ring is a clever combination of the traditional Japanese ghost story with modern Japanese technology. In it a strange videotape curses anyone who views it resulting in a terrifying death exactly a week later. It's an extremely creepy film that is truly unnerving at times. The pacing is very deliberate as we are taken through to the unforgettable final act. It's all about mood and atmosphere. It's quite economic with its shocks relying more on mystery and growing tension. The key to the puzzle lies in the enigmatic weird video at the heart of the story. This bizarre short film leads the protagonists on a journey to discover the sinister secrets that underpin it. Strange details surround those who view the tape such as the fact that their images in photographs become disturbingly warped. It's a highly effective central idea for a horror film.The visual presentation is very good with some excellent cinematography. The sound design also works extremely well with the imagery on screen adding to the ominous tone perfectly. On top of this there is good characterisation which helps a great deal in giving the story an effective psychological edge. The husband and wife team are well played and believable this makes their urgency in solving the mystery all the more pertinent. But nothing I repeat nothing can prepare a viewer adequately for Ring's one moment of true genius. Everybody who is reading this must surely know what I am about to refer to. I mean of course the moment when Sadako crawls out of the television screen. This must go down in the history of horror cinema as one of the most audacious and terrifying moments ever conceived. It's quite brilliant in concept and execution. The film may have been relatively subtle up to this point but after this scene perceptions of Ring suddenly and jarringly change. It's worth watching the movie for this scene alone.It was remade in America to much lesser effect as The Ring in 2002.".

The execution of the plot line however was completely and utterly ruined right in the middle. Right when the exhusband OMG SUDDENLY HAS AMAZING PSYCHIC POWERS and KNOWS ALL. Can you say lazy scriptwriting leads to completely anticlimactic deus ex machina? I knew you could. I think it also lacked in subconscious imagery to play up the creepiness and sense of dread. Some fans call this realism but for crying out loud this is a ghost story and there is no realism in ghost stories! I will say though that the use of ancient legend and certain real historical elements lent it a very shivery flavor and that worked well with the plot.It's definitely worth watching though.".

With the American version you get significantly better scares and death scenes. I would have been okay with the classic scream then cut to next scene but the black and whiteinvert color thing too? Any respect or immersion I had was ANNIHILATED by those scenes! I laughed at the death scenes! Those scenes made Ringu is a complete and utter failure of a horror movie! I would still recommend watching it if only to see the original Japanese version but that's only justification I could give. To be honest I didn't find the American version all that good either. A tape that takes 7 days to kill you is just not that threatening to me. Now if Sadako were Final Destinationing people near immediately after they viewed the tape THAT would have been glorious!".

The US version is OK and indeed better than most modern horror films but Ringu is superior and of course the impact of the famous ending is lessened slightly. This is the film that rekindled my interest in horror films after feeling for many years there were no new ideas or quality any more. As everyone knows Ringu follows the story of a cursed tape once watched you receive a phone call that tells you of your impending doom. The tension of the film is the key to the impending terror and it has a really cloying dark feeling throughout. As is the case with most Asian horrors especially the earlier films of the recent batch the director does not make the plot too obvious to the viewer. You have to watch closely and decide a few things for yourself. I must admit I really enjoy this aspect of Asian films you have to work at it as opposed to the usual spoonfed Hollywood story lines. There are some major differences between Ringu and Ring the father is psychic which makes sense there are less jumps and telegraphed shocks but the same dank dirty atmosphere is there in both films. It is not a perfect film. It obviously lacks the budget of Ring and there are patches when nothing much happens which is difficult for an audience fed on constant periodic shocks. Asian cinema has a different pace there are points of quiet leading to out of the blue shocks. This actually increases the tension of the film leading up to one of the most terrifying climaxes possible. Once you have seen the ending you will wish you hadn't as you cannot watch it fresh again. A great film that is perfect for TV viewing excellent acting throughout with possibly the best ending of any horror film.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE BIG HOUSE  prison of no hope  the last terminal for lost souls. Only the strong survive the weak crack or are corrupted. As the warden shrewdly tells a new arrival the place won't make you go yellow but it you already are yellow it'll bring it out.MGM was the only studio in Hollywood which would have let a female write the script for such a strong story. But in Frances Marion they not only had the most celebrated screenwriter in the industry but also a person uniquely qualified to write about any situation. She headed off to California's notorious San Quentin Prison to observe the conditions  learn the lingo. Cheerfully deflecting the jibes  taunts of guards  prisoners alike she reminded them that after being a frontline correspondent in the Great War there were few situations she couldn't handle.The result is a wonderful film tough hardbitten  stark. MGM did itself proud by supplying a terrific cast and production values. The scene where belligerent Wallace Beery refuses to eat the commissary slop remains a classic.Chester Morris does a fine job as a resourceful crook who is actually helped by his time in prison reformed against his will. This excellent actor is too often ignored when the histories of 1930's cinema are written. Wallace Beery as murderous Butch is absolutely unforgettable. Marion wrote the part with him in mind  it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing it. Lovable  dangerous in equal measure he steals every scene he's in. THE BIG HOUSE would set Beery firmly on the road to major talkie stardom.Robert Montgomery on the cusp of his own salad days as a sophisticated romantic leading man here plays quite a different role. As a weak cowardly stool pigeon he's cast very much against type. It would be 1937's NIGHT MUST FALL before he received another such finelynuanced role.Lewis Stone is very effective in the small role as the toughasnails warden. Beautiful Leila Hyams is wellcast as Mongomery's spunky sister. George F. Marion  DeWitt Jennings are both memorable as elderly security guards. Champion stutterer Roscoe Ates provides a few moments of much needed comic relief.Karl Dane is easily spotted as a hulking convict in several scenes but he is curiously mute. Doubtless his thick Danish accent was already giving the Studio trouble. Even though he had been an important comic star in silent pictures he was quickly relegated to talkie bit parts. He was eventually further reduced to selling hot dogs from a cart outside the MGM front gates. This was the final indignity. He committed suicide in 1934.Preview audiences were curiously cool to THE BIG HOUSE until MGM executive Irving Thalberg figured out that female viewers didn't like con Chester Morris romancing another prisoner's wife. Thalberg instructed Marion to rewrite a few scenes and refilming made it clear that Leila Hyams was Robert Montgomery's sister not his spouse. This pleased the patrons and the movie was a big hit.".

As the warden shrewdly tells a new arrival the place won't make you go yellow but it you already are yellow it'll bring it out.MGM was the only studio in Hollywood which would have let a female write the script for such a strong story. But in Frances Marion they not only had the most celebrated screenwriter in the industry but also a person uniquely qualified to write about any situation. She headed off to California's notorious San Quentin Prison to observe the conditions  learn the lingo. Cheerfully deflecting the jibes  taunts of guards  prisoners alike she reminded them that after being a frontline correspondent in the Great War there were few situations she couldn't handle.The result is a wonderful film tough hardbitten  stark. MGM did itself proud by supplying a terrific cast and production values. The scene where belligerent Wallace Beery refuses to eat the commissary slop remains a classic.Chester Morris does a fine job as a resourceful crook who is actually helped by his time in prison reformed against his will. This excellent actor is too often ignored when the histories of 1930's cinema are written. Wallace Beery as murderous Butch is absolutely unforgettable. Marion wrote the part with him in mind  it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing it. Lovable  dangerous in equal measure he steals every scene he's in. THE BIG HOUSE would set Beery firmly on the road to major talkie stardom.Robert Montgomery on the cusp of his own salad days as a sophisticated romantic leading man here plays quite a different role. As a weak cowardly stool pigeon he's cast very much against type. It would be 1937's NIGHT MUST FALL before he received another such finelynuanced role.Lewis Stone is very effective in the small role as the toughasnails warden. Beautiful Leila Hyams is wellcast as Mongomery's spunky sister. George F. Marion  DeWitt Jennings are both memorable as elderly security guards. Champion stutterer Roscoe Ates provides a few moments of much needed comic relief.Karl Dane is easily spotted as a hulking convict in several scenes but he is curiously mute. Doubtless his thick Danish accent was already giving the Studio trouble. Even though he had been an important comic star in silent pictures he was quickly relegated to talkie bit parts. He was eventually further reduced to selling hot dogs from a cart outside the MGM front gates. This was the final indignity. He committed suicide in 1934.Preview audiences were curiously cool to THE BIG HOUSE until MGM executive Irving Thalberg figured out that female viewers didn't like con Chester Morris romancing another prisoner's wife. Thalberg instructed Marion to rewrite a few scenes and refilming made it clear that Leila Hyams was Robert Montgomery's sister not his spouse. This pleased the patrons and the movie was a big hit.";

He and cell mate Chester Morris have a new man in their little abode in the person of a young Robert Montgomery. Montgomery's only a kid but he's done a man size crime of manslaughter in a vehicular homicide where he was no doubt good and sloshed on prohibition rotgut.

	schema:reviewBody "Over the decades there have been tons of prison films. Most are pretty entertaining however a few such as The Big House are great films and must be seen by serious film buffs. It's not surprising that this film took the Oscar for Best Writing as Francis Marion's script was the biggest reason this film was so good. It also didn't hurt that you had three exceptional actors Chester Morris Wallace Beery and Robert Montgomery in the leads as well as George Hill's wonderful direction. While Beery was the one who was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for me the best performance in the film was Montgomery'she played his part with an amazing intensity you just need to see. As for Morris he was as usual very believable and professional.The film begins with Kent Montgomery arriving in prison. He doesn't feel he belongs thereafter all his killing a person was just an accident as he was drunk! However the warden Lewis Stone will have none of this and tells Kent he's earned ten years in prison. Through much of the early portion of the film Kent felt very sorry for himself and kept asking his family about an appeal. I really felt annoyed at this as Kent seemed to only think about himself and showed no remorse at all. Fortunately the film did NOT paint him as a victim but as a spineless little jerkand as the film progresses you see just how spineless and evil he could be.Kent has two cellmates. Butch Beery is a sociopathic bully who pushes everyone around except for Morgan Morrisand Morgan is the third man in this cell. As for Morgan he's tough but there is also a certain decency about him and although Beery got the Oscar nomination for Best Actor clearly Morris was THE star in this film and the movie mostly focused on this guy. As far as what happens next I really would rather not discuss this as it is just better if you see it for yourself.As I said above Montgomery was the standout in this film. His terrified look and pusillanimous body language were great. While he's not usually thought of as a great actor here in one of his first films he is mesmerizing. The other two are also wonderfuland Lewis Stone is wonderful as the tough but very reasonable warden. But if you see the film you'll also realize that the biggest star really is Marion's script. The film is gritty and realistic without being bogged down by clichs. I also loved the direction as the camera angles and almost film noirlike camerawork really were striking. Well worth your time and proof that early talkies could be just as good as anything made today.".

	schema:reviewBody "I suspect The Big House helped birth many of the conventions staples and slang terms which have come to define prison films. Many of the classic elements are here but they manage to feel fresh instead of coming off as worn out clichs.The big impact this film had for me was that it made me a fan of two of its main stars Robert Montgomery and Wallace Beery. The Big House made Beery a star establishing his loveable lug persona and making him one of the biggest stars of the early 30's and one of the most unconventional stars in Hollywood history. Beery has a contradictory screen persona as seen here as his role of Butch a thuggish brute one minute but as gentle as a puppy the next. However I feel Robert Montgomery is the one who steals the show even If he doesn't have as much screen time as Beery and Chester Morris. Montgomery strikes me as the most interesting character in the film as a privileged pretty boy convicted of manslaughter while drunk driving he appears to be barely ready for adulthood let alone ready for serving 10 years in prison. Throughout the entire film you can tell he's completely out of his element with his trembling manner and naive wideeyed stare. Unlike the rest of the prisoners he is not a criminal in the common sense displaying how it's a scary possibility for any regular person to end up in prison regards of their background or social standing.Being an early talkie The Big House features many long static camera shots muffled sound and no background music. However I feel these technical limitations are one of the film's greatest assets as they heighten the claustrophobia of the cells and other confined areas of the prison. If The Big House was made or remade later in the sound era with more advanced cinematography and clearer sound and a music score it would not be as effective. The sound design itself is impressive with the sound effects of whistles prisoners marching or turning their plates in perfect unison in the mess hall showcase the routine nature of prison life and its mundanity.The film's screenwriter Frances Marion interviewed actual prisoners and prison personnel when writing The Big House making the film an as authentic as possible look at the American prison system in 1930. Director George W. Hill apparently threatened to fire anyone caught acting and forbade the use of makeup in the film. The sets don't look like Hollywood sets and this is not a romanticized look at prison such as movies like Ladies They Talk About. At the beginning of the film the prison's warden Lewis Stone delivers a monologue about the general public wanting criminals locked behind bars but don't care about their treatment or rehabilitation once in prison. Here the prisoners have nothing to do all day in the overcrowded prison but grow animosity towards the guards and plot on how they are going to make their escape. Shortly after watching The Big House I heard a discussion on the radio regarding the deteriorating conditions of prisons in the UK in 2014 and a caller phoned in and mirrored the exact points Lewis Stone made in The Big House 80 years later and nothing has changed.".

	schema:headline " The grand daddy of all prison movies!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Prison pictures were still raw and exciting in 1930 and this was the grand daddy of them all!!! I disagree with the reviewer  I think this film is every bit as good as a Warner Bros. crime movie. Wallace Beery is a revelation as Butch  a character that a few years down the track would become a staple in almost every prison movie.Kent Marlowe Robert Montgomery a wealthy youth who is used to having his parents fight his battles for him is sentenced to 10 years for manslaughter  he kills a man while driving drunk. Lewis Stone plays the stern warden while George F. Marion plays his conscience Pop Ryker. There are several speeches against the antiquated prison system the overcrowding which leads to putting first timers into cells with hardened criminals. This is what happens to Kent  he is to share a cell with Butch Wallace Beery an unrepentant murderer  you never heard of the Delancy gang wipe out  well I done the wiping!!! and also Morgan Chester Morris a criminal who still has humanity. He tries to give Kent advice about surviving in prison but Kent is drawn to the prison stoolie!!!There are some wonderful visual highlights  the prison food hall  prisoners are shown eating at what a few seconds before were empty tables. There is then a protest about the food which Butch leads. Morgan is keeping a low profile as he is due to be released. During visiting time Morgan sees Ann who is visiting her brother Kent. Kent is of course whining and complaining about how he can't take things in here anymore and why can't she do something about it. He is cowardly  Robert Montgomery is just excellent and has perfected the wild eyed stare  and through his actions ruins Morgan's chance of getting an early release. Both Morgan and Butch are put in solitary confinement and when they are released Morgan makes a daring escape via the prison morgue.While out he visits Anne's bookstore but she suspects who he is as her brother has written her a letter. She bravely apprehends him with his own gun until he manages to convince her that he means no harm. A local detective thinks he recognizes him and after a few months of freedom he makes a new start falls in love with Anne he is taken back to prison.There is to be a prison breakout shades of 20000000 Years in Sing Sing 1933. Butch has it timed for noon but Kent has already squealed to the Warden and the guards are waiting for them and because Morgan has refused to join the mob Butch thinks he is the one who leaked the plans. The mob scenes are excellently handled and the siege is very exciting. They even bring in the tanks!!!Although I haven't seen Robert Montgomery in a lot of films I don't think I have ever seen him act in a more convincing way. Leila Hyams was also an actress who tackled some pretty unusual roles as well. After a few ordinary roles she was surprisingly cast as the circus girl in Freaks  but this role was different as well. She plays Anne Marlowe a compassionate girl who is not afraid to use a gun to defend herself and also runs her own business.Highly Recommended.".

Wallace Beery is a revelation as Butch  a character that a few years down the track would become a staple in almost every prison movie.Kent Marlowe Robert Montgomery a wealthy youth who is used to having his parents fight his battles for him is sentenced to 10 years for manslaughter  he kills a man while driving drunk. Lewis Stone plays the stern warden while George F. Marion plays his conscience Pop Ryker. There are several speeches against the antiquated prison system the overcrowding which leads to putting first timers into cells with hardened criminals. This is what happens to Kent  he is to share a cell with Butch Wallace Beery an unrepentant murderer  you never heard of the Delancy gang wipe out  well I done the wiping!!! and also Morgan Chester Morris a criminal who still has humanity. He tries to give Kent advice about surviving in prison but Kent is drawn to the prison stoolie!!!There are some wonderful visual highlights  the prison food hall  prisoners are shown eating at what a few seconds before were empty tables. There is then a protest about the food which Butch leads. Morgan is keeping a low profile as he is due to be released. During visiting time Morgan sees Ann who is visiting her brother Kent. Kent is of course whining and complaining about how he can't take things in here anymore and why can't she do something about it. He is cowardly  Robert Montgomery is just excellent and has perfected the wild eyed stare  and through his actions ruins Morgan's chance of getting an early release. Both Morgan and Butch are put in solitary confinement and when they are released Morgan makes a daring escape via the prison morgue.While out he visits Anne's bookstore but she suspects who he is as her brother has written her a letter. She bravely apprehends him with his own gun until he manages to convince her that he means no harm. A local detective thinks he recognizes him and after a few months of freedom he makes a new start falls in love with Anne he is taken back to prison.There is to be a prison breakout shades of 20000000 Years in Sing Sing 1933. Butch has it timed for noon but Kent has already squealed to the Warden and the guards are waiting for them and because Morgan has refused to join the mob Butch thinks he is the one who leaked the plans. The mob scenes are excellently handled and the siege is very exciting. They even bring in the tanks!!!Although I haven't seen Robert Montgomery in a lot of films I don't think I have ever seen him act in a more convincing way. Leila Hyams was also an actress who tackled some pretty unusual roles as well. After a few ordinary roles she was surprisingly cast as the circus girl in Freaks  but this role was different as well. She plays Anne Marlowe a compassionate girl who is not afraid to use a gun to defend herself and also runs her own business.Highly Recommended.";

Nothing really seems at stake here despite the contrivances of plot.  The film lacks noise grit tension though it is fastmoving competently directed and decently acted.Wallace Beery does his usual gruff routine though he doesn't dominate the proceedings as one might expect him to.  Neither does Robert Montgomery which is usual with this curiously unlikeable actor.  He was goodlooking enough and always gave a good and thoughtful performance.  And yet he never makes a strong impression coming across like a lightweight despite his intelligence and skill.The revelation to me was Chester Morris a popular actor of the '30s and '40s who is now virtually forgotten.  With his strong jaw and ax blade profile he looks just like the Dick Tracy of the comic strips.  Here he gives a relaxed performance and shows great charm warmth and humor all with a certain intriguing restraint.  In fact he is extremely handsome sexy and appealing and in a very distinctive way  something about his brow and nose suggest Joaquin Phoenix kind but feral too.  Check him out.".

Although the story is told from Morgan's and Kent's points of view it's Butch who steals the show Beery was nominated for Lead Actor after all. The movie starts off from Kent's point of view as he is incarcerated for a DUI and vehicular manslaughter. After he's there for a while the film then shifts to Morgan's point of view as Kent betrays him on the day of Morgan's parole no less in hopes of getting some time off such is the Prisoner's Dilemma. Morgan escapes and hooks up with Kent's sister on the outside it used to be his wife but audiences were turned off by this turn of events. At first we're on Kent's side but as he starts to cave our sympathy shifts to Morgan in a most interesting way. The climax is a thrilling gun battle in the prison and in the end one of our heroes dies and the other goes free. Overall a very good genre picture.KEVIN More fun from Frances Marion the most celebrated woman screenwriter in Hollywood history who here tackles a much grittier subject the prison movie. This film is really a threeman ensemble consisting of Morgan Chester Morris Kent Robert Montgomery and Butch big bad Wallace Beery. When the film starts I thought it would be all about Kent trying to keep his head on straight while serving his manslaughter sentence. The focus begins to shift when he reaches his cell and meets 'Machine Gun' Butch and the charismatic brains to his brawn John Morgan. Very quickly the story shifts to Morgan after Kent doublecrosses him and Morgan later escapes. But Butch can hardly be regarded as the thirdplace character as his mere presence virtually dwarfs the other two men. It's definitely not the greatest prison picture that could be made. The directing is average the action scenes are spectacularly implausible and the sound effects are notably sloppy but it's certainly an enjoyable characterdriven action yarn guided by Marion's expert pen.Last film Hell's Angels 1930. Next film viewed Animal Crackers 1930. Next film chronologically Monte Carlo 1930".

Wallace Beery as a hardened inmate received the Best Actor Oscar nomination but the film is really much more about Robert Montgomery newly incarcerated and navigating the ins and outs of prison life until it's no longer about him and is instead about Chester Morris who escapes and falls in love with Montgomery's sister before being captured and sent back to the slammer. The film's money shot is a big shoot out at the end during which all of the principal characters die. This grim gritty stuff distinguishes the film as preCode and it's the movie's preCode status that allows it to get away with the moral ambiguity in not really having good guys and bad guys and making the audience unsure of who it's supposed to be rooting for.Being an early sound film The Big House is almost by definition uneven since filmmakers were trying to figure out what movies should look and sound like with the addition of the new medium. But many clearly thought Douglas Shearer brother of Norma and head of the MGM sound department at the time handled sound well as this film has the distinction of being the very first winner of the Sound Recording Oscar. Workhorse screenwriter Frances Marion also won an Oscar for Best Writing in a year that saw her go up against the formidable competition of All Quiet on the Western Front no less.Grade B".

Indeed as many users have mentioned the villain Ghajini does not look menacing enough. But lets face it gone are the days when villains used to be called Mogambo. And gone are the days when villains used to have a scar faced appearance. The new age villain is what Ghajini is.The acting is superb to say the least. Although Jiah Khan really spoils the party. She's better at romancing a senior citizen than playing such characters. Asin is absolutely brilliant and leaves a lasting impression. She makes you feel the depth and the pain of the Kalpana was killed tattoo. And finally Aamir Khan. Well what more can one say about this man who has changed the landscape of Bollywood movies. Once again he delivers a power packed performance I could almost feel his emotions within me!Watch this movie for its complexity and its simplicity. The complex character of Sanjay and the beautiful and cute Kalpana makes this movie one of the best movies of 2008. What an amazing way of making the year so special!".

She's better at romancing a senior citizen than playing such characters. Asin is absolutely brilliant and leaves a lasting impression. She makes you feel the depth and the pain of the Kalpana was killed tattoo. And finally Aamir Khan. Well what more can one say about this man who has changed the landscape of Bollywood movies. Once again he delivers a power packed performance I could almost feel his emotions within me!Watch this movie for its complexity and its simplicity. The complex character of Sanjay and the beautiful and cute Kalpana makes this movie one of the best movies of 2008. What an amazing way of making the year so special!";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Ghajini";
	schema:reviewBody "The tattoos on the body the Polaroid snaps the notes scattered around the house and the smoking gun evidence? Short term memory loss happening every 15 minutes. If this doesn't seem like Christopher Nolan's masterpiece Memento then I don't know what does. Written and directed by A.R. Murugadoss I don't see much of a nod of acknowledgement to Nolan's work and in almost all literature it only falls back on the fact that this is a Hindi remake of Murugadoss' own Tamil movie of the same name Ghajini produced in 2005 Nolan's was in 2000 which joins the ranks of films having their titles named after the chief villain.In any case this isn't the first time that we see very obvious similarities in premise and characters being adopted for Bollywood's own productions and the shotinSingapore Krrish comes to mind as well as they had the entire setting of John Woo's Paycheck incorporated into that film. But of course in any version some merits could be found but I believe some form of acknowledgement would be in order other than in this case a quick flash of a very wordy disclaimer about Ghajini being gleaned from various short stories and material and another paragraph which I missed given the fine print and short duration on screen but I'm pretty sure no mention of Memento.Well there are some reasons why I chose to watch this. First up the music's by A.R. Rahman and for all the good publicity he's getting for his work on Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire I just had to experience yet another piece of his musical magic on a film besides one that I've watched much earlier this year in Jodhaa Akbar. One just cannot imagine how his musical talent will be put to good use in a film which looks and feels like Memento and this being the next best thing. Guzarish is a track used in the trailer and it is currently my new ear worm.Another reason is of course Aamir Khan. Yet another prolific actor with a penchant for perfection it was interesting to see how his take on the protagonist's short term memory loss would rival that of Guy Pearce's. I'm embarrassed to say I've only seen him in action in Lagaan so this would be yet another opportunity to witness his ability which can be measured against a benchmark. But don't expect the same though because Pearce's version was more of a thinking man who questions and second guesses himself while Khan's version was in two parts to serve the story one as a raging hulk monster who tears through his opponents with savage violence fueled by anger and hatred coupled with the hurt he experienced and recalled Hulk producers take note in case Edward Norton decides against any more sequels look in the direction of Aamir Khan while the other as mildmannered Sanjay Singhania CEO of a telecommunications company in Mumbai.Yes Bollywood's version naturally comes with builtin song and dance which for once I would have thought looked quite out of place in the movie if not for A.R. Rahman's score and music. While half of the movie might be seen as a copy of Memento's premise and character the other half served more to allow the audience to share the pain with Sanjay. Nolan's version had you experience the frustrating condition of the syndrome through its narrative presentation but this one junks the reverse chronology and plays it out flat and builds a rich back story for Sanjay so much so that you'll root for him as he goes on his rampage of revenge. You'll find yourself entrenched in the romance between Sanjay and his lady love Kalpana the stunning Asin who reprises her role from the 2005 version as well who's a model awaiting her big break and a girl with a genuinely good heart. The plot never fails to give her numerous moments to showcase her good nature and it's no surprise why anyone would not fall in love with her instantly. Factor in plenty of loveydovey moments of comedy and pursuit under the guise of a different identity like Shah Rukh Khan's Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi which makes it perfect for a date movie but with hindsight that you know this love is doomed from the moment it began which actually makes it quite sad to watch the events unfold since you know what will eventually happen to her.Ghajini doesn't adopt or try to adopt those very cerebral mindf moments from Memento but as I mentioned plays it out more like a straight forward action thriller with a handful of inevitable moments of watching our protagonist get taken advantaged of because of his condition. No other structural styles are used besides flashbacks where the purpose of two characters in the movie are to read the diary of events so that it could be translated visually onto the screen. However you'll still be kept in the dark for some time as to why the designated thugs of Ghajini Pradeep Rawat would want to exact their mettle onto Sanjay and Kalpana and you'll be held in suspense for almost 2 hours before the reasons get shown.I can only imagine the flak that this film might receive because of having to adapt and not properly acknowledge perhaps that it's not original material save for the romantic spin on it. But if you would look past those ramifications and treat this like a reimagining of Memento in more straightforward terms that this would still serve as an entertaining thriller done Bollywood style.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of critics have condemned this film as being a mere remake of the highly acclaimed and popular Hollywood film 'Memento'. While there is no doubt that this film is at the very least loosely inspired from Memento to call it a complete ripoff would not only be a stretch of the imagination demanded greater suspension of disbelief than that required for viewing either movie but would also be unfair to the effort Murgadoss and the rest of the team have put into developing this epic for an Indian audience. Rather it would be best to view this film as a separate entity something not quite at the standards of Hollywood's best but certainly above the usual clichd Bollywood fare.Ghajini tells the story of a man called Sanjay Singhania Aamir Khan who suffers from a condition called Anterograde amnesia which prevents him from forming new memories as a result of which he is unable to remember anything for more than around 15 minutes. This condition was caused by the brain damage he suffered when hit on the head by an iron rod during a violent attack on him which also resulted in the death of his lover Kalpana Asin. Haunted night and day by fragmented memories of the incident he is driven to nearmadness with rage and embarks on a quest to avenge the death of his love by hunting down the gang behind the attackhis ultimate targets being a Mob lord about whom he knows nothing save for a single name'Ghajini'. In order to compensate for his short term memory loss he uses a system of notes Polaroid photographs and tattoos on his body to remind himself of the facts he has gathered during his quest and the progress he has made. Along the way he encounters a medical student named Sunita Jiah Khan who is intrigued by his condition and wishes to study him and thus ends up being dragged into his violent life. The story of Sanjay's violent quest alternates with extended flashback sequences of his happy preamnesiac past as a savvy corporate honcho and tells the tale of his romance with lively ad model Kalpana and the circumstances which led up to the incident that caused her death and his memory loss. Ultimately the film comes full circle in an aweinspiring climax when past and present collide to bring a fulfilling end to the story.Aamir Khan proves his versatility as an actor yet again playing not one not two but three roles in this film. As Sanjay Singhania the savvy corporate honcho he is polite yet has a brisk and efficient air to him a lot like his real life self. As 'Sachin' a struggling actor romancing Kalpana he plays the shy and unassuming everyman albeit one replete with both confidence and sincerity. And finally most notably he plays the postamnesiac Sanjay an almost insane inhuman monster a killing machine consumed by rage and bloodlust haunted by shattered memories and yet lost confused and disoriented whenever his periodic memory loss kicks in. Perhaps one of the best scenes in the film is one early on where waking up at home Sanjay wanders through his house clueless having no idea where he is until he reaches a mirror on which is written a note which tells him to remove his Tshirt whereupon he sees the tattoos that remind him of his lover's death and his quest to avenge her and cause him to be suddenly overpowered by rage and a desire for vengeancea transition which we observe several times over the course of the film. Asin does a pretty good job as the bubbly and vivacious Kalpana making her a likable character who's brutal murder does create the impact on the audience's mind which makes us truly sympathise with Sanjay's quest. Jiah Khan does okay as the medical student who gets dragged into Sanjay's quest for revenge while Pradeep Rawat may come across as an overthetop clichd bad guy in his role as the titular 'Ghajini'but it works well for the story believe it or not.This film is actually two films in that the darker 'present day sequences' of Sanjay's orgies of violence seem to belong to an entirely different genre from the lighter comedic flashback sequences though the shattering of Sanjay's happy past life makes us understand the driving force behind his present day violence. The style of music dialogue and even settings for both sets of sequences is drastically different as a resultwhere on one hand you have fancy office blocks garden parties and the beach side on the other hand you have seedy back lanes and darkened parking lots.On the whole despite a few ridiculous plot holes Ghajini is definitely one of the most entertaining if not one of the best films of Bollywood in recent years.".

You may have kiddo fantasies but please stop making people suffer because of your fancies.For movie This movie seems to be lost from the very beginning. And many illogical stupid plots. A cop who loves to handle case on his own and goes everywhere alone.A lady police constable who instead of informing her superior officials calls the witness at midnight to testify if the 2 of the kidnapped girls are missing??

I have many points to bring about this stupid movie but I have to give some rest to my hand. I can even write a book on the stupidity shown in this movie.Finally the only person who seems to be suffering from short term memory loss is the Editor who doesn't know what and when to show.

	schema:reviewBody "In totality it is a good movie. It's a movie that was not only successfully made but also successfully promoted. Though there is always some anticipation associated with Amir's movies as most of the time he promotes the movie through many channels and for many days and Ghajini was not an exception. Since last one year he had walked and talked about Ghajini. And as if it is not enough he had offered a scheme along with the offer watch the movie and watch the newly chiseled body of Amir for free. The movie was properly made and in fact better made than the original Ghajini which was overly dramatic in its treatment. The climax of the movie is different from the original one and is far better.The new face of the movie Asin came as surprise package and she not only looked great but also acted nicely. The background score is well executed and is able to hold the mood as well as to engage the audience. However the songs are too many and are at wrong times and except Guzarish most of them failed to create any lasting impact on the audience.Now comes the action that is the greatest part of the movie and is thoroughly well executed. The action choreography was done brilliantly and was completely able to convey the anguish and frustration of Amir. The action sequences are well executed and for the first time Ghulam can be treated as an exception Amir looked convincing when he beats up a whole lot of bad guys that are too many and too big for man of his size. Amir had not only sculpted a good body but also presented it nicely on the screen.However the most entertaining and soul touching part of the movie was not the climax but rather the comic as well as emotional scenes between Amir and Asin.The soft funny and soul touching Cinderella type love story of A business tycoon Amir and a gold hearted beautiful looking middleclass girl Asin was so brilliantly written and executed that I felt that it had all the potential for a separate movie. However the another Highpoint of the movie is that the way both sides and stories of Amir pre and post the murder of his beloved were told. The alternative narrating style was well executed and able to build suspense.Despite all the good things I have written about the movie I am very sorry to say that Ghajini is not Memento it just cannot be. Basically Ghajini is just another love  revenge drama that has Amir in it. That is what the movie is and it never lift itself beyond that though the potential was there. The only difference this movie has with other love and revenge dramas is that here the male protagonist is amnesiac. Sadly though Amir acted below his standards and most of the time he acted as if there is no difference between being mentally retarded and being amnesiac. No Sir they are not just one and the same thing. He had used too many stupid head moments and tilts strange stares acted unnecessarily confused and walk with abnormal gait.The movie never attempts to explore the plight of an amnesiac. Only thing that it ever attempts to show that the male protagonist is suffering from anterograde amnesia that it gave Amir one or two scenes in which he forgets about his current past. Surprisingly tattoos that have played an important part in the classic Memento are of no use in Ghajini except for acting as an excuse to show how beefed up our Amir had become come on Amir stop this pseudorivalry of you and Sharukh you are better than him even with both your hands tied down behind your back and a mask on your face.Basically this movie has disappointing me more than anyone else as after this I had started to believe that Amir is more of interested in making movies that look different rather than being actually different otherwise there could not have been so many holes in the script and treatment. All the time that he wasted on shaping up himself and subtly promoting the movie could have been utilized in making the movie more realistic and deeper without actually losing its commercial value.So my verdict is watch the movie for Asin and when you come back then rent Memento watch it and then calculate how high Christopher Nolan stands than A.R. Murugadoss.".

	onyx:emotionText "In totality it is a good movie. It's a movie that was not only successfully made but also successfully promoted. Though there is always some anticipation associated with Amir's movies as most of the time he promotes the movie through many channels and for many days and Ghajini was not an exception. Since last one year he had walked and talked about Ghajini. And as if it is not enough he had offered a scheme along with the offer watch the movie and watch the newly chiseled body of Amir for free. The movie was properly made and in fact better made than the original Ghajini which was overly dramatic in its treatment. The climax of the movie is different from the original one and is far better.The new face of the movie Asin came as surprise package and she not only looked great but also acted nicely. The background score is well executed and is able to hold the mood as well as to engage the audience.

	schema:headline " Overhyped Masala Flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Ghajini only goes on to show what hype can do for a movie.The movie may well be on its way to become one of the biggest grosser in Bollywood. But at best it matches up to an aboveaverage Sunny Deol flick. Had the movie not featured Aamir Khan it would not have been nowhere close to what it is now.Bollywood has had a history where many a venture has sunk despite hype but what worked for Ghajini was a sustained and immaculately planned publicity campaign. That it was Aamir's sole movie in the whole year and was coming a whole year after his poignant Taare Zameen Par already had the nation in good anticipation. This combined with the publicity given to Aamir's overhyped physique and supposed eightpack took the hype to newer altitudes. The marketing team also made sure the bulkedup Aamir was visible in malls and public places. Days before the release one could see the onceconsidered reticent Aamir giving interviews on every possible show on every possible channel. Newspapers and websites were flooded with Aamir's 13 month rigorous training to get his look. Also to engage a larger segment of the audience romantic promos augmented the initial actionoriented posters.The end result of it all had to be a bumper opening for Ghajini. Needless to say all this wouldn't have worked so well for another actor but Aamir's hysteria is unparalleled and his fan following spans all sections of gender class and religion. The loose ends of Shahrukh's Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi also proved beneficial for this film and the thinking audience thronged the halls to see if Aamir had fared better. For the rest who weren't really the star's fans they went anyways to see what all the hype was all about! So how did I find it? The film is loud and the background score louder. This morning I concurred with my colleague who told me that he left the hall with a heavy head after watching this film. Even the overall music barring a song or two is forgettable and belowaverage by Rahman's standards. Majority of the songs stand out of the story and merely extend the length of the film.If action happens to be your genre of choice you will enjoy the punches and villains being banged on walls and windows. If not then you'd be sitting at the wrong place for those parts of the movie. What however holds your attention is the narrative the director manages to engage you through the entire film. When the gore goes heavy a romantic flashback alters the tone and pace of the movie. In this regard the editing is slick and crisp. So even if the film could put some of you to sleep it won't give you the opportunity to yawn! In terms of performances Asin wows with her refreshing act. She lights up the screen and due apologies to Aamir's fans steals the thunder from right under the actor's nose. It's a pity she didn't get her due with the superstar taking most of the credit. You wait for her to come on screen be it simple acts of helping people around her or faking up her romance with the business tycoon  she portrays the character of affable Kalpana with lan. In fact it is the flashback sequences in which she appears that were most enjoyable.It is surprising that Aamir known for choosing his films very selectively opted for this South Indian remake. Even though his character is central to the film he doesn't have too many dialogues. As a guy suffering from short term memory loss he shows his frustration to a degree but doesn't have much else to do than beat up anyone and everyone coming in his way. Perhaps the director could have focused more on the confusion and tribulations he faced due to his problem. As the business tycoon in flashbacks his witty act makes you laugh. But in one of the scenes when giving interviews to international media he didn't sound convincing as a magnate. All in all his performance was satisfactory in the context of the film. He didn't break any new ground with this as some people claim. As for achieving the macho look I don't think with the support available these days it is such a Herculean task for an actor known for his sincerity and perfectionism.As the bad guy Ghajini Pradeep Rawat disappointed he tried hard to mouth Haryanvi dialogues but was neither effective nor convincing. Perhaps the movie would have been elevated to another level had the villainy act been more polished.The cinematography by Ravi K. Chandran was par excellence. And be it the exotic locales of the Guzarish song or dark shots of the climax sequence he has shot them all brilliantly. The action sequences have a South Indian influence even though some of them are executed well.Ghajini as a one time watch was entertaining even for someone like me not particularly into action movies or Aamir Khan. But the cult status to which it has been elevated is definitely not justified. It is a clearly overhyped and has garnered undue credit than what it is worth. I'm sure people had higher expectations from Aamir but for fear of being sounding different no one wants to admit that.".

ARRahman  WOW!!! He made the Kaise mujhe song echo in all the audience's heart as they leave the theater. Its like Every night in my dreams song from titanic.

	schema:reviewBody "Movies like Memento gets made once in a while. It has nothing to do with the story it has nothing to do with the direction it has nothing to do with the cinematography it has everything to do with the executionNow I'm not saying that directioneditingcinematography was not good. It was Aclass. No second thoughts there for sure. But the point here is the movie doesn't STAND out for me due to these factors. I mean the whole movie was played backwards. How more innovative can you get? And not only it was innovativeness Nolan did a damn cool job of changing one's thought process and the way one analyzes each character. You sidesympathizeloathe with some characters in the beginning and after a point it is the other way around. How many movies have been able to achieve that? Not many. I'm sure. This is what makes Memento great. This is what makes Memento MEMENTO. This is film making raised to the power infinity.And then comes Murugadoss says he was inspired by Nolan and he wrote his own version of the film. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing. Although I still feel Aamir's body tattooing just like Leonard's method of remembering things is too much of a coincidence if not anything else. Now the movie might be completely different from what Memento is or what Memento showed. But it would be very tough for me to watch the movie in isolation. I mean granted the movie might not be a Memento but hasn't it taken the central idea and also the tattoo's part? . And then what does the director do? He adds an Asin subtracts some clothes adds some songs again shows us a love angle? Why? Why so accommodating all of a sudden Murugadoss? And then Aamir Khan steps in. The man who knows it all have been there and done that kind of air with him. Momento I couldn't understand he writes with a nonchalance. Also he didn't 'enjoy' it too. No problems there too. Movies are just like opinions. To each his own. Disliking 'Momento' doesn't make Aamir a bad actordirector. But what does he do to make the movie talked out is to get a new look for the movie. I mean how bloody convenient? You took one of the strongest ideas played around with it. Walked with it up to a certain extent and then when you developed cold feet added what the audience would like? I'm not against songs romance in the movie esp. Hindi movies but just for the heck of it? Build up an original idea do what so ever you want to do with it. Make love to it seduce rape. Whatever. But the idea has to be yours.But please don't flinch someone else's idea toy with it mercilessly get someone to back you up by saying I didn't 'enjoy' it. Though that 'someone' is the superstar is a different thing all together. I wouldn't have any problems had Ghajini been Murugadoss's and only Murugadoss's baby I would have cared too hoots. Had he added a zillion songs it wouldn't have mattered. But I would be very very sad if Murugadoss kills one of my favorite movies of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ghajini is an out an out action thriller set at the backdrop of romance and revenge drama. Its almost a frame 2 frame remake of Tamil hit Ghajini which was originally inspired by Memento. Since I loved both the versions. It was difficult to expect anything newer or better from the Hindi version. So the verdict would mostly revolve around did the makers ensure the benchmarks are met. Its a definite 'A' for being able to meet the gigantic expectations. No the director has not disappointed you. The high points are the few thrills that are part of the narrative the edge of the seat kinds.While avoiding comparisons Aamir is done a terrific job playing a confused and furious person in search of the killer of girl friend. His corporate getup was styled differently and looks convincing. I can already sense the style being a rave shortly in the corporate dressing. His toned up body looks fab and justifies few of the over the top fights.Asin has won my heart again din't think she would be able to do so repeating the feat she did 2 years ago. In few of the reels she literally stole the movie from Aamir. The climax is different and is better picturised. Overall when you leave the theatre you do feel if you missed something.. I can only sum up the following could be why i felt so.. 1. I knew the story and could predict the dialogues in advance. 2. The length was a mild problem 3. The action sequences looked dated in parts one blow and 4 on the ground. 4. The originals were too good to repeat it.Oh I wished I had the bliss of not having watched the originals to take a fresh look at it.For the humongous effort of the team go watch it if you are hungry for masalas beyond cakes and wine this holiday season..".

	schema:reviewBody "Ghajini was promoted well that even a person who won't be Amir's fan could go and watch it to find out what would be about the story that made Aamir to work out for this one. From promos the obvious parts and facts about the movie was it's action flick movie well wrapped with songs and dynamic dialouges. It's true this movie has mind blowing action sequences but with that even story is also good. Ghajini is a chase saga between goons and Aamir. Ghajini starts off with a lab where Jiah Khan is a student who is looking for a project to work on. She finds a file of Aamir khan who is a short term memory patient. Professor insist and deny her to take that project. Right after there first action sequence you will witness where aamir is fighting with one of the goon. He kills him. Right after that fight Aamir goes the place where he lives and you can observe that he things all tidy regarding to his revenge that he is taking. Every morning when he wakes up he reads what happened to him and become provoked. He excercizes with anger and then starts moving on for his mission. One of the cop finds out about Aamir's place through a ticket that was left on a murder place. Somehow he's able to get hold of Aamir. and then tie him up. He finds a diary on which Aamir has wrote about from the time he came to India and what happened. The cop reads through it which also let the audience know about the flash back story. In the dairy it tells how aamir and asin met up and how their love story goes on. the dairy ends with where aamir decides to reveal his original personality that he is not an ordinary guy he is a well accomplished businessman. He will only tell her that if she accepts his love. The cop tries to wake him to find out what happened after that. But Aamir somehow manages to untie himself and start beating up the cop. Aamir was about to kill him when he hears the door bell rings. Aamir hides him somewhere and then he goes out to the college where Jiah Khan is studying. Jiah tries to talk to him but aamir denies to tell her what happened about the accident. Aamir then goes to the place where he would be able to see Ghajini. Ghajini is a villain whom aamir is targeting. There aamir takes his picture. And then He tries to kill him. But by mistake he kills someone else. Then Ghajini tries to kill all his enemy. but he seems to realize there is still someone who is left. At the same time Jiah goes to Aamir's place to talk to him. She mistakenly finds That cop. She unties him and then the cop insist her to flee. But at the same time Aamir shows up. He doesn't remember who they are. The cop starts to run and Aamir starts to chase him through the streets. Jiah is also running after them. Accidentally the cop dies by crushing down from a bus. Then Aamir starts to chase Jiah.Jiah some how manages to escape from him. The entire movie is tied up with back forth sequences of romance action and songs. There is not really any comedy in this movie. The action sequences are well executed. The movie is quiet violent at places. Will aamir be able to find out who is ghajini that something now you have to look out by watching this movie. The entire team of Ghajini has done a good job. Asin is worth watching. Though she is teaming up with super star She manages her space for this movie. Mostly it's said that to get Hindi dialet isn't easy for a Tamil actress. But you wouldn't experience anything like that in this movie. Even the villain is done good. there would be definitely nominations for him for his work. Jiah is a surprise pack and also has got important role. And Again for those  who was comparing Ghajini with Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi I would have only one thing to say you need to learn differentiating a musical movie and a revenge saga movie. The theme is like watching Hollywood style movie in Hindi.".

The direction screenplay acting and music everything was truly amazing. A very well coordinated movie.Some might look at this movie as a 'Dark Comedy'. It truly is... This movie reminds of Momento and Kill Bill both great superhits.Pros  Very well known and superhit story from Tollywood. NOTE Even though concept is same as in Momento the story is very different. Plus I liked the Bollywood flavor since it introduces a lovestory aspect.Excellent acting by Aamir Khan as usual. Brilliant new comer  Asin.Mix of Comedy and Thrill and Drama and all the Action. Perfectly balanced story extreme violence and moderate comedy. You'll be left with a movie belonging to multiple genres. Not sure why that was a complaint by some reviewers even though it is brilliantly executed.  Excellent screenplay and cinematography. PresentFlashbackPresentFlashback yet no break in story very good flow. Almost 80 of the time the movie kept me thinking about both the past and the future of the story what must have happened and what will happen both at the same time.Cons  Well the one thing I didn't like is the length of the movie. There were one or two places where I felt like the scene was unnecessary and the movie could have been shortened.Nevertheless I might just go watch this movie again. In fact this movie has inspired me to watch Momemto again. This movie is not for everyone and the only reason is too much violence. But I can guarantee that anyone who is tolerant to violence and looking for a new story and hasn't seen the Tollywood version will definitely love this movie.9 on 10 from me. Best movie of 2008 and 2009 for me.".

The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line. No wonder then that you await an Aamir starer with bated breath. the Hindi adaptation live up to the humongous expectations? The hype is unmatched and you expect no less than a presentday masterpiece. Running time almost 3 hours? Not at all! There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. As moviegoers we've watched countless good versus evil fares over the years and although GHAJINI belongs to the same family not once does it take the beaten track. The story has been told differently and most importantly the story offers so many twistsnturns that you just can't guess what would unfold next. Director A.R. Murugadoss tells this one differently. It starts off with what happens in the past comes to the presentday goes back in time again and returns to the contemporary again. This is a breathless exciting story heartbreaking and exhilarating at the same time. On the whole GHAJINI is a winner all the way. The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest Hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic the Week 1 business should be unparalleled the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short GHAJINI has 'Blockbuster' Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch GHAJINI instead.".

Out of so many positive things the most important thing is the actress Asin  never saw an actress so expressive and not to mention so beautiful .

All who follows bollywood forums knows that there is a fight between Aamir and SRK fans and since Rab Ne has become such a hit Aamir fans are having hard time swallowing it. That's why you are seeing lots of great reviews of Ghajini for past 4 days.Luckily I am neither Aamir or SRK fan. I just came back watching Ghajini and I will say its a big disappointment. I don't need to tell about the story because everyone knows about it.Film has a good first part mostly because of Asin She has done a remarkable job only bright thing about this film. Where Aamir has you know worked more on his 8 Pack Abs and nothing more. He did not put much effort as he usually does. Result after the death of Asin films gets boring its more action senseless action. If you are trying to get over 2611 don't watch this movie as everything you watched on Television about 2611 will come flashing in front of your eyes. Any way another weak link about the movie is Giya Khan She just can't act. Director has tried to fix all these problems with more and more action which is impressive if you don't watch Hollywood Movies but If you have watched some good Hollywood Action Movies you will find Ghajini's action ordinary.This film is remake of a tamil movie with same name but when you watch the movie you'll find that it has taken lots of scenes from successful Hollywood Movies as well like Hulk and many more. Its not a movie but Hindi verison of trailers of many Hollywood Movies.Only watch it if you are Aamir Khan's fan or you like action movies otherwise skip this movie. It has nothing what we use to see in Aamir's movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only good thing about Ghajini is its marketing. With so much hype created for such a long period of time this movie is sure to draw packed houses for the first few days. The movie is marketed as the story of a revenge of a man who is suffering from short term memory loss. Well in reality you get this and much much more..To start with within the first ten minutes of the movie any movie lover can see the lackluster screenplay. And then it doesn't get much better. The story line is seriously flawed and you don't have to apply any brain to see the gaping holes in story.The idea of short term memory loss  only able to retain things in memory for 15 minutes  should have been the central theme of the movie. Sadly this part is grossly underdeveloped and hugely diluted by flashbacks of romance and 'comedy' . For one who has watched Nolan's Memento and went to see Ghajini with similar expectations this will be a very frustrating experience.Director has not tried to develop any character in the movie. Ghajini is the main villain on whom the movie is named. Director is not successful in making the audience hate the villain and hence feel sympathetic towards Sanjay Aamir.High part of the movie is Aamir Khan. He is looking good with his new chiseled body and has done a superb job. Few action sequences are nicely shot and edited and you feel the force in the scenes. But apart from this the movie falls flat and you are left wondering where it is heading to. Songs are again a sad part of the movie. Nowhere fitting in the story line almost all of them are dream sequences.Having 'wasted' my money on this movie my suggestion to you would be better wait for some satellite TV channel to air it.".

And what's new? My first reaction is why was this film made? Scene to scene copy of Memento. And even then again it was already remade into an Indian film in the past so why then was that needed? Aamir Khan hams throughout and his acting is pretension at its worst. It's not the young actor I used to like whose simplicity covered the entire screen. He is now someone who pretends to be a good actor who pretends to portray himself as someone who takes a role seriously but in the end his acting generates into annoying hype. No intensity no skills nothing. And BTW he is not at all that fit. If I were the director I'd rather cast John Abraham or Hrithik Roshan who could make full justice to this role in terms of physical appearance and general credibility.Asin is nice overacts in some scenes but does have some charm. She's not a great actress but she is an actress without a doubt. Giah Khan is average.It's sad that this film was such a big hit. Indian mass audiences generally like to watch films which are melodramatic and overdone or just mediocre films which show a fake world. Ironically Raja Hindustani a cheap film without any vivid storyline was one of those films.It's sad because while many of the films deserve the money they earn take Sholay Dilwale Dulhania many are just terrible disasters that seem to appeal to all those who prefer to see a different plastic world and that's how many smallgreat films are simply and shamelessly left out.I'm not against any film as long as it is entertaining exciting interesting and wellmade. But I am against films that are just not needed that are pretentious that are made to fool people to insult their intelligence by pretending a film is of a high standard and above all films that were made just to publicise the leading actor. Ghajini is one of those films that apply to all these descriptions.".

	schema:headline " Jump off a bridge and fall in love";
	schema:reviewBody "The last time Luc Besson directed a movie was back in 1999. The last six years he occupied himself with his productioncompany EuropaCorp and by writing a lot of screenplays. Now he's back with his 9th feature film ANGELA. This time no gunfights carchases or explosions. Nope this time the man brings us of all things a romantic comedy. The movie is completely shot in Paris and seems to be one of the most secret projects of French cinema. Honestly I can't see why except maybe for a nice plottwist which is presented to us halfway through the movie and not as usual near the end.The plot don't worry no spoilers Andr is a regular swindler. He lies and cheats all the time and owes money to almost every criminal in Paris. After being beaten and threatened for the umpteenth time he decides to kill himself by jumping off a bridge. On the verge of committing this act of despair while standing on a bridge he looks to the left and sees a girl about to do the same thing. When she jumps he jumps after her and saves her from drowning. She's so thankful that she offers to do anything he wants while constantly remaining at his side. Suprisedly she turns out to be a real lifesaver by finding a lot of dubious ways to earn money and pay off Andr's debts. After a while Andr wants to know why she's doing all these things for him and is curious about her past...Jamel Debbouze you might know him as the slightly retarded grocer's assistant in LE FABULEUX DESTIN D'AMLIE POULAIN is particularly good as the nervous Andr. The Dannish Rie Rasmussen a sexy blond goddess with legs that go all the way takes a little more time to convince as Angela. However there is a certain chemistry between the two of them. The other characters are merely caricatured portraits of criminals and gangsters.The story is rather straightforward and relies a lot on funny situations and dialogues. A lot of talking is being done and I must say most of the lines are wellwritten. Near the end of the movie unfortunately Luc Besson goes way overthetop making the movie lose a lot of credibility. But then again it just might be possible that the end could be interpreted in two different ways. And that makes me suspect that Besson likes to play it safe by trying to please as many viewers as possible.Anyway a very important reason to watch this movie is the atmospheric black  whitephotography by cinematographer Thierry Arbogast who also worked on Besson's previous films. Paris during autumn is beautifully transferred to the screen with wellbalanced lighting. The movie also has some impressive shots of 'la Tour Eiffel' a cathedral in 'le XVe arrondissement' and the many bridges to be found in Paris.Most likely ANGELA will have as many defenders as adversaries not necessarily to be divided in Bessonfans and notfans respectively. But both parties will have to admit Besson had the guts to try something different. So let the boxoffice decide whether this genreeffort is successful or not.".

	onyx:emotionText "The last time Luc Besson directed a movie was back in 1999. The last six years he occupied himself with his productioncompany EuropaCorp and by writing a lot of screenplays. Now he's back with his 9th feature film ANGELA. This time no gunfights carchases or explosions. Nope this time the man brings us of all things a romantic comedy. The movie is completely shot in Paris and seems to be one of the most secret projects of French cinema. Honestly I can't see why except maybe for a nice plottwist which is presented to us halfway through the movie and not as usual near the end.The plot don't worry no spoilers Andr is a regular swindler. He lies and cheats all the time and owes money to almost every criminal in Paris. After being beaten and threatened for the umpteenth time he decides to kill himself by jumping off a bridge. On the verge of committing this act of despair while standing on a bridge he looks to the left and sees a girl about to do the same thing. When she jumps he jumps after her and saves her from drowning. She's so thankful that she offers to do anything he wants while constantly remaining at his side. Suprisedly she turns out to be a real lifesaver by finding a lot of dubious ways to earn money and pay off Andr's debts. After a while Andr wants to know why she's doing all these things for him and is curious about her past...Jamel Debbouze you might know him as the slightly retarded grocer's assistant in LE FABULEUX DESTIN D'AMLIE POULAIN is particularly good as the nervous Andr. The Dannish Rie Rasmussen a sexy blond goddess with legs that go all the way takes a little more time to convince as Angela. However there is a certain chemistry between the two of them. The other characters are merely caricatured portraits of criminals and gangsters.The story is rather straightforward and relies a lot on funny situations and dialogues. A lot of talking is being done and I must say most of the lines are wellwritten. Near the end of the movie unfortunately Luc Besson goes way overthetop making the movie lose a lot of credibility. But then again it just might be possible that the end could be interpreted in two different ways.

With two brilliant central performances from Jamal Debbouze as Andr and Rie Rasmussen as Angela this is a Romeo and Juliet love story with a central theme about loving life that is better than Prozac. With some nifty little camera tricks and a quirky script it takes you on a journey of all the major landmarks of Paris from the Eiffel Tower Notre Dame the Sacr Cur and plenty of seemingly deserted streets. Like a hybrid of Amelie Wings of Desire and It's a Wonderful Life it is so moving in places I was nearly reduced to tears. Every second that Angela is on screen she is so beautiful and captivating that I practically saw her in colour and with Andr making up the odd couple they are a pleasure to watch. Stylish without being oversentimental Angela is an ageold love story but told in a new and interesting way.".

Serious Besson fans will not be disappointed. Besson has filmed a Paris that is at the same time both beautiful and real. We see the beauty of Notre Dame Parisian cafs the city's bridges but we also see its ugliness and the difficulty faced by those who do not fit the stereotype of what it means to be French. Anyone who has ever felt like a stranger in their own home will find a kindred spirit in Andre. It is a struggle to fit into a culture and a struggle to value one's self as a part of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "AngelA is an easy film to knock. Superficially there isn't a great deal to endear it to any particular type of audience. For example there's barely any action no sex or nudity there are no big Hollywood stars it's not sufficiently intellectual to be an 'arthouse movie' despite being black  white! and although it has amusing moments it's hardly a comedy. In addition the film is only focused on the two main characters and even then it's only really about one of them. The remaining participants are quite deliberately it appears straightforward stereotypes who allow the simple story to progress. The quality of acting from Rie Rasmussen seems far from impressive but to be fair she's not speaking in her native language. Mind you her awkward portrayal of the titular character seems to work well and she certainly stands out as a 'fish out of water'. But despite the film's potential shortcomings there are three saving graces that transform AngelA from a rather average 7 to a brilliant 9 in my eyes the breathtaking cinematography thank you Luc Besson the magnificent casting Jamel Debbouze is perfect as Andr and the heart warming gentle story which stayed with me long after the film had finished. In fact I would go so far as to say that AngelA could leave you examining your own life and wondering when was the last time you stopped to 'respire and regard' the beautiful world around you and consider how the way you feel about yourself might well have a direct impact on how others treat you. However AngelA is one of those films that you have to be in the right mood to watch. If you don't allow yourself to relax and be drawn into the fairytale the story can easily fall flat. You also have to give it a chance to get started the fastpaced dialogue at the beginning makes it hard to watch the pictures at the same time as reading the words unless you're French of course!. But once Angela enters the frame the story takes off on a stunningly gorgeous wander around Paris and the way that the tale gently unfolds in the second half of the film is wonderfully touching. There are many moments of outstanding beauty and even the superficially simplistic longshots of Angela  Andr crossing the Seine have a mysterious magical quality about them. Actually the whole film feels slightly unreal this is partly down to the subject matter but also to the way it was filmed in an almostempty Paris at odd times of the day. So in summary I love AngelA. It's one of those films you can watch again and again quite happily and find new insights from each viewing. There are so many scenes that quickly become favourite moments as you watch it multiple times. The contrast between the giant Nordic goddess and the shifty little NorthAfrican seems to work brilliantly and the backdrop of a beautiful black  white Paris with incredible lighting more than makes up for a few minor flaws. 910".

	schema:headline " Besson wanting to claim himself as an auteur";
	schema:reviewBody "Besson's intention by directing this movie was good. There is it seemed to me a big effort to make his film deep considering the discourse. It can be perceptible through the plenty of plays with symbols that are contained in it. The main problem is that by writing such dialogs certain scenes seem too artificial and often too long. This has to be added to the fact that if you see the film in french youll quickly notice that the dialogs that often concern both J Debbouze and Rie Rasmussen are more than sometimes incomprehensible and require a permanent attention to decipher them. Rie Rasmussen even if she's quite a wonderful creature on a physical aspect is however an average actress and the scenes that deal with emotions are spoiled this is rather surprising considering Besson's job on The Professional by a clumsy actor's direction. However cinematography by Thierry Arbogast is astounding and foreigners will find a wonderful black and white postcard of Paris as they'll see the movie. It is also regrettable that Besson didn't appeal to Eric Serra for the soundtrack. For Besson's defense it must be said I think that his staff and himself have worked in such constraining circumstances to shot in Paris that the number of shots was counted and couldn't allow actors to give their full potential. This is the first time also that a director has full access to production and budget resources by himself so he can write a screenplay that does not have to be selected by instances like CNC allowing himself to direct a personal but too poorly collaborative project. Anyway this is a film that has definitely to be seen.".

The first directorial effort by Luc Besson after 6 years and Besson having produced and written movies in between that can IMHO be only described as crap. No need to worry however AngelA is simply a delightful film. Expertly framed by Thierry Arbogast it presents a very simply story in a genuinely funny and original way. Both Jamel Debbouze and Rie Rasmussen are perfectly cast and seem to be having a lot of fun playing their respective parts. While one could say that the general setup of the picture is hardly new it really doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film or the underlying story. The film doesn't present many twists and turns the ending can be foreseen about halfway through the film. The joy of getting there however makes up for any of the afore mentioned problems.Now please Monsieur Besson Don't make us wait 6 years for the next liveaction picture!".

	schema:reviewBody "Stagnating in debt without a Euro to his name smalltime lowlife Andr decides that the best thing for all concerned would be to throw himself into the Seine. However just as he is about to end it all on the Pont Alexandre III he is interrupted by a beautiful blonde who without word or question leaps into the river before him. Without even questioning the irony Andr jumps into the water to save her and after pulling her to safety is shocked when the woman dutifully offers to help him out of his current predicament. Angela of course is no ordinary suicidal beauty though it takes time for the sceptical Andr to realise that she has latched onto him for a very specific reason. The twist is that she needs him just as much as he needs her if only to feel the emotional connections that divinity has denied her.AngelA 2005 takes director Luc Besson back to his roots to some extent giving us a slight though no less charming little tale of love and loneliness that forgoes the kind of balletic exotic action and violence that came to pepper his more iconic work throughout the 1990's and instead looks back to the quirky stylish character driven films that he produced in the early to mid 1980's. As a result AngelA seems indebted to the long since forgotten cinema du look movement a brief cinematic resurgence in 1980's French cinema that saw a younger generation of filmmakers looking back to the days of Godard Truffaut and the Nouvelle Vague to create popculture referencing films dealing with doomed love and alienated Parisian youth. Although the film is very much evocative of that brief era in French cinema in which Besson came to prominence alongside filmmakers such as Jean Jacques Beineix and Leos Carax AngelA isn't a complete retread of his earlier work. In fact the most notable thing about this film is the way in which Besson channels the spirit of his younger self  creating a film that is high in energy and expressive in both style and imagination  but also manages to bring to it the same sense of emotional maturity and character detail found in his much better films of the 90's chiefly Nikita 1990 and Lon 1994.Whereas his 80's films were content to fall back on clever visual gags iconic characters and arch dialog AngelA takes these characteristics and applies them to a relationship that is as mysterious provocative and believable as the one between Lon and Matilda or even that of Corbin Dallas and Leeloo from his great popart sciencefiction thriller The Fifth Element 1997. It also gives us characters that we can care about and believe in something that seems a million miles away from the puppetlike warriors of his first film the wordless sciencefiction parable The Last Battle 1983 or the ironic caricatures of the director's second feature the chic and iconic crime thriller Subway 1985. Many have likened AngelA to the classic Frank Capra film It's a Wonderful Life 1946 with the notion of a down on their luck character being brought back from the brink by a mysterious angeliclike figure. This is true to some extent but the difference is in the details and the overall message that the film presents. In It's a Wonderful Life the central character played by James Stewart is shown how much poorer the world would be to his friends and family if he had never been born. In AngelA however the character of Andr is shown how great the world can be if only he had the strength and the drive to take advantage of any situation no matter how seemingly hopeless.Some will obviously balk at the brazen romanticism on display here particularly towards the end of the film in which Andr and Angela realise  without giving too much away  that they each fulfil some greater sense of purpose to one another with Besson once again bringing things to a close on the Pont Alexandre III to create an interesting circular aspect to the narrative rife for reinterpretation. The relationship between Andr and Angela is a very beautiful one playing off the obvious differences in their appearance and the slow reversal of roles that takes place over the course of the film's duration. It also works as a result of the pitchperfect casting of comedian Jamel Debbouze as the luckless Andr and supermodel Rie Rasmussen as the protective Angela and the subtlety and compassion that both of these performers bring to their respective characters. With this in mind AngelA for me at least is as beautiful as cinema gets perfectly tapping into the spirit of the cinema du look approach with the glossy photography sharppacing and imaginative use of production design but with an interesting story and characters that manage to elicit real and captivating emotions.The continual interplay between the two characters and the presentation of their plight is beautifully done featuring some of Besson's best writing and dialog with at least two scenes in particular the mirror scene and the penultimate scene back on the bridge almost bringing me to tears. It is unconventional shamelessly romantic and prone to the kind of unashamed flights of fantasy that really require an enormous amount of suspension of disbelief... but it is worth it. AngelaA is a beautiful film not only in the way in which it is presented but in the relationship of its central characters and the deeper philosophical interpretations of the plot. Quite clearly a hard sell for many perhaps more cynical viewers but for me this is a genuinely imaginative and inventive film that moved and delighted me on a profoundly personal level.".

I found myself pleasantly surprised with this one. I'm not usually into all this soppy romantic bllocks but with this I'll make an exception. It's actually a really beautiful film well acted and well made. It tells the story of a nohoper who finds redemption in the form of a beautiful girl. The film makes you question for a while whether or not this girl is actually insane. I was taken with how beautiful and talented Rie Rasmussen was and was even more stuck by the fact she wasn't French and had to learn the language for the role. Jamel Debbouze also did well his scene in the mirror very well acted you'll know what I mean if you've seen it. Not for everyone but for fans of a nice night in with the missus this is a must. Quick note she cried at the end .".

I found myself pleasantly surprised with this one. I'm not usually into all this soppy romantic bllocks but with this I'll make an exception. It's actually a really beautiful film well acted and well made. It tells the story of a nohoper who finds redemption in the form of a beautiful girl. The film makes you question for a while whether or not this girl is actually insane. I was taken with how beautiful and talented Rie Rasmussen was and was even more stuck by the fact she wasn't French and had to learn the language for the role. Jamel Debbouze also did well his scene in the mirror very well acted you'll know what I mean if you've seen it. Not for everyone but for fans of a nice night in with the missus this is a must. Quick note she cried at the end .";

A bit about Rie Rasmussen Among other worldly powers she is a 5'10 professional model who is also an actor. AngelA a Eurocorp film is foreign by American standards and is all spoken French. The movie is in blackandwhite and filmed completely in Paris. AngelA is an enigma for many reasons. She shows an interest in Andre a little guy who jumps off a bridge into one of Paris's rivers. Andre demonstrates that he can swim and fishes AngelA out of the river. Now she plays the part of the person who owes this man her life. She quickly finds out that Andre is a Middle Eastern with a morbidsarcastic humor who dabbles in olive oil. And other ventures that have landed him in...trouble. The angel tells him she will make all his financial troubles go away. Then the mobsters will go away and not kill him. So early in the movie as AngelA is becoming Andre's friend and rescuer she tells a lady in a bathroom that the guy AngelA is with is a woman actually. It's clear that Andre is not gay. Later in a restaurant is possibly the most romantic and sweet part of the film where AngelA tells Andre this revelation directly. AngelaA may be an angel but she is not some sweet little angel with a halo and all of that. She is smart thinking on her feet. She sizes up situations quickly. And with some experience in handtohand combat she could have easily kicked some butt throughout the film. Yet AngelA whose sidekick believes is a wild woman is very much woman and later Andre understands why.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Luc Besson is quoted as saying Cinema never saved anyone's life it is not a medicine that will save anyone's life. It is only an aspirin. That doesn't mean we don't sometimes like our aspirin in posh packaging and that's exactly what we get with Besson's new movie his first directorial venture for six years.AngelA is a romantic comedy shot in black and white and with subtitles. While it is not entirely without merit the fancy wrapper illustrated with a plentiful helping of Parisian photoopportunities should not lull you into believing you are watching of film of real quality or substance. While there is a great mishmash of talent scattered throughout I found myself wishing for the first half that a Hollywood remake could edit the jokes with better comic timing. Your problem is that you're always running instead of hitting pause the leggy blonde heroine Angela tells our forsaken and suicidal Andr and that's exactly what it feels like as the verbal jokes are disgorged on an audience without time to digest or appreciate them and the slapstick is wasted from lack of pacing.Fortunately things do get better especially as we are made privy to Angela's mission. Having picked up some emotional ballast the jokes have more to reverberate off. The best bit after being given a mission she tells him is going to wardrobe  on this occasion she has decided to do slut  which she pulls off very convincingly although when she turns her hand to beating up bad guys she reminded me more of the deadly android Pris from Bladerunner.Angela's rather morethanhuman task could easily have descended into farce but Besson cleverly chooses the moment of revelation to get more serious. From hereon in the movie gets more interesting throwing in gender psychology and marginally more intellectual challenges. I am you she tells him  he may be a man on the outside but inside he's just a sixfoot slut. The emptiness of the opening section makes this intense characterisation welcome and I could eat up such pretentious lines and the tearful looks with glee. It even makes sure it doesn't take itself too seriously the line follows on from a scene where Andr is getting changed in a women's toilet and Angela counters an elderly lady's vexation by insisting He's a woman really implying he's transsexual. Although AngelA has 'strong language and sex references' justifying its '15' certificate there's no nudity and we are left wondering if even the sex scenes were in our imagination. Besson does succeed in getting us to think about Angels  as well as Fallen Angels Falling in Love and Why do Angels Need to Eat a CalciumRich Diet but the idea of angels shedding some divine light into the life of mortals is heavily polluted with selfish wishfulfilment. In the Bible angels were originally 'sons of God' who came to earth to sire children on mortal women. Later they were called demons 'fallen' angels until the Book of Enoch cut to the chase in true patriarchal fashion and blamed women for the angels' fall. Here they ask us if happiness is not indeed in heaven. A 2005 Harris Poll showed that 68 of Americans believe in angels rising to nearly 80 in the less educated suggesting that the film will be further 'cleaned up' for any American remake. Until then if AngelA is not exactly the classic it aspires to be it's quirkier and classier than the average chickflick and should be enjoyed as such. Much could be said in criticism of it but for such a relatively humble offering it could be more divine to forgive.".

	schema:reviewBody "Luc Besson Leon The Professional and Fifth Element is a master of two things  boldly unique visuals and oddball romantic pairings. Both are abundant in his latest film a masterpiece called AngelA. There are moments of aesthetic perfection in this film that took my breath away. I caught myself beaming from ear to ear on more than one occasion as I marvelled at some of Besson's cinematic composition. AngelA is inventive and beautiful and poetic.Before I describe the film let me say that it all leads to and away from one quite devastating scene. It is a scene played out by the two leads staring directly into a mirror and having a conversation with each other. The camera pans behind the glass allowing us as viewers to become the mirror. I became so captivated by the emotions of that moment because I saw pieces of myself in Jamel Debbouze's character. For an instant I entirely mirrored his feelings. After having seen over 3000 films in my life it ranks as one of my favorite cinematic moments to date.Jamel Debbouze plays Andre a down on his luck Frenchman who is in grave financial difficulties with the wrong crowd. He is trapped in Paris because he has lost all of his identification including the American green card that could get him back to his New York City home. The US embassy is not too keen to help him as he has a recent conviction for fraud on his record.When all is seemingly lost and time has run out on his debts Andre steps over the barrier to Le pont Alexandre III in order to throw himself into the Seine. Moments away from the desperate act he peers to his left only to see a statuesque blonde twenty feet away about to do the same thing.Rie Rasmussen plays AngelA pronounced like Angela with a French accent a 6foot beauty with the body of a supermodel and the face of an angel. Weeping she launches herself into the famous river. Jamel instantly follows in an attempt to rescue her. He drags her ashore.Andre questions her desire to commit suicide. After all how can someone so beautiful want to do such a drastic thing? Surely there most be something to live for? AngelA returns the questions which only serves to irritate him. He is just a short average looking man with enormous money problems. He loves no one and no one loves him. What more does he have to live for? She offers herself as a devoted friend volunteering her life to him. What he says goes. Needless to say Andre is sceptical.What follows is a black and white tour of the most beautiful city in the world today. Luc Besson's incredible framing and camera work follows these two people as they dart in and around some of the most famous landmarks in Europe. There is nothing quite like Paris in black and white. Each and every frame of this film would hang proudly in any art gallery. It is one of the most aesthetically gorgeous films I've ever seen.What makes it even more resplendent to behold is the presence of Rie Rasmussen. One would think that a supermodel with only one acting credit under her belt as the diamondclad thief in De Palma's Femme Fatale would not be a standout performer. One would be wrong.Rasmussen is a renaissance woman if there ever was one. I've been a big fan ever since her infamous catwalk wink at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2001. She has since directed two magnificent  acclaimed short films Il Vestito  Thinning the Herd. Those efforts will soon lead to a major directorial production. She has published a book of her photography entitled Grafisk. Her canvas artwork is extraordinary. And based on this performance her acting skills extend far beyond making out with Rebecca Romijn.Jamel Debbouze and Rie Rasmussen are perfectly cast as the hapless loser and the angelic guide. Both of them create three dimensional characters that are full of surprises. The two of them generate laughs and thrills and tears. It is a masterclass in acting. I loved watching them in what is essentially a twocharacter play react off each other for the entire ninetyminute running length. There is passion. There is anger. There is silliness. There is tenderness. There is empathy. Debbouze and Rasmussen deliver on all levels.AngelA is a truly lovely film about finding love... for another as well as for oneself. It is superbly shot by the visual genius Luc Besson... who finally matches that visual mastery with a story that earns such an effort. The lead actors will not win Oscars because The Academy never rewards such small foreign films  but it should make an exception in this case. This film is endlessly entertaining hopelessly romantic and devilishly witty. It is one of my favorite films in recent years and I urge you to go out of your way to find it.Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics.com".

	schema:headline " Touched by an Irresistible French AngelA";
	schema:reviewBody "The French fondness for absurdity and philosophical conundrums is on fine comic display in the film AngelA written and directed by veteran movie maker Luc Besson. The leading role of Andre was tailorcrafted for actor Jamel Debbouze who nails it dead spot on and never fails to wring affecting humor compassion and wonder out of every line and gesture. As Andre Debbouze is a down and out wouldbe artist living in Paris. Though he prefers to think of himself as an American on some sort of bohemian cultural adventure it appears more likely that he's a Moroccan immigrant with big plans to strike it rich investing in olive crops in South America. His meager financial means make those plans unlikely to become reality. When he's unable to pay back money borrowed from the mob he decides to commit suicide by jumping off the Alexander III Bridge into the Seine River. However just as he's about to jump he notices a blonde woman about to do the same. Despite her obvious intentions he asks what she's doing. She answers by making the jump.Although he was fully prepared to cancel his own life Andre ends up saving that of the woman he eventually comes to know as AngelA. Happy though he is to have spared her he also finds himself lamenting I can't even kill myself without someone fg it up! That the individual he has rescued is someone extraordinary is apparent from her beauty which stands out even while she's dripping wet and disheveled. A clue to just how extraordinary she may be is provided when she stands up and towers over Andre's fivefootfive form. In exchange for having saved her life the woman vows to serve Andre in any manner he chooses. To Andre's way of thinking it will be good enough just to have this beautiful creature by his side and allow the association with her to bestow some degree of dignity upon him. AngelA's way of thinking turns out to be very different when she proves she can and does deliver a great deal more. As AngelA proceeds to correct one by one Andre's financial and legal woes with the mob the struggling transplant can hardly believe or accept his good fortune. Like most modernminded individuals probably would do he rejects her revelation that she's actually an angel. After all her chosen disguise for this visit to earth is in her own words that of a sixfoot sexy bitch. She provides Andre with both the proof he requires and certain solutions needed to his mortal dilemmas. The greatest challenge turns out not to be Andre's problems with the mob but his lack of respect and love for none other than Andre. After AngelA gives her charge the gift of himself he of course falls dangerously in love with her. However the brilliant twist in this film is the dilemma with which AngelA finds herself literally wrestling once her mission to assist Andre appears to have been completed and her wings spread to fly her back to heaven. Rie Rasmussena student of directing as well as an actor and writeris a dazzling marvel in her portrayal of the title character. She and Debbouze aided by Besson's fantastic script share an onscreen chemistry that grows more incandescent with every scene. The city of Paris itself also gives an amazing kind of performance as the flawless setting for this modern metaphysical fable. That the film was shot in black and white adds immensely to its poetic enchantments and irresistible romantic appeal. by AuthorPoet Aberjhani author of The Bridge of Silver Wings and Christmas When Music Almost Killed the World".

When he's unable to pay back money borrowed from the mob he decides to commit suicide by jumping off the Alexander III Bridge into the Seine River. However just as he's about to jump he notices a blonde woman about to do the same. Despite her obvious intentions he asks what she's doing. She answers by making the jump.Although he was fully prepared to cancel his own life Andre ends up saving that of the woman he eventually comes to know as AngelA. Happy though he is to have spared her he also finds himself lamenting I can't even kill myself without someone fg it up! That the individual he has rescued is someone extraordinary is apparent from her beauty which stands out even while she's dripping wet and disheveled. A clue to just how extraordinary she may be is provided when she stands up and towers over Andre's fivefootfive form. In exchange for having saved her life the woman vows to serve Andre in any manner he chooses. To Andre's way of thinking it will be good enough just to have this beautiful creature by his side and allow the association with her to bestow some degree of dignity upon him. AngelA's way of thinking turns out to be very different when she proves she can and does deliver a great deal more. As AngelA proceeds to correct one by one Andre's financial and legal woes with the mob the struggling transplant can hardly believe or accept his good fortune. Like most modernminded individuals probably would do he rejects her revelation that she's actually an angel. After all her chosen disguise for this visit to earth is in her own words that of a sixfoot sexy bitch. She provides Andre with both the proof he requires and certain solutions needed to his mortal dilemmas. The greatest challenge turns out not to be Andre's problems with the mob but his lack of respect and love for none other than Andre. After AngelA gives her charge the gift of himself he of course falls dangerously in love with her. However the brilliant twist in this film is the dilemma with which AngelA finds herself literally wrestling once her mission to assist Andre appears to have been completed and her wings spread to fly her back to heaven. Rie Rasmussena student of directing as well as an actor and writeris a dazzling marvel in her portrayal of the title character. She and Debbouze aided by Besson's fantastic script share an onscreen chemistry that grows more incandescent with every scene. The city of Paris itself also gives an amazing kind of performance as the flawless setting for this modern metaphysical fable. That the film was shot in black and white adds immensely to its poetic enchantments and irresistible romantic appeal. by AuthorPoet Aberjhani author of The Bridge of Silver Wings and Christmas When Music Almost Killed the World";

The woman will do anything to help him and it soon become apparent that she is something more than human.Shot in glorious black and white I don't know when Paris ever looked this good. Its a glorious looking film that is a real treat to look at. I had to take a couple of phone calls during the film so I paused the movie only to find beautiful art print style pictures on my TV. Heavenly.The plot line of an angel helping out our stumble bum hero is a well worn one. Whats different is how Besson plays it against expectations clearly he's a man who needs a bit of help but contrary to most films of this type he's not a complete idiot. He's a man who's been worn away by the world and who really just needs some one to believe in him. this would be a great double feature with Wings of Desire To be honest most of the plot of Andre needing to get money and Angela helping him doesn't really work all that well. Its clearly been put in place so that Andre and Angela have something to do. What shines through that is the interplay between the two characters. There is a real affection for each other. Indeed once the money plot goes by the wayside and we simply concentrates on the two leads who are in almost every shot the film becomes a wonderful touching tale. More than once a tear came to my eye as the two slowly began to crash into each other. Its wonderfully romantic.A word of warning. This is an odd ball movie in a way. The film is not what you think it is or rather it wasn't what I thought it was. About half way through I was tempted to restart the film and watch it again because I suddenly had the feeling that I was not liking the film as much as I was going to on the next go round. It was clear that the film was doing what it wanted and that I wasn't ready to take it on its own terms. I resisted the temptation but I'm pretty certain that I'm going to like this better on the second go round. I have a feeling this is a film you like the first time and love the second.Warnings and reservations aside I do recommend this film. If you can go with its vibe I think you'll have a really good time. As for me it made me wish I I had some one to love like that.".

	schema:headline " Probably one of the best nonAmerican family adventures in recent history.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Thief Lord was released in my country a couple of months ago and for some reason this movie almost immediately caught my attention. A German family adventurefantasy movie with English language and with English actors  all of that seemed quite unusual and therefore interesting to me. At the same time I never heard of Cornelia Funke's novel of the same name so I didn't know exactly what to expect from the movie. I watched Thief Lord today and actually I liked it. It was really fascinating to see something fresh and different from typical and often annoying Hollywood family stuff. For young ones Thief Lord is an enjoyable family adventure with talented young cast against the background of one of the most beautiful cities in the whole world Venice. For grownups besides that it's a story of bitter loneliness and sometimes misunderstanding which unite most of the characters. Two brothers fifteen years old Prosper and much younger Bo after death of their parents are separated. The younger goes to the old childless relatives and Prosper has been sent to an orphanage. But brothers can't live without each other and for six years old Bo Prosper is the only person who cares about him and loves him so much. Desperate they run away. They have nowhere to go in the whole world and they are heading to Venice the city that their mother loved so much. But the city is not welcome to runaways with no money and only unexpected help of a mysterious boy who called himself Thief Lord and saves them from more troubles. Bo and Prosper join him and his team of orphans who find a refuge in a deserted movie theater. Soon our heroes learn that ancient city is full of surprises and what's is more that some strange magical things can happen there. They become involved into rather unexpected events and lives of different characters collide in Venice. We meet a lonely wife and husband who also heading to Venice trying to find a runaway child who was merely a way to suppress their own loneliness a lonely detective who was hired to find Bo and some other characters. However finally for many of our heroes resolution salvation of their personal problems will come in a rather unexpected way for each other. But the loneliest and most suffering from that is mysterious Thief Lord himself who is trying to keep his secrets inside of him. This key character is playing by Rollo Weeks who looks very good in his rather complicated part. Both Aaron Johnson Prosper and Jasper Harris also left very positive impression from their acting selfreliance and naturalness. Despite rather short running time of the movie the development of most main characters is not bad. We know enough about them to feel sympathy or antipathy to them and we are not indifferent to them which is very important for such a story. The acting among adult cast was also not bad with most memorable and likable performance from Jim Carter as Victor. Thief Lord in the beginning the movie is fast paced and probably a little too short but mostly it's exciting wellfilmed film with interesting and original story. The soundtrack one it's own looked very good and it's a very good addition to visual part even if sometimes the music is abstracted from what we saw on screen. And let me to say that visuals for such lowbudgeted production were also not too bad. If you are looking for a good nonAmerican family adventure film on English language as an alternative for Hollywood production featuring talented cast probably you would be unable to find better choice than Thief Lord. Also it's worth to notice that the movie mostly successfully avoids typical and clichd for American family films crude humor and language.I know possibly I'm too generous and surely Thief Lord is not a flawless masterpiece but I rated it 9 out of 10. Unfortunately such enjoyable and beautifully shot family movies so rarely appear in our movie theaters or video stores. And the last one thing that I almost forgot to mention. The title song Orphan skies is pretty cool and I liked it very much.".

Rollo Weeks is in my opinion the ONLY choice for Scipio aka The Thief Lord.The plot is that with a surprise ending. My favorite character is Scipio. This movie is perfect for males and females of all ages. It was originally made in English but was dubbed for German theaters. So every one who speaks English don't worry!

This movie is perfect for males and females of all ages. It was originally made in English but was dubbed for German theaters. So every one who speaks English don't worry! You can still see this wonderful movie!If you see it and just love itwhich I know you will you should recommend it to all your friends!";

Yet I had no idea The Thief Lord was being made  only discovered by chance that it was on release. Very minimal publicity indeed compared to the overhyped Harry Potter films. As a fan I wondered if it had suffered under the filmmakers' knife. Whether it had been drastically altered. Well there is occasional alteration  several scenes cut but otherwise one of the more faithful adaptations. I was impressed by Scipio in particular but I thought everyone was good. The adults were a little OTT but not bad. Archers fans will recognise the distinctive voice of Lynda Snell Carol Boyd as the aunt. The score is dramatic  the effects wondrous. I'd rather see this than Harry Potter any day. Thief Lord has genuine heart  doesn't rely on constant flash  show. It's real storytelling for a change. It's just a shame it will be lost beneath the heavyweights of X3  The Wild. 910".

But i have say this movie was probably the best movie i have seen in many years. This movie just blew me and not only me but my family away. The film was amazingly detailed and explained the character very well. The effects for this movie were just magical. This film isn't the blockbuster of the year but this movie did have amazing acting the effects were really well done for a lowbudget movie. And the most important it did stay very true to the book and left very little out. Looking back on some bookmovies they leave a lot out and some of the movies don't turn out that great for some people. But this movie left out very little and a lot of people will be very pleased. The movie overall will get a 1010 because Cornelia Funke is just an extremely amazing writer and the movie was just so magical and exciting all people of any age will love it. And don't forget to catch Cornelia's soon to be made into a movie Inkheart.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had read the Thief Lord and really liked it but the ending never really clicked with me. Suddenly Venice seemed almost supernatural which came completely out of the blue and Scpio's decision to become grownup although you understood why it was done seemed like a huge mistake. I had really enjoyed this book until that part.But of course when I saw that it was made into a movie I had to see it. I was fully prepared to be completely disappointed with the movie and complain that it was nothing like the book but I was pleasantly surprised.The movie was absolutely wonderful! The story was summarized to the main plot very nicely and most of the dialogue seemed to come straight out of the book. The acting was superb. The soundtrack was great. And most importantly it visually answered my questions.When Bo sees the creatures from the MerryGoRound you actually believe Venice and the MerryGoRound has these magical powers. Also I was more acceptant of Scipo's lifealtering decision after seeing how he contently fit in to the adult world something that I thought was never done to my satisfaction in the book.Although the movie is obviously a lowbudget film. I found the special effects quite refreshing to today's computergenerated creatures. For some reason I found it to be even more believable that way.There were only two problems I found with the movie. One was the lack of knowledge you had for the supporting characters. For instance I didn't even get that Hornet had a crush on Prosper until after it was said. I understand that you can't fit all of the character's history from the movie into the book but a little would be nice.The second problem I had with the movie was that I didn't know about it until I saw it on DVD! I can only assume that it was because it didn't make enough money in the box office. My question is WHY?!? This is probably one of the best family films I have seen in a long time and would please adults and children alike. SO WHY DIDN'T THESE PEOPLE SEE IT! TO MAKE UP FOR THIS CRIME THAT YOU HAVE Committed ON YOURSELF YOU MUST GO AND RENT THIS MOVIE. You won't regret it.".

The story's about little Bo and his older brother Prosper. Their mother died and they are placed under the care of their Aunt Esther and her husband. Aunt Esther only wants Bo because of his angel face and plans to place Prosper in a boarding school it's an orphanage in the movie. The siblings refuses to be separated and runs away to Venice. There they meet Scipio aka Thief Lord and he offers them Stella an old rundown theatre as a home. There they meet other orphans like them Hornet Riccio and Mosca.Bo and Prosper's aunt and uncle goes to Venice and hires a detective named Victor to find them because they knew how much the boys love Venice from the stories their mother told them. There's a souvenir shop owner by the name of Barbarosso and the orphans sell the treasures that Scipio steals to him. Barbarosso has a costumer that wants something precious stolen and the Thief Lord accepts the job. It's a wooden wing that belongs to the merrygoaround of the Merciful Sisters claimed to do magical wonders. If I continue I'll spoil the delightful surprises.After seeing it I was disappointed. What happened to the characters? Where's the sparkle? The characters seem shallow comparing to the ones in the book. The movie really did stick to the plot of the book but it seems they were so obsessed in keeping the story line just right that they forgot the characters. Plus the English accent was so thick that I had a hard time understanding what they were saying.There are wonderful scenes in the movie that really shone forth. I love how Bo and Prosper met Scipio the camera following him crawling on rooftops. The awesome escape the gang made after Victor found them in the Square. Victor and his mustache collection that he keeps inside his jacket. The beautiful mask shop.Maybe I'm just too faithful to the book. This movie will be great for those people who haven't read it yet.".

In the book when Theif lord betrays everyone they hate him. In the movie it was all oh who cares. I was more then slightly annoyed by this. None of the other characters seemed to have a story behind them when they all did. Hornet collected booksand the aunt and uncle where way worse then the movie would have led you to believe. Even the way that the two main characters got there was toned down like it was no trouble at all. I would suggest that you read the book before giving this movie any type of high rating. I will guarantee you that you will be just as angry as I was.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Thief Lord' is an enchanting little film that will keep people of all ages occupied since it's executed in a manner that isn't too childish or sugary. Based on fantasy novel by Cornelia Funke the film centres on fourteenyearold Prosper and sixyearold Bo orphaned brothers who face being split up by their cruel aunt and uncle who intend to dump the elder boy in a children's home while they adopt the younger child. The boys flee to Venice a city their mother told them was magical where they are befriended by the mysterious Thief Lord and his band of street waifs. Stealing to provide for themselves the children's lives are about to take another extraordinary turn as the Thief Lord's secret is unravelled and they discover why Venice truly is a place veiled of magic.The child cast in this film all give decent performances and manage to carry the film well since it is very much a film that focuses on their characters. Rollo Weeks' Scipio is portrayed in a manner that shows him to be a less flashy more troubled hero than Harry Potter of the films an entirely different character to the Harry of the books. Aaron Johnson is perfect as Prosper a young teenager caught between enjoying his own childhood and providing a parental figure to his brother while wee Jasper Harris was utterly adorable as Bo proving that very young actors can still be talented. Their young costars of George MacKay Lathaniel Dyer and Alice Connor are equally as effective in their roles. And the young cast are wellsupported by their adult costars particularly Jim Carter as the clumsy Victor and Alexei Sayle as the slimy Barbarossa.As an adaptation 'The Thief Lord' is quite loyal to the books with the characters and the main plot remaining largely unchanged. The story is depicted in a manner that is involving and will endear the audience to the young characters and the musical score fitted the mood of the film perfectly. However there were a couple of flaws such as the scenes towards the end with the new 'children' I don't want to elaborate too much in deference to those who haven't seen the film were a bit too slapstick and didn't suit the rest of the film while the new version of Scipio should probably have been played by someone else since it just looked like Rollo Weeks with a bit of makeup on. And perhaps it should have been established where Proper and Bo lived previously so the audience aren't left wondering why the citizens of Venice all speak with English accents.That said I found 'The Thief Lord' a charming film that should appeal to all ages of the family. It's a shame it's so underrated and received little acknowledgement in the UK since surely we should be supporting our talented homegrown young actors and be eager to show the world that British child acting doesn't begin and end with the Harry Potter cast.".

It was better than I ever could have imagined. The movie captured all the magic and the mystery of the book and even brought it to life in a way I never could've thought.

	schema:reviewBody "If you're a hard core movie fan you learn to appreciate good Bad Movies. There are movies that go so far off the tracks in terms of one or several essential features of film art  casting script sets pacing editing lighting coherence  that there is no way that you could being honest recommend them without qualifications to an unsuspecting viewer.Movies that go off the tracks in these essentials and offer no redeeming features are just plain Bad Movies. You you make fun of them and then you forget about them.But some Bad Movies offer amidst the badness unique moments of grace and truth. You allow yourself to be sucked in and you studiously ignore or forgive all the screwups that went into making them Bad Movies. Angel Eyes is a Good Bad Movie.Why Bad? Genre incoherence is the biggest problem here. Angel Eyes was marketed as a supernatural thriller that offered spooky scary insights into fate love danger and perhaps life after death. Ads and the first portion of the movie hinted at a weird alternate identity for one character. Was he a ghost? An angel? A devil? Would Angel Eyes be another Sixth Sense or Wings of Desire? That's all just smokescreen. I'm not revealing any spoilers by saying that no one in the movie is a ghost an angel or a devil that conceit from the ads is jettisoned pretty quickly.There is a subtext of fate destiny love and death but that isn't worked really hard either. That whole subtext could have been skipped and you'd still have pretty much the same movie.The movie you get is a movie about traumatized people finding love and rebirth. And that is one great theme.Another problem with the movie is its misunderstanding of how quickly people can recover from trauma. But hey.I say but hey because this movie has a lot going for it and it's worth seeing for what it has going for it.Jim Caviezel is an underrated actor. He's not wooden he's subtle. It's tragic that we've gotten to an era where audience's eyes can't appreciate a quiet actor in the Gary Cooper mode.Caviezel is a worthy inheritor of the Gary Cooper mantle. He's stunningly handsome has a big gorgeous body  he's a former basketball player and it shows  and he possesses Cooper's quiet masculine tenderness and humility.All these qualities have allowed him to strike the perfect note of a very male spirituality in a number of films from Frequency to Thin Red Line to Pay It Forward to The Passion to Angel Eyes. In his early scenes when the movie doesn't want you to know quite what he's about he is perfect as a perhaps ghostangeldevilweirdo homeless bumsavior.He's equally good later as an entirely corporeal lover.He plays a wounded man and Caviezel has the gifts to convey his character's inner pain. You believe that he cares as much as he does about what wounded him you believe that his wounds could have done to him what the movie wants you to believe they did to him.Jennifer Lopez is equally good. Face it  Jennifer Lopez is a fine actress. Yes she appears on tabloid covers. Yes she made Gigli. Yes she poses in naughty clothes a lot. Yes she is a Puerto Rican from the Bronx.And you know what? She's a fine actress. Don't let her nonsilverspoon pedigree keep you from appreciating what she can do on screen.Lopez is as good as a cop here as she was in the more celebrated film Out of Sight. She's winning charismatic natural and lovely to look at. Even in a white tshirt and navy blue cop uniform slacks she is beautiful.Like Caviezel Lopez plays a wounded character ready to be reborn by love. She's equally as good as he but she conveys her different wounds in a different way. One wounded person retreats another lashes out in violence. It's interesting to see which party picks which method.Sonia Braga is in this movie. Any movie with Sonia Braga in it can't be all bad.Victor Argo in a very small part as a very flawed man is JUST PERFECT. 100 believable and heartwrenching. I'll never forget his moments locked in silent misery a misery he causes and a misery he feels.Finally there is a nottobemissed scene between an abused family member and the abuser. A character speaks into a video camera at a family reunion and ... the scene just took my breath away. At that point I wanted to cry and surrender my full respect to the movie in spite of everything it had done wrong so far.Don't let bad reviews prevent you from seeing this movie. Nothing's perfect. There's enough heart and beauty here for the discerning viewer to appreciate.".

	schema:headline " Absorbing human and very good characters.  out of four";
	schema:reviewBody "ANGEL EYES  2001  out of fourBy Blake FrenchLuis Mandoki's Angel Eyes begins as a melodramatic tragedy that feels as if it's missing something. Its centerpiece is a love story between an unlikely couple who save each other's lives under different circumstances. At first the film plays with interesting ideas about fate love destiny mystery and the past but does so with stunning blandness. The male lead James Caviezel plays Catch a mysterious character with an absorbing revealing past. But his inceptive existence switches back and forth between two negative impressions Catch is either a balmy character or Caviezel delivers a boring uninteresting performance. To my pleasant surprise however by the time the movie reaches its emotionally effective climax it proves these original perceptions to be wrong.  Jennifer Lopez stars as a tough Chicago cop named Sharon Pogue. She patrols the crimeridden South Side of Chicago with her police buddies including her partner and friend Robby Terrence Dashon Howard. In the same neighborhood lives Catchwho sleeps in an empty apartment and delivers goodwill to many around him. He wanders around the area as if he is in some kind of existential daze thus some believe him to be a lunatic but for most he appears to be a peculiar but harmless figure.Both of these characters have undergone deep emotional struggles. The vast majority of the conflict in Angel Eyes lies inside the characters. I do not want to give away any of the movie. Therefore I must be terse in my explanation. Experiencing violence early in her childhood Sharon has taken a stand against her father's abusive ways and is still paying the price her entire family disowned her. However her parents have invited Sharon to an upcoming marriage celebration. Should she attend forcing her to come to terms with inner demons and face her father for the first time in years?Angel Eyes provides no easy answers for its characters. Sharon's private and public lives are well developed and intriguing. The film gives her a lot of dimensionI especially like her family related aspects. I will not reveal any more information about Catch based on the advertisements his different people will have different expectations of his identity. By explaining anymore about him I risk giving away a large portion of the movie. Although the film does not contain startling identity twists or surprising ninety degree turns it is very deliberate about what information is revealed at what timethus the lack of information in the beginning. Angel Eyes deserves to reveal itself on a full scale rather than me giving its plot away right here and now.  Luis Mandoki has a certain knack with directing love stories that disclose their plot at the perfect moment. In 1999 his film Message in a Bottle examined another troubled soul coming to terms with his future. He does the same kind of thing with Angel Eyes. He's keeping a lid on his demons as Sharon does with hers explains Mandoki about the character's behaviors. It's only when they fall in love and then risk losing that love that they are forced to examine who they really are present and past.Screenwriter Gerald DiPego creates character's who connect with the audience. The story is about the conflict between isolation and connection says DiPego. We become isolated because we're afraid of opening up to each other especially these days. On the other hand there's a longing inside of us to connect. I think our salvation lies in keeping connected. As Angel Eyes concludes each of the two character's has come to terms with their troubles and past. What they discover I will leave up to you to find out. This is an uncommonly absorbing picture because we believe these characters live in our world not in face their most private and deepest fears and although nothing is truly solved by the end of the movie for Sharon and Catch for better or worse their problems become a different more fulfilling internal battle. some movie fantasy. So often movies end with a fluffy soft attitude for their charactersbut not in Angel Eyes.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was put out as a thriller on the commercials making it seem like the premise is about a cop who meets a guy who turns out to be a serial killer. When in fact this movie is a great love story. Jennifer Lopez plays Sharon Pogue a tough female police officer who is still recovering from an abusive childhood. Apparently when she was seventeen she called the cops and got her father Victor Argo arrested after he beat her mom Sonia Braga up. She hasn't been in contact with her family since then until now when the family reluctantly invites her to a ceremony renewing her parents vows. The there is Catch Lambart played by Jim Caviezal. He is a wanderer who lives in an apartment equipped with about three items  a bed a light and a table. Catch never smiles however he does walk around looking for good deeds to do. The two emotionally torn people meet when Catch tackles Sharon's assassin who is seeking vengeance of the death of his brother. The two quickly fall in love. But now Sharon wants to know about Catch's past which he wont say a word about. And basically the rest of the movie is about the Sharon trying tragicly dealing with her abusive childhood Sharon trying to find out more about Catch and Catch knocking down the wall he built around his past. I can honestly say that Jennifer Lopez delivers one of her best performances surrounded by the character of Karen Sisco in Out of Sight and her shouldhavewonanoscar performance in Selena. Jim Caviezal also did a great job keeping it real. But Jennifer Lopez is the major powerhitter in this movie. Jennifer never had to belch an emotion out it was natural for her. Guys ask a girl on a date and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!".

Apparently when she was seventeen she called the cops and got her father Victor Argo arrested after he beat her mom Sonia Braga up. She hasn't been in contact with her family since then until now when the family reluctantly invites her to a ceremony renewing her parents vows. The there is Catch Lambart played by Jim Caviezal. He is a wanderer who lives in an apartment equipped with about three items  a bed a light and a table. Catch never smiles however he does walk around looking for good deeds to do. The two emotionally torn people meet when Catch tackles Sharon's assassin who is seeking vengeance of the death of his brother. The two quickly fall in love. But now Sharon wants to know about Catch's past which he wont say a word about. And basically the rest of the movie is about the Sharon trying tragicly dealing with her abusive childhood Sharon trying to find out more about Catch and Catch knocking down the wall he built around his past. I can honestly say that Jennifer Lopez delivers one of her best performances surrounded by the character of Karen Sisco in Out of Sight and her shouldhavewonanoscar performance in Selena. Jim Caviezal also did a great job keeping it real. But Jennifer Lopez is the major powerhitter in this movie. Jennifer never had to belch an emotion out it was natural for her. Guys ask a girl on a date and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "So let me set the scene here I was in a motel in the middle of nowhere and was flicking through the channels of the limited cable that the motel offered... I spotted Jim Caveizel or however on earth you spell his name and put down the remote as he is an actor that I admire and respect.  Of course JLo then came into the scene and my instinct was to pick up the remote and flick the channel but I didn't and I am glad that I made that decision.  Not being a fan of JLo I have never seen Angel Eyes and had no reason to seek it out either on video or on the TV but hell when you are in a motel with limited cable options you don't have alot of choice right? Nevertheless I was thoroughly delighted that I left the remote where it was and watched this movie because in the end I loved it.  I loved it more for the subtle points than the big hollywood this is a romance you better weep points.  Hang up and I'll call your machine in this day and age how relevant is that? how many people if they would be honest would much rather talk to a machine than the person because it is impersonal and they can save face?  The teeny tiny aspect of him playing the notes of the trumpet on her back as they were dancing... okay so I am married to a musician so that resonates with me but it spoke volumes no matter how much he had tried to block it out his soul was still there and in his soul was his music.  I thought both leads played their roles with skill and conviction.  I was never quite sure until the end of course if Catch was a good guy or a bad guy and I liked the fact that it kept me guessing.  As I said I am not a JLo fan in fact I could be described as quite the opposite but in this movie she played her part beautifully with conviction and totally believably.  Jim Caveizel as always was understated calm and played his role with a sympathy that is rare to see.   Loved this movie and cannot wait to see it again.  I will agree with everyone however about the advertising hype that surrounded it they ended up portraying it as a psychological thriller if they had stayed true to the story and advertized it for what it was a beautiful romance I think it would not have died as it did.  Shame on the publicity people for burying such a fine film.".

	schema:headline " Lopez shines in effective drama";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit two things one is that I'm not a big Jennifer Lopez fan. Secondly she's very good in this film. The film opens at the scene of a car accident and a female police officer Lopez is telling the survivor who is all banged up that everything will be okay and to look at her. Then the film shifts to a year later and Officer Sharon Pogue is a Chicago cop who doesn't relate well to others except other cops and hates the whole dating process. While in a diner with her fellow officers she notices a man James Caviezel across the street looking at her and then suddenly a car drives by and starts shooting the place up. Sharon takes chase after the car crashes and chases a youth down into a secluded area when she is ambushed and the youth gets her gun and is ready to kill her when out of the blue the man who was staring comes out and saves her.SPOILER ALERTLater in a bar she meets him again and talks to him. She asks him his name and all he says is Catch. She's intrigued by him and he says he likes her but he says very little about himself. He wanders the streets a lot and also helps a handicapped woman named Elanora Shirley Knight with groceries. Meanwhile Sharon has family trouble and her parents Sonia Braga and Victor Argo are going to renew their vows and she's not sure if she should go. When she was a young girl she called the police on her abusive father when he was beating her mother and after all these years he still has not forgiven her.This film was directed by Luis Mandoki who also has shown in earlier efforts that he has a good flair for portraying relationships with believable emotional attachments. The problem is the area of the story surrounding Catch. We know right from the getgo who he is and what he's hiding. The film goes just a tad too long and of course there is an upbeat ending. I think it would have been totally appropriate to have a more open ending with some questions on the future of the characters. But the film is enhanced by a very good performance by Lopez. Not only is she believable as a tough cop but we can understand her emotional problems dealing with others. Its a performance that rings true and reminded me of why so many people are intrigued by her. Her character is the core of the film not Catch and she does a terrific job of balancing her emotions between the tough cop and the lonely and vulnerable woman. This isn't a great film by any stretch of the imagination but it is an underrated one. One of Lopez's shining moments.".

It's a shame the producers chose to use perhaps the worst marketing ploy in the history of film.Sharon Pogue Jennifer Lopez is a lonely woman in Chicago with no real life to speak of.  She is estranged from her family has problems with insomnia and her only friends are the people she works with.  Enter Catch Jim Caviezel a shy quiet man who saves Sharon's life.  They both seem to have problems with insomnia and reclusive behavior.  They start a cat and mouse game  she brings him to her apartment he seems to want to leave he wants to come back she tries to kiss him he doesn't want to be kissed.  She stands him up he gets upset then he doesn't seem to care so she follows him into his apartment etc.  It seems like it would get repetetive but the story is actually quite good.Lopez gives a good performance probably second only to her portrayal of Karen Sisco in Out Of Sight.  Caviezel is good at these sort of parts and seems to be in danger of being stereotyped as the guy that weird stuff happens to.  People often complain that the two of them have no chemistry together not realizing that this is the whole point  their relationship is made intentionally akward by director Luis Mandoki most likely to make it seem all the more impressive that they still want to be with each other.I have one big problem with the advertising and two smaller problems. They tried to make this seem like some sort of cop thriller  it is not. You'd think by watching the trailer that Catch is a menacing person the opposite of what the character really is.  They should have made this film out to be what it really is  a chick flick about an unlikely couple with no chemistry who love each other enough to stick with each other anyway. Consequently the film only brought in about 24 million.Which brings me to my second problem the budget.  Why did this take 38 million to make?  I noticed that this was released by Warner Brothers and distributed by two different production companies internationally.  That was unnecessary.  They could have easily made just as good a film for a lower budget.  Even with Lopez's 9 million paycheck the rest could have been shot for 5 million putting the total budget at 14 million.Also Catch seems a bit too spacey.  There perhaps should have been more attempts to humanize him which could have been done without killing the aura of despair around him.  I also didn't get the sex scene  the character didn't seem like the type to have sex with someone after only a few weeks.End spoilerDespite these last few problems I rated this film very highly as it is one of my favorites.  I just noticed the bad parts from watching it so many times.  Don't be fooled by the advertising  is it worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " Not Your Usual Mindless Summer Film Fare";
	schema:reviewBody "Angel Eyes differs from the usual mindless summer film fare. Audiences under age 30 may classify this brooding lethargic romantic mystery with Jennifer Lopez and Jim Caviezel as downbeat impersonal and tiresome. Neither Message in a Bottle director Luis Mandoki and Sharkey's Machine scenarist Gerald DiPego cater to neatly tying up all the loose narrative threads at fadeout nor pander to erratic attentiondeficit style editing to ingratiate audiences with their lachrymose cops  lovers yarn. Instead every scene in Angel Eyes portrays life as an experience where people sometimes cannot resolve conflicts. Mandoki and DiPego dole out plot details like bread crumbs to string us along and this piecemeal strategy maintained my attention.Angel Eyes will either intrigue you or will infuriate you entirely with the way they draw out the inevitable. They give their characters room enough to develop and a gifted firstclass cast exploits every opportunity. Admirably much of this provocative aboveaverage but uneven 'chick flick' springs from the characters and their reactions to the obstacles thwarting their desires. Unwisely Mandoki and DiPego rely on some plot contrivances that undercut credibility but deepen dramatic impact.Angel Eyes opens in Chicago at the scene of a tragic traffic accident. Windy City cop Sharon Pogue Jennifer Lopez of Maid in Manhattan comforts an accident victim until the paramedics arrive. Mandoki and DiPego create an intriguing aura of mystery early on in the story because the victim remains anonymous.

	onyx:emotionText "Angel Eyes differs from the usual mindless summer film fare. Audiences under age 30 may classify this brooding lethargic romantic mystery with Jennifer Lopez and Jim Caviezel as downbeat impersonal and tiresome. Neither Message in a Bottle director Luis Mandoki and Sharkey's Machine scenarist Gerald DiPego cater to neatly tying up all the loose narrative threads at fadeout nor pander to erratic attentiondeficit style editing to ingratiate audiences with their lachrymose cops  lovers yarn. Instead every scene in Angel Eyes portrays life as an experience where people sometimes cannot resolve conflicts. Mandoki and DiPego dole out plot details like bread crumbs to string us along and this piecemeal strategy maintained my attention.Angel Eyes will either intrigue you or will infuriate you entirely with the way they draw out the inevitable. They give their characters room enough to develop and a gifted firstclass cast exploits every opportunity. Admirably much of this provocative aboveaverage but uneven 'chick flick' springs from the characters and their reactions to the obstacles thwarting their desires. Unwisely Mandoki and DiPego rely on some plot contrivances that undercut credibility but deepen dramatic impact.Angel Eyes opens in Chicago at the scene of a tragic traffic accident. Windy City cop Sharon Pogue Jennifer Lopez of Maid in Manhattan comforts an accident victim until the paramedics arrive. Mandoki and DiPego create an intriguing aura of mystery early on in the story because the victim remains anonymous. Cleverly but effectively they capture the action from the perspective of the injured passenger. A year elapses and the main plot gradually begins to unfold. Angel Eyes depicts Sharon Pogue as a tough resourceful fearless police woman who can handle anything that the criminal element can dish out.

	schema:reviewBody "Possible SpoilersAlthough Sharon Pogue the central character in this film is a Chicago police officer with a beat in one of the city's roughest districts this is not a traditional 'tough cop' thriller. Rather it is the story of a romance between Sharon and a mysterious stranger named Catch which begins when he saves her life while she is confronting a violent criminal. Catch is a strange figure who lives alone in a deserted building and who wanders the streets performing acts of kindness to strangers. Sharon finds herself emotionally drawn to this baffling young man who appears simpleminded but gentle fey and vulnerable yet nonthreatening and the two begin a romantic relationship. As the film progresses we realize that Catch had a previous life very different to the one he leads now. We learn for instance that his real name is Steven Lambert and that he is a talented jazz musician. There are also hints of a secret in his past which has left him with an overwhelming sense of guilt we eventually learn what that secret is although I will not reveal it here. Sharon also has psychological problems arising from her difficult relationship with her family particularly with her abusive father which started when she reported him to the police because of his violent behaviour towards her mother. The main themes of the film are the need for forgiveness of oneself as well as of others reconciliation and redemption. We see how Sharon and Catch deal with the shadows of the past which are threatening to destroy their chances of happiness. Unlike some I did not see Catch as a Christfigure possibly those who did were influenced by the fact that the same actor Jim Caviezel also played Jesus in Mel Gibson's recent 'The Passion of the Christ' or the film as an overtly religious one. The themes of forgiveness and redemption are capable of being understood in a secular way as well as a religious one. It is however possibly a spiritual film and certainly a poetic one. Certain scenes such as the one where Catch and Sharon realize their love for one another while swimming in a disused quarry and the one in the nightclub where Catch rediscovers his love of jazz struck me as having a particularly haunting quality. I was also impressed by the two leading actors. This was the first of Caviezel's films that I had seen other than 'The Passion' and I was touched by his portrayal of the lonely guiltridden but kindly Catch. As for Jennifer Lopez I was pleasantly surprised. On the previous occasions I had seen her in films such as the truly appalling 'Anaconda' she struck me as being not so much an actress more a singer who had wandered into the movie business because someone  probably her accountant had told her it would be a good career move without her having much idea of what would be required of her. In 'Angel Eyes' however it seems that by and large JLo has at last realized what this acting thing is all about. Although some of her lines are occasionally indistinct the overall impression is one of emotional and psychological truthfulness. That in fact can be taken as my overall impression of the film as a whole not just Miss Lopez's performance. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Mandoki's 'Angel Eyes' is one movie that I had walked out on twice. But for some reason I stayed through the whole film during the third viewing and I'm glad I did. Now the problem with 'Angel Eyes' is the incoherence during the entire first hour. The story unfolds into something different each time while not staying within the frame of the main story. It's confusing. It's misleading. That works for some movies but not for 'Angel Eyes'. The reason why I had walked out earlier was because at some point the movie really drags but once the characters confront their own pain the conflicts are presented and somewhat resolved. I appreciate Mandoki's attempt in telling the story of two lonely characters One who is traumatized by a past event that changed his life and the other who has been neglected almost disowned by her family because she did the right thing. In spite of the mess in the beginning he gets most of it right towards the end. The confrontation scene between Sharon and her family at the 'vowrenewal party' and the scene where Catch visits his wife and child's grave are very well executed. I liked the chemistry between Caviezel and Lopez. James Caviezel delivers a quietly subtle performance. It seems as though the part was made for him. Jennifer Lopez is a mixture. While she was terrible in some scenes there were some shining moments of excellent acting especially in the beginning and the latter half. She also carries off the copper role very well just like she did in 'Out of Sight'. So I guess it wasn't such a bad watch as I had thought earlier. Just needed some patience.".

In Angel Eyes she is beautiful aggressive soft and hurt ... I think Jim Cavaziel helps bring her down from any 'Star Scene Stealing'  he is so calm and dashing here I think she was as transfixed as us! It's a gentle film that doesn't feel the need to rush proceedings letting the audience sit and figure out the mystery and even if like us you figured it out at least 30mins before the end I think you will still want to stay with it and see how the characters wind up.

	schema:reviewBody "Out of all the JLo movies made so far this is the only one that seems to... dig deeper than the surface of human emotions. The writer and maybe the director must've had more than a vague idea of where they were going with this film. Some scenes cause me to tear up which is a rare commodity for any simple romance made in the last... 10 years.Jennifer Lopez is asked to play more here than the typical pretty girl who makes her way up in one way or other like the movies she normally lands. This took quite a bit of insight and understanding on her part possible even an emotional connection to the movie to nail the part. Keeping all that in mind the male main character seemed to get an even better idea of what's asked of him. The way he carried himself was almost deadon though possibly even overdone at times but I blame the director for that.That said what worked even more is the chemistry the two had going on. Never before have I seen Lopez's eyes light up the way they did with James. It seemed like they'd truly sunk into their roles and the interaction between them felt chillingly real.What was truly underdone however is the family abuse issues that Lopez's character's family was going through all through the plot. This didn't seem like a movie about civil issues and therefore the parts where they went into detail about family violence seemed a bit... off thewall to me. At the very least if there was a serious connection between violence and maybe the reason Sharon became a cop in the first place they sure failed to show it.This movie hands down I believe needed more insight and more beyondthesurface conversations. It needed less words and more visuals. It was mostly wellwritten but needed some touchups. The transition of Catch from his old life to the estranged new one was very meekly done. There could've been more about his family how good a father he was could've been shown even in flashbacks. More details for the backgrounds of both characters could be in order.But mostly though this film is very underdone and some parts made me laugh at them more than with them I end up seeing it again and again and it still acts as a tear jerker to me. I'll say it again  Lopez seemed to find herself in the right place here where much more than her natural charm was put to the test. Give this movie a try it's.. not like the rest not like many movies made today.".

It is the last word he hears his son say as he is throwing the toy in the car before he is killed. Dad...'catch'.The way the film deals with domestic violence  how it can tear a family a part at its foundation but then is glossed over for appearances seems to be right on the mark.

	onyx:emotionText "The scene when Catch is playing Nature Boy on the trumpet at the jazz club is just so genuine  touching. A big applause to the real musicians that were playing the tune.The Director might have made it a little less subtle of how Steve takes the name Catch after the accident. It is the last word he hears his son say as he is throwing the toy in the car before he is killed. Dad...'catch'.The way the film deals with domestic violence  how it can tear a family a part at its foundation but then is glossed over for appearances seems to be right on the mark. And despite the renewal of her parent's wedding vows the underlying problem isn't going to go away.";

Both characters have pasts they are trying to deal with both hide those pasts from each other and refuse to speak of them.

Perhaps you will be surprised to find what a solid and impressive drama Angel Eyes is.Jennifer Lopes is notorious for a bad choice of films she plays in with her rather limited acting ability. But this movie is a nice exception. Here she is very comfortable in the role of a slightly boorish and internally disturbed policewoman and with this performance she really hits the mark. Her costar James Caviezel also gives an excellent portrayal of a man who is recovering from the loss of his family.The storyline itself is wellrounded consistent and believable leaving no blurred moments or gaps. Although the assumptions of the film may seem too melodramatic in fact the film is not in the least cheesy or mushy. On the contrary what we see is a very realistic and uneven development of a relationship between two complex characters with an open not sleazy happy ending. The message of the film is also very sound and clear  life is not a smooth simple line and you never know what will take you to your destination.The film delivers this message softly and is definitely worthy of your attention.".

	schema:reviewBody "In many ways Italian film I FidanzatiThe Fiances can be considered as a stylish extension of Ermanno Olmi's previous film Il Posto. Both of his films present the preponderance of man over machine as human beings have the ability to reveal their sentiments crack a joke dance and sing. Olmi has shot his film with the astute eyes of a documentary filmmaker who is more interested in capturing the daily lives of his protagonists. A scene which elicits widespread sympathy involves the waiter of an industrial hostel who shares the troubled tale of his son's illness with a new employee. The industrial landscape of Sicily has been shown in all its honesty with some casual yet frank shots of industrial plants with workers who toil throughout days and nights. A sensible viewer does not lose much time to discover that this is a film about a man trying to find his rightful place amidst a fast changing industrial scenario where some old men are believed to have collapsed due to loneliness. The film also echoes its Neorealist concerns about the romantic lives of two young people who had to separate due to circumstances beyond their control.

	onyx:emotionText "In many ways Italian film I FidanzatiThe Fiances can be considered as a stylish extension of Ermanno Olmi's previous film Il Posto. Both of his films present the preponderance of man over machine as human beings have the ability to reveal their sentiments crack a joke dance and sing. Olmi has shot his film with the astute eyes of a documentary filmmaker who is more interested in capturing the daily lives of his protagonists. A scene which elicits widespread sympathy involves the waiter of an industrial hostel who shares the troubled tale of his son's illness with a new employee. The industrial landscape of Sicily has been shown in all its honesty with some casual yet frank shots of industrial plants with workers who toil throughout days and nights. A sensible viewer does not lose much time to discover that this is a film about a man trying to find his rightful place amidst a fast changing industrial scenario where some old men are believed to have collapsed due to loneliness. The film also echoes its Neorealist concerns about the romantic lives of two young people who had to separate due to circumstances beyond their control. Ermanno Olmi creates a balanced position of young lovers by showing how each of them is dealing with the absence of the other partner. FinallyI Fidanzati is a perfect film for those viewers who would like true to life stories unroll before their eyes.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is elegant sixties modernism with a subtle socialist thrust. With a bit too much technique concentration on beautiful striking shots and fragmented narration studded with flashbacks the story and characters though interesting don't have quite enough weight to involve the viewer. The modernist love of the cryptic goes a little overboard though in an intriguing way as for example in the long opening sequence in a dance hall as people gather for the dance and you take a while to figure out what's going on. The man takes a career opportunity to move up from welding by going to work at a distant isolated plant. The plant and its environs represent industrial capitalism and the city overspreading the countryside. Arresting moments like the dog straying into the church or the young boy working very fast in the restaurant as well as the individuality of a variety of people glimpsed in passing give the movie a mysterious and moving charm. Yet telling so much of the story without dialog weakens our sense of the characters. It draws you in slowly but a bit too much is withheld. Il Posto stays closer to the characters and feels warmer though the ending of Fidanzati has magic.".

	schema:reviewBody "My first exposure to an Ermanno Olmi film was through 'Il Posto' and I thought that film was a small masterpiece. So clearly I was going to explore more of his films. Being the second Olmi film that I have ever watched all 'I Fidanzati' did was to give me further evidence of Olmi's prowess in screen writing and directing.To be honest in a political sense both 'Il Posto' and 'I Fidanzati' are in the same ball park. Both films explore the corporate scene of Post WW2 Italy and the varied effects of the economic boom on the lives of the working class people. 'Il Posto' dealt with the need to grow up prematurely and pledge allegiance to the corporate system as early as possible for survival in a cutthroat society. 'I Fidanzati' deals with a man who is older than the protagonist in 'Il Posto' but who is also dealing with the effect that the need and the urge to get ahead in the rat race has on his life more precisely his love life. Giovanni and his fianc Liliana's lives get turned upside down when he decides to leave Milan and go to Sicily for a job opportunity with more pay. The first scene of the film is very provocative. We are shown this dance hall where the atmosphere is as dull as ever. People are here just as a habit and their desire to enjoy themselves have probably become a chore now. Then we meet the main couple. Both Giovanni and Liliana's faces and the way that they behave with each other tells us clearly that all is not well between them. Then Olmi gives us some flashbacks to inform us about the reasons behind this tension between the two. We then see Giovanni leave for Sicily and what awaits him there is not something that enthralls him. His life becomes synonymous with his work with absolutely nothing to do during his free time. He just wanders around the streets observing people when he isn't in the factory toiling away. There is a scene in Sicily where we see a big carnivallike celebration which Giovanni visits. This scene beautifully complements the opening scene of the movie in the dance hall. This is because the atmosphere here is very energetic and frantic unlike the atmosphere in that scene. However Giovanni still leaves this celebration feeling lonely due to the absence of Liliana. Ironically this separation actually helps both of them to understand each other a little better in hindsight. What I really love about 'I Fidanzati' is that although Olmi is clearly making a statement on the dehumanising nature of the rampant industrialisation but just like Antonioni he does it through subtle storytelling and never allows his political statements to obscure what is the heartbeat of the film which is the romance between Giovanni and Liliana and the realisations that they make about their relationship over the course of the film.In both 'Il Posto' and 'I Fidanzati' I have noticed the fact that Olmi's style of storytelling has an inherent innocence about it. His camera is nonjudgmental. He understands his characters and observes them without forcing the viewer to draw rapid and concrete conclusions about them akin to the humanist filmmakers of the 50s and 60s. Just like 'Il Posto' he revels in just observing his characters observing things without doing much. His style of realism gives you hints of his documentary filmmaking past. There is also some French New Wave esque use of jump cuts in certain scenes that I wasn't really expecting. He doesn't feel the need to cram a lot of stuff and incidents in his screenplays. However for a film with very little plot development he does manage to infuse some ambiguity. The scenes where his screenplay delves into nonlinearity can be interpreted in more than one ways as per the desire of the viewer. The ending itself is ambiguous. For me the film ends on a bittersweet note. However I have read reviews where the ending has been interpreted in a far more pessimistic sense.The acting in 'I Fidanzati' is tough to judge. One might say that the actors specially Carlo Cabrini doesn't do much except observe things. But I think Cabrini does bring an understated humanism to the role. You can clearly see the loneliness in his eyes when he is looking at himself in the mirror after coming back to his hotel from the celebrations or the subtle joy in his eyes when he sees the dog causing chaos in the church. Anna Canzi who plays Liliana has a very expressive face and very expressive eyes. She doesn't appear in too many scenes but whenever she does she makes you know what she is feeling and thinking just through her eyes. Considering that both of them were amateurs one has to praise Olmi a lot for having the ability to get these subtle performances out of non professionals.'I Fidanzati' has cemented Ermanno Olmi's status as an auteur in my eyes whose work I should keep exploring. Although I love 'Il Posto' slightly more than this film never the less the skill artistry and humanism present in 'I Fidanzati' make it a great film.".

	schema:headline " Makes Christiane F look like a fairytale...";
	schema:reviewBody "...so says the blurb on the Australian video cover of this film. Hanna D appears to be some sort of homage to the former much more superior German film. Set in Amsterdam this Italian film was dubbed into English for its release in English speaking countries. It is about a girl named Hanna borne of a troubled uncaring and womanising alcoholic mother the mother gives an appalling extreme performance. We have to make the presumption that the virginal Hanna starts to sell her body thanks to the troubles she has had endured due to her parents' separation some years earlier. A man who eventually takes her virginity becomes her pimp and introduces her to heroin saves Hanna from some rampaging prostitutes angry with her after they believe her to be encroaching upon their territory. Hanna eventually meets another straightlaced man with both characters literally falling instantly in love. You see them about 1 minute later canoodling in the streets of Amsterdam having just met on a ferry! Eventually this 'troubled' relationship results in some strange illogical actually dramas with the pimp. Indeed there is no logic to the story's progression and the acting... it's REAL bad sadly not even bad enough to be considered 'good'.The Italians often take old ideas and rejig them into something else  with a tendency to make things more explicit or extreme. This has been seen in various Giallo productions and it can be seen here. Everything that was largely implied in Christiane F is made explicit. There is a copious amount of fullfrontal nudity and what appears to be close up shots of real drug injecting. We discover new ways of injecting drugs  under the tongue in the scalp and even under the eyelid. As was the case with scenes in Christiane F you even see Hanna experiencing a drug withdrawal complete with chunky vomit and some pretty ridiculous acting. And there is an unforgettable scene of a woman retrieving a small vial of drugs from her jail mate's anus  these are scenes that stay with you but for all the wrong reasons.To be fair it is not unreasonable to expect an Italian 'remake' to be pretty over the top. Hanna D sure is over the top! On the one hand it is amusing and silly and on the other you might think 'why did they even bother'.This film did not appear to have had a wide release back in the 80s and it is not hard to see why. It was released in Australia back in the mid80's some time and has had some exposure in parts of Europe and North America. This film is to soon receive a DVD release.".

Hanna gets money by letting people see her naked. Eventually her home life goes from dysfunctional to destructive a short hop and Hanna needs to escape.

However her old life is still lurking out there.This is a very sleazy film. Its a walk on the wild side. I have no idea if its true or not but the picture it paints isn't particularly pleasant. As an exploitation film its an okay time killer. The lead is good looking both in and out of her clothes. The gory details of the life of our heroine is suitably unpleasant. The problem is that after a while the film simply becomes very talky and repetitive. How many times will people shooting up shock? How many sex for money encounters where the girl secretly cries do we have to see before it stops effecting us? It all wears thin after a while and we become desensitized to anything by the second half although the retrieval of the drugs in the rehab center is an exploitation classic If you want a sleazy exploitation film and don't mind it repeating itself in the second half then see this movie. If you want anything else stay away.".

This is no doubt for the best however since she spends a lot of her screentime buttnaked andor engaged in various sexual situations. Glass surprisingly went on to a long career in Germany but her only previous credit was as one of David Hamilton's barelylegal modelactresses in First Desires.

Although credited to Axel Berg this was actually written and directed by the infamous Italian Rino DiSivestri who gave the world Werewolf Woman and Deported Women of the SS. I actually liked his first film Woman in Cellblock 7 however and I understand he actually received letters of thanks from real prostitutes for his movie Red Light Girls. I can't imagine ANYBODY recognizing themselves in this movie though even if it was allegedly inspired by real events. But what a hoot!".

	schema:reviewBody "Hanna D The Girl from Vondel Park 1984 12 out of 4Italian trash is pretty much a remake of CHRISTIANE F. Teenager Hanna AnnGisel Glass shows old men her body for some quick cash but after hitting the streets to get away from her alcoholic mother she soon finds herself with an even bigger creep who gets her hooked on heroin and forcing her into prostitution. If you shy away from trash that takes a serious subject and exploits it just to show off some TA then you'll certainly want to stay far away from this movie which is certainly one of the sleaziest that I've seen. It's not that the film is overly graphic but exploiting a subject matter like this is going to raise a few eyes and there's enough overthetop moments here to make fans of the genre happy. We get outrageous dialogue between the hookers and their clients silly cat fights between the woman a drug dealer getting beat up by two men on motorcycles the drunk mother wanting her daughter to sleep with her boyfriend so that he'll stick around and all of this happens in the first twentyminutes! The sleaze level is pretty high from start to finish as the main reason for this movie being around is so that various women can take their clothes off. Glass does a pretty good job in her role as she manages to handle the sleaze as well as the more serious moments that the film offers. She was apparently twentyyearsold when this was released but her body looks much younger and this here really adds to the creepy nature of the subject matter. The supporting cast are the types you'd expect to see in something like this and that includes the really bad dubbing. The 84minute running time gets to feel a bit long after the first hour due in large part to the movie turning way too serious in the second half. I'm not sure about others but I hate when an exploitation film tries to switch gears and put across some sort of message. Another problem is that the story itself is so choppy that it just seems to bounce from one situation to the next without too much thought or reason. Bruno Mattei was in charge of editing and some might think this is the reason for the film being so choppy but I'd guess it had more to do with the screenplay not offering more. So in the end if you're a fan of Eurosleaze then eat up as this here offers enough for two movies.".

If you're a politically correct viewer stay away as far as possible. By the way For lovers of Jess Franco's oeuvre there's much to enjoy. Lina Romay  his muse  has a leading part as the director of the prison where female inmates are well not treated very well. And she does nudity too at 52. The version I saw was the unrated gory edition from the German 4DVD set that came out recently. Alternative title is Escape from Prison Island.".

It's run by an evil cigar smoking warden and her straight black haired henchwoman. There are about three plot strings happening simultaneously but I won't go into that since the juicy parts are more important. Let's just say that torture rapes and violence are happily in abundance here including a Ned Beatty rape scene that takes place ON camera as opposed to Deliverance. One scene has a guy get his cock straightened with pliers then has his teeth removed with said pliers and finally has his scalp taken off prior to having his throat slit. Sound like fun yet?

Due the reason that the first part was Andreas first success he made this sequel but to be honest and I said it before it has nothing to do with part 1. Okay he uses some shots from the first part but it isn't in the same context as in part one. He in fact re edited the shots. Of course Andreas is in this flick too as is the man he adores Jess Franco. The difference with part one is that there is gore available only you have to wait until the last half hour of the flick. But it is worth waiting for. All made by his friend Olaf Ittenbach. As always he make use of the same actors as in his other movies like Franco and Lina Romay. Just of the record when you watch the interview on the extra disc with Romay you can notice it is at the office of X Rated Kult. And just have a close look some OOP DVD's are available in his office. The acting is believable and much better then part one the editing and score is better. Anyway the limited box I own has 3 versions of this flick. Frauengefangnis 4 ungekurzte version. It clocks in at 88 minutes no English subs German language. This is the part that you will find in the shops. The gore is intact the movie starts immediately with a view over the prison island. The nudity is intact. No more no less just say the cut version available all over the world. Women behind bars 4 director's cut. This one clocks in at 105 minutes and is the only version with English subs. It is also the only version with an alternative opening. This version is hard to get because the alternative opening has some XXX features. A girl hitch hike and is picked up by a weirdo. In fact this opening has nothing to do with the movie except that the girl appears later on the prison island. Of course the guy take a short cut into the woods and she has to give him head. all filmed on screen facial cuming included. Further this version has the explicit nuditylesbo scene's all shown. This is the XXX version only available at specialised shops. Further on the gore is intact. Angel of death 2 rohschnittversion. This version has the same opening as the cut version and clocks in at 124 minutes. The gore is available uncut but the nuditylesbo scene's are more explicit and there are other lesbo scene's available not seen in the other versions. This film as the title says refer to those 70's women behind bar exploitationgrindhouse flicks combined with an ode at the Ilsa flicks. Only watch it if you can take real gore and are not offended by the XXX nudity.".

The acting is pretty awful and the fight scenes are lame but there is a love of sleaze in every frame and an understanding of what trash fans enjoy. Unfortunately the flat script makes for a flat movie. So despite numerous atrocities hardcore sex and a guest appearance from Jess Franco the experience is an empty one.

	schema:reviewBody "Angel of Death 2 is a German movie from 2007 so this one has its 10th anniversary this year. It is one of the more but not most known works by writer and director Andreas Bethmann. And if you hear this name plus the names Kercmar Manoush Carsten Frank and Olaf Ittenbach who was in charge of the effects then you maybe guess correctly already what to expect here. The answer is lots of sex lots of gore and violence but major deficits in all kinds of other areas the most crucial being storytelling obviously. I wrote in the title of my review that this is a the epitome of an amateur movie but while some may see this even as a compliment in my opinion it means that it is a really bad movie. Amateurish is nothing you would aim at especially if you have been making films for a long time already. After all this one here is the sequel to another Bethmann movie from almost a decade earlier. And it seems he has nothing learned during that time. This also refers to his castings decisions as most of the actors and actresses are really unbearably bad and the worst is that this film at least the version i saw ran for a massive two hours and twentytwo minutes. And you could perhaps say that two hours and twenty minutes of that are garbage. It makes me a bit sad to see Lina Romay in here playing a crucial role as lots of the stuff she has done in her younger years is really far superior to films like this one here even if you could it as well to the genre of sexploitation movies especially with how it starts right away with a rape scene. Jess Franco also has a small cameo and I don't understand it as films like this one here are really nothing he would want in his body of work. The story is as bad as it is generic. Girl gets raped then schemed for drug possession and she ends up on a prison island while her millionaire dad sends out men to free her from the humiliation. This film actually goes by several other names as well not just in Germany but also in other regions of the world. But no matter what you call it it will always stay a huge piece of crap with horrible acting writing and looksdirection. I suggest you stay far far away.".

Honestly holidays are stressful and barely ever as good as you want them to be anyway while this movie was much more than I expected it to be.The humor in the film is warm never condescending or patronizing to the characters. There is always the sense of fun. The movie really sells itself to me by not making Mr. Hulot a buffoon alone in the crowd. Circumstance and happening reveals everyone to be capable of situational humor the accidents of the movie are shared with a laugh.It is an observational movie and the majority of the humor is not forced neither upon us nor upon the movie itself. It merely shows how people can get involved in each others' lives how funny the average day can be. It is like attending a family reunion really. The camera does not stick itself to Mr. Hulot but goes anywhere for a laugh. If a small boy is doing something funny the camera will be there to capture it all and then leave the boy. This would make another film feel large but because there is no story to the film because there is no main character to feel especially attached to it always feels personal it always feel like you are seeing something nobody else is.Perhaps the best part is that the film sticks with you for days afterward and soon Mr. Hulot's Holiday shows its real genius as you start noticing similar things happening around you.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's probably easy to see this as just a relatively late occurrence of classic slapstick. In fact the slapstick dimension is quite masterful. But there's a lot more to this movie than the comedic value of seeing someone get kicked. Part of the charm comes from the structure of the movie. Instead of a linear narrative or a series of sketches it's a multidimensional portrait of different aspects of human nature. The point of the movie if there is one there's more likely a large array of points in this apparently simple comedy isn't put out ostentatiously throughout the film. For instance if Tati intended to admonish people to have some fun in life it's not by showing how Hulot's having fun but by showing the respect fun may have with some people. There's also the purely aesthetic pleasure derived from a wellcrafted movie. This one's fluid enough that nothing appears superfluous from sun rays passing between drapes to one of Hulot's accidental gestures. Of course there's a nostalgic value in watching such a movie. Not for 1950s France but for another era however long ago when insouciance might have been acceptable.".

Each scene has plenty of goodnatured humor and most of them also contain some amusing details that are hard to catch the first time you see it making it well worth rewatching.The opening sequences are easy to identify with for all that the story occurs in another time and place since some of the numerous snags faced by the vacationers are common experiences. Then from the time that Hulot leaves the door open as he enters there is a nonstop stream of good comic material that highlights Tati's own character.By keeping the dialogue to a minimum it emphasizes the visual gags with occasional sound effects some of which are also amusing yet wordless comments on human nature. Tati's style would have worked very well in silent comedy yet he also has his own character not an imitation of Keaton or of Chaplin or of anyone else. He made even better use of the character in Mon Oncle but this one well deserves to be remembered and enjoyed as well.".

By that standard M. Hulot's Holiday is the funniest movie of all time.I saw this movie soon after it first appeared in the USA 1953 and thought at the time it would become a classic. Since then the projector in my mind has replayed so many scenes so often that in the replaying it's grown even more hilarious. From time to time when I see it again each time I realize that  as funny as the original is  it has that rare quality of planting seeds that grow and blossom in my memory even more. Looking for the end on a tangled garden hose always replays M. Hulot's experience with the garden sprinkler. There is very little plot beyond 'what I did on my summer vacation'  but there doesn't need to be. Throughout the movie from time to time we see an elderly couple who stroll observing the follies eccentricities normalities of the behaviors of people on their summer vacations. This film's perspective is that we are similar to them strolling observing  and as if the film's opening and close coincide with the beginning and end of the traditional French August vacation.I've also seen Jacque Tati's Mon Oncle several times while it's good to me it's several magnitudes lower than 'Holiday.' I look forward to seeing Playtime with the sure knowledge that nothing can top M. Hulot's Holiday. But as with all humor different folk like different flavors. This film's flavor is generally slightly dry with a few wet spots. Tati as director observes the usual the commonplace the well meaning and then tweaks it just enough to either make you smile in self recognition or sometimes snort milk out your nose. His Monsiuer Hulot is a gentle chivalrous soul always trying to be helpful although he inadvertently sows occasional chaos in his wake as if letting no good deed go unpunished. He's obviously a cousin of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin.ETA I've just read Roger Ebert's review of M.

As viewers we follow Hulot an earnest but clumsily unlucky man through a few blissfully lazy summer days. We share his energy in play tennis and ping pong. We feel his delight when dancing with a pretty girl at a masquerade party where few adults have bothered to attend.

	schema:reviewBody "A fine very original comedy film. Although made in 1949 it does not date. Only the colour of the film and the age of the cameras used giveaway the movie's age. Simply it is the story of a French chap who goes to a very small seaside resort on holiday. It is not a simple film however. Clever Charming and beautifully crafted it has to be the jewel in the cinematic comedy crown of France. It is very very funny. This film was plagiarised for many of the 506070's Variety Sketch programs on British TV. Benny Hill and Arthur Haines programme content owe much to scenic gems in this wonderful film. No need for subtitles here though. It starts where Laurel and Hardy left off. Slapstick without the slap and definitely no stick. Gentle but so many hearty laugh generating situations. I have to admit to seeing it in a London in the early 60's and being told to shush by my fellow audience I laughed rather too loudly. The sequences are lovingly put together. Mr Hulots tennis lesson from the lady who sold him the racket and which provided an unlikely winning streak is unique. The humorous build up of the Funeral scenes is masterful. Characters from the gangling Mr Hulot himself the waiter in the hotel to the English couple going on their nightly constitutional and many other fine performances by amateurs I believe add to the films magic. Hotel guests sitting around and listening to the radio and the Hotel Manager investigating who is guilty of not wiping their wet feet on the doormat may seem dull on paper. They are anything but dull when seen in this classic film It is one of those movies that Thanks to the wonder of DVD when your mood is melancholy put on select a scene any scene sit back and laugh your troubles away.".

Tati does not seek to write or tell a story the movie is as fragmented and broken as only a movie about a vacation could be. Having known and visited small places on the north French coast in the '50s I found that the movie carries the sense of calminnocence and pace of the region and the time with absolute truth. The never ending series of contrasts in the movie from the deranged passenger station and Hulot's journey in his jalopy to fast cars pushing him off the road and his having to stop because of a dog sleeping in the road. All these events leading up to the actual vacation put one in the mind and spirit of one in Hulot's place. The camera work at all times enhances this sense of pace and is on occasion truly beautiful. Through the various escapades as the vacation unfolds on a daily basis we are taken on a spirited and delightful week at the coast. The dialog such as it isadds no more than an extension to the wonderfully atmospheric musical score. This has none of the social commentary of other movies by Tati such as mon oncle yet in retrospect it is a chronicle of many things lost. This in summary is a work of genius it has been fresh for more than 50 years and it would be hard to improve upon in the next 50.".

The dialog such as it isadds no more than an extension to the wonderfully atmospheric musical score. This has none of the social commentary of other movies by Tati such as mon oncle yet in retrospect it is a chronicle of many things lost. This in summary is a work of genius it has been fresh for more than 50 years and it would be hard to improve upon in the next 50.";

Whether you see it in English or French makes no difference since the entire story is told visually so much so that the dialog what little there is is not needed.The laughs when the come are the sort to double you over with pain and tears in your eyes. Its wonderfully funny.The problem that some people will have with the film is its pacing and plot. Actually there is no plot its simply a collection of events while Hulot stays at the seaside resort. The pacing is leisurely with laughs coming after scenes of quiet beauty and slice of life moments that seem to lead nowhere. Its like a week at the beach and moves at its own pace.Despite what some may consider flaws THE FILM WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH. Which is all that matters. And even if you're someone like me who likes but doesn't really love the film you'll find yourself wanting to see this again simply to see what you missed and to marvel at the artistry How did they do the floating paint can?7 out of 10.".

Tati diligently noted and then recreated every little gesture quizzical look silly but common smalltalk the disdain of waiters and the sound of a springdoor.

I can almost feel the warmth of the sun on my skin as we are taken on a summer holiday with Jacques Tati.Jacques Tati in my opinion was a comic genius. Even to see him motionless with his arms resting awkwardly angled on his back and pipe in his mouth is enough to induce a guffaw. His every movement in his slightly illfitting clothes were intended to have an effect on the viewer and this is my favourite of his films. Every squeak of the door mutterings and movements during the course of this nondialogue comedy are pure theatre and I think he must have choreographed his moves for maximum impact. The lack of the spoken word does not matter  Tati spells it out perfectly.It is slapstick at its finest. I personally believe that 'The Plank' a film starring the likes of Eric Sykes and his cohorts must have been a homage to Tati's work.Les Vacances de M. Hulot has many layers but I love its innocence. Tati's physique being tall and upright taking his large strides as he walks can't fail to make you laugh as he finds himself in all manner of situations. In my opinion this film but particularly Jacques Tati is 'the' finest of many great things to come out of France. France should be very proud to have produced such a man of his talents  Viva Le Tati !!".

But as the movie goes on if the strangeness still remains all this elements begin to make sense and create and original and I think never experimented on screen world. ANGEL is indeed a really good surprise if you manage to accept and enter the inner world that the movie describes and the kitsch atmosphere of Ozon's style witch was for me unbearable in his previous movies like 8 Femmes but that absolutely fits the subject of this movie. When I learned that Ozon directed a movie in English about a young artist I was waiting for a sort of kitsch version of ESTER KAHN the wonderful movie another French director  Arnaud Despechin  made about a young lady in Britain in the early XX century but I couldn't be more wrong  ANGEL is a sort of feminine or Gay version of Tim Burton's ED WOOD describing how a strong imagination  no matter how bad it is  can completely recreates the world and how you can fully lives in a fantasy universe when you believe hard enough in your talent and your art .The movie tells us the life of Angel Ramola Garai who has everything to become the new Ludivine Sagner for Franois Ozon from her childhood where she dreams upstairs the family's grocery of the fastidious and glamorous life of a famous writer to her success in the house of her dreams  Paradise house where she has everything she ever dreamed of when she was young. The originality of this movie is that everything is seen with Angel's eyes. And her eyes only see what her imagination tells them to see for she doesn't live in reality but always fills it with dreams so that she can live as if she were one of her romantic heroine. Whatever awful and sad the word might be it never touches Angel for she always transforms it with her imagination the way she wants. And imagination she has plenty... Of course her world is a childish puerile and kitsch world of a bad Barbara Cartland 's novel and the movie completely recreates it on screen with all the artifices it supposes  from the colors  that explains the pink  to the situations  when she proposes Esme the man she chooses to love the rain suddenly stops when he says yes and a rainbow appears  empirical reality doesn't exist here for Angel is unable to see it. But and here's the all interest of the movie the spectator on the other hand is absolutely able to watch it.This tension between the strong believing that Angel puts in her world and the ridiculous that the spectator sometimes sees in it is mostly tangible thought other character's eyes like Charlotte Ramplin is the more judgmental she's the first to condemn Angel's books but mostly for personal reasons  she can't stand the pretentious and rude young lady with whom her husband is falling in love or Esme the untalented painter who is also one of this ambiguous character for he accepts his wife universe but is unable to really find his place in this fictive world. And the movie constantly plays with this two degrees witch brings humanity cruelties and sadness to the shinny but unreal world it describes. That's also why this movie is so surprising  we never know exactly where we are  is this a dream when will it stops will reality goes after it in the end ? This constant instability regenerates the spectator interest for this movie and keep it far from the classical costumed movie about the rise and fall of an English women writer it could have been.That's also why this movie reminds me of Tim Burton's ED WOOD for beyond their differences they both deal with the same thematic of the triumph of an artistic imagination over the world and the fall that fallows this triumph and they also share a melancholic tone as well as real understanding and compassion for untalented but passionate artists.".

But and here's the all interest of the movie the spectator on the other hand is absolutely able to watch it.This tension between the strong believing that Angel puts in her world and the ridiculous that the spectator sometimes sees in it is mostly tangible thought other character's eyes like Charlotte Ramplin is the more judgmental she's the first to condemn Angel's books but mostly for personal reasons  she can't stand the pretentious and rude young lady with whom her husband is falling in love or Esme the untalented painter who is also one of this ambiguous character for he accepts his wife universe but is unable to really find his place in this fictive world. And the movie constantly plays with this two degrees witch brings humanity cruelties and sadness to the shinny but unreal world it describes. That's also why this movie is so surprising  we never know exactly where we are  is this a dream when will it stops will reality goes after it in the end ? This constant instability regenerates the spectator interest for this movie and keep it far from the classical costumed movie about the rise and fall of an English women writer it could have been.That's also why this movie reminds me of Tim Burton's ED WOOD for beyond their differences they both deal with the same thematic of the triumph of an artistic imagination over the world and the fall that fallows this triumph and they also share a melancholic tone as well as real understanding and compassion for untalented but passionate artists.";

Adapted from a book by Elizabeth Taylor about an Edwardian novelist whose life fails to live up to her romantic fantasies it is as ridiculous clichd and overwritten as any of the heroine's creations hard to know if this is the fault of the source material or Ozon's adaptation though he has been assisted by acclaimed playwright and translator Martin Crimp. You watch it in disbelief unsure if you're meant to laugh or not faintly hoping that this is a deliberate attempt at postmodern ironic detachment but wondering what would be the point and gradually realising that Ozon thinks he is Douglas Sirk and has completely embarrassed himself.The actors look all at sea particularly Romola Garai who can't give any charm to the unlikeable heroine and Ozon adopts a stiff and oldfashioned style of filmmaking  complete with syrupy music and terrible back projections  which make the film look as it it was made in 1936 rather than 2006 I'd like to think this was a deliberate if unfortunate miscalculation but the consequence is that the finished product looks stilted and amateurish. Only Charlotte Rampling  Ozon's muse  almost saves the day but her air of sardonic detachment probably says more about her feelings towards the film than about her character.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the novel by Elizabeth Taylor this Francois Ozon directed movie was the closing film of the Berlin Film Festival last year and while it played out like a biography of a fictional character you can't help but to imagine how close it seemed to the flamboyance of the other Liz Taylor being infused into the titular character.Movies based on biographies such as Miss Potter with Rene Zellweger and La Vie En Rose with Marion Cotillard seem to follow a formula of rags to riches and basically living the dream that no one had imagined was possible. Naturally being blessed with a talent and a gift helps too and with Angel Deverell Romola Garai hers was a steely resolve of wanting to break out of her poverty cycle through her writing an aspiring novelist with limited life experience relying solely on her vivid imagination to paint literary marvels with her firm grasp of language constructing sentences like a wordsmith many times her age.What made her character compelling to watch and follow is her living in a fantasy world she constructs for herself which suits her perfectly as it provides for and fuels her imagination with romantic stories to enchant and endear herself to her readers. It shields her from her insecurities but in doing so she slowly isolates herself into her view of Paradise and becomes a chronic liar which I felt she's constantly aware of but is ashamed to admit any stain in the perfect world.Delivered in two distinct acts things start to change when she meets the HoweNevisons. Nora Lucy Russell probably her 1 fan who simply worships the ground she treads on and offers to be her personal assistant and her brother Esme Michael Fassbender from 300 who said they'll fight in the shade! with whom Angel falls head over heels for. And this stifling relationship takes a toil on all parties involved with shades of possible lesbianism played down in the film though I'm unsure what became of it in the novel. While Angel had her break from Theo Sam Neill the publisher who believed in her Esme the aspiring painter has none besides Angel who would probably say Yes to anything he says. And his portrait of her probably was the highlight for me in the movie. If a portrait painter needs to and can peer directly into your innermost soul and bring whatever qualities he sees in you onto the canvas then Esme would have succeeded with his godugly picture of Angel reinforces meaning of being beautiful on the outside. but ugly on the inside.The special effects were quite badly done and perhaps deliberately too as it's made up of very obviously superimposed shots of backgrounds that no longer exist because of modernization. Other than that the rest of the production values are high and the costumes too which Angel decked herself in are quite a sight to behold especially when there's a call for a change in colours to reflect the mood of the story as it wore on.But what made this movie very palatable is how Romola Garai carried the role through the story. You can just about believe the very naiveness and devil may care attitude that her Angel brings however always seemingly able to hide and bury her true feelings deep within herself and being a master manipulator also helped loads. Like how Charlotte Rampling's character of the publisher's wife reflected you just can't help but to pity Angel despite her pomp flamboyance and hypocrisy.So if you're interesting in a movie that provides avenue for an intriguing study of a person putting on a very fake mask then Angel despite its title will be the movie for you to examine human traits which are anything but angelic.".

Even before I had read that I thought about this all the time.It's very rare to find nowadays a movie with moderndays technical perfection brilliant colours and costumes and soundbut a 1940's style. Everything is over the top unbelievable but for me going to a movie means suspension of disbelief do we need a film to be like reality? I don't go to cinema to see reality but to be taken to a different world one of romance and it hardly gets more romantic than this. Read the interviews at www.francoisozon.com and you will understand it all a lot better. This movie does not deserve the criticism it gets here as that's comparing apples with oranges. This movie is PERFECT as it is made almost flawlessly and in a for costume movie lovers very lavish way a great joy to watch and listen to not to mention a very energetic and passionate Romola Garai who I will love to see also in Atonement. A nice touch in line with the 1940's style is that trips to London Venice Greece Egypt are made the way they did in those days not on location but a filmed background. Nothing is very realistic in this movie but it shows what dreams are made of and I thank the director and actors highly for many hours of fantastic entertainment. In it's genre it's just as good as Lord of the Rings which also did not have to be real to be wonderful did it?".

It seems clear to me that he is showing us not a realistic depiction of Angel's life but a version colored by her imagination. The intention is not to mock her but to allow us to share her experience and to make up our own minds about the value of her fantasies. The closest to an authorial statement comes from the character least sympathetic to Angel Charlotte Rampling as the publisher's wife comments that in spite of Angel's lack of talent or selfknowledge she has to admire her drive to succeed. Of course we're not compelled to agree but it strikes me as a fair assessment.The reactions to this movie remind me of the uncomprehending dismissal of Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette another story of a shallow selfinvolved woman that insists on looking through her eyes. This kind of scrupulous generosity is in line with a tradition going back to Flaubert's Madame Bovary and both directors have the stylistic confidence to carry it off.

	schema:headline " Romola Lets 'Er Rip Bodice and All";
	schema:reviewBody "Hungary's gift to world cinema via Hong Kong her birthplace the amazing Romola Garai here really pulls off the impossible aided by the deft and surefooted Francois Ozon as director. Here she gives a performance so impressive that she actually saves a bodiceripper of a romantic novel by Elizabeth Taylor but becoming a travesty and turns it instead into a classic. This is one of those daring film projects which one would have thought had no chance of success at all. It is done with tongue just enough in cheek not to take itself too seriously but because of the intensity of Garai's central performance as the overthetop character Angel Deverell and the earnestness of her great big eyes as she does it the impossible happens and the film works! Really the result is astonishing! The sombre toneddown performance of good old Sam Neill also helps because he is so underthetop that he quite compensates for Angel Deverell's wild and extravagant excesses as a character. A bemused Charlotte Rampling oozes suitable resentment as Neill's wife and her narrowed eyes are used to as good effect as ever as she studies Deverell in the way that one would watch a snake glide across the terrace. Or is it Rampling who is the snake gliding across the terrace? One is never sure with her especially when she is peering from under those lids and being dangerously subdued as if coiling to strike. Francois Ozon is best known for SWIMMING POOL 2003 in which Rampling did one of her many excellings she has been winning the gold star for a long time now. Ozon seems to have paranormal relations with outstanding examples of the feminine psyche and without the combination here of Garai and Ozon this film would have been one of the greatest flops of our time. Garai must have had to have this most caressing of directors looking approvingly at her every time she did one of her wild scenes so that she could be sure from the feedback that she had not disgraced herself by overacting. I just don't know how they pulled it off. The way Garai opens her eyes with that innocent stare wider wider Ozon could be considered a kind of dentist 'Open wide! Now wider! No wider! Wider!' And it works. The film is consciously a parody of the traditional English romantic novel you know those dreamy things which women read furtively in the way that men look at porn magazines both concealing these vices from each other since all women secretly believe in true love just as all men think mostly with their organs and each is ashamed to admit the truth to the other sex. In England these novels are called 'Mills  Boon novels' after the publisher which published so many of them no man I know of has ever read one. Well this story is set in Victorian England and is about a precocious 18 yearold girl Garai who although 25 at the time looks genuinely 18 who lives above a grocery store and refuses to accept reality in its present form so to counteract her grim life she writes an early 'Mills  Boon' type novel. It is accepted for publication by Sam Neill and she goes on cranking out these corny books in endless profusion and becomes immensely popular and very rich. She buys the country house she admired from afar when younger which is you here have to remember that the cheek is suddenly full of lots of tongue 'Paradise'. Here the director was very clever and used a real house called Tyntesfield near Bristol in the west of England and the result is simply breathtaking. The art direction of this film is absolutely spectacular. How much fun they all had doing this! The character played by Garai is an insufferably egotistical selfdelusionist on the grand scale and normally one encounters this kind of role only with much older actresses as for instance Gloria Swanson in SUNSET BOULEVARD 1950 as a classic example of the type. It is quite a switch to see a young girl play a character who is even more delusional insane and selfobsessed than Tony Blair and every bit as ruthless.

	onyx:emotionText "Hungary's gift to world cinema via Hong Kong her birthplace the amazing Romola Garai here really pulls off the impossible aided by the deft and surefooted Francois Ozon as director. Here she gives a performance so impressive that she actually saves a bodiceripper of a romantic novel by Elizabeth Taylor but becoming a travesty and turns it instead into a classic. This is one of those daring film projects which one would have thought had no chance of success at all. It is done with tongue just enough in cheek not to take itself too seriously but because of the intensity of Garai's central performance as the overthetop character Angel Deverell and the earnestness of her great big eyes as she does it the impossible happens and the film works! Really the result is astonishing! The sombre toneddown performance of good old Sam Neill also helps because he is so underthetop that he quite compensates for Angel Deverell's wild and extravagant excesses as a character. A bemused Charlotte Rampling oozes suitable resentment as Neill's wife and her narrowed eyes are used to as good effect as ever as she studies Deverell in the way that one would watch a snake glide across the terrace. Or is it Rampling who is the snake gliding across the terrace? One is never sure with her especially when she is peering from under those lids and being dangerously subdued as if coiling to strike. Francois Ozon is best known for SWIMMING POOL 2003 in which Rampling did one of her many excellings she has been winning the gold star for a long time now. Ozon seems to have paranormal relations with outstanding examples of the feminine psyche and without the combination here of Garai and Ozon this film would have been one of the greatest flops of our time. Garai must have had to have this most caressing of directors looking approvingly at her every time she did one of her wild scenes so that she could be sure from the feedback that she had not disgraced herself by overacting. I just don't know how they pulled it off. The way Garai opens her eyes with that innocent stare wider wider Ozon could be considered a kind of dentist 'Open wide! Now wider! No wider! Wider!' And it works. The film is consciously a parody of the traditional English romantic novel you know those dreamy things which women read furtively in the way that men look at porn magazines both concealing these vices from each other since all women secretly believe in true love just as all men think mostly with their organs and each is ashamed to admit the truth to the other sex. In England these novels are called 'Mills  Boon novels' after the publisher which published so many of them no man I know of has ever read one. Well this story is set in Victorian England and is about a precocious 18 yearold girl Garai who although 25 at the time looks genuinely 18 who lives above a grocery store and refuses to accept reality in its present form so to counteract her grim life she writes an early 'Mills  Boon' type novel. It is accepted for publication by Sam Neill and she goes on cranking out these corny books in endless profusion and becomes immensely popular and very rich. She buys the country house she admired from afar when younger which is you here have to remember that the cheek is suddenly full of lots of tongue 'Paradise'. Here the director was very clever and used a real house called Tyntesfield near Bristol in the west of England and the result is simply breathtaking. The art direction of this film is absolutely spectacular. How much fun they all had doing this! The character played by Garai is an insufferably egotistical selfdelusionist on the grand scale and normally one encounters this kind of role only with much older actresses as for instance Gloria Swanson in SUNSET BOULEVARD 1950 as a classic example of the type. It is quite a switch to see a young girl play a character who is even more delusional insane and selfobsessed than Tony Blair and every bit as ruthless. Such parts just don't come along for young actresses whose opportunities to be demented are generally restricted to the more conventional sex sirens nymphets or other characters relying entirely on their sexuality. Here sex doesn't come into it it is all romantic mania carried to the highest possible levels of intensity and frankly insanity.

I went into the cinema knowing practically nothing about what I had to expect and found myself in a movie with over the top acting corny dialogue and a dislikeable main character. It was after some time in the movie that I realized Ozon used the style of old Hollywood melodramas to enforce the pompous and passionate character of Angel's writing and to at the same time add ironic breaks to an otherwise fairy tale story. But still Ozon shows a lot of love for Angel on screen and does not use the irony to demonstrate his superiority. Now quite a while after watching Angel the film still sticks in my mind and crosses my thoughts now and then which is a proof to me that I really saw an impressive work that mixes an antique style with narrative intransigence unseen in melodramas of the old days.".

	schema:reviewBody "For me this film is truly awful. It tells the story of an English woman who writes simplistic kitschy romantic novels  think Barbara Cartland but set in the 1900s. Its prolific eponymous heroine the daughter of a provincial grocer has her first book published while still at school and goes on to achieve fame and fortune before meeting her inevitable nemesis.Had the film contained irony humour imaginative visuals original character insights or surprising plot twists it could have been watchable perhaps even admirable. But Francois Ozon the writerdirector has used little or none of these and instead has employed the sort of fairystory linear plot line cardboard characters melodramatic action and overdecorated interiors as one imagines appear in Angel's books. Fortunately we are given little by way of examples of her writing. Incidentally though on a technical level the film is mostly competent there is a laughably bad piece of backprojection  or whatever equivalent is used these days  near the beginning when Angel is in a carriage riding through London.Even with these defects the film might still have worked if Ozon had made his main character in the slightest degree likable or intriguing had she been say a naive dreamer who relates guilelessly to those around her and to her adulatory readership. We could then have understood and forgiven her ignorance of the absurdity of her writing. But it is hard for us to sympathise with Angel when she starts off as a hateful materialistic selfish brat remains so throughout her period of success and lionisation and hardly changes even when fate turns against her.It would be easy to blame some of the film's flaws on overacting by its principal Romola Garai but I suspect she plays her part exactly as Ozon wanted. The male lead is Michael Fassbender as Esm a stereotypical garretdwelling Bohemian artist who is the one object of Angel's adoration besides herself. Also on stage are Lucy Russell as Nora Esm's sister who genuinely admires and loves Angel Sam Neill as Angel's publisher who incredibly agrees to print her first schoolgirl effort despite her refusal to alter even one word of it and Charlotte Rampling as his wife who is understandably baffled by his abandonment of his critical faculty.Unless you're really stuck for something to do I recommend giving Angel a miss. Instead for those who haven't seen it the recent Miss Potter is a far more credible and engaging portrait of a turn of the century female writer.".

Immensely talented as a writer despite shallow contempt to reading books Angel is allinall a literary hack with an undeniable way with words and romance. At an early age she is discovered by a publisher Tho Sam Neill who becomes so fascinated with her writings that he agrees to release her first book to critical and commercial acclaim. Angel uses the newly found fame and wealth to purchase her dream house Paradise marry the man of her desires and become a larger than life as if straight from her novels...Francois Ozon tackles the whole movie with an unmistakable signature delving into the epoque with wit and charm encapsulated by the character of Angel. Multilayered and hard to crack she is presented as an alternative type of rebel without a cause absolutely engulfed by her own brilliance that she is unable to break out of her shell to take a gulp of reality. Once she molds her dreamlife she seems to believe that this is the end of the story her life has reached perfection and no further chapters need be written. However the barrier she builds around herself becomes a prison from where she struggles to see that her perfect life is more a projection of her expectations into reality than reality itself.All in all an interesting concept and to a point well contrived. At some stages the movie uses an absolutely pathetic excuse for backgrounds i.e. while riding in a carriage across London we she varying landmarks of the city rudely apparent to be fake to highlight the audacity of Angel's dreamlife as if taken from a romance novel. Nonetheless the movie falters in creating a mood to coincide with the premise of the story. Throughout the movie Angel is a hysterically overplayed and pretentious character which draws multiple laughs in the most awkward situations i.e. whilst reading her husband's eulogy or when drawing her last breath before death. This odes of course give the movie a certain whiff of freshness as Angel's eccentrics really get you interested in her character however unlikeable she may be. Nonetheless this was taken to such an extreme that at times I was unsure whether Angel is essentially a pastiche of costume dramas with a by the numbers script full with often hilarious scenes as if making fun of the whole genre and its dramatics.All in all an enjoyable movie but the awkwardness of the permeating funniness of Angel and her undergoing together with the lack of clarity as to the intentions of the director make the eventual reaction to it a meandering mess of drama comedy and rushed narrative.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've added Angel in my watch list about a month ago after studying quite a few of Romola Garai's and Michael Fassbender's performances. Some of the films i've watched with Garai were Inside I'm Dancing 2004 Mary Bryant 2005 Atonement 2007 and The Other Man 2008. She was brilliant in all of them. So she was in this film.This is a fiction story based on a novelscreenplay by Elizabeth Taylor. It's kind of a biography of a young writer Angel with a not wealthy background that manages to finally publish her rich in imagination novels. What do you think passionate love wouldn't knock on her door when she starts being famous? This is where Fassbender's role Esme comes in. Another artist an underestimated painter who doesn't feel confident enough about his work and who also keeps some skeletons in his closet that will later in the film much later finally be revealed. Fassbender is a great performer but he doesn't get to shine here. Sam Neil plays the part of the overwhelmed publisher and Lucy Russell does a great supporting work as Esme's sister.As i'm still new in screen writing and film structure i found myself a bit worried about the way this movie was unfolded. Everything seemed so magical and dreamy and the drama was almost out of the plot for much longer than i expected. It had to make a turn! And it did and it was sudden maybe a bit frustrating at some point but you'll have your turning point eventually.Since i've realized that there where practically two acts in this film i recalled the atmosphere the costumes the music and the colors that went along with the change. In the beginning everything was so bright and cheerful then all turned pale and gloomy to show the depression which you can clearly notice even in the clothes of the protagonist. There where only a few outdoor special effects that looked really out of date and weird for a 2007 production.

	onyx:emotionText "I've added Angel in my watch list about a month ago after studying quite a few of Romola Garai's and Michael Fassbender's performances. Some of the films i've watched with Garai were Inside I'm Dancing 2004 Mary Bryant 2005 Atonement 2007 and The Other Man 2008. She was brilliant in all of them. So she was in this film.This is a fiction story based on a novelscreenplay by Elizabeth Taylor. It's kind of a biography of a young writer Angel with a not wealthy background that manages to finally publish her rich in imagination novels. What do you think passionate love wouldn't knock on her door when she starts being famous? This is where Fassbender's role Esme comes in. Another artist an underestimated painter who doesn't feel confident enough about his work and who also keeps some skeletons in his closet that will later in the film much later finally be revealed. Fassbender is a great performer but he doesn't get to shine here. Sam Neil plays the part of the overwhelmed publisher and Lucy Russell does a great supporting work as Esme's sister.As i'm still new in screen writing and film structure i found myself a bit worried about the way this movie was unfolded. Everything seemed so magical and dreamy and the drama was almost out of the plot for much longer than i expected. It had to make a turn! And it did and it was sudden maybe a bit frustrating at some point but you'll have your turning point eventually.Since i've realized that there where practically two acts in this film i recalled the atmosphere the costumes the music and the colors that went along with the change. In the beginning everything was so bright and cheerful then all turned pale and gloomy to show the depression which you can clearly notice even in the clothes of the protagonist. There where only a few outdoor special effects that looked really out of date and weird for a 2007 production.

Frankly for about two hours I was fairly convinced that it must have been a dream sequence. I can't fault the performances but the script was just so pedestrian they didn't have anywhere to go. The main character is imaginative to the extent that it actually becomes difficult to determine what she really believes when she is consciously imagining and when she is simply deluded. It's never really resolved what the male lead's true feelings for her are and the other characters are merely onedimensional support.Eminently missable.".

The characterisations were poor. Sam Neill as always played Sam Neill and even Charlotte Rampling for whom I have great admiration couldn't save the film. I can only compare it to Titanic  not the movie but the ship.Who was Angelica? I know she had something to do with Paradise which was shown in reverse over the gate of the house right at the beginning but the right way around for the rest of the movie but as a character she wasn't introduced. Was this edited out or was I in a coma at the time and missed it? What went wrong with the background shots? Alfred Hitchcock did a better job of them in the 60s. How can it be that with all the modern technology it was so obvious and poor? I quite simply did not believe any of it. One man after the movie came up to my wife and myself with a bemused smile on his face and asked What was that all about? He said he was expecting Angel to wake up and find it all a dream. My comment in reply Mas more like a nightmare The only thing I found even remotely interesting was the way Esme used the wheelchair Angel gave him to hang himself from. This gives some idea as to how boring I found the rest! I suffered the movie expecting my wife to say that she found it moving i.e. I thought it had to be a chick flick that only women can enjoy. Meanwhile Barbara sat through it thinking that I must have found something arty about it. If we had only known we could have walked out and not had to endure the torture.I could not in all consciousness recommend this movie  even to a person I hate.None of it worked none of it inspired none of it entertained. It was even too horrible to be amusing.".

These are all implemented to increase the unreality and fantasy of the film and give it that classic movie feel.At first I found the actual story and characters almost second fiddle to the look and sound of the film but Ozon isn't out to parody more to homage or pastiche. Angel's sudden and cartoony rise to being a prominent literary figure is silly and fun but towards the end as her vision of fantasy starts clashing with reality the film turns out to be unexpectedly moving.Angel is far from being a heavily moralising tale about true love and happiness over gaudy extreme and is more a joyous celebration of fantasy over reality a wonderful pastiche of historical romance where the girl manages to win the grumpy gloomy bachelor and runs after him in the rain as they kiss passionately under a shining rainbow as the score swirls in that classic forties way you never hear anymore.It's a wonderful and funny and frivolous film and yet also tragic and moving at times. With this much love and joy up on screen it's such a shame some people seem to miss the point of it and criticise the bad special effects and bad acting.

	schema:headline " Ozon's first film in the English language  showy but hollow";

And the Festival is indeed a case in point for globalization with among other things two film in French directed respectively by a Taiwanese and a Canadian and French director Ozon directing his first film in English English that is not a funny language called American. But I digress.Whether you like Francois Ozon's films you can't deny that he has a way of grabbing your attention with films such as haunting Sous le sable playful 8 femmes and surreal Swimming Pool. Bad news Ozon admirers as Angel comes considerable short compared with any of these remarkable if not all superb films.For his first venture in English language filming Ozon teams up with Elizabeth Taylor not that one. Team up is perhaps not a totally accuracy description because this is the late Elizabeth Taylor a littleknown writer who died more than 30 years ago and whose novels are outofprint. To Ozon however The real live of Angel Deverell was like 'Gone with the wind'.Watching Angel in the Elgin Theatre in downtown Toronto where I had watched Cats four time I couldn't help but wonder if Ozon was just looking for ANY story that he could use to parody Gone with the wind. The stories are actually quite different but Ozon uses every opportunity to parody. My memory of GWTW is rather vague but there are a couple of scenes in Angel when Scarlett O'Hara pops right out of the picture. Judging from the chuckles and laughter of mirth from my fellow audience many at places when they are expected to sob or sigh I suspect that there are a lot more that I have missed as well as parodies of other Hollywood classics too.But what is the point other than showcasing some glamorous set pieces and gorgeous costumes reminiscent of Hollywood in the 40s and 50s? Not much. The story of a totally unattractive girl characterwise rising to stardom through a series of romance novels she pens is uninteresting. Her mindless possessiveness of a man a painter purported to have talents but no breaks is clich. Typically Ozon the element of homosexuality in hinted if not elaborated here between her and the man's sister who is devoted to her. Maybe as some suggest the whole thing is to show how this girl lives in the dream world from which she awakes ironically only at the call of death. But with none of the characters worth feeling for the whole thing falls apart.I maintain that perhaps Ozon is trying too hard to impress the English speaking audience and it backfires. Romola Garai so well received in I capture the castle 2003 has tried hard to bring life to a title role that is somewhat hollow a thankless job. Ozon's favourite Charlotte Rampling mesmerizing in Sous le sable is nothing more than a cameo playing the publisher's wife. Oh yes Sam Neill who plays the publisher is getting to look and feel more and more like James Mason.".

But most of them cover this fact with a thin veneer of empowerment and sensitivity making perfunctory surface concessions to political correctness. It's hypocritical dishonest and has horrible longterm effects on the psyches of young impressionable girls and boys.

Every woman in the movie is a laughable caricature who advances if at all by deceiving other women and becoming a sexual object for men.  The heroine Nomi crosses every line sells every shred of dignity physically assaults her female competitors sleeps with her boss in the most overthetop sex scene in cinematic history gets her best friend raped... and at the end of the film claims that she has gambled and won herself. This tragicomic nod to empowerment is a slap to the face of anyone who's been paying attention.Whether Esterhauz and Verhoeven intended it as such Showgirls is at once a camp classic and a sly satire an example of everything our culture at once wallows in and disavows.

	schema:headline " Beyond the Valley of the Showgirls";
	schema:reviewBody "Every once in a while a film comes along that strikes a chord with audiences in such a way that they react strongly sometimes because of this the film can become a hit. The opposite can happen as well. Showgirls drew some venomous reviews from both critics and audiences and it quickly gained a reputation as a bad movieit became a buzzword and a joke immediately. An entire generation of filmgoers who were too young to see Showgirls or else uninterested in it were instructed that it was a bad movie when it was mentioned as such in the allages trailer for the big hit Scream 2. More recently people like Tarantino and a few respected film critics began to admit that they loved the film and while it's never going to gain acceptance as a serious film at least people are able to see Showgirls for what it is instead an opinion based on legend.Yes Showgirls is trashy and absurd but we do enjoy those kinds of films. Are we saying that it's wrong to make them? I think the main problem with Showgirls is that it's a great looking big budget film that is a pastiche at heart. Whatever people were expecting at the time of its release they were definitely not expecting a new Beyond the Vally of the Dolls which like Showgirls got the strongest possible rating at the time of its release. Also similar to Russ Meyer Verhoeven takes Joe Esztherhas's crazy script and directs his actors to be straight faced at all times saying these lines as if they mean it. Just like in 1970 this defied the expectations of the audience and it got the movie panned. Whatever Paul Verhoeven intended with this film it's hard to imagine that this happened accidentally and even the people who claim to like Showgirls because it's so bad are missing the point just a little. I think the bizarre qualities of the film are mostly intentional and it doesn't stray too far in style from successful films Verhoeven made before this mostly Basic Instinct. In fact it seems to me that the only true bungling has been MGM's marketing. Even now as they reap the benefits of it being a cult classic that has sold extremely well on home video their idea of how to round out the DVD edition is to get somebody totally uninvolved with the film to deliver a sometimes amusing but otherwise unnecessary commentary about the obvious instead of paying Elizabeth Berkley a couple thousand dollars to offer her own commentary on the film which would have been a couple thousand times better.Eszterhas writes trashy movies intended to be a good time and Showgirls is certainly that. But I can't imagine Verhoeven thinking that this movie would connect with audiences on a large scale basis the trailers implied that Showgirls would be similar to Basic Instinct which it is not. Maybe if this movie had come later after another failed attempt to recreate Basic Instinct people might have accepted it as its own type of film. The dialog is way over the top and how utterly boring would the movie have been otherwise? Other parts of the film are marvelously conceived and Verhoeven keeps the film in motion at all times. The only thing that truly spoils the fun is a violent rape scene although it does fit with the reptilian tone of the movie full of victims and victimizers it is the one thing that grounds the film in the real world with real violence. It may not have been intentional but it presents an interesting concept if the rape had happened to any other character it would not have been the same. Because it happens to the film's only sympathetic character it carries a great impact. The cinematography is flawless and the sets are always interesting and sometimes funny like the bizarre stage numbers. Pay attention to the soundtrack as well Verhoeven has an excellent collection of songs many of them written specifically for the film.Watching Elizabeth Berkley's career selfdestruct on camera is one of the film's most morbidly fascinating pleasures. I beg to differ with people who call her performance bad what actress could have played this part and made it anything other than what Berkley did? The truth is she worked wonders with a character that was impossible to play. Her dancing is both ridiculous and a marvel. How she can bend herself into those positions and hit those marks not to mention her famous lap dance gyrations must be seen to be believed.

	onyx:emotionText "Every once in a while a film comes along that strikes a chord with audiences in such a way that they react strongly sometimes because of this the film can become a hit. The opposite can happen as well. Showgirls drew some venomous reviews from both critics and audiences and it quickly gained a reputation as a bad movieit became a buzzword and a joke immediately. An entire generation of filmgoers who were too young to see Showgirls or else uninterested in it were instructed that it was a bad movie when it was mentioned as such in the allages trailer for the big hit Scream 2. More recently people like Tarantino and a few respected film critics began to admit that they loved the film and while it's never going to gain acceptance as a serious film at least people are able to see Showgirls for what it is instead an opinion based on legend.Yes Showgirls is trashy and absurd but we do enjoy those kinds of films. Are we saying that it's wrong to make them? I think the main problem with Showgirls is that it's a great looking big budget film that is a pastiche at heart. Whatever people were expecting at the time of its release they were definitely not expecting a new Beyond the Vally of the Dolls which like Showgirls got the strongest possible rating at the time of its release. Also similar to Russ Meyer Verhoeven takes Joe Esztherhas's crazy script and directs his actors to be straight faced at all times saying these lines as if they mean it. Just like in 1970 this defied the expectations of the audience and it got the movie panned. Whatever Paul Verhoeven intended with this film it's hard to imagine that this happened accidentally and even the people who claim to like Showgirls because it's so bad are missing the point just a little. I think the bizarre qualities of the film are mostly intentional and it doesn't stray too far in style from successful films Verhoeven made before this mostly Basic Instinct. In fact it seems to me that the only true bungling has been MGM's marketing. Even now as they reap the benefits of it being a cult classic that has sold extremely well on home video their idea of how to round out the DVD edition is to get somebody totally uninvolved with the film to deliver a sometimes amusing but otherwise unnecessary commentary about the obvious instead of paying Elizabeth Berkley a couple thousand dollars to offer her own commentary on the film which would have been a couple thousand times better.Eszterhas writes trashy movies intended to be a good time and Showgirls is certainly that. But I can't imagine Verhoeven thinking that this movie would connect with audiences on a large scale basis the trailers implied that Showgirls would be similar to Basic Instinct which it is not. Maybe if this movie had come later after another failed attempt to recreate Basic Instinct people might have accepted it as its own type of film. The dialog is way over the top and how utterly boring would the movie have been otherwise? Other parts of the film are marvelously conceived and Verhoeven keeps the film in motion at all times. The only thing that truly spoils the fun is a violent rape scene although it does fit with the reptilian tone of the movie full of victims and victimizers it is the one thing that grounds the film in the real world with real violence. It may not have been intentional but it presents an interesting concept if the rape had happened to any other character it would not have been the same. Because it happens to the film's only sympathetic character it carries a great impact. The cinematography is flawless and the sets are always interesting and sometimes funny like the bizarre stage numbers. Pay attention to the soundtrack as well Verhoeven has an excellent collection of songs many of them written specifically for the film.Watching Elizabeth Berkley's career selfdestruct on camera is one of the film's most morbidly fascinating pleasures. I beg to differ with people who call her performance bad what actress could have played this part and made it anything other than what Berkley did? The truth is she worked wonders with a character that was impossible to play. Her dancing is both ridiculous and a marvel. How she can bend herself into those positions and hit those marks not to mention her famous lap dance gyrations must be seen to be believed. Gina Gershon is great too a leering predator who manages to be both vulnerable and invincible at the same time and only because she seems to be the only actor in the troupe that's in on the joke. Kyle McLachlan is skeezy with a haircut and a smile that make him resemble the creature from the ALIEN franchise more than a human being.

	schema:reviewBody "You want it you pay for it.  Club bouncer ShowgirlsShowgirls is an interesting film though people won't appreciate it for many years to come. The problem with Paul Verhoeven is that nobody realises that he's a satirist. All his films shot outside of the Netherlands are intensely satirical and not meant to be taken at face value. With Showgirls he quotes from All about Eve and 42nd Street tearing apart those pipe dream stories that audiences have been so conditioned to absorb.Verhoeven's real target isn't Hollywood or American crassness but rather those morally dubious Star is Born tales. The audience isn't punished for wanting to see sex and nudity it's punished for wanting Nomi to succeed. The film is saying that in a crass society success is bankrupt and by pushing the pipe dream you merely fuel this big ugly machine.Nomi the star of Showgirls isn't a character. She's a piece of wood. A piece of wood not because she can't act but because she's a mere slab of fuel existing solely to be burnt up and combusted by her neon lit environment. She goes from strip club to dance club to theatre house exploited all the way. And she loves it.By the end of the film it's not funny that Nomi is going to make the same mistakes all over again. It's sad that despite the fact that the Myth has been revealed repeatedly she is still seduced by it enough to try all over again. It's like those Toys they give kids at Macdonald's. The child knows the toy is total crap but they just have to collect the other one. Why? Because it's a toy and the child's perception is that toys are fun.Showgirls deals with this false perception. The toy is crap. It's unsatisfying but we want it because we can't find satisfaction in what we have and in where we're at.Showgirls is also intensely symbolic. Song titles mirror Nomi's apartment numbers each of her jobs takes her one step further into hell which ironically is her goal she symbolically dies and is reborn the famous lapdance is shot to mirror the sex scene in the pool and the film ends with Nomi battered and broken and more importantly even more ignorant than before. Then there's her dream man hinted at by a billboard at the start who turns out to be a devilish rapist by the end of the film. This theme of one being punished for ones fantasies permeates the entire film and extends outward in such a way that the audience itself participates. At first we're titillated but by the end the sex has numbed us and we reel in disgust.In terms of style the film is intentionally over the top. It's loud crass and overly colourful. Nomi herself thrusts her body at us in a ridiculously pathetic manner. The director's aim is not to titillate. He wants us to pity the girl's desperation her falsity the tasteless stains of her makeup and desperate contortions of her body. Nomi is dumb and is always begging us to accept her. And so Verhoeven subjects us to visual and aural overload all designed to numb our minds. We leave the film stupid and unaroused poetically blind and unaware of the truths it has shown us.The best satires tend to raise the most unjustified hate and Showgirls is no different. What's different is that the nudity sex and overall tacky bad movie aesthetic of the film prevents it from being reevaluated or even embraced. Future audiences desensitized to pornography and nudity will probably accept this film easier.There's also one really good shot in the film that reminded me of Welles. The shot occurs when Nomi sits on a park bench alongside a busy street. The bench is in the foreground but perspective is forced in such a way that it dwarfs the Las Vegas buildings surrounding it.In terms of camera work the film is also impeccably shot. Verhoeven's camera is precise with some beautiful steadicam and crane shots.7.510 An interesting satire intentionally camp cartoonish and over the top. Though some scenes feel tasteless the film as a whole surprisingly seems to get better with repeated viewings. Pay attention to one scene in which children walk innocently through a theatre nude women all around. Moment's later a woman curses violently and the kids and their mother are shocked. Verhoeven's point is clear language violence and exploitation are far more tasteless than any naked breast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Showgirls a film in which absolutely everything that could fail fails and fails spectacularly. From the bizarre casting down to the plasticated set design Showgirls is constantly redefining the parameters of awfulness. Who decided that Elizabeth Berkeley the tall leggy Milo Manaraesqe ingnue famous for playing Jesse Spano in Saved By the Bell could carry a major Hollywood film let alone one as ridiculous as Showgirls? Is LizBerk really the right choice to portray a young woman so irresistible that even though she is unfailingly rude selfish and mean everyone wants to bend over backwards to do nice things for? What I'd like everyone to pay attention to this time through however is the fact that this particular narrative only makes sense if you assume that it is taking place in an alternate universe with norms of behavior and physical laws radically different from our own. It's the sort of place where all that women talk about when they are together is their nails their breasts and potato chips.

From the bizarre casting down to the plasticated set design Showgirls is constantly redefining the parameters of awfulness. Who decided that Elizabeth Berkeley the tall leggy Milo Manaraesqe ingnue famous for playing Jesse Spano in Saved By the Bell could carry a major Hollywood film let alone one as ridiculous as Showgirls? Is LizBerk really the right choice to portray a young woman so irresistible that even though she is unfailingly rude selfish and mean everyone wants to bend over backwards to do nice things for? What I'd like everyone to pay attention to this time through however is the fact that this particular narrative only makes sense if you assume that it is taking place in an alternate universe with norms of behavior and physical laws radically different from our own. It's the sort of place where all that women talk about when they are together is their nails their breasts and potato chips.

It's ten times as good as Striptease.It's not Citizen Kane but it's not a softcore porn version of Rock Star awful film either. Most of the characters were welldeveloped and believable even it the situations were not. And there's plenty of humor the vast majority of it intentional. I'm wondering if most of the heavy derision of the film comes from Puritanical attitudes rather than from an honest evaluation. If unromanticized sex and heavy nudity  literally in the case of one character  make you or your viewing companions uncomfortable Showgirls probably not for you.

His perverse look to human desire impulses and instincts and the direct way he brings it to he screen are something really unique and make him an author rather than a mere director. Talking about Showgirls the exciting choreographies and its connection with what is being told reveal his love and knowledge of the musical genre. In addition the script by Eszterhas is a malicious retelling of the Cinderella's tale manipulative funny filled with great dialogue and a sense for rhythm than a lot of screenwriters would like to have.Gina Gershon shines in her role but I simply can't believe why the critics deceased Elisabeth Berkley when her performance is filled with enthusiasm and energy.

	schema:reviewBody "It does not follow. That's the best way to describe this movie to anyone. I've watched it several times now I admit the movie is so strange that even though you know it is bad you have to go back and watch it again just because you can't believe what you just watched. That's saying something for me a person who can only watch a movie once before needing a few months to pass before wanting to watch again.What I find so intriguing in this movie is how badly the character of Nomi Elizabeth Berkley interacts with people and how amazingly they accept her. Not just accept her they all love her. Nomi a woman who reacts with violent hostility to simple questions or requests displaying herself to be a complete sociopath. Yet strangely every person she snaps on sees her as something endearing or wonderful for some inexplicable reason. I just don't get it.In the beginning of the movie Nomi loses it on a total stranger attacking the woman's car before being stopped and then vomiting for some unknown reason. The woman's response? Take her to dinner but not before nearly kissing her in the most misplaced and misguided lesbian reaction. I would have called the cops. What next? I'll tell you. Nomi snaps again when asked a simple harmless question by throwing the food the woman was treating her to and shouting. The woman's response? She asks Nomi to move in with her. What the hell?! Throughout the movie Nomi comes off as totally unlikable to the point that I found myself rooting against her which is ironic seeing as how she is the protagonist of the film. To be fair Nomi comes in a few flavors. I want to say she is bipolar but that would leave out her middle ground the smarmy bitch flavor. I hate to use that word but it's the only way to justly describe her. You'll see. This is flavor is most often displayed when during any of her many disrespectful interactions with her employers and superiors. The cringeworthy I was having my period excuse to her boss and her taunting of Cristal Conners Gina Gershon later in the film.She seems to follow some set of illdefined and unbalanced set of morals that make no sense to anyone but her. Nomi all but whores herself out for success but draws a line at icing her nipples for some reason. Then throwing the ice at the casting director and exploding on him. Wow. Then she gets the job.With respect to Elizabeth Berkley I don't know why so many people in this film saw her as this amazing beauty with so much talent. She is attractive yes but by no means the most attractive woman in the cast even if you exclude Gina Gershon who was gorgeous. Which leads up to an incredible vomitenducing scene between Nomi and Cristal about how great Nomi's breasts are. They're nothing special in my opinion. The dialogue here.... Honestly I can't do it justice. Nobody talks like people talk in this movie. Nobody. I want to see your ass What do you think of your breasts?I'm on my period. Check. This movie managed to make nude women even those as beautiful and talented as Gina Gershon unsexy. The dance numbers failed to entice any kind of sexual desire from me. How untalented must a filmmaker be to make a nude woman unsexy? Goddess would close in a week in real life.That just scratches the surface. There's so much about this movie that is just awful and makes little sense that I have no idea where to begin. When I have more time I hope to watch this movie and ammend my comment as I go.As awful as it is it has more rewatchability than most movies I have ever seen. It's not because this movie is sexy as the creators hoped but because it is a moving demonstration of absurdity and a world that could only exist in the mind of people with no scope of social and sexual reality. It is funny I admit but still awful.".

It's not because this movie is sexy as the creators hoped but because it is a moving demonstration of absurdity and a world that could only exist in the mind of people with no scope of social and sexual reality. It is funny I admit but still awful.";

Verhoeven knows what he's doing in every second of the movie.Its undeniable that Showgirls is the best shot movie of the 1990s or very close to being but it needs to be reappraised as a monumental art film that's sly and doesn't pander or take itself too seriously unlike the films that win Oscars these days.

I just can't help but like the utterly incompetent dialogue... especialy the dinner doggiechow conversation. Writer Joe Ezerhaus known for his overthetop overly sexual homophobic womanhating scripts has somehow managed to bring these abhorrent traits together in such a way as to fascinate. Clearly prejudiced towards lesbians and gays Ezerhaus writes with a strange pen here... at once homophobic but at the same time so outrageous that it can't be taken seriously. Berkley's performance is deadon many panned it but really she showed true style and wit bringing a charm to a role designed to be offensive if not for this Naomi would have been a nasty unsympathetic character and the film really would have just sucked. So ultimatly no credit to Ezerhaus! The success of this film and I'm not talking boxoffice resides solely on the performances and directing. With a lesser cast and director this would have been helpless trash but Gina Gershon Paul Verhoeven and Elizabeth Berkley bring it to life. Great dance sequences and cool costumes make for an enjoyable film. I could have done without the brutal rape scene though. That is the films only real downfall... but then again blame Ezerhaus for that!".

The idea I suppose was that prolonged exposure to something bad will psychologically turn off all urges to repeat that same offense. Horse Pucky! I decried not believing such a tale could possibly be true . . . until I saw Showgirls. I like sexy naked women as much as the next guy but after this movie was jiggled in my face for two and a half hours I didn't want to see another naked body for about the next two years Freud would have eaten me alive.I doubt that the movie had the same effect on Joe Esterhauz the author from whose pen this sheepdip flowed. Not long after the movie came out I was watching one of those making of specials and Esterhauz said that the movie was a hardboiled expose on the empowerment of women yeah . . . okay. The special boasted that this was a recurring theme throughout his work which includes Basic Instinct Flashdance Jade and Sliver. I guess that Joe and I must have different ideas about female empowerment because his idea seems to be to portray women as hookers strippers killers and raging lesbian predators anything outside those four categories and they're fishfood. He apparently thinks that their best activities for empowerment are knives lesbianism sex for cash violence and nasty sneers Mr. Freud you would have had to put overtime in on this one.In Showgirls the women could be any one of these things. Violence is so much an afterthought to their personalities that it comes out in their speech their clothes their stares their dancing and even their collegian stuffed lips. It oozes from every pore and even comes out in a scene at a fast food restaurant when the heroine furiously squirts ketchup all over her french fries. For me that scene proved a commentary on the film because well you know how when you squeeze a plastic ketchup bottle it makes that loud flatulent noise? You get the idea.I think Joe knows that he has a lousy script because he keeps throwing in deterrents so that we hopefully won't realize that the script is featherweight. Deterrence like nudity for example which got the film an NC17 but should have been an NC95 so no one would have had to sit through it. The characters reside in Vegas but the movie might as well have been staged in a nudist colony. Nearly every scene is littered with wall to wall skin whether the scene calls for it or not. They dance naked they sleep naked they eat naked they talk while they're naked. The movie is so jam packed with nakedness that the sexy parts are when the women put their clothes back on! Esterhauz turns out the be the only boob attached to this project that is not on screen.The movie follows the destiny of a walking bag of hostility named Nomi Malone played by Elizabeth Berkley whose acting comes in two flavors Stare blankly and blink who has killer looks and the brain of an appliance bulb. She's a leatherclad badchick from the wrong side of the tracks who hitches to Vegas to become a dancer. How are we to be sure that she's bad? She wears leather carries a switchblade and cakes on enough makeup to make Tammy Faye wince.Perhaps she figures all that badness makes her a human shield against that cold and unfeeling landscape of bitter failure and resentment known as Las Vegas. When she gets there she finds that Vegas is well a cold and unfeeling landscape of bitter failure and resentment.Everyone in the movie approaches Nomi like a lion smacking it's chops. Everyone hates each other which makes us hate them and therefore the movie but Esterhauz explains that in this hellish world of hostility and sexual vengeance Nomi learns a lesson in morality Really? I must have blinked.Before the sun sets on her first day in Vegas Nomi makes a new best friend becomes her roommate and gets a job at a strip club  and she's STILL ticked off!! The roommates situation is just an excuse for pseudosemisortakinda halfway attempt at some lesbian shenanigans hinted at because Nomi and Molly sleep naked in the same bed. Read that again and keep in mind that they've only known each other for one day.Nomi has dreams of getting a gig with a jiggle and light show called Goddess which we are told is the hottest show in town Yeah maybe if it were the ONLY show in town. I can't figure why she's so eager to get a part in this thing. IT'S TERRIBLE!! It's like a bizarre tribal dance in which the dancers contort in front of feux volcanoes and do spidery things with their fingers. It's like a strange pseudoseductive dance on Star Trek only the performers lack the decency to look humiliated.The show like the movie is dull real dull. So dull that you begin looking in the backgrounds for other things to look at. The sets for the show and indeed the entire movie are a hammered collection of sharp shiny things that glitter in the background and I guess are suppose to make things look sexy. At one point I was so bored that I began staring at those sets and imaging how the pieces could be cut up and used for Junkyard Wars. of four".

She spends most of the movie with a vacant expression on her face that gives way to unprovoked screaming fits.  Her character starts the film as a jerk who treats people badly and end the film as a jerk who treats people badly.  The plot in fact has no effect on her personality.  This is amazing cuz the plot is such a lame moralistic fable to begin with.  Innocent girl from NY City? makes it to the big city works her way up and finally succeeds by sinking to the depths of the people around her.  This makes her want to leave cuz you know she's become everything she's ever hated or something.  The problem with this story is that Nomi STARTS OUT as an awful jerk who would push a colleague down some stairs to get ahead  she just hasn't thought of it yet.  So the story which anyone over the age of four has seen before is pointless.The dialogue is atrocious  it's Penthouse Letters stuff.  It's how horny old men think young women talk when they're in the bathroom.  That said there's a lot dialogue in this movie that is unforgettable in the same way that Battlefield Earth makes variations on I have leverage' unforgettable.Kyle MacLachlan spends the whole movie with a stupid stoner smirk plastered on his face.The sex ohmygod the sex.  The simulated sex scenes in this movie are comic gold.  At least twice that I remember Nomi mounts the MacLachlan character and does this move on him that looks kinda like a fish out of water.  Her spine it sorta whips up and down so that her torso is flipping in mid air. The hilarious part is that one of the sex scenes is in a hot tub and when Nomi does her thing her body slaps and plops the water.  Besides being unerotic the sex scenes go on forever.I have never ever before in my life wanted women in movies to put some clothes on.  I admit it  I'm disgusting.  When the sex scene got started in Muholland Dr. the thought going through my mind was THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!'  But Showgirls takes the juvenile male urge to stare at boobies and pummels it.  About half way through the film all I could think about the all those breasts is that support is a matter of comfort.  It just seemed merciless to depict a world where there are apparently so few bras.Anyway that's the funny stuff.  Now for the awfulness.  Black people are nurturing.  There are two characters for Nomi to crap on despite their best efforts to help her out.  Glenn Plummer plays a dancer who wants to help Nomi perfect her absolutely jawdropping dancing talent and Gina Rivera plays a sweet person who takes Nomi in when she arrives in Vegas.  When Rivera's character Molly first meets Nomi Nomi is attacking Molly's car cuz her luggage was stolen and the car was nearby when she needed to hit something.  Instead of beating Nomi senseless Molly buys her some food offers to be her roommate and help finding a job.  And it goes on like that. Nomi is basically infantalized during scenes with Molly.  This is true of Glenn Plummer's character as well who spends most of his screen time chastising Nomi like a parent about wasting her talent.  Of course in the dark world of Showgirls nice people can't exist.  Plummer's character turns out to be a guy who says that every girl is a dancer of extraordinary talent to sleep with them but with Nomi he really means it and after mothering Nomi for half the movie Molly gets gang raped cuz I dunno victims are always asking for jerks to be nice to them and that's what she gets or something equally insightful.Everyone in the film keeps talking about how Nomi is a phenomenal dancer. I didn't see anything to justify this.  Actually they labored the point so much that it invites scrutiny that her dancing can't live up to.  It's kinda cruel really.  What if someone made a movie with Steve Buscemi where everyone marvels at how handsome he is?  I don't think there's anything wrong with his appearance but if you spent two hours being asked to look at him and admire his features...Anyway this movie is bad in so many ways but it's memorable.  It's like watching Plan 9 for the laughs but different.  It played recently at the Midnight Mass in SF  a venue that plays camp classics like early John Waters and the Mommy Dearest.  Verhoeven and Eszthehas set out to make a naughty dark movie.  Instead they made a crude incompetent and disgusting film.  Showgirls is probably exactly the film they intended to make and that's why it's funny.Gina Gershon didn't stink.".

Nice for people who like this sort of film usually shown early in the evening on the women's channel this one must have acquired some sort of filmhouse stigma on the way but not my cup of tea.There were some interesting ideas in this one such as the lady from the rehabilitation who kept using social worker talk as if reality had completely passed her by but too few and far between to lift this film to the next level. Still quite entertaining with enough humor to never make it completely boring. I switched from the last half hour of Hannibal to this and did not regret that choice.".

Nice for people who like this sort of film usually shown early in the evening on the women's channel this one must have acquired some sort of filmhouse stigma on the way but not my cup of tea.There were some interesting ideas in this one such as the lady from the rehabilitation who kept using social worker talk as if reality had completely passed her by but too few and far between to lift this film to the next level. Still quite entertaining with enough humor to never make it completely boring. I switched from the last half hour of Hannibal to this and did not regret that choice.";

Generally a nice agent  she is in trouble at work when she does an error in judgment in an undercover operation which turns in a disaster. One of her partners named Eric Matthews Benjamin Bratt is assigned by his chief Ernie Hudson to lead the high profile case of a terrorist nicknamed The Citizen . Gracie pieces together the tracks to determine that The Citizen's next target will be the Miss United States beauty pageant threatened by the psychopath criminal . The pageant administration  led by previous winner named Cathy Morningside Candice Bergen and long time host Stan Fields William Shatner provide the FBI with access to the pageant Cathy in particular is less than thrilled to have a noncredible Gracie disguising as a contestant which she feels will ruin the pageant. The FBI enlist the assistance of former pageant contestant consultant Victor Melling Michael Caine  he is called in to groom and turn the agent into a beauty pageant contestant. As Gracie proceeds in the transformation she gets to know the other contestants Melissa De Sousa Heather Burns who will appear in the sequel  not only as potential criminals but also as real people. She also discovers that another sinister element is present at the pageant. She investigates against the orders of her superior using all the means to find the dangerous criminal . Then she decides to investigate by his own in the contestant pageant and she befriends the beautiful contestants . Firstly she goes undercover to the contestant in San Antonio  Texas  where finds some clues. She tries to protect her new friends from dangerous attacker who attempts to blow up the pageant .This fun movie displays action  comedy suspense and is pretty entertaining . In spite of some flaws  silly gags and camp glamour the film works well enough for a respectable light comedy with extra doses of amusement and entertainment . Sandra Bullock is sympathetic and funny as untameable tomboy agent  she shows no signs of having any femininity in her demeanor or appearance and her earnest clowning wins audience attractive. Bullock plays as a hybrid among Bridget Jones and Inspector Clouseau characters . Most of laughters come courtesy of her jokes and fights  both physical and verbal . Benjamin Bratt as her tough brawny colleague is likable . They form a peculiar duo  making a special buddy movie . Lively  jolly musical score by Edward Shearmur and atmospheric cinematography by Lazslo Kovacs . The motion picture is professionally directed by Donald Petrie . The picture will appeal to Sandra Bullock fans. The following is titled Miss Congeniality 2  Armed and Fabulous by John Pasquin with the same cast adding Treat Williams  Regina King and Enrique Murciano  it is another Sandra Bullock vehicle and results to be an enjoyable sequel in which appears similar characters to first part .

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.Once again we have an actor in charge  this time it is Sandra Bullock who commissioned a script and produced herself. When writers are in charge we have scripts about writing like Wonder Boys or Finding Forrester.' When actors are in charge the plot device is usually about acting. That's why so many Shakespeare plays have people in disguises.If you are a film actor in Hollywood you have a hard choice to make. For someone like Bullock you can either become a personality or an actor a real actor. Kate Winslet has chosen to be a real actor. Sandra wishes she could be but we won't give her a chance. It has little to do with talent its just a matter of whether the personality is marketable. If it is we force these folks into a box. So she and Roberts and Ryan and so so many other women are mere personalities.As an aside I really admire Brad Pitt who is in this for the long run and who seeks out adventuresome risktaking roles just because the draw to be a relatively worthless personality like say Harrison Ford is so great. And he needs to work hard to avoid it.What we like about Bullock is what we think she is really' like perky and fun so we refuse to see her in dramatic roles. The good side is that you make oodles of money as a personality. The bad side is you are reduced to a barking seal for instance in Julia's case forever working that smile. These people hate their box unless they are really really dumb but we won't mention names. And the game is risky because the big movies that depend on these openers' have to be different in some way. So the problem is how to have a familiar personality in a slightly different vehicle.You can see just how the wheels turned for this film as Bullock tried to get ahead. This time instead of Sandra's character being a pretty airhead we'll have her play a character pretending to be one! That way we can make fun of the box people will come and we can show the actual process of acting. Along the way of making fun of the box we can poke fun at the viewers who here literally gather around a screen and gawk.To drive the inside joke home get Candice Bergen to play the conservative Texan villain who is behind the airhead enterprise. Her goal is to make the winner a literal airhead. This is the modern Jane Fonda liberal who took on Dan Quale when he had real influence and won! This is the girl who and whose dad considered her to be sibling to Charlie a true performing airhead personality. No one in the business would fail to get this joke.Add in a Frick and Frack Caine who is a very fine nonpersonality actor who tutors' our performer and Shatner who is making a career poking fun at his own salable personality which happens to be as a fatuous dope. Okay those are the key pieces. All else is plot machinery to support these roles plus a few elements of humor and charm from the stock library.Its much more interesting watching what the movie is really about than watching the movie itself. At least in this case.".

When writers are in charge we have scripts about writing like Wonder Boys or Finding Forrester.' When actors are in charge the plot device is usually about acting. That's why so many Shakespeare plays have people in disguises.If you are a film actor in Hollywood you have a hard choice to make. For someone like Bullock you can either become a personality or an actor a real actor. Kate Winslet has chosen to be a real actor. Sandra wishes she could be but we won't give her a chance. It has little to do with talent its just a matter of whether the personality is marketable. If it is we force these folks into a box. So she and Roberts and Ryan and so so many other women are mere personalities.As an aside I really admire Brad Pitt who is in this for the long run and who seeks out adventuresome risktaking roles just because the draw to be a relatively worthless personality like say Harrison Ford is so great. And he needs to work hard to avoid it.What we like about Bullock is what we think she is really' like perky and fun so we refuse to see her in dramatic roles. The good side is that you make oodles of money as a personality. The bad side is you are reduced to a barking seal for instance in Julia's case forever working that smile. These people hate their box unless they are really really dumb but we won't mention names. And the game is risky because the big movies that depend on these openers' have to be different in some way. So the problem is how to have a familiar personality in a slightly different vehicle.You can see just how the wheels turned for this film as Bullock tried to get ahead. This time instead of Sandra's character being a pretty airhead we'll have her play a character pretending to be one! That way we can make fun of the box people will come and we can show the actual process of acting. Along the way of making fun of the box we can poke fun at the viewers who here literally gather around a screen and gawk.To drive the inside joke home get Candice Bergen to play the conservative Texan villain who is behind the airhead enterprise. Her goal is to make the winner a literal airhead. This is the modern Jane Fonda liberal who took on Dan Quale when he had real influence and won! This is the girl who and whose dad considered her to be sibling to Charlie a true performing airhead personality. No one in the business would fail to get this joke.Add in a Frick and Frack Caine who is a very fine nonpersonality actor who tutors' our performer and Shatner who is making a career poking fun at his own salable personality which happens to be as a fatuous dope. Okay those are the key pieces. All else is plot machinery to support these roles plus a few elements of humor and charm from the stock library.Its much more interesting watching what the movie is really about than watching the movie itself. At least in this case.";

	schema:reviewBody "It seems we have been getting our share of Beauty Pageant comedies lately Beautiful' Drop Dead Gorgeous'.  Miss Congeniality' is by far the biggest production and the best of the lot.  Sandra Bullock who also coproduced plays Gracie Hart a homely FBI agent who goes undercover at the Miss United States beauty pageant to catch a terrorist who has threatened to blow up the pageant.  The story is funny and Bullock shows her range proving to be an excellent comedian in addition to her proven talents as a dramatic actor.  The writers poke the typical fun at pageants and contestants throughout the film but they develop a conscience at the end when Gracie gets tearyeyed admitting what a great experience it was.  There is plenty of silly slapstick humor. Bullock does her runway thing with aplomb and her tongue firmly in cheek. Michael Caine is wonderfully droll as the beauty consultant who is given the impossible task of turning the ugly duckling into a swan.Interestingly this is not the first film where Sandra Bullock makes the beast to beauty transition.  In one of her early films in 1991 Love Potion Number 9' she plays a geek who discovers a love potion and turns into a knockout.  That film was an early indication of her comedic talents but she eschewed zany comedy for dramatic and romantic roles for many years after that.  It is good to see her return to it.This is a very light and entertaining film that is easy to watch and easy to forget.  At over 100 million gross it had plenty of mass appeal.  The comedy is silly but fun and Candice Bergen Michael Caine and William Shatner provide some terrific moments in supporting roles.  I rated it a 710.  It is a good solid comedy.".

When I was growing up one of the yearly television events I always recalled was the Miss America pageant as well as the other beauty pageant for Miss Universe. Watching Bert Parks' singing the Miss America song was on the same level as watching the Thanksgiving Day parade or the Superbowl. In fact when Parks was fired from Miss America in the 1980s the pageant lost many viewers out of sympathy with Bert. But that dropping of Parks was an example of what the producers of the show faced in the 1980s. There had been dwindling interest and ratings for several years. Many felt the show was old fashioned because of the idiotic talent sections and the stupid questions QuestionWhat do you wish for? Usual answer World peace!. Others especially feminists were put off by the idea that the contests were demeaning meat markets displaying women for sex purposes only  and not really emphasizing women's brains. The pageants are still around but they lack the exposure they had back in the 1950s 1960s and 1970s. Even recent scandals have made one question the entire idea more the best known Miss America of the last twenty years was Vanessa Williams who lost the title for an infraction of the rules and subsequently had a successful  and still flourishing  acting career something that rarely happens to the regular winners.Here there has been a bombing and killing at the Miss United States beauty pageant. As a result an FBI team is assigned to figure out who did this. The team happens to find evidence that suggests a Unibomber type did but they don't know for certain. One of the recent recruits Sandra Bullock is to enter the contest as Miss New Jersey. This is done with the knowledge of the contest's chairperson and spokeswoman and former Miss United States Candace Bergen. Bergen is not happy about the choice Bullock is all professional FBI agent with little in the way of a sense of fun and absolutely no sense of style or even rudimentary knowledge of makeup. The FBI team headed by Benjamin Bratt assigns a former member of the Miss United States pageant Michael Caine to prettify and prepare Bullock for her assignment. It almost leads to mutual murder. Caine is a man of style and knows what wins contest audiences. Nothing he sees about Bullock remotely covers this. Bullock finds Caine insulting he admits to a stylish elitism and she finds the new regimen impossible. Not only must she learn some talent they finally pick up on her playing the musical glasses like Ben Franklin's armonica but she has to walk with poise be graceful and keep her weight under control some of the best jokes deal with her constant attempts at stealing donuts when she is supposed to be eating carrots and vegetables. She is also trying to see the value of the contest. Bullock believes in the modern age of feminism and works hard at being a good agent. She sees the contest as a sexist outofdate affair. She also notes it brings out the worst in the other contestants most of whom are basically good types but are now taking cheap shots at each other in efforts to win the contest. She is particularly protective about Miss Rhode Island Heather Burns who seems to have selfconfidence problems and hopes to improve herself by winning the contest.Bullock is also finding her current job annoying in a nonprofessional manner she and Bratt are both attracted to each other but she can't find any time to make time for him nor he for her. If they get together it is for the business of finding the bomber threatening the contest or for Bratt taking a sullen Bullock for training sessions with a snooty Caine. This is hardly a good way to develop a love affair.Finally there is the problem of Candace Bergen  a long time supporter of the contest she sees it as actually helping the winners by giving them scholarships that can assist them in furthering careers in all professions and thus raising the image of women. And she resents the alltoeasy dismissal Bullock keeps bringing up when she shows what she thinks of the contest.The film also has it's version of Parks in it's traditional host played by William Shatner. Certainly not the same as his Captain Kirk or even currently Denny Crane Shatner's Stan Fields has a popular following among the older generation who like his pleasant inane jokes you can tell after awhile what he's going to say as a joke and his singing the theme song. His performance is like additional icing on the cake. And a well made cake it is.".

He nearly steals the show and seems to have produced the most focused characterization for his role as rarely seen on any film.

At the end of the movie someone needed to convince Gracie to some back inside the Hotel for her farewell as a surprise and of course Victor was the one and the only logically believable character to convince Gracie to come back inside.

I didn't expect to enjoy this film as much as I did. The script didn't have the greatestmost realistic dialog or serious character development but it was campy fun! However I found the character of Rachael much more realistic than the original Carrie. I thought it was tremendously well cast. Moreover the set decoration was very clever and added a deeper understanding of the characters. Bonus points for having Danny B. Harvey and Billie Holiday music in it! It's hard for a sequel to really be taken seriously because people get so damn nostalgic for the first but you should really check this one out! I actually enjoyed it more than the first Carrie.

I first noticed that that was this hot gothlike chick playing the title role and there were people I'd seen before like Jason London that idiot form Home Improvement Zachary Ty Bryan and Mena Suvari who had a busy year in 1999 with American Pie and American Beauty.I think critics had a go at this film but in my opinion this was a very worthy sequel to the original. For starters it stayed true to the idea of having actors who are in their 20s playing teenagers that was a joke because Sizzy Spacek was 26 when she played Carrie in the original and we've got a 24 year old playing Rachel Long in this film here as well as a few 27 year old people playing some of the jocks.I just loved seeing those jocks and backstabbers getting what they deserved. They acted so well to get you to hate them. You could feel Rachel's pain and the evil within her and what she was doing... although it was so brutal and Satanlike... it was something you could somewhat cheer for. It's an amazing scene with all the glass shattering. Incredible!But never mind that  the acting is very good in this film. The storyline is a little bit thin at times but on top of all of that it still is rather original. Some good special effects some pretty good comedy from that American Pie nerd guy you know who I am talking about and it's a lot better than most modern day teen horror schlock! I put this film alongside Freddy vs. Jason as one of the most surprisingly good teen horror films of the last decade. All those Halloween sequels and Scream if you know what I did last summer crap as well as those films that try to take the mickey out of teen horror films are worthy of more than enough Razzies when compared to this film. I'm so glad this film wasn't nominated for Razzies.I can't believe Emily Bergl is 30 now! She deserves more roles in movies because she is a bloody good actress with an original and unique look about her.The Rage Carrie 2 deserves so much more respect than it has been given.".

Carrie 2 handles teenagers problems and conflict much better than other films and I think that it is a much better film to identificate with for young people. The new Carrie is  once again  a true outsider and not one of these upper class allamerican teens like the ones in I Know...etc. The movie shows its sympathy for this outsider a nice detail in some scenes you can see the Marilyn Mansonposter at the wall of Rachels room  the icon of all angry outsiders. Another point the horror violence is much harder than in the other teen movies too. Everyone who likes gory horror should like this movie All in all I could not say anything bad about this movie.

Well some of them anyway.The trailer to this movie did NOT appeal to me.  Some of the critics trashed it.  Even the box to the actual tapeDVD looked 'cookiecutter' to the first Carrie.  I hate redone classics therefore I avoided this movie like the plague for the longest time.  Indeed I ran the opposite direction when this movie came near me.  Well maybe thats going a bit far.LOW AND BEHOLD!!  Last night 752002 USA network showed this movie and nothing else was on.  I had a bottle of Jose Quervo on hand just in case. I sat down and got ready to laugh at tear apart and rag on this flick. After all its my job as a film buff to see even the 'bad' films in order to better appreciate the 'good'.I was utterly surprised by this film.

Well some of them anyway.The trailer to this movie did NOT appeal to me.  Some of the critics trashed it.  Even the box to the actual tapeDVD looked 'cookiecutter' to the first Carrie.  I hate redone classics therefore I avoided this movie like the plague for the longest time.  Indeed I ran the opposite direction when this movie came near me.  Well maybe thats going a bit far.LOW AND BEHOLD!!  Last night 752002 USA network showed this movie and nothing else was on.  I had a bottle of Jose Quervo on hand just in case. I sat down and got ready to laugh at tear apart and rag on this flick. After all its my job as a film buff to see even the 'bad' films in order to better appreciate the 'good'.I was utterly surprised by this film.

	schema:reviewBody "I know this movie's almost a decade old but I only just became a member here at IMDb so I wanted to drop a comment on this amazing horror flick.This movie has quite a bit to offer fans of just about any kind of movie horror suspense drama a couple of laughs and some romance all set within the template of the modern age teen movie  and it works out beautifully. Emily Bergl and Jason London star as Rachel Lang and Jesse Ryan respectively. Making her cameoreturn from the first film is Amy Irving in the role of Sue Snell the sole survivor of the original massacre. Amy Irving while not seen very often in the film does a fantastic job of showing that the character is indeed still very tormented by that fateful night it all just comes flooding back to her when Rachel breaks the snow globe.One of the best scenes in the movie is when Sue Snell takes Rachel very distraught over the suicide of her best friend back to the location of the original massacre where the remnants of the desecrated high school still stand. It is also this scene that tells us how Rachel got her powers  she's Carrie's halfsister by way of a shared father.That brings us back to Rachel and Jesse. These two become attracted to one another as the film progresses and eventually go out on a couple of dates. Let me just say something here. The romance between these two was done amazingly well aided by the onscreen chemistry between Bergl and London. I was so taken by it all that I actually hurt for Jesse when Rachel died.In the end they end up getting a little too close for the comfort and overinflated ego of Jesse's exgirlfriend who subsequently plots revenge with her friends as well as the other football players that Jesse rightfully dissed earlier in the film completely unaware of the grizzly fate that awaits them all. It all goes down at the post game party at the rich football player Mark's house. Inevitably they go too far and end up pushing Rachel off the deep end...and into a seething ocean of rage. The partygoers all die in particularly gory fashion  to include a girl being riddled with CDs and a jock being pinned to a door and Ms. Snell by a fireplace poker. The jock Eric played by Zachary Ty Brian  also the guy responsible for the death of Rachel's best friend  certainly gets it worse then anyone when he is castrated with a harpoon gun.In the end mirroring the first film Rachel exacts her revenge and kills herself in the process leaving a very heartbroken Jesse the sole survivor.This was such a great movie for so many reasons and I truly recommend it to any fan of the horror genre.".

Another sad thing about this show is that you know what's going to happen the moment you see the opening credits. Sure sure girl gets humilated thourghly and then turns into crazed psychic murderer...yawn...Been there. Done that.Even the actors look like they were forced into doing this movie. Emily Bergl is as frightening as a cabbage patch doll while Jack London... let's just say i didn't pay to see wood act. Apart from the actors the flasbacks serve more to irritate than to link up with the first movie.Bottom line If you can beam objects around like Carrie then for the love of God beam yourself out of that theatre......".

Never a fan of horror movies I went with a curious mind and didn't expect much.  However I got my money's worth by far!What worked the most for me in the this movie was the degree of sincerity and intelligence portrayed in the script.  This wasn't a typical blood 'n guts gore film about some girl who gets her feelings hurt and knocks off the entire student body.  There's much more beneath the surface than that.I would dearly love to see this movie again while it's still playing on the big screen.  There's something different about this movie which is a cut above many of the recent teenscream movies which have come out over the past 2 years.  I'm not sure what it is.   It might be truertolife characterisations or terrific performance by newcomer Emily Bergl or the wellwritten story which unfolds at the perfect pace and sets you up for the somewhat typical finale.  I think it's most likely the empathy you feel for Rachel and the sadness which prevails.  And where true love is concerned like Romeo  Juliet true lovers can only be together forever in death.  That is the definitive nature of happy endings as illustrated early on in this film.This movie  however  does not end this way.The Rage is rated R for mild language brief sexuality and  naturally  horror violence and gore.  Although there isn't that much throughout the movie you get your fill at the end.  There's not much of that creative bloodletting many horror films delve into which is a refreshing change.".

When Rachael's best friend kills herself after being seduced and dumped by a member of the football team strange things happen which are noticed by the school counsellor Susan Snell  in particular it reminds her of Carrie who had the powers to move things with her mind.  Snell tries to help Rachael get help before she shares Carrie's fate but Rachael is busy falling in love with one of the football team  but is he all that he seems?Surely this film must feature on any list of unnecessary sequels made many years after the fact.  That the film bears the name Carrie' must have made the studio hope that some of the good features of that film would be carried sorry over and redeem this.  The plot tries to keep the essence of Carrie but it tries to mix in all the clichs of the modern teen movie as well  and the two don't mix.  So for the majority of the film we have the normal jocks bothering weird girl' plot and the odd scene of something breaking.The problem is that suddenly the end scene happens  with little build up or trail.  From a girl ignoring her powers Rachael suddenly becomes some sort of pumped killing machine in full control of her mind.  The change is too sudden and is lazy writing.  The actual film itself is too much an average teen movie and the ending is full of deliberate gore for the audience that measures horror in those terms.  I personally found it overdone like the special effects guys were trying too hard.The director also feels like he's working too hard.  He tries to freak us out and make everything seem exciting by having tonnes of zooming cameras changes in film stock and changes from colour to black and white.  But it all felt like a gimmick because of the material.  The film pales beside the original and just fails trying to steal bits from it  even the ending is spoilt because we know to expect a shock' ending because it's trying to do a Carrie moment.Bergl is average as Rachael  she basically plays your typical Goth stereotype from all these movies.  London is OK and it's funny to see two stars of American Pie in small roles.  Irving reprises her role with a logical crowbaring of facts but she is wasted and is only there to provide the link to the whole mindpower stuff..  Is she this desperate for work?Overall this isn't as bad as many reviews made it sound on release.  It's an average at best teenhorror movie.  However the fact that it relates itself to Carrie makes it look worse by comparison  not helped by showing clips.  I'd avoid this unless your idea of a great movie is American Pie 2 or Friday the 13th Part 6.".

	schema:reviewBody "The long awaited sequel to Carrie? Anything is possible. The Rage Carrie 2 was mostly the weirdest thing I've ever saw. Knowing what Carrie started and Rachel left off. It was fair enough to see one of the survivors of Carrie's wrath working at the new high school. And a new outcast RachelEmily Bergl whose friend commits suicide at the school. This character didn't quite fit in with her foster family. Because her mother is a nutshell. And the jocks were the real heels of the movie. The plot kinda mirrors the first movie but unlike the first Carrie with Sissy Spacek Emily Bergl's Rachel was meaner looking. And there was no blood spatter in this one. Although RACHEL'S WRATH was much MUCH worse than Carrie's. Her tattoo comes alive her powers is unleashed and everyone is in deep trouble including the last survivor of the first movie. She really defined the term pokerface. CDs and flying glass were effective on everyone who crossed and deceived her. Rachel was indeed deadlier than Carrie. But one question left me to wonder did she perish? Only time will tell. This movie was weird compared to the first and I out of all people would think twice on making her mad! Rating 2.5 out 5 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the 2013 Carrie remake was released I wanted to rewatch the original and its sequel. It had been years since I've watched this and it holds up and much better than I remembered. It has a great nostalgic vibe to it with having Amy Irving return as Sue Snell 23 years later and giving us some great flashback scenes from the original classic. It also brings the original story to the modern world with Carrie's half sister Rachel Lang having the telekinetic disease. This movie almost seems like it'd be a great Lifetime film rather than a sequel to Carrie because of the teenage drama and suicide over love. After Rachel's friend commits suicide because of being rejected by a jock guidance counselor Sue Snell tries to help Rachel with the loss and soon the realization that she has powers.Rachel begins to fall in love with a sweethearted jock named Jesse. The jocks begin to taunt her and humiliate her at a party after the big football game. This is the best part of the film because you always wanna see how these hot telekinetic chicks get their revenge. There is one part that I absolutely hated. Even as a child it brought me to tears. I won't spoil it for you but someone beloved gets caught in the crossfire. It's a good and decent sequel but will never beat the original. I'd recommend THE RAGE CARRIE 2!!!".

The Music in this film is very sad and very good. The actors are popular and they perform great. And the title says it all when it says THE RAGE. The original Carrie i didn't care for much I guess because i don't really care for old flicks of any kind But the remake of the first Carrie in 2002 was cool. This Horror flick brings class to the screen in a new and interesting way. I suggest any horror movie freak go to there local BlockBuster and pick the very hip movie up!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "So I commented on this title on a previous occasion after having seen it once. Apparently I didn't like this film after seeing it for the first time. So it's a Friday Night I'm home from school which is 100 miles away all of the movies that I wanted to see I left in my dorm room. I came across The Rage Carrie 2 on the shelf looking for something to take me back to the late '90s nostalgia I've been feeling lately. Hey anything is better than this decade we're living in right? I popped The Rage Carrie 2 in and watched it for the second time ever. I've had this movie almost 2 years and I've only watched it twice. I guess second chances are good because this time around I don't know what it was this movie touched me. Maybe it's because I have a girlfriend whom I really love I dunno. Anyway the performances were excellent. Emily Bergl really did a great job of playing Rachel she really made me sympathetic and empathize with Rachel. The part where Rachel begs and pleads with God to take her life because she has been so humiliated and is finally at the end of her rope emotionally really broke my heart. Any movie that can bring me to tears earns points in my book. Jason London takes on a different role from the one he had in Dazed and Confused although he still manages to be on the football team. I was really hoping for him to save Rachel in the end but of course we all were I'm sure. The other cast members of this film including Amy Irving why did she have to die so horribly!!?? I guess keeping up with the tradition of the one sympathetic adult getting killed in a gruesome and violent way kind of like Miss Collins in Carrie. I really hated the other jocks so therefore the performers who were portraying them did their jobs well as did the other popular people. Eddie Kaye Thomas was kind of off in left field but I guess so was his character. The shatter effect really got me to jump. So a shout out to Katt Shea for directing this film. Sorry I was so critical of this film after the first time I saw it.".

There were some really creative filming camera decisions made and I can see why this was nominated for a Sundance Grand Jury prize.

In the process he breaks his relationship with his girlfriend Tatum O'Neil turns his back on his only friend and the mute who gave him his poetry.Little Noises is a dreary tale of greed the thirst for power and wealth rolled up into a disturbing melancholy mesh.  Crispin Glover one of my favourite actors shines in the lead role with great performances from Tatum O'Neil and Matthew Hutton as the mute.  You'll probably find this movie in the Comedy section of your local video store but it's out of place with movies like The Jerk and There's Something About Mary. Little Noises offers moments that leave the viewer saddened rather than laughing.  The finale of the film is one you won't be able to get out of your head. Leaving the viewer with a glimpse of the past or what the future could have held.  Check it out but don't expect a comedy and the same quirky Crispin we all know and love.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've just watched this movie as part of the Italian Film Festival held yearly at Washington University in St.Louis Missouri HTTPwww.italianfilmfestivalstlouis.com. The film was projected in Italian subtitled in English. This is a solid comedy. I laughed practically all the time. It was judged the best movie of the festival by a mixed audience of Italians and Americans. It is not sexoriented even if Valentina Lodovini Maria shows considerable amount of her upperfront anatomy that's just natural in Italy. And it's really witty and well structured for creating a crescendo of humor. I haven't seen the original French version so I don't know whether the credit for this is due to the Italian production or not. Italians in Italy might not like this movie because it seems to tread too lightly on very serious things like the violence the garbage and other known problems in the Naples' area. But you know? It's a comedy! And contrary to what some Italians in Italy feel this movie shows that North people when forced to confront their prejudices they might discover that they are also good nice friendly South people out there. Italians at the Film festival actually loved this movie while hated the two that showed a more realistic view of the Neapolitan way of life. The reason is that a movie is also an ambassador for the country of origin. Nobody outside Italy wants to see not even a part of their country always portrayed as a cesspool of garbage and violence without showing the rest of such community. For me the message of this movie is universal not just Italian. In all human confrontations the other side is also human. And if we learn how to walk in the shoes of the other looking at life through the other's eyes we may find that we are not different at all. I didn't give it a full 10 because the process of making it ohsofunny made some situations and the personal relationships husbandwife boyfriendgirlfriend etc. become a bit unreal and stereotypical. But I laughed! Finally I wonder where did they found so many practitioners at the trulyincomprehensiblemaster level of the Neapolitan dialect...".

The film begins with Alberto Colombo Claudio Bisso as a civil servant of the ItalianPostale.

Alberto's wife Silvia Angela Finocchiaro chooses to remain in the civilized north while Alberto is subjected to his penance. The ensuing journey is a farcical romp through social stereotypes and false assumptions which leads Alberto to reevaluate his own system of beliefs. Steeped in Italian cinemas rich history of neorealism and romanticism it seems that amore' is the parallel undercurrent to the film. Love reigns supreme beneath the comical veneer as southern mama's boy Mattia Volpe Alessandro Siani garners courage to express his affections for local bellissima Maria Valentina Lodovini. Alberto and Silvia teeter on the brink of their faltering relationship and her brave trip to the south will either break them or change them forever. A wonderful introspective on preconceived notions that prove false wrong when people understand one another combined with breathtaking scenery of Italy's southern coastal regions make this a film for all the world to enjoy. The sequel Welcome to the North 2012 should prove to be equally entertaining as the noteworthy cast of Alberto's friends invade the northern regions. Caio!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a sentimental comedy  a bit pathetic. This is the limit of the current cinema in Italy. we have no sense of irony then you can have only from one side the desperation of Gomorrah and on the other plastic comedies like this one. It is very difficult to find popular movies comparable with the old Italian masterpieces. The characters are not credible and not funny. This movie depicts a more stereotypical vision of the Italian than the Sopranos' TV series  By the way it is curios that a TVserial made in US is more effective to depict some of the Italian culture than movies made in Italy. As Italians we have no way to reflect to our conditions improve ourselves and avoid to be stuck to the same old stereotypes PizzaSoleMandolino with the difference that in this movie Mafia is just a fiction  a set inside the set just to save Alberto's marriage  this is very sad and not funny at all.".

	schema:headline " A sentimental 'feelgood' farce with heaps of potential which is seldom realised.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a curiously lame reversioning of a French film which was much more successful on many levels the most important being the direction. WTTS is an awkward experience for this audience member it's full of good farcical ideas and nice broad characters but it never really comes to life because the staging the timing and the acting all miss the mark. You can see how good it could have been how many of the scenes played differently would have worked. Alas it's mostly flat overly sentimental but cheerful. The only actor in the cast with whom I'm familiar is Angela Finocchiaro whom I very much admired in Don't Tell  in which she gave a funny and moving performance. Here she's not given much to do beyond acting out the demands of of her caricatured character and the unlikely turns of the plot. I kept expecting her to be funny but I was always disappointed. I attribute this to poor writing and even poorer direction. It's often extraordinary how certain scenes are staged  as though the director is anticomedy.".
