	schema:reviewBody "Travis Patrick a former government op is hired by his old commanding officer Wellington Breck to protect his daughter Diana Vogel of Ring Of Steel 1994 fame for a temporary amount of time because bad guys are after him and his family. Travis agrees to the job but only if he can bring in his buddy Baxter Weller to help out. Even though Baxter is a nutty guy Wellington reluctantly agrees. What then follows is Travis Baxter and Diana moving from place to place in the woods as Katya Lewis Daniel Kulich and other baddies try killing them using various means but usually shooting. Most of the rest of the movie is this catandmouse game but there are a few twists every now and again to try to keep the viewers' interest. Who is the real DECOY? Sure Decoy may have some bigger names like Robert Patrick and Peter Weller and it may be shot well using picturesque Canadian locations shot in Regina and La Ronge Saskatchewan but don't be fooled this is just as dumb and runofthemill as many other DTV productions out there. It was clearly trying to be more upper crust and be almost theaterquality but ultimately doesn't get there and is a disappointment.There are some cool killings and the baddies have these futuristic wrist rockets that they use on their enemies but that's really the only noteworthy invention here. And that doesn't a good movie make. There are some utterly stupid timewasting romantic elements between Baxter and Diana for a while which don't need to be there. Diana is the clichd complaining woman dragged along into an adventure we've seen so many times before. On the other end of the female spectrum is Charlotte Lewis looking amazing with her outfits and highpowered weaponry. It's quite a change from her role in Men of War 1994. Robert Patrick puts in a personable enough performance but it's hard not to compare this to the awesome Zero Tolerance 1994 which is Patrick at his absolute best. Weller puts in a quirky performance with his pseudophilosophical dialogue and he's always good but Decoy as a whole is mediocre with tons of pewpew gunfighting scenes that don't really add much.Also on board as one of the baddies is Vladimir Kulich who has played the Eurotrash Bad Guy in such movies as Crackerjack 1994 Red Scorpion 2 1995 and Breach Of Trust 1995. We're definitely getting used to seeing him. There's also the prerequisite torture scene but this time the movie opens with it and gets it out of the way. But the problem with Decoy is every time it starts to get good it pulls back. It's almost like the movie has a fear of success.Decoy is ultimately wasteful with what resources it has and it never rises above your standard action premise.For more action insanity drop by www.comeuppancereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since my childhood I've been fascinated by all life under water. I was only two years old had severely burned my arm and my parents didn't know how to make me forget about the pain. They decided to buy me a little fish tank with a couple of goldfish in it. And it worked as I sat on my knees in front of it I forgot about all the pain. My arm healed but the passion remained and I've always kept fishes as a pet ever since I've got two aquariums and a large pond now. I will also never miss any documentary about this wonderful creatures on television but I hadn't seen this one before. Last Christmas my mom found it on a double DVD and thought it would be a good present for me. She was right.Even though the entire documentary is situated in the water you'll get to see more than just a lot of fishes in all kinds of colors and sizes. You'll also get penguins polar bears whales dolphins... But there isn't just a diversity in the creatures that are shown. Also the environments change and that's a good thing. The polar sees are completely different from the tropical sees the Atlantic different from the Pacific and together they make sure that you keep watching it with your full interest. More than once I found myself watching it with my mouth open. All the images were incredibly beautiful but if this had been situated in one spot than the 92 minutes would have been too long. Now I just couldn't get enough of it. And that's also where this movie's main weakness if you ask me. I wished that it would keep on going on for another 30 minutes or more. It just ended too soon.If you are interested in everything that happens in that magnificent world under water but don't want to learn scuba diving first than this documentary is definitely a must see. The images are just wonderful the music that accompanies it all is great... Just let yourself be overwhelmed by the beauty and the powers of nature. It's an excellent documentary made by the BBC Natural History Unit. I give it a 1010. Just one last word of advice try to watch it on a large screen and with an excellent surround system if you can it can only add something extra to the experience.".

I was only two years old had severely burned my arm and my parents didn't know how to make me forget about the pain. They decided to buy me a little fish tank with a couple of goldfish in it. And it worked as I sat on my knees in front of it I forgot about all the pain. My arm healed but the passion remained and I've always kept fishes as a pet ever since I've got two aquariums and a large pond now. I will also never miss any documentary about this wonderful creatures on television but I hadn't seen this one before. Last Christmas my mom found it on a double DVD and thought it would be a good present for me. She was right.Even though the entire documentary is situated in the water you'll get to see more than just a lot of fishes in all kinds of colors and sizes. You'll also get penguins polar bears whales dolphins... But there isn't just a diversity in the creatures that are shown. Also the environments change and that's a good thing. The polar sees are completely different from the tropical sees the Atlantic different from the Pacific and together they make sure that you keep watching it with your full interest. More than once I found myself watching it with my mouth open. All the images were incredibly beautiful but if this had been situated in one spot than the 92 minutes would have been too long. Now I just couldn't get enough of it. And that's also where this movie's main weakness if you ask me. I wished that it would keep on going on for another 30 minutes or more. It just ended too soon.If you are interested in everything that happens in that magnificent world under water but don't want to learn scuba diving first than this documentary is definitely a must see. The images are just wonderful the music that accompanies it all is great... Just let yourself be overwhelmed by the beauty and the powers of nature. It's an excellent documentary made by the BBC Natural History Unit. I give it a 1010. Just one last word of advice try to watch it on a large screen and with an excellent surround system if you can it can only add something extra to the experience.";

	schema:reviewBody "Water makes up most of the Earth and unlike the surface ecosystems it is the hardest for man to explore inhabit or bulldoze. It is the closest thing to having a different planet except right here on Earth. As such I was looking forward to watching this film because of the excellent footage of the many amazing creatures and ecosystems that ever improving technology allow us to get closer to. I'm not really one for nature programmes so maybe that is why I was extra impressed by the film  because such stuff has not become ordinary to me. At the start of the film I must admit that I was watching the ordinary whales crabs and seals fitted into that category to me but once the camera went deeper into the oceans it only became more and more fascinating with such weird and wonderful creatures on display.This goes for the shallower depths as well as fish whales sharks etc are all very well presented and gorgeous to watch. Indeed that is the strength of the film  the beauty of it. It is fascinating to watch and the expertise in filming shines through from start to finish. However it is the appreciation of the view where the film is weak. Gambon's narration is sparse and even but it only occasionally gives out nuggets of information. I didn't expect detail like David Attenborough would give but it could have done with something more to compliment the visuals. The music covers the lack of narration and generally the score is well pitched to support the air of wonder or pace to the film.Overall this is a great visual treat even if it is mostly going to be seen on the small screen. It all looks impressive and is fascinating but a bit more narration and detail would have been useful. Best viewed as a visual experience or as an entry into the wider genre of nature programmes.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a very nice feeling watching a documentary like this on the big screen. You can feel the overwhelming power of waves bursting against rocky coastlines and experience the vastness of the ocean.Deep Blue takes you on a journey from the coast to the coral reefs then to the icy lands of the antarctic and finally down to the most fascinating part of this movie the deepest depths of the ocean where not a single beam of light shatters through.Most scenes are greatly composed of very clear sharp and absolutely stunning images harmonized with the orchestral music of the Berliner Philharmoniker.In one very nice and humorous scene where you see hundreds of fat penguins shambling over a sheet of ice I nearly got the impression also induced through the music watching the marching scene of Edoras citizens in Lord of the Rings The Two Towers. Might sound odd but I guess I have a faible for large scenes with many actors moving on the big screen supported by a big orchestra. There is another scene like this with little crawfish on the coast choreographed like a sports event.But in Deep Blue you have no special effects. There are literally thousands of actors in some scenes. You watch birds falling from the sky shooting into the waters grabbing one fish out of a vast swarm. You watch penguins gaining speed under water jumping out and finally more or less safely landing with their round bellies on the sheets of ice. And you're worried about little fish hiding under rocks when carnivore fishes arrive searching for food.You might have seen most of the animals before but when they take you some kilometers down you enter a completely different and very fascinating world which I have never seen before in another documentary  at least not in this clarity.Down there in this seemingly live threatening environment very very odd and sometimes scary looking creatures are lingering around. Sometimes you wonder yourself if they just dropped you out of the documentary throwing you right into a science fiction movie.There are tiny creatures partly transparent with moving light bars on their bodies pulsating in rainbow colors. There are little ones generating bright flashes to baffle their enemies. And well if you've seen Finding Nemo you might recognize the scary looking carnivore with a light bulb on his head attracting innocent little fishies.....So... I rated this documentary 810. It's not perfect in my opinion. There is a narrator sometimes throwing in some sentences which are more or less describing the current scene. I think he speaks about 1015 times in the whole movie. This goes well with the pace and the atmosphere would be disturbed by too much speaking but gives you nearly no information about the animals you see on screen. A tiny subtitle in one of the lower edges might have been great showing you the names of the creatures you're currently looking at.Also I would have done the cutting in a slightly different way. Some scenes are perfect just beautiful and overwhelming where other scenes are very much like in the usual TV documentaries.Overall this movie is worth watching in the cinema if you have the opportunity to do so. Also the more people learn to admire the wonders of the ocean the more chances mankind may have to protect it in the future.".

I haven't seen the documentary series Deep Blue Sea on which it was based so I cannot comment on how the film compares to that series. What I can say is for any of you who are interested in animal behavior above and below the ocean's surface you will be amazed. This film has few interruptions between wonderfully paced and edited clips of animal behavior. While I had seen almost all of the animals and plant life that appear in this movie before this gave me a new and thrilling opportunity to see their lives as the animals themselves do. You hear their voices and experience their emotions. The soundtrack kept me emotionally captivated for the entire 90 minute run time. The filmmakers don't try to narrate the behavior but let you experience it first hand to a thrilling effect.However this movie is not for the faint of heart. The filmmakers spare no detail in showing close up the threats posed to smaller sea life by larger and more voracious variations of life. With that in mind I recommend keeping young children away from this movie. The children sitting a few rows in front of me in the theater gasped and held onto their parents during the violent scenes in the film.If you do see this movie make a point to do it on the biggest screen you can find and sit as close as you can.".

Since such films on big screen in cinema are a rarity as a matter of fact not many people felt encouraged to see DEEP BLUE. Perhaps we are too much addicted to action films and all fictions possible. In this way many of us have forgotten that it is also possible to admire real nature on screen. I also must admit that I am not a fan of such documentaries. What usually bores me in them are the number of sophisticated terms provided to the viewer which makes it all too scientific. Nevertheless I went to see DEEP BLUE for the sake of images that addressed my curiosity. And I do not regret! It was wonderful throughout. The film is foremost a stunning image which pays tribute to the variety of life mostly the life under the waters.First of all it is important to mention that the documentary is not very long and serves a useful purpose not being a too detailed insight into some facts of life in the ocean. Besides the film is really visually stunning. You see the underwater world as if you were there. All kinds of fishes of various shapes and colors are a feast for the eyes. You see the entire joy and freedom of their lives as well as the necessity to defend themselves from deadly dangers. The atmosphere is great and the action is very involving. Moreover the philharmonic orchestral music in the background makes the experience even more unforgettable. The most impressive moment for me was when the journey to the deep began and the pictures we could see were fewer and fewer due to darkness. How unbelievable it is how much the sunlight provides to the earth. These creatures that have never seen the light look completely different as if not from this world. Some of them surprised me totally. Yet they also have the desire to live... There are also other wonderful moments showing life on the ground particularly the polar bear and penguins. This is filmed with great commitment indeed.DEEP BLUE is not a film for everyone. Some people may not find anything special in it. Perhaps that is why the cinemas in Poland had it for only 10 up to 15 days while other films are being showed for two months or even longer. Yet I would recommend DEEP BLUE to anyone who can still admire the variety of beauties on the planet of life that the earth not unintentionally is. But remember to see it on the big screen.

It's a fascinating journey into the ocean particularly the parts that most of us will never see like the arctic regions and the deepest reaches of the deep ocean. Some of the shots themselves are incredible just in the way the camera crew were able to immerse themselves in the biological communities that they were filming especially the feeding scenes.

It's a fascinating journey into the ocean particularly the parts that most of us will never see like the arctic regions and the deepest reaches of the deep ocean. Some of the shots themselves are incredible just in the way the camera crew were able to immerse themselves in the biological communities that they were filming especially the feeding scenes. Anyone with even a passing interest in the ocean and the mysteries of life on this planet should definitely not miss this.

Deep Blue is a Discovery Channel Documentary about life in the oceans of the world narrated by Pierce Brosnen. This movie had some really cool scenes Polar Bears attacking Baluga Whales Killer Whales attacking Humpback Whales Dolphins pushing schooling fish into a feeding ball etc. I like watching these things the only problem is I had seen them all before on the discovery channel... for free. The unfortunate problem with this movie is that it had litterely nothing that I hadn't seen at some time on the discover channel or the national geographic channel or animal planet etc. Thus it was very hard to stay interested in it for over two hours.

I have no idea of how the crew could have gotten some of these startlingly revealing shots. How for instance do you get close enough to a polar bear to film its attempt to catch a beluga whale without disturbing the bear itself? I mean the bear can't be blind! Telephoto lenses yes but these images are crisp and clear as if shot from ten feet away.It's less academic than it is an aesthetic experience. No scientific names. Pierce Brosnan's sparse narration keeps us abreast of what we're watching and what's going on. That pile of big pebbles is actually a group of emperor penguins huddled together for warmth against the antarctic blizzard. You wouldn't know it without the narration except that every once in a while a penguin's head pops up out of the gray pile and glances around for a few seconds.The musical score is as lyrical and majestic as the visual imagery which may be good or not so good but it never becomes cloying. It resembles Debussy as impressionist all about nature and movement. If this had appeared in say 1968 the weed heads would have flocked to it. But these days they're all grown up and don't need to alter their state of consciousness to appreciate what they're witnessing. The film itself will take care of that.It's in no way a treehugger movie. Well Brosnan's narration ends with a question. Are we in the process of destroying this before we've come to understand it?

The narrator Pierce Brosnan says This is a world of constant jeopardy an endless cycle of birth death and renewal. Powerful waves crash into the rocky coast where the sea lions return to give birth but unwary seals become prey to predators the black and white colored killer whales in the shallows at high tide. Then again the whales themselves risk being stranded there.More marine life is seen before the view shifts to the coral reefs a narrow band of sunfed life only found in the shallows of the tropical seas. The skeletons of coral polyps  the smallest and most fragile of organisms  form the reef. The darkness is feeding time for some the nightfeeders with builtin sensors have no need of light. Fascinating and colorful sea creatures abound further below the ocean surface but unfortunately most are not identified. There are poisonous jellyfish and manta rays. Just before the halfway mark of the film the scene moves to the Arctic polar bears and also Antarctic penguins. In the Antarctic the temperature is seventy degrees below zero 70F and the winds exceed one hundred miles per hour. The penguins gather speed in the cold waters before jumping out and landing on sheet ice. Meanwhile in the far north the polar bears search for nesting seals hidden in ice caves situated just below the surface. Thirtyton gray whales travel six thousand miles to feed in the polar seas. After six hours of jostling killer whales separate one unfortunate gray calf from its mother and move in when it is thoroughly exhausted. From the surface of the ocean we next enter a subterranean world the deepest underwater area on the planet and where surface light does not penetrate. Seven miles deep the Marianas Trench it is a mystery world of perpetual night. It is a sparsely explored netherworld of odd life forms again unidentified. The only light emanates from the undersea creatures themselves. Light is used as a lure to attract prey or as a decoy to confuse them. Poisonous hydrogen sulfide gas and boiling water spew forth in some areas. Yet even near those settings some life forms exist. At film's end we hear that there are only a few thousand blue whales left on earth. The blue whales are earth's largest creatures by far.The narration is limited and the orchestral music appropriate. If you like nature documentaries you will enjoy this one although there are several lulls.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best movies of marine lives. We can watch another universe into the sea. Beautiful images and music make us feel so comfortable. In the sea it is very different world however we have sympathy and impression.The movie Deep Blue show us how the marine creatures live in mysterious sea. In the deep blue world these creatures don't live without using their wisdom. So I was very surprised at their great power to survive. The polar bear dives into icy ocean and hunt a bigger dolphin for its hungry cub. Emperor penguins have gone without food in order to protect their eggs for three months on the ice of 50 points below zero. It is not only very beautiful but also sad that shakes and dolphins and sea birds fight in water with aiming the school of sardines.The story into the sea is the drama without plot but for lives in the water life and death are to their side. So it's not game it's serious. They live desperately so I was much moved. There are cruel scenes for example the hunting of a killer whale but it is reality.

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of the best movies of marine lives. We can watch another universe into the sea. Beautiful images and music make us feel so comfortable. In the sea it is very different world however we have sympathy and impression.The movie Deep Blue show us how the marine creatures live in mysterious sea. In the deep blue world these creatures don't live without using their wisdom. So I was very surprised at their great power to survive. The polar bear dives into icy ocean and hunt a bigger dolphin for its hungry cub. Emperor penguins have gone without food in order to protect their eggs for three months on the ice of 50 points below zero. It is not only very beautiful but also sad that shakes and dolphins and sea birds fight in water with aiming the school of sardines.The story into the sea is the drama without plot but for lives in the water life and death are to their side. So it's not game it's serious. They live desperately so I was much moved. There are cruel scenes for example the hunting of a killer whale but it is reality. However it is interesting in inexperienced world and we can feel so wonderful as if you took a trip to all over the sea. You will meet various lives and experience something priceless in this trip. I hope you have nice trip!!";

And because of the nature of the footage some scenes had to be explained  a scuffle between a killer whale and a seal in the surf may have been dramatic but without a voiceover telling you what was happening it was just so much water being thrashed about. And as with the score in places the narration was overly dramatic as if the writers didn't think the footage exciting enough on it's own.By far the biggest disappointment though was the footage itself. Wonderfully shot and truly breathtaking and fascinating at times granted.But whereas 'Winged Migration' was shot as a movie  it was brand new footage that had been shot with that project in mind  'Deep Blue' is a compilation of BBC clips. So much of the footage had been seen before  how many times has that footage of the killer whale hunting seals on the beach been used for example. And when we saw the movie the footage of the dolphins seals sharks and birds hunting the huge shoals of sardines that bookended the movie had been on television only the week before. Film like that should always be breathtaking naturally but there does come a point when you have seen a certain clip a number of times that it loses it's magic.

No link to reality what in the world qualifies some oil fire fighters to run cutting edge equipment other than they're the inventor's drinking buddies.  THESE guys are going to set off nukes to save the world?  No wonder it's about to end.As for casting I think the only criteria was who was unemployed when it came time to shoot.  Personally though I have to say I did like the Wil Wheaton Molten Shower scene.";

Of course he walked off the job a year or so earlier fearing that his creation might be used as a weapon.  He was right.  It's the potential for that disaster thing I just mentioned which brings our wouldbe hero back to save the day.  If this sounds remotely like so many other films out there it probably is.This is B movie territory folks but it's a FUN ride!  Sheffer gets to dig down 120 miles into the Earth and place 5 nuclear bombs that will create a chain effect that stops the planet from tearing itself apart...while also saving valuable budget money by not showing too many disasters on the surface always visible because the camera shakes before we get some cheesy CGI effects.Along for the ride is James Russo Wil Wheaton giving a better performance than in Python and Terry Farrell Dax from Star Trek Deep Space 9. What the film isn't able to entertain you with visually because of what I'm assuming is a modest budget it more than makes up for in dialogue and acting.  There are a few technobabble bits here and there but these guys and gal are enjoying themselves and provide some welcome laughter.  Forget the other Government stiffs.  They kind of pad the film a bit and aren't nearly as fun to watch.It's especially nice to see Sheffer in a more heroic role after Hellraiser Inferno and Wheaton still has a smile that will make you melt.  If you can overlook some really fake CGI effects and just take the movie for what it's supposed to be entertainment then you could do a lot worse than give Deep Core a try.".

And I've never even taken a geology course. Or the other plot option is that they are merely exploring the center of the earth find lost civilizations monsters etc.Quickly here's a list of all the films and a brief comparison to this one The Core The Gold Standard. Much higher budget than this one and a fun Bmovie that doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as this one.Journey To The Center of the Earth I liked this even though it had Pat Boone in it. A good old fashioned fantasy film from back in the day.Mesa of Lost Women See my review here on the IMDb. One of the worst movies ever made.The Phantom Empire Fred Olen Ray directed mishmash of a ripoff of Indiana Jones a 1950's alien invasion movie and a 1930's serial. A lovable jumble of insanity. They spend most of the movie running around in the cave in Bronson Canyon a legendary Bmovie location in Los Angeles. Super fun for Bmovie fans. Others might get annoyed.Unknown World Another machinethingy must drill into the Earth to save civilization. Actually pretty well done for a nobudget film from 1952. Black and white of course.Beast From Haunted Cave Okay they didn't go down into the Earth that far only into a cave. But they find a cool monster in there. Enjoyable Roger Corman produced schlockery.The Incredible Petrified World  Also 1950's black and white. They find a secret underground world here comes the twist under the ocean floor! They descend in a diving bell. Zero budget here. Incredibly boring. Only saving grace is John Carradine but he can only do so much. Rating real low. Skip it.Village of the Giants  I think there's a cave in this one? Is that why I stuck it in here?Sound of Horror  Haven't watched this one yet but I believe it's about people dying in a cave in Greece.At The Earth's Core  Classic 1970's schlock! Based on Edgar Rice Burroughs. Classic Saturday afternoon fun fare. Worth watching.The Lost Continent  People enter the Earth and find lost world of dinosaurs...so bad it's good. Some hilarious moments. Another black and white low budget nonepic from the 1950's.I need to pick up The Cave and The Descent two recent films with people dying undernearth the earth.DEEP CORE stacks up pretty well against some of these. There is a ton of hilariously bad dialog and the interior of the Drilling Thingy is really bad and low rent.I'll give it a four for good old yocks. If DEEP CORE had taken itself a little less seriously it probably would have rated a 6 or 7 for entertainment value. The Core is much funnier. Stanley Tucci's performance alone makes it worth your time.".

So far so good but that's were the good things stopped. This flick has nothing to do with horror. This is just a Bflick with very terrible CGI. But somehow I kept watching what would happen. So it's not a movie that you will hate but also not one to remember. The acting wasn't that convincing and the story wasn't one to cheer. This could be if it was made in the seventies one of those flicks that would be shown at a drivein. So I think that you know what I mean. The ones with stupid plots and goofy lines.

The machine used for saving the world looks like a giant cardboard box with Grey spraypaint. On the most stupid moments the speed is taken out of the story. Come on guys the world is about to end you're the devoted ones to save it don't bother on saying please or stop the vehicle and start an argument about who's turn it is to launch the nuke etc etc. When taking a rollercoaster ride in a machine through the earth it is expected that all persons move the same way. Not in this movie.The cockpit is made of white IKEAboxes with office chairs with only a few monitors and some buttons. The drill is making a hole twice as big as the vehicle etc etc etc. I wonder wasn't there an actor prepared to warn the director that he was making a disaster of this movie instead of making a movie about a disaster.I usually like this type of films but not this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've now watched enough movies on TV  in Spanish to set the bar low for expectations. Films as bad as Deep Core prompt me to do other activities like play the Wii on another TV made almostuseless by the digital transition a few years ago.  when I do focus on the movie I make some comments or riffs about how crappy the scene is. Deep Core is another silly scifi film about how some scientists use a very ginormous machine  possibly worth a trillion tax dollars if it's a government asset  that's equipped w the requisite nuclear bombs  one rogue scientist to complicate the mission which is to prevent some cataclysmic catastrophe that could kill millions as evidenced by either stock footage of past disasters or modestlooking CGI demonstrating destructions of world landmarks e.g. California's Pacific Coast Highway or some church in Quito Ecuador. This also stars two thespians from a Star Trek spin off Wil Wheaton from The Next Generation  some actress from Deep Space Nine. I have to say that now that I enjoy Wheaton as Sheldon's nemesisturnedpal on The Big Bang Theory that silly scene of him taking a deadly magma shower in this movie is forgiven.  I assume Deep Core had a midrange budget as all the exterior shots of the drilling vehicle were done on a computer while the interior shots look like something in a sketch comedy show. I think if I actually bothered to watch  understand the Spanish dubbing to learn the story perhaps I'd hear some jokes or double entendres about drilling. But I doubt such comedy would be in the movie. In conclusion Deep Core judging by my 2 outta 10 rating isn't crappy enough to scare you into turning off the TV. But the dialogue  plot  the scenes wo CGI graphics  is so unintriguing that it's recommended to do a little multitasking such as eating websurfing or if your TV has PIP watching something better on the other screen.".

Terry Wil and all the others did a great job. I thought it was very sad to kill Wil off not only because he was the youngest but because he was so cute too. This is also a very hard movie to find in my location but this movie is one of my favorite movies from 2000 to 2001.

It may not be an incredible immortal masterpiece  I do have to admit it is second to The Abyss  but this is definitely a good movie in virtually every way. For the last fifteen years I've owned a VHS tape of it recorded from a laserdisc version and seen it loads of times. Today I got the Region 2 Widescreen DVD and I was once again confirmed in my opinion that this is a fine movie. It is underwater scifi horror and one of several such movies from the era but except that it doesn't have the clout effects wizardry and budget of a James Cameron attached to it it manages to be an extremely wellcrafted production none the less.The actors are great. Every one of them have absolutely unique and realistic character traits and the dynamism between the crew is superbly entertaining. Nancy Everhard as a softspoken female navy seal is played with humble sincerity and feminine sensitivity making for a very realistic package. Nia Peeples is the sexiest thing you ever saw and the one whose intuition foresees the whole thing. Miguel Ferrer is even more obnoxious here than in Twin Peaks yet also profoundly pitiable. Everybody gives an amazingly human and believable performance and the action and production values are overall perfectly adequate and effective succeeding entirely in suspending the viewer's disbelief.To the day I die I will maintain that this is a good movie. And posterity will prove me right. One day...9 out of 10.".

Yet Mr. Cunningham did do a few slightly more ambitious projects. This DeepStar Six is a semisuccessful underseamonster mash with surprisingly good acting decent special effects and a couple of good oldfashioned scary moments. The film deserves a reasonable rating slightly higher than all other lame and laughable Ridley Scott and James Cameron wannabes. The plot involves an 11headed crew that is about to finish up a 6month research at the bottom of the ocean. When exploring the ocean floor they accidentally stumble upon a hideous and relentless monster. Like it usually is the case in this type of films it takes a little while before you actually get to see the monster. By that time human stupidity already exterminated half of the cast. Granted the monster itself is one ugly critter and not at all badly put together by the special effects department. Butlet's not praise this film too much because it simply remains a rather anonymous 80's monster movie like we've seen them so many times before already. Not one action presented here isn't inspired by or similar to the ones featuring in other films and every character is a flawless stereotype. The performances given by the entire cast actually outshine the roles they're playing. Highlight of them all is Miguel Ferrer who portrays the typical cowardly crewmember. Constantly complaining and arguing at first and when the monster shows uphe flees to and leaves his colleagues to their own device. Every monster flick stars a bastard like that you know. As well as the superintelligent and overambitious female scientist and the heroic captain who sacrifices himself in order to save his crew. If you ignore these inevitable weaknesses you'll certainly have fun. You get what you expect and that doesn't necessarily have to sound like a bad comment.".

Fortunately it doesn't bog itself down like THE ABYSS by incorporating a tedious needless social statement in the final 45 minutes like Cameron's vastly overrated film. Be that as it may this is still a rather weak Bfilm with poor characterization and a bythenumbers plot.When a group of underwater workers disturb the lair of a sea creature the monster gets its revenge by destroying their base and snacking on the crew. The crew are all quite underdeveloped even the romantic leads of Greg Evigan and Nancy Everhard. SPOILER You know when characters are about to die because they'll start start talking about their New Hampshire farm like Cindy Pickett or greasy hamburgers like Matt McCoy.STORY  This isn't a bad story it just offers nothing new. The characterization is weak because it tries to forcefeed clichs. Miguel Ferrer plays the doofus Bill Paxton character of ALIENS and the romantic link between Everhard and Evigan is too weak for my money. None of the other characters are even moderately developed leaving the viewer with little invested in the people on the screen.ACTING  The acting wasn't the problem. Miguel Ferrer clearly gives the best performance in this film with his excellent slimy portrayal of Snyder the everpickedupon handyman eager to get topside. I thought Nia Peeples and Nancy Everhard should have changed roles because Everhard's character was a toughasnails Navy officer and Nancy although she clearly got into solid shape for the role looks more like a schoolmarm than a soldierPeeples on the other hand has the hard body for a female Navy officer but her line readings were way too fast. I felt like whenever Nia had a line I had accidentally hit the fast forward button. The other actors were fine. Evigan is okay as the male lead and Matt McCoy does a solid job as the goofoff. Ferris Bueller's mom Cindy Pickett gives a solid performance as the base's medical officer and Marius Weyers is great as always. His character really needed to be more developed though.NUDITY None but no female cast member wears a bra in this movie. They didn't quite adhere to their packing list before departing on this sixmonth deployment.".

S Cunningham Friday the 13th which came out the same time as the overblown but dull 'The Abyss' and for me the best of the three 'Leviathan'.Fairly routine stuff but still it has it's moments of sheer excitement.

The script had its tedious spots of state the bloody obvious comments but it's mostly bearable with some added wit provided by McCoy's character.The direction by Cunningham is solid with some nice touches of suspense created and not forgetting a couple of gory moments that truly standout. While the plot is reasonable it still follows your usual monster on the loose formula though the idea of the creature's origin was interesting but it definitely could have been explored in to more. Though other than a seamonster causing trouble for the underwater crew they also face human foolishness and a leaking laboratory base with some of the crew falling victims to themselves than the monster.The pace can be slow at times though that does help add tension and it definitely picks up in the last 40mins when the monster actually fully appears. While the special effects and the monster itself is fair and it does look a bit like the monsters from 'Tremors' and add a bit of crab too but it does look more ridiculous and very rubbery when the whole design appears on screen I was hoping that they would keep it mostly hidden e.g. 'Jaws' but overall it's not too distracting.Well have I gone soft as this discreet seamonster film has definitely improved on my second viewing?".

It came out around the same time as The Abyss  Levaithan but I really think it is a good film by itself. I think obviously that The Abyss was the best of the three and Leviathan the worst but DeepStar Six is sort of like that middle child that really gets ignored. It really blows my mind that Leviathan is rated higher than this movie and probably only because it had a bigger budget.There are uniformly good performances throughout this film and decent enough specialeffects though they are rather dated. The music is well composed and it has a fairly believable story so why the low ratings?".

He doesn't have a chimp sidekick here though. In fact there are a whole bunch of people who filmgoers will recognise if not be able to put a name to. But the real star is Miguel Ferrer who has a kind of HudsonfromAliens role. He gets increasingly manic as the film progresses until he finally loses it totally. The movie is worth watching for him alone!The plot is the usual science tampering with nature deal and the ensuing onslaught of nature on science. Nothing remarkable. Nothing that isn't predictable. The creature however is refreshingly different and done well enough with the effects of the day to not look pathetic in this age of CGI.As I mentioned there are some dodgy plot holes and physics but the movie entertains enough that you can overlook them for the most part and just enjoy it.All in all a film worth a look in on a quiet day.".

Which it is funded by the navy is expected to perform scientific studies as well as install an underwater nuclear missile silo. On a routine job two of the crew members on the small submarine blasted the cave open. They decided to explore it but they encounter the unknown. When a large mysterious creature attacked the underwater ship and killed the two crew members instantly. Since this creature is attractive to light this thing decides to attack the crew of the ocean floor station.Directed by B movie producerSean S. Cunningham Friday the 13th Spring Break made an entertaining lowbudget adventure with some cheap thrills. The cast do their best with this material but it is Ferrer gives the only memorable performance in this cheap feature. Some people prefer this one over Leviathan but I think Leviathan is better made much superior cast and special effects are superior to DeepStar Six. The look of the creature is not bad the best thing in Cunningham's direction. He only used the creature in some key sequences and the monster only appears in the movie for a couple of minutes.DeepStar Six should have had an large budget what i felt hurts the movie are the underwater sequences are not very convincing. It seems to me that Cunningham worked hard on a low budget and he did his best to cover the flawed production values. It seems that Mario Kassar and Andrew Vanja from Carolco Pictures only give Cunningham an 10 million budget or less. I felt the script was good and Harry Manfredini Best known for Friday the 13th movies gives an good music score probably his best work. I felt the cast seemed out of place expect for Ferrer but they did their best.I would love to watch this movie in Widescreen since the region 1 DVD's are only Full Screen. Maybe in a future Bluray release we can finally watch it in the original Widescreen aspect ratio of 2.351.This is a update from March 25 2013. I track down the Region 2 DVD from eBay. DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen 2.351 transfer and Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound is quite good. DVD also includes an rather dull commentary track by the filmmakers two featurette original theatrical trailer and photo gallery.As a B movie it works but fails as a A level production. Since Carolco Pictures are better known for their big budget productions. As a Guilty Pleasure DeepStar Six is entertaining. It is memorable for Miguel Ferrer's standout supporting performance and an surprisingly good Harry Manfredini score. Certainly an interesting double feature with Leviathan for one night's viewing. Super 35.  .".

A rival studio rushing into production a similarly themed lesser film to cash in on the free publicity of the other film. It's been going on for decades and isn't going to stop.In 1989 we got TWO cuckoo films trying to cash in on the release of James Cameron's much anticipated 'The Abyss.' One was 'Leviathan' and the other was 'Deep Star Six.' While it would be impossible for either of the two to even be in the same league as 'The Abyss' 'Leviathan' was an enjoyable cuckoo film. It had a fantastic A list cast a scary build up and quality FX. 'Deep Star Six' had... Miguel Ferrer.That's the major problem with 'Deep Star Six' it's doesn't fail because it never even tries on any level. For example 'Leviathan's limited budget required them to film dry for wet for its underwater shots which it did surprisingly well. 'Deep Star Six' ONLY HAS ONE 30 SECOND UNDER WATER SHOT! That's right an under water scifi action film which only has one under water scene! The plot a deep ocean under water base... well they never really explain WTF there is a giant under water base. They only mention something about it being a nuclear missile site for the Navy or something.Unlike 'Leviathan' the characters are extremely forgettable and the cast is totally devoid of any namable stars save Miguel Ferrer whom is terribly miscast in his role. The only other three actors I recognized were Greg Evigan 'My Two Dads' 'PSI Love You' 'Tek War' Matt McCoy husband in 'Hand That Rocks The Cradle' and Elya Baskin token Russian guy in EVERY MOVIE.I looked up the filmographies of the other actors just in case I missed anyone. Nope. They've barley done any other work.Their mini subs are attacked by a sea monster or so we're told. Remember there's only one under water shot in the beginning so we never actually see the monster under water or the destruction its blamed for.The monster eventually gets inside the base and this is another example of 'Deep Star Six' not even trying as Matt McCoy being cut in half is NEVER SHOWN! In one shot he's alive in the next he's cut in half. Maybe the monster is innocent? So far we haven't seen it cause any of the deaths. In fact we haven't even seen the deaths! When we finally see the monster it's bigger than an elephant which begs the question how the hell did it get inside and how does it later fit through airlocks the size of manhole covers?The surviving crew members do the only sensible thing and close the airlock thus trapping the monster inside the base! While the airlock was leaking water they'd already decided to abandon the base anyway so what would one flooded room matter? Anyway five crew members escape the room alive. Alright so letter lock the door and NEVER go in that room ever again! At this point the film reminds us that they will decompress and evacuate the base in four hours. Good! Just leave the monster alone for four hours and they'll never have to see it ever again!!! Of course they go back into the room!!! What's the worst that could happen? Thus the monster causes more death and destruction. Maybe it just wants out? Open the airlock and let it out!As I said there's nothing to hate about 'Deep Star Six' except how little it tries. It was a cuckoo project to begin with that really comes in a distant third behind 'The Abyss' and 'Leviathan.'".

Since it has 5.2 rating on IMDb I actually think it's truly underrated and good underwater film. I can see why a lot of people disliked it because they couldn't accept that the way it's a rip off of Alien. But just because it's a ripoff doesn't mean this movie a bad. First off I loved it even when the alien or the monster appeared in like 34 minutes. It has a great characters the atmosphere the editing the setting. It has no much plot but it was all that entertaining and just interesting film.My rating 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an enjoyable show about an ocean floor mission which uses welldelivered wellmade ships and machinery props. The show tries to be realistic in a successful way. For instance there is truly a danger from too high an increase of atmospheric pressures under water that will infect the bloodstream and cause a person to literally collapse from not equalizing his inner body pressure with the outside sea pressure. This was used effectively here in the movie. The movie is presented in a mood of suspenseful dread illuminated by a ray of hope for the crew's survival like many good edgeofyourseat thriller flicks. The acting showed this intensity okay. It features as one of the members Snyder played by Miguel Ferrer who seems to be disturbed and almost neurotic. He causes mishaps which leads the others to compounded disaster after the monster is known to be lurking somewhere around. There is a violent death of just about everyone and their trapped condition worsens progressively. It seems like the blame for the lost cause of their mission should and was put on Snyder and his actions as being the real detriment to the crew. I think this presents the main monster problem in an effectively scary way. I did feel that some of the scenery underwater was pretty and improved the movie. This film was an adventurous and entertaining show with a cast which included some attractive women although they played not as sex symbols but more influential roles comparable to their male counterparts. Watch this movie for unexpected disaster imposed on a seemingly normal sea quest!".

	schema:reviewBody "What got me excited about this movie was the crew Sean Cunningham Jim Isaacs and Henry Manfredini have all been involved with the Friday the 13th series of movies. Given that they're top of my list of 'chilled night in' movies and keep me warm at night so to speak the idea of a nonJason movie with these fellas working on it pricked up my ears.The movie is actually quite similar in feel to their other significant works in that it's tense well scored and at times quite bloody. You'll certainly be sucked into the movies atmosphere. What also helps is that unlike many other films of this genre the script and acting are tight so much so that you really don't want the characters to die a change from the normal 'you're so dumb I hope you get a pitchfork in the neck' line of thinking most suspense horrors take.The creature I won't describe it heavily as it's a big part of the movie and knowing what it looks like etc might spoil it a bit is quite a piece of work doing the unthinkable and managing to sneak up on people underwater despite being one of the largest beasts I've seen in a movie for quite some time. Several times I jumped out of genuine shock at its attacks.So as you can tell I really liked this film so why the 7 out of 10 shouldn't it be a 9 or 10? Well it has its shortcomings. The SciFi aspect of the movie is quite underdeveloped which is a shame as the production design is excellent and I wish a little more had been done with it than just creating an underwater haunted house. Also the movie has not aged well at all. Certain sections largely due to the budget so I don't really blame them look like they've been lifted straight out of Stingray. I can't help but feel that most of the budget was sunk into the creature I tell you now though it has paid off in spades. All of this unfortunately makes the movie a little patchy to watch hence the 7.".

Okay DeepStar Six is a little dull but once the monster pops up it isn't that bad. Visually I think it's fine and although the special effects look slightly premature and clearly a lot of smallscale models have been used I actually prefer this over the clinical and steely looking computer tricks pulled by canonized Industrial Light and Magic.To compare this film to Fantastic Voyage 1966 may be way out of line but still DeepStar Six reminded me of that somewhat ridiculous film in which a scientific crew and their vehicle are shrunk in order to explore the human body. Little human bodies are saved in DeepStar Six and that is a bit of a waste since the cast is good and especially the female contributions by Nia Peeples Nancy Everhard and Cindy Pickett are swell. Greg Evigan makes a nice lead and he has the right looks for his heroic part. Thank God or Cunningham they did not cast a bull like Steven Segal or Chuck Norris for this part for that would have spoiled everything. A pleasant surprise is the presence of Marius Weyers who played in the wonderful classic The Gods Must Be Crazy. Not at his best here but I don't mind. Camera and lighting are done in such a way that the interior of the ship as well as the atmosphere look pretty authentic and Sean S. Cunningham has done a fine job in making his actors move around in it naturally and convincingly. Not a masterpiece but I am pleased to see a film like this from a man who has done much worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film is essentially a filmed record of the live theatre production by the Royal Shakespeare Co. that toured to New York in the late 1960's and was filmed for Art House distribution by Universal.This is one of my alltime favorite films because of the sheer density of meaning in it.  The story is set in an asylum in 1808 in the Napoleonic era and the play within it is set in 1793 during the most violent part of the French Revolutionary era.  Most of the dialogue has relevance to political criticism in both eras.  If that were not enough it also has levels that are clearly evoking the era that the playwright Weiss was writing in the 1960's and also Germany's recent HolocaustWWII past.  Some passages in the play most notably those relating to war manage to have a level of meaning for ALL FOUR eras at once!  Because I show this film to classes I've seen it dozens of times and I'm continually intrigued by it because each viewing reveals new meanings as it seems to weirdly comment on the current day's events that occurred long after it was written and filmed.  The first viewing is often disorienting because it piles so much historicsociosexualpolitical content up with so much odd directing and extreme acting style that it is hard to grasp at first but repeated viewings suck you in like an intellectual's Rocky Horror Picture Show and some theatre junkies learn to sing along.The Film of the Royal Shakespeare Company production of MaratSade 1967 is considered a classic avant garde 1960's drama in the style known as Theatre of Cruelty. It is often shown to university level theatre classes because it has wonderful examples of both Artaud and Brecht theatre styles in it.  I show it to my classes and it never fails to blow their undergraduate minds.  It stars Glenda Jackson as Charlotte Corday now Dame Glenda Jackson MP Ian Richardson of House of Cards fame as Marat and Patrick Magee Clockwork Orange as de Sade.As the title implies the film is entirely a playwithinaplay where most cast members depict both a character from the French Revolution as well as an insane asylum inmate playing that character. While the film like the later comedydrama about deSade Quills addresses censorship it is primarily concerned with a debate between Marat as a sort of representative of revolutionary radical communism and de Sade as a nihilistic existentialist frustrated with his own and society's violently cruel urges as well as the futility of revolutionary action to improve mankind.Despite this very heavy and multilayered topic the film also manages to be both sexy and funny in regular intervals. Great moments include a comic orgy scene where the inmates sing What's the point of a revolution without general copulation? in a round like rowrowrow your boat and mime a vigorously improbable group sex event fully clothed Magee's various speeches on the nature of man What we do is but a shadow of what we want to do...  Richardson's unblinking intensity as he waits for the knife to kill him and Jackson doing a little dance trying to capture the knife from de Sade while he teases her with it in an effort to get her in his arms. Add to this the delightful theatricality and musical numbers yes there are many musical numbers! and it is little wonder that the play on which the film is based has regularly been performed all around the world ever since it was written.".

So I took advantage of it and rented the movie. And this is what I found within it...Never before has a title been so self explanatory. It serves as the film's plot description.

And it is directed and acted in by a famous patient at the hospital The Marquis de Sade. It is performed to the Administrator and his family and many local citizens who care to watch. The point of the show is to prove that the hospital's rehabilitation methods are working but de Sade has a far more ambitious goal than that. And the play is constantly interrupted by the administrator who feels it should be more politically correct for the recent times. But after the second act the inmates have secretly taken over and he is forced just to watch in horror as are we...the audience.It is very hard to classify this film. At some points it is a drama. At other points it is a thriller mystery horror comedy and even musical the musical numbers are very strange. But for the most part it is a two hour history lesson. All the performances are excellent and haunting especially Glenda Jackson's performance. The film has a bizarre tone about it and is easily the most eerie film I have ever scene. When I called it a history lesson you might have lost interest right then. But all the actors especially the narrator who speaks only in rhymes looks directly into the camera as they speak. It is as if they are talking to you and as if you are the only one watching. This gives you the feeling that you must sit up and listen or they will be angry with you.MaratSade is the most unique and most ghostly film I have ever scene.

	schema:headline " Demanding Stimulating But Excessively Dry In Execution";
	schema:reviewBody "MARATSADE is the film version of a play that arose from an actor's workshop exploring various theatrical theories expressed by French actordirectorwriter Antoine Artard who extolled a style of performance he described as theatre of crueltywhich broadly speaking consists of an assault upon the audience's senses by every means possible. Ultimately and although it makes effective use of its setting and the cinematography mirrors the chaos expected of such a situation the film version of MARATSADE is less a motion picture than a record of a justly famous stage play that offers a complex statement re man's savagery.The story of MARATSADE concerns the performance of a play by inmates of an early 1800s insane asylum with script and direction by the infamous Marquis de Sade. While this may sound a bit farfetched it is based on fact de Sade was known to have written plays for performance by inmates during his own incarceration in an asylum. The story of the play concerns the assassination of the revolutionary Marat by Charotte Corday but the play itself becomes a debate between various characters all of which may be read as in some way intrinsically destructive and evil. Since all the characters are played by mentallyill inmates of the asylum the actor playing Marat for example is described as a paranoid and the actress playing Corday suffers from sleeping sickness and melancholia the debate is further fueled by their insanity unpredictability as performers and the staff's reactions to both their behavior and the often subversive nature of the script they play out.Patrick Magee as de Sade Glenda Jackson as the inmate playing Corday it was her breakout performance and Ian Richardson as the inmate playing Marat offering impressive performances indeed the ensemble cast as a whole is incredibly impressive and they keep the extremely wordy script moving along with considerable interest. Even so it will be obvious that the material works better as a live performance than as a film and I do not recommend it to a casual viewer its appeal will be largely limited to the literary and theatrical intelligentsia. The DVD includes the original theatrical trailer but beyond this there are no extras of any kind.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	onyx:emotionText "MARATSADE is the film version of a play that arose from an actor's workshop exploring various theatrical theories expressed by French actordirectorwriter Antoine Artard who extolled a style of performance he described as theatre of crueltywhich broadly speaking consists of an assault upon the audience's senses by every means possible. Ultimately and although it makes effective use of its setting and the cinematography mirrors the chaos expected of such a situation the film version of MARATSADE is less a motion picture than a record of a justly famous stage play that offers a complex statement re man's savagery.The story of MARATSADE concerns the performance of a play by inmates of an early 1800s insane asylum with script and direction by the infamous Marquis de Sade.

To commemorate the anniversary and to show off the hospital's own special brand of art therapy a group of inmates at Charenton Asylum perform a play recreating Marat's last days written and directed by the infamous Marquis de Sade. The players include a recovering paranoiac a narcoleptic also suffering from melancholia a sex maniac a former priest a former prostitute and a patient so incensed by his role that he is confined to a straightjacket the entire time. As the play progresses delving into the political and social unrest of the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror the players discuss and debate the purpose of revolution the horrors of war the futility of activism the need for equality the impossibility of equality the desire for freedom the importance of individuality and the relationship between murder and sexual passion. To start with.Oh and it's a musical too.This is a great movie. One of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding movies I've ever seen. Directed by Peter Brook and performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company it's a filmed version of Peter Weiss' play of the same name. It demands a lot of a viewer. Once it starts it doesn't give you much room to breathe. It just takes off running and you are forced to keep up with it. It's one of the few movies I've ever seen where I was agreeing and disagreeing with every main character at various points. It's almost too much to take in in one sitting. I've seen it several times and I still feel like there's more to get out of it. I knew next to nothing about the French Revolution going in but I still felt like I understood the issues at hand. They can just as easily apply to modern American society.The acting is uniformly excellent. The three main playersPatrick Magee de Sade Ian Richardson Marat and Glenda Jackson Cordayare all outstanding. Magee brings a unique humanity to a man largely considered by history to be a savage pervert. Richardson's Marat is heartbreaking. Endlessly staring ahead he knows his cause is probably lost but can't give up on it. Jackson is stunning as both the impassioned Corday and the patient desperately trying to spit out her lines before she falls asleep again. There isn't a note out of place in the whole cast. What I can't get over is that these actors had already performed these roles on stage umpteen times before they made the film. That they performed such a challenging play night after night with the same kind of talent intensity and passion you see on the screen is remarkable.MaratSade is definitely a polarizing film. I wasn't sure I liked it until the second time I watched it. But I couldn't stop thinking about it after the first. It's disturbing frightening funny and demanding sometimes all at the same time but in my opinion it's worth seeing at least once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brilliant in every way. A film of a play about a play put on by the inmates of the Asylum of Charenton in France 1808 as directed by the Marquis de Sade played by Patrick Magee. Filmed plays are often criticized for their staginess but this one quite requires that feeling. The actors are separated from the audience which appears from time to time by metal bars which also appear from time to time. Most of the film takes place in the middle of the play with the lunatics seeming dangerously in our faces. The man who runs the asylum sits on the side behind the bars and occasionally walks out onto the stage to calm his residents down or to castigate the Marquis for including certain undesirable notions in his play. The subject of the play is the nature and importance of human cruelty as demonstrated by the French Revolution which ended some 15 years earlier but which continues on even to the present far beyond the actual setting of the play. About a thousand ideas are thrown out throughout the film and it's difficult to catch them all. It's the kind of movie that sets the head reeling and it made me want to watch it again ASAP. The actors are all brilliant. Besides Magee Glenda Jackson deserves special praise for her performance as the narcoleptic inmate who plays the executioner of Marat. I didn't mention that other name in the title because I am unfamiliar with the historical character. I understood the gist of his role in the Revolution but I'd like to learn more before I rewatch the film. Peter Brook's direction is fantastic he kept my heart rate up throught the entire film. I'm thinking about getting the DVD especially if it has subtitles. It is sometimes difficult to understand the dialogue and almost impossible to understand the song lyrics. Oh did I mention it was a musical? 1010.".

The theory behind this approach is that the patient by acting can understand his or her psychiatric disorder and through acting out their traumas they are supposed to get cured. It a method still used today by psychiatrists. The Marquis de Sade is there as a political prisoner and traces the history of the French Revolution in the play he has written.The viewer sits outside the bars of a large bathroom cell where the play is performed as part of the gentry who watch the play for entertainment. Charlotte Corday  played by Glenda Jackson Lost and Found in her starring film debut has narcolepsy  a condition characterized by brief attacks of deep sleep.  Corday wants to kill Marat  because of something that happened to her mother. Marat was one the leaders of the French Revolution and contacted a skin disease while hiding in the sewers of Paris. He had to remain in the bath tub to keep his skin moist and had a nurse to care for him. Marat controlled the revolution by writing orders in his bathtub and then sending them out. Corday at the end of the play murders Jean Paul Marat in his bath tub with a dagger.Interwoven throughout the play is the Marquis the Sade's interpretation of the French Revolution. The asylum warden his wife and his daughter are inside the bathroom cell with the inmates.  The warden is constantly trying to maintain order and objecting to what the Marquis de Sade has put in the play.  The inmates also interact with the warden's wife and daughter in many funny ways. There is one scene where the inmates pretend to be using a guillotine to cut off heads.  When they cut commoners heads off they pour something red in a bucket but when they cut  the king's head off they pour blue blood in the bucket. Three of my favorite characters in the movie are a trio of people two men Kokol and Cucurucu and a woman in clown makeup who act as narrators and comic relief.This movie is rated R but there is nothing really in the movie that justifies the rating. The only sexy scene is when Corday whips the Marquis de Sade with her hair.  One other character is a sex maniac who can't keep his hands off Corday.This is a very interesting movie but is hard to follow. I have the tape and a copy of the screenplay but I am under the impression that historians who specialize in the French Revolution should have a better understanding of this ultra intellectual plot. It is a screenplay that is very hard to understand. Perhaps because those people are crazy and are showing their perception of a  reality that in my view would be different in the eyes of an average person.  By the way the actual title of this movie is The Persecution and Assassination of JeanPaul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade. A quote There is no revolution without general copulation copulation copulation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Brook for many years the artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company has more than once astounded the theater world with his interpretations of familiar plays by Shakespeare and others. Here's the chance for moviegoers to witness his transformative skills in action. MaratSade which I'd seen previously on stage is a Brechtian political drama about the French revolution performed in a madhouse under the direction of the notorious Marquis de Sade. Brook's retelling takes advantage of the setting by emphasizing the particular insanities of the major players. Marat portrayed by Ian Richardson is coldly rational except when he's not. Patrick Magee's de Sade reflects that personality's obsession with cruelty. But the real brilliance of Brook's choices is captured best by Glenda Jackson who appears as a victim of narcolepsy cast in the role of Charlotte Corday Marat's assassin. Jackson's character can barely rouse herself to perform. She's confused. Her diction is odd. She's not convincing as Corday nor is she supposed to be. She's thoroughly convincing however an insane person playing someone who is obsessed with Marat. Other brilliant performances are turned in by Michael Williams as the Herald who announces key scenes Robert Landon Lloyd as Roux a cleric turned revolutionary who is seen most of the time in a straitjacket because of his violent behavior John Steiner as Monsieur Depere a sexual predator who lusts after Jackson's Corday and a quartet of three men and a woman in comedia del' arte garb who comment on the action in song and verse.It is a bizarre film difficult to watch at times but brilliant in its execution. I do not believe there is another director alive or dead who could have done what Brooks did with this script and this talented group of actors. Too bad he didn't do more movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film and play were especially popular in the 60s because at that time you could get an audience by promising lots of violence and sex on stage although this movie is mild compared to the current crop. MaratSade became one of those things that the in crowd had to claim to have seen.

Jean Paul Marat is ultimately vilified for the people he killed just as the Black Panthers the Weathermen the Yippies and other groups and in the end regardless that their actions hurt more than they helped everyone was trying to do their best for the people. I mean to say Marat is a pathetic character condemned by nature to suffer his last days with a debilitating skin disease. In the case of the 60s radicals we have been condemned to see the world we envisioned turn away from our ideals and turn us into caricatures and stand up routines. At least those of us who didn't wind up going to prison or dying outright. The play is wonderful and speaks truth through the mouths of those condemned to an insane asylum. We are forced to reevaluate our notion of insane.".

I'm not going to pretend that I understand what this is about aside from the basic premise about a bunch of inmates putting on a play and I do know it was based on a stage play. Still I watched all 2 hours. The acting is great across the board but Magee Ian Richardson and Glenda Jackson in her major film debut are exceptional. The movie is disturbingI realize these are all actors playing roles but they're so good that you believe everything you're seeing. The direction also is masterfulit opens up the play cinematically. It has an R rating but that's mostly for subject matter and a brief nude scene with Richardson. This isn't for everybodysome people will be bored silly by itbut for those who like challenging movies this fits the bill. The ending is very disturbing. I give it a 7.".

I'm sure some of Pakistani POWs are in India as well but let's focus on the movie. Full of actors. Some were stage actors like Raghubir Yadav Rajendra Gupta etc. Amitabh Bachchan who plays the role of a Major acted well. Akshaye Khanna did his part well. There was nothing for Amrita Rao to do than a few giggles and couple songs. I think Sanjay Dutt's role was most solid even though it wasn't too long. He acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive. If you compare it to LOC which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions if it HAD a story  Deewaar is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors. 7.510".

Yes the movie is mash of so many English POW Escape movies. But if that was the case why didn't the makers decide to choose one classic English POW and make a complete remake of it. Pakistani bashing  Oh my God!!!! Its so clumsy and cheesy that makes you wonder why it has been forced in such a gawdy manner. Guys  you need to watch Gadar and thats what I call classy Pakistani bashing.Romantic track  when do Bollywood filmmakers ever learn to do away with conventional moviemaking!!! AkshayeAmrita track is so very clich'd and aptly justifies the word forcefit.MarhabaMarhaba song  my personal opinion the latest Remix albums are much better. Milan Lutharia no but Sridhar Raghavan Yes I was expecting a lot from him. But as a writer he was a big downer. The script doesn't have holes it has craters!!!It looks like Milan Lutharia was in a hurry to finish the task at the earliest.

However the actor that really impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon not to be confused with the singer KK. In the scene where he first meets Amitabh's character I thought that a man who can just look at AB keep staring and not say a word and still look strong is definitely a good actor. In fact he has proved himself worthy again in Sarkar alongside AB for a second time. This guy should get more roles he's brilliant.If you've read any of the other reviews here on IMDb you already know the plot and I do agree that Akshaye Khanna's entry into Pakistan was a little too easy. And the little love angle he shared with what'sherface was completely unnecessary. But he is a fairly good actor as seen in DCH Sunjay Dutt is cool to watch always. and AB... what can I say. I don't know if I'm his biggest fan in the world but I know I can definitely compete for the spot.An interesting watch considering it's Bollywood although a bit inspired by Hollywood oldies like the Great Escape and Bridge on the River Kwai.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love Amitabh Bachchan he is a big star who has a good actor sometimes super good in him too. Yet after his return from the short retirement at the start of the 1990s he used to make a bunch of movies per year where one is good and the rest is not ! Typical I think for a man who wants to be in business all the time. In 2004 he made 11 movies at least Deewaar wasn't one of their worst ! The movie's intro was so impressive and engaging. It promised me with real great work. And to tell you the truth the movie was kind of entertaining but why after its ending it collapsed easily ?! Now this is a movie which wants to handle the issue of the Indian internees in Pakistan and how they're victims of both sides. So the personal solution is the only way. But the treatment of the whole thing made it as another B movie with the good and bad meanings of the term. Despite that everything and everyone looked serious it was handled usuriously. All the characters were just stereotypes without any possible deepness. There was some naivety behind a lot of the events. So ultimately the movie was superficial more than simple.Observe carefully Sanjay Dutt's character seemed at first as the perfect opportunist selfish who could literally run over the dead bodies of his fellow prisoners just to flee. Then SUDDENLY he became that faithful altruist patriotic who sacrificed his own life for the others and cried to not be buried in Pakistan ??!! Then this lame sadistic warden ? What's his story ? And why he is fornoreason a forever evil ? But originally why to answer all of that since he is here as the B movie's villain ! Moreover Akshaye Khanna as the son aside from being so pale and noncharismatic his role was so empty to the utmost what's his work beside being a saver ?! For a moment I imagined that he was an officer in his country's government who got angry and resigned for doing what that government's law unable of but none of my reveries was true. Bachchan was just an angry old man and the genius presence would solve the rest. He was a character without any particulars nor history. As a whole this movie had no real humans rather characters in a cartoon where Mickey is good Pete is bad and Goofy is goofy ! Extra annoying points  How the son sneaked into the enemy's country ? How he knew already that his father has been transported to another prison ? And the Indian prisoner who was hiding under the Pakistani military car while the transporting what did he intent to do anyway ? Though still the strongest Mumbo Jumbo here was the storyline of the traitorous what a lousy one ! It makes you ask eagerly  if he was that long time rat then why he didn't inform about the whole matter of the tunnel from the start ??! There is a clear general irony about it as it has some attractive moving plot however with hasty dealing. It isn't lazy in making action though it is in making the rest. For instance what could be the difference between someone who was never in a Pakistani prison knowing nothing about its life's details and the one who wrote this movie??! Totally NOTHING ! Sure the script lacked distinctive details to separate the movie from other movies such as The Great Escape to have its own personality be more original and live longer among its likes.The love story between the Indian boy and the Pakistani girl could have been one of the highest points of the script representing the peaceful tone of the movie and epitomizing implied message about circumstances made this love impossible. But sorry that line had been epitomized itself ! I extremely loved the first sequence. The prisoners' anthem. The respectable always intense performance of Bachchan despite that the role didn't give him what could make it one of his finest indeed. The smart enjoyable and technically dexterous directing of Milan Luthria it got wonderful moments but the best of them was the scene of hanging one of the Indian prisoners as the new prison's reception that was one memorable piece of cinema to the extent of being a visual poetry.Deewaar determined to be the commercial Indian movie. So no wonder that everything was just hot moment after another no wonder that there was an erotic number and no wonder that Bachchan's character killed the warden brutally at the end while it would've been better if he was kept alive taken to India as an internee and tasted an equal portion of his torture. But who said anything about sane ending it is A BOLLYWOOD FLICK where all the good Indians must triumph all the evil Pakistanis must go to hell and all the audience must come out of theaters happy entertained and satisfied. Just thank god that it didn't contain  700 songs forced melodrama superfluous comedy or overthetop acting.It's above average as an action movie. But needed less shallowness and more authenticity to be a great one.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems so much like rhetoric that the minute it begins you already know how it is going to end. The only thing you might not be able to guess are the people who are going to die and in which order they do so.Amitabh Bachchan plays an army major who along with over three dozen Indian soldiers are trapped in Pakistani prisons and are all presumed dead. It's not like India doesn't want to recover them it's that's for 33 years Pakistan has maintained that they do not have any Indian soldier prisoners. Ranvir Kaul Bachchan desperate and determined not to die on Pakistani soil has tried to escape from the death camp 17 times all unsuccessful attempts until one day when he sabotages a routine trip and allows one of his fellow soldier who is also bearing a letter to escape. The man makes it into the slums of Pakistan and is helped by a fellow Hindustani but dies before he can be nursed back to health. Before he dies he hands his good Samaritan a letter which is then sent to India to alert the military that their soldiers are still alive. The government is hesitant to take the letter as authentic but when Gaurav Kaul played by Akshaye Khanna hears of this he vows to his mother that he will go to Pakistan and bring his father home. Thus begins a tumultuous descent to the depths of despair as he slowly becomes a rebel with a cause. Upon reaching Pakistan he traces the origin of the letter to the person who sent it and when he arrives at the man's home he meets a girl named Radhika played by Amrita Rao who is also the man's daughter. Naturally she falls in love with him but he keeps his focus on his plans. When upon the 19th prison break a mysterious stranger named Khan played by Sanjay Dutt escapes and is rescued by Gaurav signs of hope begin to materialise. The best part of the film for me is surprising not the liberation of the soldiers but the song and dance that occurs between Gaurav and Radhika one of the rare songs in the film which is also a highlight of the film. Amrita Rao looks so heavenly in this song and the playback singer matches her so perfectly that you would believe she is the one actually singing the song. The worst part of the film is the fact that Gaurav leaves her behind in Pakistan after all the bad luck he brings upon her all in the name of saving his own father. I mean what sort of fate did he bestow upon the poor girl by leaving her behind after fracturing her life?".

Finally a superhero movie you can relate to instead of everything being all high and mighty on morals and super powers.Defendor had it all comedy action drama and romance. What made this movie unique was the blend of genres which works really well. Initially I thought it was just a spoof of superhero movies but Defendor is so much more than that.The characters in the movie are real and believable. Hats off to Woody Harrelson for his marvelous performance as Arthur  Defendor. This role really showed off Woody's acting talents. I think we can all see parts of ourselves in the Defendor character and that is what makes this movie so powerful so gripping and so entertaining.And also to Elias Koteas for his role as the corrupt policeman and Kat Denings as her role of a young woman in drug abuse and harsh life situation. And the supporting roles were nicely portrayed as well.The story told in Defendor easily picks you up and keeps you tight. It is really good and you can place yourself in that story. It is very believable and leaves you very entertained.I was thoroughly entertained from start till end. Lots of good action really good and solid story and spectacular acting. This is definitely a keeper a movie with enough value to be watched more than once.".

	schema:headline " Clever parody juxtaposed with intriguing selfreflexive darkness  an inspired revision of the superhero myth";
	schema:reviewBody "Given the recent onslaught of superhero films hitting theatres it would seem only natural to anticipate parodic responses to the genre sending up its excesses and sillier elements. On the surface it would appear that debut director Peter Stebbings' Defendor is exactly such a film casting Woody Harrelson's oddball everyman as a surrogate crimefighter and exploiting his antics for humour in the vein of 1999's Mystery Men. And initially this is the approach the film itself appears gearing up to take opening with a hysterical spoofing of overblown superhero film clichs including rooftop billowing fog high contrast city lights against nighttime darkness and larger than life acrobatic feats always check the garbage days moans a wounded Defendor after leaping off a rooftop into a dumpster recently emptied of garbage to cushion his fall. Such astute genre awareness combined with the wonderfully imaginative collection of Defendor's makeshift crimefighting weapons including the most inspired use of marbles seen in ages could easily have assured for an hour and a half of lighthearted enjoyable cinematic fun. But Stebbings' film has grander ambitions than a mere surface level parody which subtly unfold as the film progresses. As the laughs slowly become fewer and fewer Defendor's narrative becomes steadily more engrossing settling on a tone pitched halfway between exhilarating crimemystery thriller and poignant character study as the viewer is led increasingly to question Defendor's mental stability and even the ethics of his imbalanced war against injustice. While such transitioning between tones could prove a dangerous stumbling ground Stebbings is careful to distinguish between his darker themes and moments of levity utilizing dashes of all too real violence to savagely undercut the fantasy or parodic elements. For all Defendor's silliness it certainly packs a brutal punch when necessary. Of course being the work of a first time director one would expect the occasional fumble and Stebbings' film does lose its way for a period nearing the climax meandering somewhat and losing its rhythm. Nonetheless an emerging subplot musing on the roots and importance of heroism clearly borrowing amply from Christopher Nolan's recent two Batman reboots among other sources which could have been the clumsiest addition to the movie actually emerges as surprisingly tasteful and functional adding more nuance and complexity to the unfolding film without coming across as excessively pretentious. Completing the package is the wonderfully grandiose musical score by John Rowley managing to perfectly encompass each tonal shift whether gleefully riffing on superhero musical motifs or offering something more profound and honest either way adding welcome depth and volume to a film already far from lacking in either. The casting of Woody Harrelson as the titular hapless crimefighter also proves a stroke of genius as Harrelson's naturally wacky yet powerful charisma exemplifies the essence of the film beautifully blending childlike emotional simplicity tenacious determination and enough flat out weirdness to make it all ring true as well as an inspired ripoff of Christian Bale's now iconic Batman voice. Kat Dennings is equally delightful to watch as a young prostitute who may be either befriending or manipulating Defendor warping her naturally quirky and spunky energy into something darker yet just as resonant. Elias Koteas essays antagonistic clichs with the utmost grotesque skill as a crooked cop and Michael Kelly reconciles a weakly written role with a gruff credibility as Defendor's employer and solitary friend. Finally Sandra Oh is superb in her few scenes as Defendor's psychological examiner infusing impressive dramatic tension with moments of deadpan humour and bringing welcome life to the film.It would be easy to compare Defendor as a film to its protagonist slightly cumbersome and prone to stumbling at times yet cleverly selfaware comical yet with layers of unexpected darkness and overall encompassed by such an infectious sense of classic cheesy charm that it is near impossible not to love in the end. Whether taken as a superhero parody straight out superhero film or character study or ultimately all three Defendor proves a highly enjoyable success and one easily worth a watch.7.510".

The casting of Woody Harrelson as the titular hapless crimefighter also proves a stroke of genius as Harrelson's naturally wacky yet powerful charisma exemplifies the essence of the film beautifully blending childlike emotional simplicity tenacious determination and enough flat out weirdness to make it all ring true as well as an inspired ripoff of Christian Bale's now iconic Batman voice. Kat Dennings is equally delightful to watch as a young prostitute who may be either befriending or manipulating Defendor warping her naturally quirky and spunky energy into something darker yet just as resonant. Elias Koteas essays antagonistic clichs with the utmost grotesque skill as a crooked cop and Michael Kelly reconciles a weakly written role with a gruff credibility as Defendor's employer and solitary friend. Finally Sandra Oh is superb in her few scenes as Defendor's psychological examiner infusing impressive dramatic tension with moments of deadpan humour and bringing welcome life to the film.It would be easy to compare Defendor as a film to its protagonist slightly cumbersome and prone to stumbling at times yet cleverly selfaware comical yet with layers of unexpected darkness and overall encompassed by such an infectious sense of classic cheesy charm that it is near impossible not to love in the end. Whether taken as a superhero parody straight out superhero film or character study or ultimately all three Defendor proves a highly enjoyable success and one easily worth a watch.7.510";

Woody did a very good job on this film. I can see by his performance that he enjoyed making it and I enjoyed watching him.I was disappointed in Woody Harrelson's previous acting in the 2012 monstrous mess where he painfully overacted and seemed to be telling the audience that it was all a bad joke. Defendor made up for that.Woody proved that you don't have to have expensive greenscreen special effects to make a good movie. It can be done with acting talent. Thank you Woody!

Sancho Panza is replaced by a saner but similarly pliant crackaddict Kat and Rosindante is supplanted by his 'defendog' mobile.There are other similarities the movie has with D.

	schema:reviewBody "My God Woody Harrelson is on top of his game and is on a roll this past couple of years. I was very excited to see this movie it looked like it would be fun. Not to mention I am a huge Batman fan only Christopher Nolan's dark versions. Bruce Wayne is a billionaire and he can afford to be the superhero but how could a normal man be a superhero vigilante? Defendor is the answer  one has to be an extremely justice minded and fearless person but not so naive as Arthur Poppington in this movie he uses marbles instead of guns his batmobile is a jacked up truck and he uses lemon juice as acid! I thought I would at the very least smile through the film with the bumbling Defendor who took himself far too seriously but ended up shedding a few tears. The acting and the settings are incredibly realistic I loved this movie.During the day Arthur Poppington Woody Harrelson is a normal man even if slightly naive to the workings of the world working in the construction industry. During the night time he transforms into his alterego Defendor protecting the streets from thugs. The city has a problem with thugs and nobody is prepared to stand up and fight for themselves. The police are slow to catch the wrongdoers and Arthur has a huge willpower to do what he can to help the people. He helps Kat Kat Dennings one night from Dooney  when she really didn't need any help  she was a hooker. Dooney Elias Koteas is a corrupt cop in the police force and he is in cahoots with a Serbian mob boss. Arthur has been searching for Captain industry all his life as he had killed his mother. Kat and Arthur become friends and Defendor goes after Captain Industry knowing that there is a very high chance of dying or getting arrested.Director Peter Stebbings has made a classic film which will be remembered for ages to come. The dialogues are simply awesome and the background score is very cheesy but it works. Although I was excited I didn't think I would like this film as much as I did. Woody Harrelson and Kat Dennings give amazing performances which broke my heart they have perfect chemistry. Arthur is a very childlike adult who thinks he can be a superhero and that guns are for cowards. He is very honest with everybody but bumbles up a police investigation in the matter of the mob boss. I rooted for his character all through and the climax was brilliant. He says to Kat I will see you on the moon and in that scene I really had some tears in my eyes. He fights for justice even when he is gravely wounded and talks like a real hero. Elias Koteas and Sandra Oh as the psychiatrist also gave good performances. Others worthy of mention are his little cousin and the cousin's dad Paul. Give this a chance and you just might end up falling in love with Defendor! 910".

Not to mention I am a huge Batman fan only Christopher Nolan's dark versions. Bruce Wayne is a billionaire and he can afford to be the superhero but how could a normal man be a superhero vigilante? Defendor is the answer  one has to be an extremely justice minded and fearless person but not so naive as Arthur Poppington in this movie he uses marbles instead of guns his batmobile is a jacked up truck and he uses lemon juice as acid! I thought I would at the very least smile through the film with the bumbling Defendor who took himself far too seriously but ended up shedding a few tears. The acting and the settings are incredibly realistic I loved this movie.During the day Arthur Poppington Woody Harrelson is a normal man even if slightly naive to the workings of the world working in the construction industry. During the night time he transforms into his alterego Defendor protecting the streets from thugs. The city has a problem with thugs and nobody is prepared to stand up and fight for themselves. The police are slow to catch the wrongdoers and Arthur has a huge willpower to do what he can to help the people. He helps Kat Kat Dennings one night from Dooney  when she really didn't need any help  she was a hooker.

It sucks you in with sharp dialogue and relatable characters who you definitely root for until the end. Not only all of that but the storymessage is beautifully done. Defendor isn't like other super hero movies though. It doesn't follow the same bland pattern we all know and love or hate. Arthur doesn't fly or have super powers. He is simply a guy in a makeup mask who protects people with homemade weapons he uses a jar of wasps among other things  whose purpose in life is to capture Captain Industry. Kat Debrofkowitz isn't your regular damsel in distress either. She is a young prostitute who first meets Arthur when he beats up Chuck Dooney for being a punk with a badge. The whole first half of the movie is being told through ArthurDefendor giving his deposition to Dr. Park explaining why he assaulted Mr. Debrofkowitz Kat's dad. There Kat knowingly lies to Arthur telling him Radovan Kristic played by A.C Peterson is Captain Industry  when he is in fact not  because she figures they both want revenge so it'd be a winwin. The second half is happening in real time.At the end when DefendorArthur gets shot I cry every single time. I can't help it and I rarely cry watching movies. Woody Harrelson and Kat Dennings make a great team. Elias Koteas plays the prefect badcopdouchebag. Sandra Oh is very believable in her role too. The whole cast did a stellar job but major props to Peter Stebbings for taking a washed up premise and making it fresh beautiful inspiring and for the ages.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is too bad that Woody Harrelson was nominated for best supporting actor for The Messenger he should have been nominated for best actor for this his role as a mentally unstable man who likes to pretend that he is a superhero called Defendor and who lives out his dream by actually fighting crime. There are some brilliantly funny and memorable moments in Defendor Oh no please not the lime juice! but this is not a comedy in the strictest sense. It's actually a pretty serious drama slash crime thriller. The only glaring flaw in Defendor is the character of Kat played by Kat a character who is much too together and with it to be a crack addicted prostitute but the wide range of emotion in her acting makes up for the implausibility of the writing she is dealing with. We almost want Defendor to go a little farther in his wacky vigilantism involving swarms of hornets and marbles but in some ways it's good that the movie doesn't stray too far away from reality. In fact we get the sense that Defendor isn't as crazy as everyone thinks he is that he's actually well aware that he's really just a normal guy play acting which makes his heroism all the more potent. Three cheers for Defendor!".

The plot is nothing amazing but the characters there's something to write home about. Harrelson and Elias Koteas are excellent adversaries. Sandra Oh does a fine job as Harrelson's shrink. Michael Kelly is also good. Kat Dennings rounds out some solid and surprising performances in this one.This is a believable story with believable characters. There is a little bit of everything in here. Drama. Comedy. Action. Defendor also has that little something that you can't put your finger on... probably the music and the overall direction.I hate to bring this down by voting it 7 while it's 7.3 but 7 is an accurate score here. Positives are mentioned above. Negatives include a lag in the middle and a hurried ending but this movie has some good messages and a fine cast. Defendor makes the audience feel like the characters around him  he grows on you. The best of the lot I rented. Recommended. 73100".

	schema:reviewBody "It may be a superhero satire but I think the mindset behind Defendor is closer to Forrest Gump. This movie wants to celebrate being dumb but it does so in a very stale dry fashion unlike Gump. Defendor has no heart or soul. I never got the sense that the makers put any effort into this. Instead they use a cute idea and hope that it's enough to sustain a viewer for a hundred minutes. the Defendor is a Don Quihote type. He is a mentally troubled individual who dislikes himself and the society he grew up in a society of crime to which he lost his mother a society that makes fun of him. As a means to make himself feel more accomplished he dressed up as a super hero and drives around the streets at night fighting drug criminals using a bat a handful of marbles and if necessary a squirt of lime juice.I can pin point a few good one liners early on but for the most part I find the Defendor to be a dud. Whenever it tries to be funny it feels random and contrived instead. Take for instance the use of marbles as a weapon? I would've liked to see something a little more clever considering that the intention is superhero satire. Maybe if he threw little plastic supermen instead.Another problem I have with the movie is the plastic style of acting. Nobody seems remotely involved in the project. Woody Harrellson is missing the fiery edge that made him so funny in Zombieland here he just feels childish. In fairness the script doesn't offer much character for anyone to work with and certainly not a lot of dialogue either. The climax feels rushed and cheap but by the time you get there you may not mind. Defendor is pretty boring and unacceptably lazy. No thought process has gone into this movie leaving the Defendor unfunny uncool and unfair to the viewers.".

	schema:reviewBody "A superhero movie is best when it subverts the genre itself like in Chronicle or Birdman. Defendor does just that. What happens when someone with a vulnerable mental state claims to be a superhero fighting Captain Industry? They are looked down upon. They are seen as harmless and pitiful. Until they start to take action. Then they need to be contained and get psychological help. This movie tries to shine a light  through the psychologist  on that vulnerability and shows us there's something noble even something pure in people who try to fight injustice. Woody Harrelson is in top form playing the protagonist Arthur aka. Defendor. His quest to defeat Captain Industry is a sobering and fruitless one but the public begins to care for him. Maybe just because of Athur's general naivety. A graffiti artist paints a wall with his portrait calling out to fight back. That's what this movie was about for me. Fight back. Fight the selfrighteous world who divide 'normal' people from those whore aren't according to some arbitrary measurement. Defendor is a warm eulogy for those defying normality and a subtle criticism on what is perceived as sane.".

It's not comedy. It's also not fantasy scifi or action.I would say Defendor is actually a drama. There are a few laughs anyone who fights baddies armed only with wasps and lime juice is always going to raise a chuckle but generally it's a characterfocused piece about Arthur who is a man with severe mental disabilities. He's also sick of being laughed at so he becomes a 'heroic' crimefighter by night called Defendor.I thought it was going to be funny but it is actually quite sad. Defendor wants to do the right thing and is a genuinely nice guy. That's what adds the pathos when he's repeatedly beaten up or exploited by a working girl who he befriends.I thought this was a great movie  hardly feelgood but deeper with more subtle black humour just don't expect a riproaring actionpacked laughaminute joyride.httpthewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk".

If it would be as glamorous as Forest Gump this movie would be a candidate for Oscar. I gave it a 710 because it's obvious lacks of glamor are being compensated by a touching story. Woody Harrison is great. It seems that he manages best to perform best for characters that are killersstupid. In conclusion definitely worth seeing.".

The bad reviews are due to people expecting comedy. This movie is NOT a comedy and shouldn't be judged on something it clearly isn't.Defendor is a seemingly ordinary guy who believes in justice. He's dead set on finding this metaphorical Captain Industry who he thinks is responsible for his mother's death. He befriends a prostitute named Kat all because she lies to him and tells him she knows Captain Industry when she's well aware he doesn't exist. She wants revenge Arthur belives her and with the money he's giving her for this information she can buy drugs. The beginning is Arthur explaining why he assaulted Mr. Debrofkawitz who macked on Kat. Her father assaulted her. He rightfully gets angry at this and busts up his dry cleaning business.The movie takes a turn when Dooney a sleaze bag cop uses Kat as leverage so Arthur doesn't talk about the illegal sex ring they're operating. At the end Defendor dies but his heroics keep him alive throughout town. He is known as the guy who wanted to clean up the city and make it a better place.This movie has charm. No fancy superpowers no elaborate stunts flying fights  just a normal guy with a homemade weapons and a makeup mask. It's a pretty old movie but it's definitely a golden one.".

To foil the US satellite launch the KGB plans to steal a topsecret remotely piloted stealth helicopter codenamed 'DART' being produced at a local university.  Because DART is so small it cannot be easily detected and therefore would be optimal for use in attacking the well defended USAF Saturn V at Vandenburg AFB.The hero and heroine of Defense Play are your classic allAmerican teenagers who get 'tangled' in the nefarious plot and decide to take down the bad guys.All in all Defense Play is a good halfdecent low budget film which might appeal particularly to the teens and follows in the fashion and style of such 80s films as Iron Eagle My Science Project Real Genius The Rescue and many others.  It serves as a good flashback to the days when low budget producers didn't have an F117 and tons of F117 stock footage to make as the centerpiece of all the action the official 'blow up plane' of the 80s was desert camoflauged F16s.Defense Play is an obscure film but well worth watching if you just want to kick back and have a few laughs.".

I was mostly interested in Defense Play because of Susan Ursitti. I had just watched Teen Wolf the night before and wondered where the likable Boof had gone. Defense Play was her next feature film. While Ursitti's dialogue was stilted she was still the most charming character of the lot.There are a few other seasoned 80's supporting actors peppered in here and there but most of the screentime is hogged by our generic hunk David Oliver. It's hard for people to sympathize with a spoiled athletic military college playboy but Oliver managed to be fairly tolerable while having everything.Other than Ursitti the poster art and plot were the true hooks for me full of 80s shticks. Airwolf meets Russian war games? Smartly budgetwise the movie features a radio controlled military drone gone amok and the jet stock footage that favors can buy.The plot was predictable and I knew who the secret bad guy was by the second act but the chuckle factor was pretty high.

This is the story of two teens one clearly too old to play a teenager thanks to that shirtless scene in the introduction of his character on an army base who stumble upon a Soviet plot to infiltrate an American weapons defense system by hiring posing as Americans in the program.I was expecting another War Games ripoff they don't tell you much about the teens' role in the plot synopsis on the box but was glad to learn it was not. Granted the story does make itself incredibly overt at times especially in the characters and the comic bookesque professor and most of his dialog but the movie is not too ridden with bad acting except from Susan Ursitti who adds to most of the cheesiness with some forced grief here and there implausible plot or cheap effects. In fact our protagonists are actually smart teenagers who do their homework well when it comes to dodging dangerous Soviet assassins. It's a bit of a ridiculous story in the same sense that Red Dawn was a ridiculous story about a handful of teenagers single handedly saving the world from terrorist destruction but done with just the right amount of favor towards the teen characters. This plus a wellpaced story for the most part makes this a betterthan average B80s movie. Most likely worth the time of energetic teenage boys but nostalgic fans may tolerate it...if this is the kind of story you enjoy.".

But lets start from the beginning Dei Mudder...  is made by five guys who know each other from school. One day they decided to make their own movie  just for fun and for themselves. Then it continued with 4 or 5 copies I think and a few months later it became the biggest hype in the German movie underground. Everybody between 15 and 27 knows this film or has heard of it. Youths find it hip to talk with the slang of the characters and their are also a lot of persons who know the dialogues from inside out. Dei Mudder... got some bad critics because its often said that it is hostile to foreigners. But when you watch this film you recognize exactly that this movie is only a satire and a parody. I personally think its the ideal party movie  invite some friends drink some beer and you will laugh so hard I promise!!! Although this film has got nearly no plot the special FX are home made and all is filmed with a handy cam. But Dei Mudder... takes his charm from the fact that everything looks so cheap and stupid. I know a lot of people who hate this film and say this shot could be done by everyone. Well they are probably right but the fact that a primitive work like this one reached such an immense success is nearly a phenomenon. And its one of the greatest honors for directorscript writeractor Simon Mora and his guys to be in the archives of IMDb!!! My rating Beyond heaven and hell...  Cult factor 101 .".

The duo who wrote this directed it and also acts in it is Simon Mora and Hardy Strohn. It was the first film for both and stayed the only film for Strohn while Mora kept making more movies about his trademark character Kermet Dnger. The quality of this 90minute film however is pretty much what you would expect from the title. It is amateurish trash and it becomes painfully obvious how everybody involved with this project lacks talent in writing camera work acting and filmmaking in general. It does look extremely amateurish and you know immediately that nobody working on this one was really experienced in film.Some people also if you look at the rating like it because it adds some charm that the ones who made this were still fresh and daring in their work but I cannot share this opinion. There was hardly any scene that I found only mildly funny and the humor is even way below Mario Barth level. The main actor playing an older lady in a costume is a joke that only works for one or two scenes and it becomes embarrassing quickly afterward. The only thing positive you can say is probably that the people who made this never wanted it to becomes as famous as it did. So the ones who are to blame are the fans who shared this complete garbage movie. I recommend you to stay far far away and I have zero interest to see Mora's followup projects. At least Strohn learned something from it. Watch something else instead.".

There are a couple of funny moments but without this cast the movie would have fallen apart its strictly formulaic approach and lack of any inspiration just being too obvious. It's not as bad as The Last Kiss but Braff should choose his options more wisely unless he wants his welldeserved Garden State acclaim to go down the drain.Recommended only for fans of the abovementioned stars the rest of you is not missing out on anything.".

What it does though in my opinion is keep the momentum of those two shows.When I watched this movie a second time I was not disappointed at all because truthfully The Ex is a fun little comedy that makes you chuckle and makes fast use of ninety minutes as opposed to being drawn out and slow.What makes this movie good is the actors. They're all superb Zach Braff is hilarious and you love to hate Jason Batemen's character. Charles Grodin's character was also particularly funny.If there were halves I'd give this movie a 7.5 but there isn't but let me tell you why I always start my movie grading at 9 and then add on an extra point if the movie is just jaw droppingly awesome. So for this movie I took of one point for the sole fact that while the actors were fine the script did not use them to their full potential. And then I also took off half a point because it seems like there was a lot more to the movie that was cut out.So there you go and a word to the wise get the Rated version the Unrated version is not nearly as good as the original.

Of course this is to play into the plot but it was too hard to believe after the beginning was set up so solidly. The result is a plot that cannot maintain it's credibility through to the end. It's a light film so this isn't the greatest of crimes.All in all it is enjoyable but it's middle of the road fare and certainly not worth the 8.1 rating that it is currently riding at. Rather somewhere between a five and a six depending on your perspectives and your mood. If you are rating this film higher go watch Zach in Garden State and rethink your rating.

	schema:reviewBody "If I were to look at it I would say The Ex aka Fast Track forms a loose trilogy of sorts with regards to growing up and somewhat like a natural progression in the different stages of life that Zach Braff's characters form when stringed together. With Garden State it's in the 20s where you're having a feel for the ground exploring your options and not knowing exactly what life will dish out to you.With One Last Kiss so you think that you're dead sure about your other half you're getting married and vowing to spend the rest of your lives together and suddenly an ingenue comes along and cast doubts about that.Plenty of whatwillyoudo moments with outcome that are different depending on your values but totally possible and brought out earnestly through Braff's performance as the everyday man. In The Ex Zach Braff plays the blue collar salaryman whose hotshot lawyer wife had just given birth and as agreed she'll be a stay home mum. But he just got fired from his job thus sending their agreement into red alert zone. Taking up his father in law's offer he uproots himself wife and baby and starts work in a new age advertising company only to meet up with his wife's ex.You'd come to expect the usual jokes about not fitting into a totally different corporate culture with its own idiosyncrasies conflict with the parents and the constant threat posed by the wife's ex Chip Sanders played by Jason Bateman which I bet almost every male would want to kill given his attitude and back stabbing nature. It's classic office politics at work as we root for the survival of Zach's Tom Reilly though at times you'd expect him to have a little more backbone and a little bit of smarts to survive the jungle out there.If that sounds a little like Meet The Parents it does. And it also is styled after Just Friends in the rivalry department where two guys do battle over a girl only that this time it's the third party up against a married couple. Though I'd say it again nothing beats riling you up when you see how the bastard at work gets away with almost everything and get incensed with his obvious intentions to bang his ex i.e. the wife.The flow of the movie did seem a little broken at times which I suspect that there were a lot more filmed than was put on screen perhaps saving them for the DVD release. The ideas injected into the movie were numerous but that made for the narrative feeling a little scattered. For instance Amanda Peet as the wife Sofia Kowalski didn't really have much to do except nurse the baby and be in some of the most trying comedic scenes such as the ones involving yoga.Fans of Braff will not want to miss yet another familiar performance and remember to stay tune during the credits for a coda as well as various bloopers some of which are genuinely funnier than the bits that made it to the movie.".

But he just got fired from his job thus sending their agreement into red alert zone. Taking up his father in law's offer he uproots himself wife and baby and starts work in a new age advertising company only to meet up with his wife's ex.You'd come to expect the usual jokes about not fitting into a totally different corporate culture with its own idiosyncrasies conflict with the parents and the constant threat posed by the wife's ex Chip Sanders played by Jason Bateman which I bet almost every male would want to kill given his attitude and back stabbing nature. It's classic office politics at work as we root for the survival of Zach's Tom Reilly though at times you'd expect him to have a little more backbone and a little bit of smarts to survive the jungle out there.If that sounds a little like Meet The Parents it does. And it also is styled after Just Friends in the rivalry department where two guys do battle over a girl only that this time it's the third party up against a married couple. Though I'd say it again nothing beats riling you up when you see how the bastard at work gets away with almost everything and get incensed with his obvious intentions to bang his ex i.e. the wife.The flow of the movie did seem a little broken at times which I suspect that there were a lot more filmed than was put on screen perhaps saving them for the DVD release. The ideas injected into the movie were numerous but that made for the narrative feeling a little scattered. For instance Amanda Peet as the wife Sofia Kowalski didn't really have much to do except nurse the baby and be in some of the most trying comedic scenes such as the ones involving yoga.Fans of Braff will not want to miss yet another familiar performance and remember to stay tune during the credits for a coda as well as various bloopers some of which are genuinely funnier than the bits that made it to the movie.";

From the forgettable script to the laissezfaire direction to the soso production values The Ex has definite problems. Worse still the nice cast which also includes Charles Grodin and Mia Farrow can not transcend material of this caliber no matter how hard they try. Braff is a lovable guy so it really hurts that he and the others have nothing to work with here. Yes I did crack a smile a few times but I found myself wincing more often than not. As a movie for bedridden flu patients I suppose this one is okay. But please do not spend big bucks arranging a viewing.

But then it was changed to The Ex which shifted the focus from the workplace to the home. But let's get this straight Either name is infinitely better then the unhealthy dollop of meanspirited junk that appears after the title card on the screen.Tom Zach Braff has been fired from his job as a chef at a hoitytoity restaurant so he and his wife Sofia Amanda Peet and their newborn baby schlep from New York to Ohio where Sofia's dad Bob Charles Grodin has not only set Tom up with a new job but also has procured a nice little house for them to raise their new family in. Aww ain't that sweet. But things don't start off well for Tom at the marketing firm which turns out to be both new age and well wacko. You know a place where such creative aspects as casual dress unwalled offices an imaginary ball of ideas or something abound. Tom has some issues with fitting in with the eclectic quirky crew but more importantly he clashes immediately with his new supervisor Chip Jason Bateman who just happens to be a former schoolmate of Sofia. Oh and a paraplegic of course.But don't worry although it seems like this is a romantic comedy about jealousy and redemption about a young couple getting past their differences to survive as a unit it's set up to be more like a slapstick comedy with many jokes at Chip's expense. Which is okay because Chip is a real jerk. The sad reality though is that the movie fails at both genres. Women won't like it because there's no real romance no genuine feelings on anyone's part. Sorry to generalize ladies. Guys won't like it because there's not nearly enough physical humor. That would be fine except there's hardly any subtle humor either. What you're left with is just vicious meanspiritedness that drains every ounce of humor from an otherwise talented cast.Braff's not terrible but I never got the sense that he was well believable as someone women would desire. But what do I know I'm a straight male. The affection between him and Peet seemed forced tentative and unnatural sort of like unwilling siblings. Peet wasn't bad either but she didn't have much to work with  on a positive note she doesn't come off as icily unappealing as she does in most of her other films.And man check out Charles Grodin. I had to check to see who was playing Sofia's dad  Grodin who hadn't been in a movie in 13 years looks about 85 years old here. I thought he was Bob Eubanks. There's one scene too in which Bob utters the fword. For no freaking reason other than to have Charles Grodin septuagenarian drop an fbomb.Interestingly enough the unrated version of the movie runs about five minutes shorter than the rated one that was seen in theater. And having seen the unrated one I couldn't tell you about any particular scenes that were so raw that they would have pushed the rating to an unwanted NC17. So I have to assume that the rated one was even tamer and thus even crappier.Sad and predictable in its attempt at comedy The Ex is a waste of time. You'll be clawing your eyes out at the numbing awfulness.".

But there's good reason it was a straighttoDVD release. It's not funny.Its biggest problem is with characterization. Zach Braff plays the everyman which is good casting because Braff plays the everyman with a comedic touch quite well. So well in fact that we connect to him. He wants to treat his wife well work hard and impress his inlaws. We want him to succeed just as much as he does. But then we start finding out that his wife Amanda Peet has no likable qualities and continues to force his life into hell his inlaws of course are completely stubborn and his coworker Jason Bateman is a competitive backstabbing exboyfriend of his wife. Obviously things don't go well for our hero and they don't go well for the entire course of the movie.For this to work as a comedy we need to understand our hero's connection to his wife we need to see that there's a way in to connect with his inlaws and we need to know that other characters see what the ex is really like but the writers didn't give us any of that. Instead we have to sit there while our hero who is essentially us is being tortured for no good reason and with no way out. I certainly wasn't laughing.".

	schema:headline " Great performances from Braff and Bateman in an otherwise imperfect film";
	schema:reviewBody "Ever since his directorial debut of Garden State I have been an avid Zach Braff fan. I liked him on Scrubs loved him in State thought The Last Kiss was great and really enjoyed his vocal work in Chicken Little although the movie itself left a lot to be desired. So when The Ex was finally set to be released I obviously looked forward to seeing it. And while he was great as always the movie was a bit off from his other works.The Ex revolves around Tom Braff who jumps from job to job as he prepares for the birth of his first child with wife Sofia Amanda Peet. After getting fired from a promising job he decides that the new family should move back to where Sofia's parents live and take up the job that Sofia's father Bob Charles Grodin has always been offering. But after he takes the position he gets paired off with hotshot paraplegic Chip Jason Bateman who just happens to be Sofia's friend and lover in high school and is really not too keen on Tom.The plot may sound contrived but the final product is a bit of a mishmash of great and not so great ideas.On the side of being great are the hilarious performances from Braff and Bateman. Although he is more of a madcap screwball here Braff still delivers a poignancy to the role. In a way it felt a bit more mature than his work in State and Kiss as he is no longer dealing in existential phobias. Here he is more of a man without a plan and he gives it his all. He has his hysterical moments and he has his moments of pure drama. And all for the most part work great. You can see the obvious traces of his other characters but he makes this character much more than just another shade of Andrew Largeman. Bateman on the other hand steals the show as Braff's nemesis. His quick changing gears from nice ambitious guy to a cold and calculating egocentric sociopath is intriguing to watch and delivers the majority of the laughs throughout the film. And even at the most ridiculous times Bateman stays straightladen and never gives into any other feelings but that of his character.Also on the great side are amusing character performances from Grodin Mia Farrow as Sofia's mother and Fred Armisen as Tom and Chip's coworker Manny. All do great in their small roles and make for some really funny interactions with Braff and Bateman.The script also offers a great story albeit not very deeply intellectual with plenty of moral overtones. While it could have just been a simple revengestyle flick it does tend to open itself up a bit more with a few subplots. And while at least one seems a bit useless the majority all tie in quite nicely and make for great development of characters. As said previously it has some pretty hysterical moments and a few chuckle filled moments inbetween.But the laughs do not last for the length of the entire movie. There are long dry spells where nothing funny happens and instead just leave room for either cringing or a begging of patience for the next joke. The subplots work yes but there are a few that feel tacked on just to stretch out the running time as if the filmmakers knew that what they had would not cut it so they ordered a few extensions. And some of these sequences feel rather painfully obvious where they have been placed but some feel right at home and would not be looked at any different had they not been tacked on. Some of the characters are a bit extraneous as well specifically Amy Adams as a rival mother to Peet while others just look like they drifted in from off the street looking for work because their last TV gig did not work out all too well. Thankfully the majority of these bit players are alright in their small roles but nonetheless feel a bit like a reunion of failed television series actors.Another problem is with the tone of the script. It jumps around far too often never settling on whether it wants to be a Farrelly Brothersesquire madcap comedy or a darkly twisted Coen Brothersstyle comedy. The scenes just do not all jive together and much like the subplots feel like they were tacked on during production. While the story works cohesively the comedic moments just feel awkward in some places. I can laugh at anything so it did not bug me totally. But for anyone looking for just some lighthearted fun at the movies it may turn out to be a problem.As well Peet feels out of place. Although she is younger than Bateman and just slightly older than Braff her character acts far too mature to interact with either of them. They both are out of her league and when she is trying to display emotions suggesting thoughts to the contrary they just do not work. I know her character is supposed to be more than just a stayathome mother but she just looks and acts too old for the part she is supposed to be playing. And of course her character is fodder for many mentions that never come to fruition. She is just far too serious and stern for the material and when she is not trying her best not to show it she just looks like a snob acting solely for a paycheque.Although there are problems with it The Ex does have its great moments and has some very funny performances from Braff and Bateman not to mention the first role for Charles Grodin in well over a decade. Just do not go in expecting another complex and intricate Braff comedy.710.".

This film was also supposed to be Shah Rukh Khan's debut but thankfully Deewana came and gave him his first hit. Otherwise this movie would be his debut and yes this movie was a box office disaster.The movie is about a young girl you is brought up in a brothel she makes a living as a cabaret dancer in some other guy's club. She is not a happy person as she knows her mom is alive but can't find her with the help of a friendplayed by SRK she goes on a search. However the search gets complicated as many people are not as they seem to be and too many characters create a confusion. Will the girl find her dear mother? Will she be able to bring a permanent smile on her face? Watch the movie to find out.The movie is all about a search to find the girl's mother and the search goes well but there are too many subplots which drags the film. The attention a viewer has on the main plot is not long lasting as the subplots tend to bore the viewer. The film is lengthy and editing is not well conducted as the film has many rough patches. To make matters worse there are quite a lot of arguments and problems between characters and the overacting in these scenes tend to irritate. Music is the saving grace thanks to a couple of good tunes but none of them are up to the mark none of them became hits.Direction by Hema Malini is poor she fails for the most part. She handles a few scenes well and the comic scenes are good for its time although clichd in parts. Her direction falls flat when the emotional and serious parts of the movie occur it looks unintentionally funny in some scenes. The end is also not justified and the subplots don't connect with the main plot which means all these subplots move parallel as a result there is no flow in the storyline of the film.Performances are anything great either SRK is functional but this is one of his earlier films and he wasn't much of a good actor. He did much better in Raju Ban Gaya Gentlemen and Baazigar after which he actually started to rock as an actor. The heroine has a meatier role than SRK and she does a decent job the rest overact horribly. Even veteran actor Mithun Chakraborty does a bland job this is one of his weak films.On the whole Di Aashna Hai is a poor film it fails for the most part though a few scenes are worth watching. However the movie in general is a wasted product. Die hard SRK fans might like it but this is definitely not one of SRK's good films.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are three reasons that movie fans should check this film out if you haven't seen it yet1  Outstanding dialog. I can't recall a film in which I heard so many clever filmnoir lines as this one. Almost everyone in the movie has a unique way of expressing their feelings. It makes the movie one that you want to go back and HEAR again. Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman wrote the screenplay and deserve special recognition as well as the people below.2  Fabulous acting led by the two male leads Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster. Curtis is the star of the film with many more lines than anyone else and many consider this to be his greatest acting achievement. I have no quarrel with that. It's one of the finest acting jobs I've ever witnessed by anyone. It's that good. Lancaster is memorable and plays to his strengths as a tough guy not only with his physical presence but his tactless and cutting verbal assaults. He has the best and most brutal lines in the film.The minor characters in here from the cop to the comedian to the cigarette girl to the young romantic couple are all topnotch.3  The cinematography. A big name in the film business James Wong Howe more than lives up to his reputation. This is beautifully photographed and looks absolutely stunning on DVD. I have watched hundreds and hundreds of blackandwhite films and this ranks with the best of them. He captured nighttime New York City as well as anybody ever has done.Well you might ask if this movie is so great why haven't I heard more about it?Maybe because it never did well at the box office. It wasn't promoted a lot from what I heard and the storyline is not a pleasant one. Basically this is about two immoral people who smear a nice guy so that it will ruin the romance between he and Lancaster's sister. Lancaster plays an absolutely ruthless newspaper columnist who makes and breaks careers and Curtis plays his slimy pressagent who will do anything to please his powerful boss including doing the worst of his dirty work.Furrther details of the film can be read by many of the other fine reviewers here on this website so no need to go into that.I am not one who generally likes films that feature mostly nasty people but this was done so well that it fascinates me every time. A final tip of the hat to director Alexander Mackendrick. Why he wasn't given more films to direct is a mystery to me. Highlyrecommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "MILD SPOILERS It is amazing the number of different ways a great film can weave its alluring web and pull you into its story. Of my 100 favorite films this one's journey into that rarefied status is unique based on but a single viewing. I saw Sweet Smell of Success when I was too young to really grasp the subterranean motivations of the characters who so vividly populate the film. I did not understand for instance why this powerful loathsome gossip columnist Burt Lancaster's JJ Hunsecker who so clearly despised Tony Curtis' Sidney Falco press agent nonetheless tolerated his presence. There was much that I DID appreciatethe brilliant and daring acting of the two leads the beautifully oppressive cinematography and the scintillating dialoguebut after that single viewing the film slowly faded from my consciousness. Twentyfive or 30 years later I decided to make a list of my favorite movies and came across the title of this film. Apparently memories of seeing this production had been roiling around my unconscious all this time and now triggered by the little blurb in the Leonard Maltin book these halfforgotten images came bounding back into mind now concatenated with a quarter century of life and moviegoing experience. Honing my list over the next few months and considering this film's merits I more and more began to realize what a truly marvelous work this was. This was a study nonpareil of two creatures wholly wrapped up in themselves and their ambition yet bound together in a mutual parasitism the term symbiosis sounds much too nice to describe their relationship. I understood finally why JJ tolerated Falco's presence. He NEEDED Falco. It wasn't just that Falco would occasionally offer up tidbits that he could use in his column. It wasn't that the fawning Falco could be manipulated into performing certain . . . uh tasks that were too dirty for JJ to touch. No as a ruthless powermonger he needed the treacherous sycophant as a constant reminder and test of his superiority. Falco could be demeaned and ridiculed but he also represented a danger a challenge. Falco might seem a toady but he was also a cobra waiting his chance to strike and Hunsecker relished his role as sadistic snake charmer. Watching these two play at their oppressive games of perfidy and dealing dirt provide a fascinating character study perhaps the equal of the more famous examination of one Charles Foster Kane in an earlier film. There are many other characters in the movie such as JJ's sister and her lover and some are played with great aplomb but they are all pawns in this disdainful dance between JJ and Falco and it is their personalities that stay with you long after the lights come back on.Everything about this movie seems to be nearly perfect some have criticised the film for the relatively weak portrayal of the two hapless lovers but a stronger emphasis on these two would only detract from the real focusJJ and Sidney even to the choice of names. JJ Hunsecker and Sidney Falco seem perfect monikers by themselves conjuring up images of loathsome characters. Unfortunately for the team that put together this masterpiece of filmnoir Sweet Smell of Success was no success and critics and moviegoers alike left the theaters convinced that the smell generated by the film was far from sweet. Amazingly this film not only failed to garner an Oscar it failed to receive a single solitary nominationnot for Alexander Mackendrick's direction this abject failure truncating his promising career not for the incisive endlessly quotable screenplay Ernest Lehman  Clifford Odets not Elmer Bernstein's wonderful score nor the tremendous performances of Curtis and Lancasternot even James Wong Howe's gritty cinematography beautifully capturing the seamier side of New York City. Fortunately history has stepped in to provide a more accurate critique of this once ignored masterpiece. I can hardly wait to see it a second time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love this dirty town.  Match me Sidney. Maybe I left my sense of humour in my other suit.  Great dialogue.  Great script great cinematography great acting great music.  Christ what do you want blood? From the first moment we see Burt Lancaster as the impossibly sinister J.J. we know we're in for a cracking time.  There he is sitting at the restaurant table wearing those strangely scary glasses his face expressionless perhaps he's smiling just a little bit talking to Sidney without even looking at him firing the dialogue like bullets.  When the action seeps into the New York streets oozing menace there's J.J.  master of all he surveys twisting cops round his little finger snarling and seething like some desperate animal.

There he is sitting at the restaurant table wearing those strangely scary glasses his face expressionless perhaps he's smiling just a little bit talking to Sidney without even looking at him firing the dialogue like bullets.  When the action seeps into the New York streets oozing menace there's J.J.  master of all he surveys twisting cops round his little finger snarling and seething like some desperate animal.

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that in 1957 this film was made at all is proof that Walter Winchell's decline was already setting in. Burt Lancaster's J.J. Hunsecker based on Winchell and very frightening accurately portrays the columnist and the power he wielded.For those who are interested in how Winchell got to where he was J.J. Hunsecker I would recommend Neal Gabler's biography of him which came out a few years ago. Sweet Smell of Success is the story of a day in the life of this monster who everyone on the planet it seems is terrified of offending. Like Winchell at the Stork Club Hunsecker holds court like some monarch at a nightclub where people are obsequiously asking for some recognition in his column.One of these is Sidney Falco press agent and bootlicking dog extraordinaire. Hunsecker is mad at him because he sent him on an errand to break up a romance his younger sister is having with a jazz musician he doesn't approve of. The film is essentially Falco's attempts to carry out his master's wishes.Burt Lancaster had already received critical acclaim as an actor but this was a breakthrough role for Tony Curtis as Sidney Falco. Up to then Curtis was the handsome romantic lead in many lightweight films for his home studio of Universal. Sidney Falco was a lot of things but heroic wasn't one of them. Next year Tony Curtis would get an Oscar nomination for The Defiant Ones. How Lancaster and Curtis were ignored by the Academy for nominations is beyond me.The young lovers are Susan Harrison and Martin Milner. This was probably Marty Milner's finest screen role. As Lancaster was also the producer he personally cast Milner in the part having worked with him on Gunfight at the OK Corral. Susan Harrison strangely enough never had much of a career after a promising debut. She ultimately wreaks a terrible vengeance on one of our protagonists.One of the ironic lines in the film is Lancaster saying that he'd fold up if he had to exist on a press agent's tidbits. But ironically that's how WinchellHunsecker did exist. Winchell had no real skill as a reporter as Gabler's biography pointed out. When the tidbits stopped he dried up and blew away. Sweet Smell of Success was a commercial flop movie audiences did not take to the offbeat casting of the leads nor to the gritty realistic story. Today the film is a deserved classic.".

Burt Lancaster is once again terrific as J.J. Hunsecker Walter Winchellesque writer of a society column which is more of a tool of destruction for those who cross his path. But it's Tony Curtis who holds the movie together. Always scheming and plotting and never letting a decent human emotion take precedence over his drive to succeed at any cost. He's Marvelous and was never again to achieve what he did here.But there's a third star to this production and it's New York City itself. The on location photography is stunning. What is amazing is that at the time the movie was made 1957 on location filming was just becoming in vogue. For a film like this it HAD to filmed on location or else it's power would be substantially diluted. I work in Manhattan near where a lot of this film was made J.J. lives in the Brill Building which is on Broadway between 49th and 50th Streets right around the corner from me. To see what the neighborhood looked like over 40 years ago is amazing. Surprisingly it's the astonishing on site photography that prevents the film from really feeling dated. Also the themes in the film are timeless as well.Sweet Smell of Success is a classic from top to bottom.".

Go ahead and say it to  yourself and I'll say that David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross comes  close. Both feature snarling biting dialog. Both have irredeemable  characters that will do anything for success. Mamet's characters are  mostly downandouters who are scrapping at each other to find some  sampling of their former successes. In Sweet Smell of Success there are  successful characters and losers both of which need each other to  survive. It is a tale of a successful columnist and his need for a low  life press agent. It is a bitter bleak story of power success and the  desire to have more.  Burt Lancaster plays JJ Hunsecker a powerful successful columnist who  is at the top of his game. He gets what he wants when he wants it with  no questions asked. He can make or break celebrities with a quick blurb  in his column. He dines with politicians and gets any girl he wants.  Tony Curtis is Sidney Falco a low rent press agent who needs  Lancaster's blurbs for his clients to keep in business. Problem is  Hunsecker has cut Falco out of his columns because Falco hasn't  delivered on a deal they made. Though Hunsecker can garner the love and  admiration of anyone he chooses the one woman he cannot win over is  his own sister. As he repeatedly says throughout the film she's all he  has. Problem is she is in love with a jazz singer and they plan to  marry. Hunsecker can't bear the thought of losing his sister so he  forces Falco to get rid of the boy by any means necessary.  The film is relentless. From beginning to end it never stops its  pounding. There is never a breath of kindness. The two characters with  some redeeming characteristics Hunsecker's sister Susan Susan  Harrison and her boyfriend Steve Dallas Martin Milner are so  overshadowed by the continual foul play by Hunsecker and Falco that  they come away with a foul stench.  Tony Curtis pulls a performance that reminded me of his turn as the  Boston Strangler. It is not difficult to see his Falco turning to  murder if it helped him succeed. Though as the strangler he seems to  have found some remorse for his actions where Falco is irredeemable to  the very end.  There is a seen in the middle of the picture where Falco pulls a trick  to convince a mid level performer to make Falco his press agent. At  this point Falco needs all the clients he can get. Later the performer  comes to Falco ready to sign him as his agent. Falco now feeling some  signs of success brushes the performer off without a second thought. It  is a telling scene of just how heartless and uncaring Falco has become.  Where has Burt Lancaster been all my life? Sadly enough the only film  I can remember watching him in is the 1986 tossoff comedy Tough Guys.  His performance here is nothing short of astonishing. He is the king of  his castle never stepping off his high throne treating everyone as  servants. Even his shows of affection for Susan are grotesque and  menacing.  This is a story that his hard to watch. It is brutal and menacing with  nary a redeeming aspect. But it is a film that must be watched. The  craftsmanship of the filmmakers and the performances of the actors  elevate it above so many others. It is nearly a morality tale of the  horrors that befall humanities greed.".

He can make or break you with a single word and everyone knows he can and will without a single look back.

In Falco's case he must try to break up the relationship between Hunsecker's young sister Susan and upandcoming jazz musician Steve Dallas as Dallas is not worthy' in Hunsecker's eyes.  It becomes quickly apparent that due to an almost incestuous fascination with his sister no one will be worthy of her something that Susan has to come to terms with and finally resign herself to.  In his pursuits Falco finds himself compromising any moral fiber he may have had left and no one escapes undamaged.Sweet Smell of Success is indeed a dark film and morally bereft but it is so compelling and thoughtprovoking that it is hard to imagine any viewer love or hate the film not able to come away from it without at least a few questions in mind  How far would you go for fame?

Ironically one of the few people to exhibit any modicum of pride and conviction is the one who ends up getting slandered and unjustly punished.The backdrop for this film is the vibrant busy and exuberant New York City usually at night.  Every social scene is crowded every outdoor shot shows bustling streets.  Wild loud jazz music is the soundtrack the compliments the frenetic surroundings.  The film is shot in crisp sharp black and white and any hint of color would have changed the film drastically for the worse.  Lancaster plays Hunsecker as a level even toned man which belies his hateful personality and only makes him more sinister.  Curtis' Falco is like the yipping and bouncing dog in the old cartoons and delivers his lines with a machine gunlike staccato but his eyes are dead and bleak and the only emotion he can convey that approaches regret is nothing more than fleeting until survival mode' visibly kicks in.Sweet Smell of Success is a certified classic but it is easy to see why it is not more popular.  The good guys don't win because there ARE no good guys.  And every time the viewer thinks that something may not be realistic or that something is overblown with even a second of reflection one realizes that this IS real life and it's hard to look at sometimes because it is not always pretty.Shelly".

Burt Lancaster gives again an unbelievable performance and Tony Curtis is perfect in the role of the ambitious small time thug that cannot get rid of his own contradictions. I only wish the studios would stop focusing on the teen market today and get inspired by films like this one.";

An example was the boy friend of his sister Susan a working young man devoted to music and strongly in love with Susan completely discredited by JJ. Certainly JJ was a kind of a sick man unable to accept any reason from any other person. He was born to have adversaries and not friends. To do all his work JJ needed snakes not persons as Sidney Falco Tony Curtis who behaved worse than a reptile always praising JJ although he in fact hated him and creating the intrigues whenever there were necessary.

In the preInternet days when the newspaper was king the columnists ruled  Winchell Ed Sullivan Cholly Knickerbocker Radie Harris and let's not forget Hedda and Louella! But the King was Winchell and while I don't think the Burt Lancaster character of J.J. Hunsecker is modeled on him the power and control the man wielded certainly is.Tony Curtis plays one of his best roles as Sidney Falco a lowranking press agent who is dependent on people like Hunsecker to mention his clients in their daily columns. But Sidney is on the outs with Hunsecker a very bad place to be. Hunsecker has ordered Sidney to break up his sister Susan's relationship with a jazz musician Steve Martin Milner and Susan is still seeing him. Sidney comes up with a plan to tear the two apart which probably would have worked but when Steve stands up to J.J. Hunsecker is out for blood. He demands the plan be taken one step further and dangles an attractive carrot in front of Sidney to make it happen.Done in black and white with most of the action taking place at night and often on the streets of Times Square The Sweet Smell of Success has an atmosphere of slime and grit. The handsome Lancaster and Curtis are not particularly well photographed  it's not meant to be a glamorous picture. The dialogue is fast to the point and witty and the performances are breathtaking. Lancaster underplays the twisted Hunsecker so that his contempt for the people he writes about  and his sick attraction to his sister  can be clearly shown. He could have played it more along the lines of Curtis' Sidney  an obvious manipulative rat  but it wouldn't have been as right as Lancaster's tightlycontrolled J.J.Curtis was born to play Sidney  an attractive fasttalking man with no morals who plays both ends against the middle. He's a New York character ideal for a New York guy like Curtis who grew up on the streets. Sidney is totally outrageous  he invites a cigarette girl to his apartment and then pimps her out to a columnist so he can get an item in his column he tries blackmailing another columnist but that backfires. It doesn't stop him from trying again.The two victims of these piranhas are Susan and Steve a young couple deeply in love who want to be married. Their simple story is told against a backdrop of scandal revenge manipulation and blackmail. Their situation makes the actions of J.J. and Sidney even seedier and more cruel than they already are.Sweet Smell of Success has become a cult classic and was actually mounted at one point as a Broadway musical. Like Nightmare Alley it probably was too grim for audiences back then. Is anything too grim for audiences of today? Doubtful.".

When Hunsecker becomes unhappy about a relationship that has developed between his sister and a jazz guitarist he orders Falco to do whatever's necessary to break them up.

The dialogue is impressively incisive throughout and some of the remarks made by Hunsecker are delivered with great panache. When he says I love this dirty town the comment exemplifies what he's all about and also highlights the source of his power.

	schema:headline " One of those great films  both for its content and as a nostalgic piece of work";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie apparently had only moderate success when it was released 50 years ago  presumably due to its film noir character with the iconic Lancaster and the rising young matine idol Curtis both very unctuous and one seeming smarmier than the other at every turn. Lancaster is so selfish egomaniacal and unfeeling  except for his obsession with his sister and even that unhealthy and selfserving having turned her into a basket case. Curtis is just as bad in terms of his character he just doesn't have the power or influence of Lancaster's J. J. but is trying hard to acquire it. Viewed now this film is not only superb drama with two of the greatest stars in Hollywood history. It is also a relic in the sense of conveying the influence of gossip columnists in that period and the preceding decades  Winchell Earl Wilson Ed Sullivan Sheila Graham Hopper and Parsons in Hollwood and usually a comparable columnist for more local tidbits in almost every American newspaper. These have for many years been supplanted by the plethora of gossip programs on the wide spectrum of cablesatellite channels today.There are some details in this film which can be criticized but these only make its 10 stars just a little dimmer. Even with his handtomouth status in the film Curtis' Sidney would at least have a better sign on his office door and something a tad more officelike. Martin Milner looks as though he's consumed about a triple dosage of tranquilizers and for most of the picture so does Susan Harrison if J. J. were to have a legitimate beef about Marty's attentions to his sister it should have been his apparent furnishing her with downers. If you have seen The Caine Mutiny released three years prior you'll recall the young lovers in that film Robert Francis and May Wynn. It would be a a deadheat tie with the pair in this film for the title of the most insipid young couple in filmdom history.However this fact works in this film to point even more emphasis towards LancasterJ. J. and CurtisSidney. Likewise for the rather onedimensional character to all the supporting parts and cast. The forementioned noir quality and the rather overthetop acting of the two leads is a nostalgic look at the acting styles from The Jazz Singer through the '50's nobody  but nobody  was more overthetop in style or greater than the pioneering Al Jolson.This movie like so many classics of its period is great to view in its own right  but doubly so as an historic nostalgic view of a time past.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie apparently had only moderate success when it was released 50 years ago  presumably due to its film noir character with the iconic Lancaster and the rising young matine idol Curtis both very unctuous and one seeming smarmier than the other at every turn. Lancaster is so selfish egomaniacal and unfeeling  except for his obsession with his sister and even that unhealthy and selfserving having turned her into a basket case. Curtis is just as bad in terms of his character he just doesn't have the power or influence of Lancaster's J. J. but is trying hard to acquire it. Viewed now this film is not only superb drama with two of the greatest stars in Hollywood history. It is also a relic in the sense of conveying the influence of gossip columnists in that period and the preceding decades  Winchell Earl Wilson Ed Sullivan Sheila Graham Hopper and Parsons in Hollwood and usually a comparable columnist for more local tidbits in almost every American newspaper. These have for many years been supplanted by the plethora of gossip programs on the wide spectrum of cablesatellite channels today.There are some details in this film which can be criticized but these only make its 10 stars just a little dimmer. Even with his handtomouth status in the film Curtis' Sidney would at least have a better sign on his office door and something a tad more officelike. Martin Milner looks as though he's consumed about a triple dosage of tranquilizers and for most of the picture so does Susan Harrison if J. J. were to have a legitimate beef about Marty's attentions to his sister it should have been his apparent furnishing her with downers. If you have seen The Caine Mutiny released three years prior you'll recall the young lovers in that film Robert Francis and May Wynn. It would be a a deadheat tie with the pair in this film for the title of the most insipid young couple in filmdom history.However this fact works in this film to point even more emphasis towards LancasterJ. J. and CurtisSidney. Likewise for the rather onedimensional character to all the supporting parts and cast. The forementioned noir quality and the rather overthetop acting of the two leads is a nostalgic look at the acting styles from The Jazz Singer through the '50's nobody  but nobody  was more overthetop in style or greater than the pioneering Al Jolson.This movie like so many classics of its period is great to view in its own right  but doubly so as an historic nostalgic view of a time past.";

These are people who treat virtue with scant reverence.There's a loud jazzy score to back up this energetic nighttime flick. There is no such thing as daylight here. And Clifford Odets has lent his usual stamp to the script. Nobody says anything as simple as I don't believe you. They are made to say That fish is four days old. I won't buy it. And the sweating laughaminute cop is given to misusing big words  Rectify me something Sidney did J. J. really say I was fat? Even when the cop uses the word correctly it still SOUNDS wrong  Ha ha! Come back Sidney I want to CHASTISE you. The dialog is also studded with everyday phrases that are repeated as if part of a litany  credit where credit is due. And indulge me on this and correct me if I'm wrong. The best of this dialog is given to the evildoers meaning every guy except Curtis's uncle Sam Levene underused in my opinion and Martin Milner as an innocent young jazz guitarist afloat in this sea of sharks. You twist words around he says addressing another actor not Odets. This movie is by the way some considerable distance from the director's Alexander MacKendrick usual stomping ground. Cf. Tight Little Island.Burt Lancaster gives a quiet barely restrained performance as the gossip columnist and TV personality who tells presidents what to do. He's so tense with ego power anger and an incestuous jealousy of any attention paid to his sister that he gives the impression of a boil about to burst. But he rarely loses it. Instead if he shows any semblance of emotion at all it's usually pleasure in the exercise of power accompanied by a reptilian almost alligatorlike smile of beneficence. It's a good performance and so is Tony Curtis's. Nattily dressed in black suits his hair flawlessly groomed his expression alternating between a phony bonhomie and greasy anxiety he seems always to be in motion darting rather than walking and talking almost always usually lying. Barbara Nichols as the careless and exploited cigarette girl plays Barbara Nichols. I have no idea what she was like in person but on screen she's never been anyone else. And as someone once remarked about the adolescent AnnMargaret  Everything she does comes across as dirty. Martin Milner looks right but mumbles his way through the part without much conviction. Burt's sister is a washout.What a splendid photographer James Wong Howe was. His blacks are really black his highlights seem to glisten and when Lancaster's mogul stands on his balcony staring down at his domain from on high the streets of New York look like rivulets of glittering silver poured from a beaker. Compare this with the subtle crisp grays of his Texas ranch in Hud.The movie gives us a glimpse of the sizzling New York City night life of the 1950s. It may have looked corrupt at the time but from our present perspective it was an age of innocence. Welldressed people walk alone down deserted streets at night. You want to try that in today's New York? Maybe the greatest change since then is suggested by the puissance in the hands of a newspaper columnist  a guy who writes words that people must then read. Read? Who gets their news from newspapers nowadays? Who would be shocked by the revelations Lancaster and his colleagues in gossip come up with  an unknown musician who is said to have smoked marijuana and is fired because of the slur? Today it would lead to hemorrhageinducing mirth. So it might have been rotten then true but there are times when it seems to me that it would be nice to listen to the hoof beats of yesteryear and travel back in time to a period when people still read and when one of the worst lies you might run into in the news was that a musician did some grass.".

We see the creatures that populate this dark aberration of society polite or otherwise.One of the creatures inhabiting this Eco system is Press Agent Sidney Falco Tony Curtis. Immediately we see him as a manic personality living in the bars and clubs all around the Broadway Theatrical District. He is ever running telephoning or kibitzing with clients and potential clients. His small sort of shabby office has a bedroom set up in order for him to crash or whatever else requires the use of a bed.As it seems obvious he apparently also lives there. Sidney needs to stay in the good graces of the big newspaper columnists like the top guy J.J. Hunsecker Burt Lancester. It is columnists like him who use the little items in their columns which they receive from the Press Agents. The more items from Sidney the greater is his asking price from clients.Mr. Hunsecker has acquired more power over those in the entertainment field than one could believe. He holds figurative powers of life and death over the various numbers of actors singers dancers musicians and comedians. A good word from his column is viewed as a blessing by any producer as a panning o the very same show would hurt it grievously.However as we soon see his megalomania is not limited to his show biz reporting and gossip in the printed page. He has a young sister Susan Susan Hucksetter of whom he maintains an iron grip on her life having a compulsion to protect her from any outside influences be the business or social.When Susan falls for musician Steve Dallas Martin Milner J.J. pulls out all stops in attempting to break up the young couple. He has a direct meeting where he insinuates that it would not be good his career if he didn't break off the relationship. Things didn't work out with that little chat so J.J. gave the job of discrediting Steve to Sidney Falco once again.The finale features the use of a crooked and brutal Police Lieutenant and the use of planting false evidence. Much like MOBY DICK the story ends with a lot still going on a sure indication that the author believes there to be no relief from such situations.The story is woven in such a manner as to never seem to be to long or to be dragging. The Director and cinematographer Alexander Mackendrick and James Wong Howe respectively gave the film a real upclose and personal feel to it. They make the viewer surrender himself and accept all sorts of bizarre behaviour.There has been many a claim that the Story and Character of J.J. Hudsecker while fictional and emphatically so stated is really based on Walter Winchell who was topdog in the Broadway  Show Biz Columnist business. Others have pointed to Alexander Woollcott. Our guess is that the author used bits and pieces of many real life folks as well as blending in a heaping portion of embellishment for good measure.Our Recommendation Definitely see it. Just make sure you're in the proper frame of mind as the overall mood of the film is a definitely a downer.".

	schema:reviewBody "I missed this film when it first came out when I was in my late teens  and I kept missing it whenever it appeared on TV which was a rare occasion. So I was very pleased to finally get a DVD and relish in one of the definitive stories about...power and how it corrupts.Arguably this narrative is a true classic and ranks as one of the best dramas ever put to film. First the two main actors  Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster  both give truly outstanding performances. Curtis went on to other projects like The Defiant Ones 1958 Some like it hot 1959 and most notably The Boston Strangler 1968 but as Sidney Falco he's the quintessential slime ball the guy whom you really never want to meet because he's the one you know you can never trust. He makes Paul Newman's Hud 1963 look like Mr Goody Two Shoes and that's no criticism of Paul Newman. Curtis's acting is so good he should have won an Oscar.Lancaster is also excellent in the role of a powercorrupted syndicated columnist J.J. Hunsecker who'll use whatever and whomever to protect his interests  and in this slice of slimy life it's his sister who forms the central interest. That by itself makes for a gripping tug of war between him and a very effective and young Martin Milner as Steve Dallas the guitarist who wants to marry Susan Hunsecker played by Susan Harrison an actor who faded away very quickly it seems. What's more interesting however is the interaction between J.J. and Susan with distinctive allusions to a brothersister relationship that seems to go a bit beyond normality with a longer narrative that could have been explored more and to great effect I think.What's even more interesting is the unspoken undercurrent between J.J and Sidney both handsome guys one dominant one submissive both dependent upon each other both repulsed by each other  and probably themselves deep down. And both always on the make for the next conquest including sexual.However in 1957 to extend both of those aspects into this story probably would have ensured an even faster death at the box office...In addition to the acting the other big strength is the dialog that contains some of the best oneliners in movie history. Check out the Quotes section to gain an appreciation of the quality of this script. For sheer use of word power and word play you have to look at Sleuth 1972 for comparison a lesser film sure but still entertaining.The production was topnotch as was the cinematography from James Wong Howe an operator who started out in the silent era in 1920. And it shows. Looking over his credits I spotted a half dozen movies that I rate among my favorites particularly Pursued 1947 the very best black and white photography I've ever seen. And of course the miseenscene New York as few have seen it and which is gone forever. Like On the Waterfront 1952 The Naked City 1948 and a few others that gritty city is The Metaphor for the tough grittiness that seems to permeate the citizens of that great place  good and bad alike.It's not surprising that the critics and the public at that time shunned this masterpiece nobody likes to look inside their soul to shrink back from the truth. None of us like to think what we might do or not do in the same situation it's too much for most to even acknowledge that old saying there but for the grace of God go I.Unquestionably one of the best movies I've ever seen.".

And it shows. Looking over his credits I spotted a half dozen movies that I rate among my favorites particularly Pursued 1947 the very best black and white photography I've ever seen. And of course the miseenscene New York as few have seen it and which is gone forever. Like On the Waterfront 1952 The Naked City 1948 and a few others that gritty city is The Metaphor for the tough grittiness that seems to permeate the citizens of that great place  good and bad alike.It's not surprising that the critics and the public at that time shunned this masterpiece nobody likes to look inside their soul to shrink back from the truth. None of us like to think what we might do or not do in the same situation it's too much for most to even acknowledge that old saying there but for the grace of God go I.Unquestionably one of the best movies I've ever seen.";

Martin Sheen plays Tom an American doctor who comes to St. Jean Pied de Port France to collect the remains of his adult son played by Emilio Estevez killed in the Pyrenees in a storm while walking the Camino de Santiago also known as The Way of Saint James. Rather than return home Tom decides to embark on the historical pilgrimage to honor his son's desire to finish the journey. What Tom doesn't plan on is the profound impact the journey will have on him and his California Bubble Life. Inexperienced as a trekker Tom soon discovers that he will not be alone on this journey. On his journey Tom meets other pilgrims from around the world each with their own issues and looking for greater meaning in their lives a Dutchman Yorick van Wageningen a Canadian Deborah Kara Unger and an Irish writer James Nesbitt who is ...";

	schema:reviewBody "I have looked forward to the way since first hearing about it. I heard interviews with Martin Sheen himself and a great double interview with Martin and Emilio on Irish radio. I did a part of the camino in 2009 and It was a life changingenhancing experience for me so I couldn't wait to see how the film would deal with it. Yesterday I saw the film in the Screen cinema in College Green Dublin. The film is in my opinion very true to the camino experience. A previous reviewer trivialised it as a road movie and suggested wizard of Oz characterisation. The camino road has been travelled for over a thousand years. Long before road movies were even thought about and yes any story of fellow travellers sharing their stories on a journey can be similar to the wizard of Oz but I think Chaucers Canterbury Tales is probably the true origin of the species. The camino de Santiago in its reality and in this film is a wonderful kaleidoscopic confluence of humanity. Pilgrims seem to selfselect for certain character traits such as eccentricity other worldliness joyfullness adventurousness hurt curiosity etc. Tom's companions were all from the palette of characters I found on the camino. Tom himself was an accidental pilgrim and only at the end of the camino did he allow himself to fall in love with it like the others. Tom the cynical skeptic driven to put one foot in front of another as a way of dealing with the brokenness of his relationship with his son and the trauma of his sudden death allows the distance required to allow viewers share in the journey of the Camino in a way that could not have been achieved by following four ordinary pilgrims no matter how colourful. Tom was the straight man the foil that allowed the full colours of all the other characters to shine through. I thought it was a brilliant piece of cinema. Ole!".

I think this will go down as one of Martin Sheen's best ever performances. He underplays his role due to Emilio's direction? which makes it all the stronger. In fact it's the understated quality of the whole film that makes it very moving. It never descends into sentimentality but you still feel the grief of Martin Sheen's character as he makes the pilgrimage his estranged dead son never completed. At the same time there are a lot of funny moments which lift it from becoming a depressing journey. The gradual coalescing of the four very different main characters into a unified group works very well. Each of them has a different reason for making the pilgrimage and to begin with they seem to have nothing in common but it's still very believable when they start to relate to each other. Emilio and his father Martin have every reason to be very proud of this film. It works on every level.".

	schema:headline " Martin Sheen walks 500 miles in northern Spain and it is a pleasure to watch every single one";
	schema:reviewBody "Everyone has their own personal reason for choosing to walk the real 500 mile Camino de Santiago. This is a trail which begins in France winds its way through the French Pyrenees across northern Spain's Basque region and ends in Galicia at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Legend says St. James is buried here. Every year thousands of 'pilgrims' make this arduous trek which can take months to accomplish. However don't let the word pilgrim fool you many people undertake this quest for nonreligious reasons.In fact four such folk are the main characters in The Way. Tom Martin Sheen is a native Californian eye doctor who spends as much time on the links as he does at the office. He receives an unexpected phone call from a French policeman informing him his son Daniel Emilio Estevez died in southern France in a major storm. Tom flies out to France to collect his body and learns about the pilgrimage Daniel was just starting out on.Tom and Daniel did not have the best parting one would like to have the last time you are going to see your son. Tom thought Daniel was wasting his life on these silly adventures while Daniel responded with the platitude You don't choose your life you experience it. In a moment of remorse and homage Tom decides to walk the 500 miles for Daniel with his cremated remains spreading his ashes along the way. Quickly he is joined by fellow pilgrims each with their own reasons for taking a few months out of their lives to backpack across Spain. There is the Dutchman Joost Yorick van Wageningen who is walking the trail to lose weight for his brother's wedding. Sarah Deborah Kara Unger is a chain smoking Canadian who vows to drop the habit once she reaches the cathedral and Jack James Nesbitt is an Irishman convinced the trail will finally crack his writer's block. Initially Tom does not particularly want their company because he is suffering from some severe guilt and remorse about Daniel. This leads to the film's low point of a drunken rage against pilgrims and his walking mates. Fortunately once this ridiculous and needless scene is over the rest of The Way is a very enjoyable movie to watch.The Way was shot with only available light sunlight during the day and candles and fire at night which lends it a great deal of authenticity. Other than the main characters everyone else on screen are actual pilgrims walking the trail to the cathedral. There is a scene later on with real Roma Gypsies. Since the Camino de Santiago means a great deal to many people especially those in northern Spain you can really see how writerdirector Emilio Estevez took his time to do this right. It is refreshing to see Emilio pop his head up once again for some work. I last saw him when he directed 2006's Bobby and since then it appears he has only directed a couple episodes of Numb3rs. Perhaps he is always waiting for some real inspiration to use as his next project. He mentioned The Way came about from his father and his son's experience on the trail. I wonder if the character Jack is a model for Emilio since the first draft of this screenplay took six months to write. Furthermore it is about time Martin Sheen showed up in a good movie again. Recently he has had some bit parts in throw away movies such as Love Happens and Imagine That and hasn't truly had quality work since The Departed. The Way won't win any awards however it is so positive and perhaps intentionally persuasive that I bet every person in the audience thought about how they could find a few months to take off and hike that distance. I had no idea that such a place as the Camino de Santiago existed before watching The Way which I suspect is a big reason why Emilio Estevez took the time to write and direct this film. He wants the rest of us to know about it as well.".

	onyx:emotionText "Everyone has their own personal reason for choosing to walk the real 500 mile Camino de Santiago. This is a trail which begins in France winds its way through the French Pyrenees across northern Spain's Basque region and ends in Galicia at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Legend says St. James is buried here. Every year thousands of 'pilgrims' make this arduous trek which can take months to accomplish. However don't let the word pilgrim fool you many people undertake this quest for nonreligious reasons.In fact four such folk are the main characters in The Way. Tom Martin Sheen is a native Californian eye doctor who spends as much time on the links as he does at the office. He receives an unexpected phone call from a French policeman informing him his son Daniel Emilio Estevez died in southern France in a major storm. Tom flies out to France to collect his body and learns about the pilgrimage Daniel was just starting out on.Tom and Daniel did not have the best parting one would like to have the last time you are going to see your son. Tom thought Daniel was wasting his life on these silly adventures while Daniel responded with the platitude You don't choose your life you experience it. In a moment of remorse and homage Tom decides to walk the 500 miles for Daniel with his cremated remains spreading his ashes along the way. Quickly he is joined by fellow pilgrims each with their own reasons for taking a few months out of their lives to backpack across Spain. There is the Dutchman Joost Yorick van Wageningen who is walking the trail to lose weight for his brother's wedding. Sarah Deborah Kara Unger is a chain smoking Canadian who vows to drop the habit once she reaches the cathedral and Jack James Nesbitt is an Irishman convinced the trail will finally crack his writer's block. Initially Tom does not particularly want their company because he is suffering from some severe guilt and remorse about Daniel. This leads to the film's low point of a drunken rage against pilgrims and his walking mates. Fortunately once this ridiculous and needless scene is over the rest of The Way is a very enjoyable movie to watch.The Way was shot with only available light sunlight during the day and candles and fire at night which lends it a great deal of authenticity. Other than the main characters everyone else on screen are actual pilgrims walking the trail to the cathedral. There is a scene later on with real Roma Gypsies. Since the Camino de Santiago means a great deal to many people especially those in northern Spain you can really see how writerdirector Emilio Estevez took his time to do this right.

The last formal film he appeared in was Rated X with his brother Charlie Sheen in 2000. Finally we see Emilio's talents not only behind the camera but in writing as well. He handles the screenplay the directing and the producing in this beautifully crafted film.You can tell just from the closetohome feel of the character The Way is something sentimental and meaningful to both Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Both real life father and son actors have been taking most of their time in 2011 and using it to promote a film with heart and soul but will likely be ignored when in theaters because of its very limited release and its minimal marketing.The story focuses on Tom Sheen an American doctor who goes to France after hearing his adventureseeking son Daniel Estevez has died in a storm while hiking the Camino de Santiago  a famed Christian route many walk on to find faith or go to Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela at the end of the fivehundred mile route.After arriving in France to pick up Daniel's ashes Tom makes a splitsecond decision that he will follow hike the path of his son while spreading his ashes throughout the trail. He meets up with many different people with many different stories. They are Joost Wageningen a Dutchman who is hiking the trail for exercise purposes Sarah Unger who is trying to quit smoking and Jack from Ireland Nesbitt who is suffering from writer's block and is trying to collect information about fellow hikers and their separate journeys.The Way has a number of strange qualities  for one it has noticeable parallels to the 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz. And two it is odd for Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez two actors that practice in strict Catholicism to focus on a film that leads to a Christian Cathedral. Whatever the reason behind it the story is pitchperfect and Martin Sheen may have just given one of the best performances of his career.The tears come and go in The Way but so do the shocker scenes like when the topic of abortion is briefly mentioned. It is rare for such a film to bring up a controversial topic which is why The Way deserves a load of credit.The plot isn't too deep but the story is truly moving. The acting by the four characters is fantastic and like any road movie it is more about the characters getting to find their innerselves rather than walking from point a to point b. Only here  it is more welcomed because of the fact that is what the Camino de Santiago is all about.Starring Martin Sheen Deborah Kara Unger James Nesbitt Yorick van Wageningen and Emilio Estevez.

In brief we're following Martin Sheen's character Tom during his pilgrimage journey whilst mourning his dead son who died on the same pilgrim route after only one day. Tom meets people along the way who also become his friends although Tom himself is uninviting. In contrast to the other characters Tom develops throughout the film and goes through the various stages of mourning that come with a great loss such as he suffered. Except from the usual message that people spend too little time reflecting over their life's I think The Way makes a good job of describing the strong bond between father and son and at the same time highlight some problems with that relationship. Some scenes are obviously there to hammer in those two messages and the film would have been even better had they been made more subtle. I do recommend watching this film and I think it shows that Emilio Estevez' directing skills don't just pertain to Bobby.".

In recent months I've been treated to not just one but three deeply moving film treats. 127 Hours The Kings Speech and this movie The Way which is my favorite of all. These movies are all powerful and dense in content and emotion without the use of gratuitous sex or violence. They are adult real frank and thought provoking without being twisted or gross.These are three completely different movies from three different directors and with very different subject matter. Their only common thread is that they are simply good. Very good. Films like these are the reason I fell in love with the movies so very many years ago. The one which zeroed in on my individual heart though even among these three great films was The Way.There are plenty of great reviews here about the specifics of the film and I encourage you to read enough of them to pump you up to see it but don't try to find out too much about the movie. How it unfolds etc.. The movie itself can be a mini pilgrimage. Just go knowing you will enjoy it more than Twilight Part X and let your self be vulnerable to this beautiful movie.This film is a chance for you to have a 2 hour minipilgrimage of your own. To reflect on your own journey in life whatever form that it taking. To suffer die and be reborn in a brief afternoon at your local multiplex and to give a knowing smile and wink from time to time and to laugh as well. In short this masterpiece by Emilio Estevez takes you skillfully through all the stages that happen on real pilgrimage. It's brilliant on every level. It's writing cuts straight to the heart. The editing is perfect the cinematography gorgeous and the characters are extraordinarily real whether they make you cringe or want to give them a hug or both which is usually the case with not only these characters but all the real people we meet in our lives. This is us in miniature. All of us. Captured by a master craftsman.I'll actually be hurt if the academy doesn't recognize this truly amazing film. I'm not sure if it fits the typical Oscar M.O. but if it doesn't then the academy is blind. I want this film to do very well in all regards. It's what we need in Hollywood. It's time. We've done enough of the same old thing to last us a life time. How about a steady stream of gems and genuine works of personal love such as this being offered on many more screens than CGI sterility and vampire soap operas.This is one to savor and let it have it's way with you emotionally. There was literally not a dry eye in the sadly underpopulated theater my wife and I went to. One of only two screens in this city of hundreds to be showing the best movie out right now hands down.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Way 2010A charming movie that skirts around religious intentions and mixes in some good human tenderness and friendship. It's a feelgood movie for sure following four hikers who meet by accident on the road to Santiago de Compostela or the St. James Way. This is a pilgrimage road that many people have been rediscovering over the last thirty years it's frankly threatened to become overrun with walkers. The distance varies depending on where you start but can easily be 500 miles.So people who undertake this for whatever reason do so seriously. It's not a lighthearted enterprise and if you look online there are 10 reasons not to do it reminding walkers that much of the trip is near roadways and a very modern Spain. But this movie romanticizes the heck out of it and it makes it all a feelgood experience. There may be no particular revelations human or spiritual here but it's fun to get to know the people as they open up to one another.The main figure is Martin Sheen who carries with him on an impulse as you'll see the ashes of his son. Bereavement is written all over him and he tries to find meaning in life beyond the golfing and ophthalmology left behind for this trip. This plot idea takes a twist because the director is Sheen's son Emilio Estevez who also appears briefly.There is a little travelogue aspect here and a little filler like the whole section with the gypsies but it's all pretty and easy to watch. And the best of it is sweet without being saccharine.".

The distance varies depending on where you start but can easily be 500 miles.So people who undertake this for whatever reason do so seriously. It's not a lighthearted enterprise and if you look online there are 10 reasons not to do it reminding walkers that much of the trip is near roadways and a very modern Spain. But this movie romanticizes the heck out of it and it makes it all a feelgood experience. There may be no particular revelations human or spiritual here but it's fun to get to know the people as they open up to one another.The main figure is Martin Sheen who carries with him on an impulse as you'll see the ashes of his son. Bereavement is written all over him and he tries to find meaning in life beyond the golfing and ophthalmology left behind for this trip. This plot idea takes a twist because the director is Sheen's son Emilio Estevez who also appears briefly.There is a little travelogue aspect here and a little filler like the whole section with the gypsies but it's all pretty and easy to watch. And the best of it is sweet without being saccharine.";

	schema:reviewBody "I like nothing more than when you see a movie that you only have meagre expectations of maybe you'd heard of it or seen a trailer but don't know what to expect and then WHAM it blows you away. That is exactly what happened with Emilio Estevez's The Way. The movie is not your typical Hollywood blockbuster. It isn't fast paced it isn't full of action or riveting moments. Instead it is simple heart felt subtle and completely and utterly beautiful. Your emotions will just run high and while the movie has this dark undertone of sadness and grief the beauty and the spirit of the journey will lift you up and make you want to experience this again and again. I haven't seen a movie that made me feel this way in such a long time. The stunning scenery is only small part of this film but what a beautiful countryside this rag tag group of pilgrims experience. Its a story about four people from different walks of life on the same walk to experience something...anything...and you will walk with them step by step.Martin Sheen is a Hollywood icon and a terrific actor but this is probably his best role in years. Sheen gives a powerhouse performance that just makes you love and feel for this father looking desperately to find a son he's lost but also a piece of himself. Sheen is riveting and this was an award worthy performance. Yorick van Wageningen is Sheen's first companion that he meets. A dutch man who on the surface is walking The Way for his weight but you will learn much more about him. He seems a bizarre match to Sheen but they work well together and he is a lot of fun and adds a smile to the film. Deborah Kara Unger is the jaded and angry Canadian girl she really is Canadian! She adds a definitive flare to the cast with her sarcasm and biting wit but has perhaps the most to take from the journey. James Nesbitt is perhaps the least developed of the characters as he comes on late in the movie but he is still an important part of the cast and he is terrific. Nesbitt's character most importantly gets Sheen to finally open up about his son. Writer director and creator of the film Emilio Estevez plays the small role of Sheen's son. It is significant though because I think the intensity of the emotions Sheen displays is increased by the fact that Estevez is actually his son.Estevez really blew me away with his previous project Bobby. I've come to the conclusion that when Estevez cares about a project he puts every ounce of his soul into the film. The Way demonstrates what kind of passion he puts into his film. It is just beautiful in every sense of the word. The Spanish countryside is stunning the shots he uses of all of them together walking the trail and the relationship he creates between these four strangers who are completely different. I felt on the verge of tears through the whole film but not just because it is sad because there are scenes of sadness but just how heart felt and honest and passionate this movie is. Please see this beautiful and simple drama because it is magnificent. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "A tip of the cap to directorwriter Emilio Estevez for this one. He treats faith and spirituality with refreshing respect even though he plays it a bit too safe for my taste. This is a story about a father coming to grips with the loss of his son and does so honoring his memory on a famous pilgrimage the El camino de Santiago in Spain. It's a slowly developing character piece that simply involves pilgrims walking while seeking something along the way. The first half of the film suffers from the attempt to separate spirituality from religion. Nothing moving or profound happens during the first half of the journey. We get walking LOTS of walking but we also get to know the characters and are rewarded for doing so because the last half of the film really does shine. The varied motivations of his fellow pilgrims all come in to play and nothing really is what it seems with each person on the surface. Faith and purpose means different things to different people and the movie does explore that but does so with the lightest touch possible. There's no preaching or heavyhanded sermon stuff anywhere in site. It certainly is more broadly spiritual than specifically religious. It's a slow paced and ultimately light take on both spirituality and religion because it does play it safe. Audiences of faith will find it warm reverent and congenial but not as truly satisfying because of the cautious approach. Sheen's character is a professed lapsed Catholic but it's good to see those aspects dealt with in a meaningful and emotional manner. Some aspects of his faith are seen on the journey and certainly during the climactic scene at the shrine itself. As a Catholic I appreciated the little gestures others may not and especially the influence that St. James' shrine exerted on Sheen's character. Overall this is a wonderful character movie.".

His relationship with his son had not been his best until this moment completing his son's journey might give him an opportunity to find redemption and peace of mind.On his way to Compostela he is joined by a Dutch man an American woman and an Irish writer. Each of them has a story to tell seeks a connection to Avery who reluctantly lets them into his life. The journey takes them through interesting stops. One will probably end up saying miracles actually happen with the way the plot turns.In reality the film works well because the main actors give heartfelt performance. The entire cast is in fact amazing giving depth to characters that could have been clichs. The most touching is a surprise as the shallow Dutch man grows more and more interesting as he becomes our eyes and we are witnesses to a man who is processing the emotions his fellow companions are feeling.It's hard not to be moved by the display of faith in a film that could have gone overboard and become preachy. Instead he lets us participate in some personal experiences taking us through the way letting us see the surroundings the people at the different stops letting us become involved. It is a very moving experience.".

His relationship with his son had not been his best until this moment completing his son's journey might give him an opportunity to find redemption and peace of mind.On his way to Compostela he is joined by a Dutch man an American woman and an Irish writer. Each of them has a story to tell seeks a connection to Avery who reluctantly lets them into his life. The journey takes them through interesting stops. One will probably end up saying miracles actually happen with the way the plot turns.In reality the film works well because the main actors give heartfelt performance. The entire cast is in fact amazing giving depth to characters that could have been clichs. The most touching is a surprise as the shallow Dutch man grows more and more interesting as he becomes our eyes and we are witnesses to a man who is processing the emotions his fellow companions are feeling.It's hard not to be moved by the display of faith in a film that could have gone overboard and become preachy. Instead he lets us participate in some personal experiences taking us through the way letting us see the surroundings the people at the different stops letting us become involved. It is a very moving experience.";

In the end this is an overlong highly unoriginal movie with clumsy dialogue and clichd characters.The story of Martin Sheen walking the camino to complete his dead son's journey had all the potential to be great.

I'm sorry? There are far more effective ways to lose some weight an Irish writer with writer's block whose every utterance made me cringe  particularly his opening monologue about writers. And a Canadian woman who is angry at....what exactly? Throw in some clichd unbelievably friendly locals who react to our four pilgrims arrival in the various towns as if they're the first they've seen in months in spite of the fact that literally hundreds of people are doing this trek everyday. A particular shoutout goes to the Spanish gypsy in this respect.I was also kind of surprised that Estevez's character Daniel is still yelled at by his Dad for not doing anything with his life even though he's nearly 40. Time to get over it I think.I have some friends who did the last part of the Camino de Santiago and they said that you had to get to each town early to be sure of a bed that night  not like our 4 intrepid trekkers who can rock up whenever they want and have a choice of hostels! Also they had sores and blisters on their feet after 2 days and they would be fairly fit guys. Sheen on the other hand despite not being fit enough to walk around a golf course hardly has to stop for a breath.But OK there is some poetic licence involved in moviemaking.The positives The scenery is beautiful Sheen is in standard Sheen mode uptight and dignified and there are a few genuinely funny and moving moments.But every time something happens that makes you think maybe this movie is alright something happens that is completely unrealistic and condescending.

It is a common error that people assume everyone involved in Nazi Germany was evil a conspirator. We are exposed to Nazi Germany through our protagonist who has just been released from prison for involvement with the Communist party and has difficulty after 2 years adjusting to the new NationState and its attitudes. Despite his will to interfere protest change and be politically active in some form the film shows us how futile such efforts were. Other points it greatly demonstrates is the illusion of freedom and trust given to German citizens the genuine optimism Hitler and the NSDAP provided for the German people and how not only freedom of action is repressed but also freedom of THOUGHT. If you are looking for a westernized war film with explosions sex and death this is NOT for you. If you are willing to exercise your mind and put yourself back in time and place you may appreciate this. Regarding the previous posts about character and plot development...I found the plot to move at its own pace...I feel we are too conditioned to fast cuts and overexposition...this a 'thinkingfilm'. As for character this isn't 'Can't Hardly Wait' or 'The Breakfast Club'. The character development was Arnold's transition into selfdefeat realizing there was NOTHING of significance he could do in the mania of the charismatic heilHitlering and he can not even trust his own comrades. If you are interested in history and an unbiased neutral look into the zeitgeist of Nazi Germany I would suggest giving it a watch. And then you can make your own value judgements.other things that are fantastic about this film the shooting the editing lighting and mise enscene the acting the pace i.m.o. the subtleties you will notice if you have active eyes and afford your attention".

	schema:reviewBody "Yours Mine And Ours is one of the best family films of the 1960s. Very loosely based on the reallife story of Helen North a Navy widow with eight children who married Navy career man Frank Beardsley a widower with ten children of his own. Lucille Ball bought the rights to Mrs. Beardsley's book Who Gets The Drumstick? co produced it and took the starring role of Helen North. For those who know her chiefly as a comedienne this film will be a pleasant surprise. For not only does she have the opportunity to indulge in some of the slapstick she is famous for she proves conclusively that she was an excellent dramatic actress as well. Moreover she can switch abruptly and seemingly effortlessly from comedy to pathos sometimes in the same scene! Henry Fonda takes the part of Frank Beardsley and gives it both dimension and strength.

The kids are well cast and include future notables Tim Matheson Suzanne Cupito who grew up to be Morgan Brittany Mitch Vogel and Tracy Nelson. A good deal of the plot involves the mutual dislike most of the kids have for their stepsiblings but a great deal of charm is present as well. Aiding the production is a nice score by Fred Karlin a lovely song It's A Sometimes World and handsome San Francisco location photography. A remake has just been completed and will be released around the holiday season but it's not likely to top this one. Incidentally if you read the original book by Helen Beardsley you will most likely come away with a far different picture of the Beardsley family one which may not have transferred as well to the screen. This may also explain why there is no mention of the book as the story source in the movie's opening credits.".

	onyx:emotionText "Yours Mine And Ours is one of the best family films of the 1960s. Very loosely based on the reallife story of Helen North a Navy widow with eight children who married Navy career man Frank Beardsley a widower with ten children of his own. Lucille Ball bought the rights to Mrs. Beardsley's book Who Gets The Drumstick? co produced it and took the starring role of Helen North. For those who know her chiefly as a comedienne this film will be a pleasant surprise. For not only does she have the opportunity to indulge in some of the slapstick she is famous for she proves conclusively that she was an excellent dramatic actress as well. Moreover she can switch abruptly and seemingly effortlessly from comedy to pathos sometimes in the same scene! Henry Fonda takes the part of Frank Beardsley and gives it both dimension and strength.

In the end the film is so well done that I forgot about that.  Aside from the film Please Don't Eat the Daisies this is probably the best family movie of the 60's. The best thing about the film is the realistic way in which the family blends together.  The usual problems are all there and the way in which Fonda and Ball deal with it is about what one would expect a certain amount of good intentions a bit of mistake making sacrifice and providing a good deal of love and support. The writing may not be politically correct in this day and age the scene where Fonda's kids get Ball drunk Ball spanks one of the boys and there is also a certain amount of gender stereotyping but it is this that gives the film its appeal and relatability. As Leonard Maltin points out look for a some well known faces in the supporting cast.  Tom Bosley as the doctor Tim Matheson as Mike a four or five year old Tracey Nelson Morgan Brittany of Dallas fame 70's TV staple Ben Murphy as the oldest daughter's boyfriend and well known child actor Eric Shea who gives an endearing performance as young Philip the kid that seems the most lost in the big family. All in all Dad Fonda sums the whole thing up when he describes for the oldest daughter who's being pressured by the boyfriend to have sex what love is really about and how this family is staying together It isn't going to bed with a man that proves that you love him it's getting up in the morning and facing the drab miserable wonderful everyday world that counts. I suppose having 19 kids is carrying it a bit too far but if we had it to do all over again who would we skip you?

Since I was a teenager I remember really enjoying the character of Mike played by Tim Matheson.  I always thought he would go on to be a real big movie star instead of TV movies since he had lots of charisma and maturity at that young age.  However he has done very well in the roles on television he has played and is always a real treat to watch.  I don't think I thought Lucille Ball was too old the first time I saw it because anyone over 25 seemed old to me at the time!  I recently caught this movie on TV and enjoyed it again from an adult perspective. It was a little corny but still a good film.  Life in the sixties even with Vietnam and all was a much more innocent time especially with what kids face today.  I would give it a 100 just because it is so uplifting.".

Helen North Lucy is a widow with 8 kids and Frank Beardsley Fondais a navy captain with 10.  They fall in love and of course bedlam ensues as they try to unite two families.  Oh boy!!! Battling stepsiblings arguments over who gets which bedroom resentments toward the new stepparents etc.  It ends happily though with the family pulling together to welcome the new baby 19! and learning to love and live together as a happy family.Lucy plays her role with wonderful motherly warmth.  You can actually see the love she has for each of those children and her deep desire to have her new stepchildren love her.  However  she does treat us to some delightful Lucyish antics.  The scene in a crowded bar involving a wandering false eyelash and an uncooperative dress are absolutely classic  exactly the kind of comedy Lucy can do like no one else.  And yet these antics DO NOT dominate her performance or the film.  They are just little treats thrown in every so often.  Watch her expression in the next to last scene when Fonda's children tell her that she has been adoptedas our mother for life.  Henry Fonda brings a nice crisp authority to his role  it would have been easy to have made this man a caricature.  A scene towards the end where Lucy's oldest daughter turns to him for comfort and advice after dumping her oily boyfriend is lovely.  Van Johnson has some good lines as Fonda's best friend.  The kids are all very well cast and included some stars to be  Tim Matheson Tracy Nelson she's one of the very youngest kids Morgan Brittany billed as Suzanne Cupito and Eric Shea better known as the Robin in POSEIDON ADVENTURE.In all a heartwarming film with a strong emphasis on life second chances and a very positive spin on beauty and bond of family love.".

There is one scene where one of Fonda's children spikes Lucille Ball's drink. She gets drunk and makes a fool of herself much to the delight of the kids. I love that scene.

I think it was either 19 or 20!  Much more responsibility in this combined household.  Don't forget shopping day with the caravan of shopping carts I'm surprised collateral didn't have to be put up for the groceries.  The idea here is that the sheer enormity of this situation makes it so hilarious along with all the petty jealousies and conflicts inherent in all families creates a movie that viewers can relate to on several levels.  You don't need to have 20 kids to appreciate the film.  The Brady Bunch seemed too perfect.  The Norths and the Beardsleys had to put some tough love and effort into this to make it work and this is reflected in Yours Mine and Ours.  See it just for the fun of it.

But if I were asked what my favorite film of all time REALLY was I'd have to say Yours Mine and Ours which was one of the first movies my parents ever took me to along with a rerelease of Swiss Family Robinson and Steve McQueen's Bullitt as a fiveyearold. I've loved it my entire life and I have to admit my affection for it hasn't dimmed with age.  Although I realize it's not one of the great masterpieces of all time and I would never rate it as high as say Show or People or Casablanca or Schindler's List for that matter I still love this film all the same.I must admit that I am also a lifelong fan of I Love Lucy so the fact that Yours Mine and Ours stars Lucille Ball certainly has something to do with my fondness for this film.  And growing up in the '70's when costar Henry Fonda was relegated to cameo roles in awful films like The Swarm and Rollercoaster if it hadn't have been for his charismatic and likeable performance here I would never have known he was the great actor that he was.  Add the pleasure of Lucille's longtime friend Van Johnson in the prime supporting role of Darryl Fonda's best friend and an extremely young Tim Matheson as Fonda's oldest son and you have the foundation of an excellent cast in a lovely romantic comedy about the ultimate blended family think The Brady Bunch with brains and much much larger to boot.Very loosely based on a true story Ball is Helen North a recent widow with eight unruly children who moves to San Francisco for a fresh start.  While working at the infirmary at an unnamed Naval base she meets Naval Officer Frank Beardsley Fonda of course who is a recent widower himself with 10 children ! and has brought one of his daughters Suzanne Cupito aka '70's starlet Morgan Brittany in for treatment.  Helen and Frank are immediately smitten with each other and go out on a date but immediately break it off when they realize how many children their combined family would contain. Darryl realizes that eighteen children aside these two were made for each other and proceeds to plot to get them together.  They do eventually marry and this sets up many amusing scenes of this huge family trying to blend in together.  The nice thing about this film is that for once Lucille Ball is allowed to play a character completely different from Lucy Ricardo or Lucy Carmichael from The Lucy Show.  She is intelligent touching funny and very very human here.  In only one scene does she do any kind of Lucy shtick and that is during a wonderfully played drunk scene.  Even then she doesn't resemble her daffy TV persona as much as well a woman who's had too much to drink.  And the chemistry between Ball and Fonda is so believable as a child I found it hard to believe they were not really married in real life! Honest!  Johnson gives wonderful support and Tom Bosley has a few amusing scenes as the family's exasperated doctor.  I also loved the character of Madeline Love who Darryl sets Frank up with on a disastrous date that ends with her riding home between Frank and Helen who's been dumped by her Darrylarranged date.  Their discussion of their respective families ends with the hilarious exchange  Frank I'm glad I have ten children!  Helen I'm glad I have my eight!  Madeline  And I'm glad I'm careful!All in all this is an extremely enjoyable romantic comedy that grandkids can watch with their grandparents where everyone will be entertained and nobody will be embarassed.  An added treat  laughing at the '60's styles and hairdoes which look worse and worse with each passing decade.  They just don't make them like this anymore.  12 out of ".

Reminiscent of CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN the premise  a man and woman both with a huge family meet fall in love and marry  would be unbelievable if it weren't true.Based on the autobiographical novel by Helen Eileen Beardsley YOURS MINES AND OURS is a blueprint of sorts of future television shows The Brady Bunch and Eight is Enough but amps it up to eleven. While on those shows we never got to see just how a real household was handled being situation programs their stories were resolved in minimal time here we get glimpses of what happens at dinnertime or how groceries get done and it's those trivial things that keep the charming story in check instead of throwing it into lala land. Both Fonda and Ball are wellmatched and have funny scenes together despite that both actors were a little too old for their characters but it's not even a minor contrivance. Very enjoyable witty sunny just what this kind of movie should be.".

Reminiscent of CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN the premise  a man and woman both with a huge family meet fall in love and marry  would be unbelievable if it weren't true.Based on the autobiographical novel by Helen Eileen Beardsley YOURS MINES AND OURS is a blueprint of sorts of future television shows The Brady Bunch and Eight is Enough but amps it up to eleven. While on those shows we never got to see just how a real household was handled being situation programs their stories were resolved in minimal time here we get glimpses of what happens at dinnertime or how groceries get done and it's those trivial things that keep the charming story in check instead of throwing it into lala land. Both Fonda and Ball are wellmatched and have funny scenes together despite that both actors were a little too old for their characters but it's not even a minor contrivance. Very enjoyable witty sunny just what this kind of movie should be.";

And really who can complain when it showcases a young Tim Matheson giving us a glimpse of things to come remember Animal House?as well as a glimpse of the adorable Matheson sans shirt his scene with Tom Bosley at the draft board physical is one of the funniest in the movie. One of my favorite things is watching this movie and looking at the faces of the kids trying to see the adults they eventually became Tracy Nelson at about age 3 Eric Shea was about 6 or 7 Morgan Brittany who was a young teenager and FYI to the person who commented about her appearances in the Old Navy ads that was Morgan FAIRCHILD NOT Morgan Brittany. And to those who complain incessantly about the ages of Ball and Fonda at the time the film was made PLEASE! Get over it already! Half the fun of watching movies is being able to suspend disbelief for 2 hours. I think they looked awfully good regardless of their real ages. This movie once your kids get past their astonishment that people actually lived without 8 hours of TV a day showed respect for their elders most of the time and got by without PlayStation 2 ! is the perfect family movie.

Maybe it's funny because it is outdated. The movie was made a long long time ago in a day when comedy took priority over politically correct. With Madelyn Davis and Bob Carroll Jr writing the script it couldn't be anything but a sure fire winner. The two also provided their talents on I LOVE LUCY. Madelyn Davis was known as Madelyn PUGH during the I LOVE LUCY era.Lucille Ball in this movie has really taken a big risk in stepping out of her domain where she truly reigned as the queen of comedy. Her brilliance as a comedian has always been in her ability to act like the perfect scatterbrain driving a totally frustrated straight man well past his breaking point with her totally insane schemes. On TV this straight man was played by Desi Arnaz and later by Gale Gordon.In this movie Lucille Ball shone brighter than ever showing an ability to go from scatterbrain to serious to the point of tears and back so effortlessly. And there was no straight man to bounce her brand of comedy off of.Tom Bosely was hilarious as the family doctor with his deadpan approach. Seeing him later as Howard Cunningham in HAPPY DAYS I wonder if he was really acting or was he simply being himself? He certainly has that dry wit down to an art.Oh and then there is that issue of age. Lucille Ball was 57 and Henry Fonda was around 61 when the movie was made. This issue is obviously irrelevant. The movie was a hit when it was released in 1968. And it obviously beats that remake in 2005 hands down in spite of the age of leading roles in the remake.Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda rule!".

As is often the case Hollywood took what was a great story and tried to make it better  The portrayal of the family in the movie was not entirely accurate.SPOILERS COMPARING THE BOOK AND MOVIE1 The ages of some of the children were changed.  Some of the girls especially were made older in the movie I guess so they could have teenage angst!2 In reality the children were all in favor of the wedding and anxious for it to occur..3 Helen describes the children in favor of the adoptions although I understand five of the eight original North children did change their name back.  But they were all accepting of their new parent.Maybe the producers felt that 18 kids who came from two different families being willing to accept each other and not hate each other wouldn't fly so they tried to spice it up!".

I read the original book by Helen Beardsley Who Gets the Drumstick on which this film was based long before seeing the film so I remember from the book that at the time she was widowed Helen North was 32 years old.  No way would Lucy in her nurse's mufti pass for 33 in that infirmary scene with Henry Fonda.  I can't remember how old Frank Beardsley was  at least 8 or 10 years older than Helen though.  Still Henry Fonda didn't pass for fortysomething when he opened the film with Ohninehundred and looked at his watch on the way home to his kids.Second the situation with Louise which was not based on anything that happened in the book  Frank Beardsley actually met Helen North through his sister a nun in the school where Helen's kids enrolled after their father's death and their move from Washington State to the San Francisco area struck me as completely incredulous.  She was one of ten children including seven sisters and she's mad about having to share her room?  Surely by the time she hit fourteen she would've tried to make the best of the situation and learned that complaining did no good.Third in the scene where Frank is away on the shakedown cruise and Helen opens one of his letters the first thing you notice is La Lucille's flawlessly polished long nails and beautifully manicured hands.  A mother of eighteen who spends her days scrubbing cooking and doing laundry does not have hands like this.  My own mother only had five kids and trust me it doesn't work that way.  LOLI have no idea what the real Beardsley family thought about the movie that portrayed their story.  The original story as related in the book was really heartwarming and I think the screenwriters should've been more faithful to the book.  Helen Beardsley died on April 26 2000 of complications from Parkinson's Disease.  She was 70.  I understand that Frank is still living.".

It shows a lot more then the new movie So that's why we enjoyed it. The way they keep there selves hiding that they have so many children that they both had the same amount it's so funny. We loved how they hated every babysitter and mother in the movie and hid and scared them away in a week. It is one of the funniest movies in the world. It shows the truth about children to in all ages. Then they all work along after they started fighting the two family's It shows how 2 family's 18 kids get along together in a hilarious way.".

The dating seemed a bit hokey to me and HOllywooded but believe it or not Jane Fonda has revealed on a Barbara Walters interview that there was sparks between her father and Ms. Ball.Still it was Tim Matheson the voice of Jonny Quest and Eric Shea the voice of Linus Van Pelt who kept it moving. While Matheson resented the new family and mother he wasn't hostile to Shea who was indeed lost in the shuffle and going his own path. Ball might have been able to conceal her age more had her voice not have been gone as it was which for some reason makes her seem older anyway.Still things like the phone call with one of Fonda's daughters listening in was priceless and truly hilarious but Ball's conversation with the nun about Shea's last name was it North or Beardsley now was clumsy and awkward and really could have been structured better.I did not realize this was based on a true story which makes it all the more incredible.Actually Sherwood Schwartz had proposed the idea for the Brady Bunch to networks several years before and they wouldn't buy the show until the success of Yours MIne and Ours and With Six You Get Eggroll then the Brady Bunch got the major league green light. Also Here's Lucy was to be similar to Yours MIne and Ours with her having a bunch of kids but that was dropped in favor of her two real kids.And worth noting ubiquitous Larry Hankin appears as the grocery clerk Harry. Hankin appears in programs and movies over the next three decades but may be best recognized as the television Kramer on Seinfeld when Jerry sold the show within his show.".

Although I did like the speech that Fonda gives to one of his daughters on what real love is and why she should date someone other than her current loser boyfriend who's pressuring her to go all the way.Yes the movie has definitely aged very much a 60s movie despite being made in 1968 when so many of the movies in the late 60s reflected the rebelliousness and counterculture instead of family values. Not one of Fonda's or Lucy's best. The end was very predictable and mild spoiler I knew Lucy's character would get pregnant again. Heck they have 18 why not add one more I say? Ha ha. Average.

Henry Fonda plays a Navy veteran while Lucille Ball plays a nurse and their stories come together in a detailed narrative where we learn that they're both widowed and he has ten children while she has eight. That is more sex combined than a whole slew of porn stars and more labour pain than one human body should desire. Although insightful and clever it is also very obvious. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that they will marry and the children will struggle to adapt. What does work is the two leads. Fonda is terrific as a devoted father yet he misses he place within the Navy. Ball is hilarious particularly during a drunken dinner segment. Supporting roles are flat but then again who can keep track of these children? It is mind boggling to ponder someone having this many children. Tom Bosley is given a few witty lines as a doctor but even his appearance is pretty much standard issue. The kids are so many that one would think that popcorn had more personality.

The earlier courtship scenes are sweeter and funnier than the remainder of the film.In a large cast of children it's difficult to stand out  unless the script gives you something to do.

You won't regret it.";

Stephanie asked me as Dennis Quaid got splattered with paint fell in a pool of goo and then tripped over a flatulent pig that of course eats at the family dinner table. No they weren't I replied as I stared dumbfounded at the screen shaking my head over the fact that the writers expect us to laugh about kids vomiting and then falling in it.I suppose I should commend the movie for warning the audience right away just how bad a time they can expect to have if they attempt to sit through the full 90 minutes. If the Nickelodeon Films moniker fails to send up any red flags then the fact that Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo possibly the hottest 51yearold woman on the planet meet rekindle their high school relationship get engaged get married and buy a brand new house all within the first 10 minutes should seal the deal that it's in your best interest to sprint to the exit and ask for your money back.There are two legitimately funny scenes in the movie one involving Dennis Quaid brushing his tongue. Everything else has been done several times with equally unfunny results. Oh look Dennis Quaid's son has accidentally started up a forklift at the store! Oh look Dennis Quaid just jumped on the forklift and his head is bumping against every box in the store! Oh look Dennis Quaid's credibility can actually be seen leaking out of the screen! That's what's considered funny these days?And just when you think things can't get any worse the writers decide to blindside us with an ending so ridiculously sappy that you'll be wishing you brought your trusty yellow bucket and you'll pray for an end to your dry heaving. I officially hate lighthouses now.I suppose 10yearold girls might enjoy this but if you value your time or money then I recommend that you stay away. Far away. This is a movie so the opposite of hilarious that I'm forced to come up with a new word for it  lolarious pronounced lowlarious. Feel free to use the word amongst friends. Hopefully its popularity will spread and it will one day be added to the dictionary. At least then I could say one good thing came out of the film.As it stands Yours Mine and Ours ain't mine I'm pretty sure you don't want it to be yours and if we made it ours then we'd only end up arguing over who would be the one to get rid of it.".

Both recently widowed the two find the old sparks again immediately and marry on a whim. There's one catch. Frank has eight children and Helen has ten children many adopted.Someone should tell the writers of Yours Mine and Ours that chaos does not equal funny. Two parents eighteen kids one crazy nanny and one pig all live under the same house so hilarity is supposed to ensue right? Well not in this film. All of the laughs are few and far in between and when the movie is over all you're left with is one big headache. Kids will most likely eat this one up but they deserve better films than this. It's no surprise that this film is a dud since its directed by Raja Gosnell. He is your typical bland director and he doesn't have much imagination. He always puts the lamest jokes and pratfalls into his films like Dennis Quaid falling face first into a bucket of paint.Dennis Quaid plays the uptight father and he pretty much makes a fool of himself here. He seems to be trying so hard to get a laugh from the audience but he fails. I'm surprised he took this role since this is a little out of his usual element but I guess Tim Allen was busy. Rene Russo plays his wife and she was okay but a little bland. After this film and Two for the Money she needs a new agent because she actually is talented. There were so many kids that it was hard to keep track of them. Most of them were either bland or they played annoying characters. There were a few that showed a little potential for the future but I wouldn't hold my breath. In the end a weak story very few laughs weak acting and bad direction equals a poor film and this movie is better left on the shelf. Rent the original instead. Rating 310".

As plans are set in motion the once loving relationship between the unsuspecting Quaid and Russo quickly deteriorates into heated arguments hurt feelings and tearful nights. Charming stuff.There are very few laughs in this movie. Ten minutes of 18 kids doing their best to destroy their fixerup lighthouse home was enjoyable.

	schema:headline " Waste of time";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie Yours Mine and Ours was a terrible movie and a waste of my time to watch. The reasons are quite simple the actors sucked and the plot was the stupidest.The children supposedly don't like each other and have nothing in common. And instead of trying to explain to their parents that they can't stand each other have nothing in common and were unfairly forced together without their say they make a plan to try to break up their parents. Obviosly the kids have no respect toward their parents and their feelings even the older ones. So what ends up happening is they begin ruining their parents life.What I find the stupidest part of the movie and what really made it a waste of my time is that these kids supposedly don't like each other. Well it takes a lot of teamwork to pull of the tricks that they were pulling on their parents. They learned to respect each other and eventually even like each other and yet they were still trying to break their parents apart? The whole reason they wanted to part their parents is because they couldn't stand each other. So why didn't they stop their plan when they began to get along each other? Stupid plot stupid movie.The pig was a stupid addition these guys would not had made this movie without their stupid goals behind it. They said hey lets remake the 1968 movie Yours Mine and Ours so we can outnumber the kids in cheaper by the dozen. And then said hey lets add a potbellied pig so we can have an original family pet just like in The Pacifier. Also the fact the Quaid was married to another dress designer like in The Parent Trap. They take the wreckless slapstick style with no humor in it. This movie is a rip off of so many things and lacks the ability to make me laugh.And another stupid thing about this movie is the character Helen North. She has disciplinophobiaNot a real word as far as I know. She is scared of discipline total hippie. There is Nothing I hate more than somebody whether they are real or a character who is afraid to put their foot down. After the kids trash that store I thought their would be heavy consequences. After they throw that party without their parents permission behind their back when their home is full of complete strangers trashing their house and when the kids are neglected stored away and sick on junk food she tells Frank to relax?! I would expect any health parent to ship their kids off to military school after a stunt like thatonly the kids that threw the party. She is in a relaxing mood at a time like this? Pathetic and worse than that she was afraid to set any rules or boundaries. When Frank says There is nothing wrong with having rules. Everybody lives by them the entire universe lives by them. She says Well then Frank that's the last thing these kids need from me. There's only one rule I know and that's at any time all of this can be over. Taken away from you forever then who needs more rules after that.. Sounds a lot like a divorce threat to me. Why would any parentespecially a parent of ten want no rules or boundaries for their kids? Unrealisticly a terrible character it pisses me off so much I want to take my fist and..........I found nothing good about this movie except its alright for anybody 9 and under. I would have voted 0 but I can't.Also I feel sorry for all of you so naive to actually enjoy this movie. God remove the devil inside you for it.Don't waste your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The advent of mixed families is certainly more relevant today than it was when this film was originally made in 1968 with Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda in the leads but that doesn't make this newer version a better film  not by a long shot.That movie was quaint and cute for it's time had a great emotional conclusion and even inspired the television series The Brady Bunch. This is  by far  one of the worst films of the Year of Bad Films. It is directed by Raja Gosnell which is appropriate because he was responsible for both horrid ScoobyDoo movies as if he were hit on the head with a huge circus mallet. This picture tries to combine joy love comedy pathos and crude slapstick into a rollicking family good time.It doesn't work. The leads Renee Russo Two for the Money and Dennis Quaid Flight of the Phoenix have no chemistry and the children  all amazingly attractive but talentless  are nothing more than annoying and idiotic. The situations they are tossed into are farfetched ridiculous and worst of all totally unfunny. Not the best thing to say about a comedy.Frank Beardsley Quaid is a widower with eight mostly cute blonde blueeyed children and a Coast Guard Admiral to boot. He runs the family well like a Coast Guard Admiral constantly blowing his hornpipe having them fall in and organizing them into work groups. After moving to New London Conn. in one of the great plot conveniences of alltime he meets widow Helen North a freespirited handbag designer who knew Frank in high school.Within one jump cut  and without meeting each other's offspring  the two tie the knot. Thus when the families finally get together the kids  naturally  hate each other. Among these actors there is every type of clich a Boy Scout a military cadet a cheer leader a punk rocker a grunge singer a couple of sets of twins two precocious little boys and other assorted goofballs.Also to keep things as diverse and politicallycorrect as possible Helen adopted six of hers including some Mexicans Indians a jive black dude and a gay Asian. It's like the floor of a Democratic National Convention. Add to this mishmash a potbellied pig why directors think a strange pet is funny is way beyond me  remember the duck in The Pacifier? who makes about 100 appearances including at a hardware store at the kids' school and in Frank's bed and you have a recipe for Holiday disaster. It's like having the whole family over and your father gets fallingdown drunk and knocks over the tables with the food on it. No wait that would actually be humorous. This movie is a bomb like none dropped on the slums of Baghdad by Dick Cheney.If this film were any more of a dog it would be dragging its butt across the driveway. And after the 10th fight in which the children mess up and destroy the house a store and everything else in sight you start to feel a little sick to your stomach.It was also more than a little embarrassing to see Quaid doing lame slapstick he gets splattered with paint and vomit covered with sand knocked to the ground and falls in a wading pool full of slime and playing second fiddle to a bunch of little brats. Of course he deserves it for taking on this role once played so well by Henry Fonda.Russo who allows her evil moppets to get away with anything doesn't fare as bad  unless you count her involvement in this travesty. Best to leave this Thanksgiving turkey in the oven take a few extra minutes and find the original you'll thank me for it.".

A stern Coast Guard admiral who regiments his ten offspring like so many deck swabbies meets a freespirit who lets her eight kids run wild and these polar opposites fall instantly in love? Then like two infatuated teenagers they impulsively run off and elope faster than you can say Vegas wedding with Elvis please. After this the movie just disintegrates into a parade of scenes of this mob of kids yelling crying fighting breaking things or something always falling on the dad. No comedy just tired overused old jokes and monotonously boring. The plot is built upon these hateful creeps plotting to destroy their parents' marriage and happiness. Funny? No it's not. Typical of this inept movie is the routine ending which doesn't even fit the action that precedes it.

	schema:headline " These Ratings Need Negative Numbers for Movies like This";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was so bad that the only recommendation they could find for the DVD cover was The best family comedy of the year! from the I think nonexistent Film Advisory Board.The original with Lucille Ball Henry Fonda and Van Johnson was on Turner Classic Movies recently. While not a classic or a work of art it was solidly made and from what I remember told the story of this blended family in a fairly accurate manner.The remake has so little to do with the original that it could have been written with different character names and probably nobody would have remembered. At the very least they should have had the decency to credit as inspired by rather than based upon the original screenplay. At least they had the decency not to mention Helen Beardsley's book it's probably out of print anyway on the poster.The first mystery about it is how four producing entities Paramount Nickelodeon Films MGM and Columbia could blow 45 MILLION on a movie that looks so cheap. Where in the world did that money go? No flying saucers no earthquakes no aliens. Some 40 plus million either went into somebody's pockets or up somebody's nose. It sure didn't show on screen.And whose idea was it to get all those politically correct adopted and foster children in there? I guess this was a ploy to trick minority audiences out of their hardearned money to see this.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was so bad that the only recommendation they could find for the DVD cover was The best family comedy of the year! from the I think nonexistent Film Advisory Board.The original with Lucille Ball Henry Fonda and Van Johnson was on Turner Classic Movies recently. While not a classic or a work of art it was solidly made and from what I remember told the story of this blended family in a fairly accurate manner.The remake has so little to do with the original that it could have been written with different character names and probably nobody would have remembered. At the very least they should have had the decency to credit as inspired by rather than based upon the original screenplay. At least they had the decency not to mention Helen Beardsley's book it's probably out of print anyway on the poster.The first mystery about it is how four producing entities Paramount Nickelodeon Films MGM and Columbia could blow 45 MILLION on a movie that looks so cheap. Where in the world did that money go? No flying saucers no earthquakes no aliens. Some 40 plus million either went into somebody's pockets or up somebody's nose. It sure didn't show on screen.And whose idea was it to get all those politically correct adopted and foster children in there? I guess this was a ploy to trick minority audiences out of their hardearned money to see this.

So they put aside their differences and work together to split their parents up and get things back the way they were. And naturally the parents don't suspect a thing when the kids start going to extremes.And of course things work out. And kids realize they've made a mistake. They go too far and feel bad Mom cried herself to sleep. I don't understand that part. You feel bad kids? Really? My god who ever could have thought that acting like brats and ruining every aspect of your parents' lives would be a bad idea? Really I figured that pushing every button you know of till they snap would be a good idea.And the ending is just so corny. My Beautiful Lighthouse Keeper? Give me a break here. Now that I've trashed the kids let's move on to the parents. An artisthippiewhatever marries a superstrict naval officer.

The pig...why does the family own a pig? The housekeeper...not needed she's actually scary. When you get to the core bone of the movie...there isn't much there. The plot is as thin as the humor. If you must see a movie where a bunch of selfish kids try and work over their parents due to a petty thing like moving go see Cheaper by the Dozen. Steve Martin is actually funny unlike Dennis Quaid. Honestly there was only one entire scene in the whole movie that got a real laugh out of me at the party sceneWho here lives here kids raise hands.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a documentary to expose the sexual abuse done by catholic clergymen to children and to expose the subsequent systematic cover up done by the church.Due to the disturbing nature of the film it is hard not to judge it without reference to morals. It is wrong to abuse children. I never imagined the extent of betrayal and deceit in the catholic priests' scandal. It is shocking scary and disgusting.Talking about the film proper I think it is very nicely done. How Jyono's family turns from support to anger is touchingly portrayed. Putting Nancy's trauma with Jyono's support seem to give a balanced picture of the situation. That is until later when the truth is revealed. Anne Jyono's trauma is central to the film because Anne still has faith despite all the wrongs done to her. The most heartbreaking scene in the film is when Anne breaks down after hearing her father lost faith and announces that There is no God.With the actual convict also appearing to give interview I find Deliver Us From Evil the most convincing and truthful. It is sad to see that O'Grady's guilt is very superficial.A truly outstanding film is able to evokes a plethora of emotions. Especially sadness disgust sympathy. Deliver Us From Evil is able to do all these. It seamlessly takes viewers into a journey of trauma and despair of the victims the guilt of the family members for being to trusting deceit and ruthless lies to cover things up.The other brave souls who overcome all the obstacles and let the world know about these heinous crimes are remarkable. The people who funded and worked on this film are remarkable. They face an insurmountable giant and they are not afraid to speak out. They need to let the world know. This film is shocking touching and saddening. It breaks my heart to see hundreds of thousands of lives wrecked by their trusted authority figure. I hope Deliver Us From Evil will deliver children away from evil.".

It is shocking scary and disgusting.Talking about the film proper I think it is very nicely done. How Jyono's family turns from support to anger is touchingly portrayed. Putting Nancy's trauma with Jyono's support seem to give a balanced picture of the situation. That is until later when the truth is revealed. Anne Jyono's trauma is central to the film because Anne still has faith despite all the wrongs done to her. The most heartbreaking scene in the film is when Anne breaks down after hearing her father lost faith and announces that There is no God.With the actual convict also appearing to give interview I find Deliver Us From Evil the most convincing and truthful. It is sad to see that O'Grady's guilt is very superficial.A truly outstanding film is able to evokes a plethora of emotions. Especially sadness disgust sympathy. Deliver Us From Evil is able to do all these. It seamlessly takes viewers into a journey of trauma and despair of the victims the guilt of the family members for being to trusting deceit and ruthless lies to cover things up.The other brave souls who overcome all the obstacles and let the world know about these heinous crimes are remarkable. The people who funded and worked on this film are remarkable. They face an insurmountable giant and they are not afraid to speak out. They need to let the world know. This film is shocking touching and saddening. It breaks my heart to see hundreds of thousands of lives wrecked by their trusted authority figure. I hope Deliver Us From Evil will deliver children away from evil.";

I was fighting tears during most of the film. It was hard not be moved considering the victims' plight and considering the very priest that presided over my wedding was himself imprisoned for sexual assaults committed in the past. Some will say that Amy Berg's documentary paints a onesided pretty ugly picture of the Catholic Church. But the Church didn't always help itself when expressing doubt ignoring or by just refuting cases of abuse committed by priests. The director was there at the premiere of her documentary at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was interesting to hear her talk about Father O'Grady. For her it seems that by agreeing to be interviewed for this film it was some kind of a way to be freed from whatever guilt he may have. You can sense that this guy puts a lot of importance in showmanship. Seen at the Varsity during the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9th 2006.88100 ".

I read elsewhere that the term abuse is a euphemism for much more sordid acts namely the physical rape of an innocent child.This film examines the history of one pedophile priest in the United States and how his acts were simply coveredup by the Catholic hierarchy. He performed innumerable acts on both male and female children. Even though some parents reported this to the Catholic ministry it was only when police officials became involved that he was arrested. There are many interviews with both the victims and those in the Church hierarchy who covered it up as well as the pedophile himself.So are we provided with many different angles. The documentary never becomes accusatory in itself  but it allows us to view the heartwrenching lives of the victims and their families. They try to extract an apology from the Vatican but this is all in vain.It even brings us to view the life of this eerie pedophile not presented as evil incarnate but as a human being with a severe psychological problem. At times you can feel his ingratiating performance even as he acknowledges the severity of what he has done. This is a rare film that deals with both oppressor and oppressed.The film is about several things the nature of the evil that exists in this pedophile the corruption of the Catholic Church the Church's refusal to deal with sexual issues and admit its crimes against humanity but most of all it is about the torment of the victims who are left alone with their families to struggle on with their lives.

If one is attracted to a person sexually a man a woman at whatever age one also associates that quality with the object of even the most conventional Catholic marriage. So to a man who from the start of his sexual growth is trained as a Catholic priest what's the difference between an object of pure lust and an object of affection? The danger in turn is not merely a danger to his own self but a danger to those objects of lust and affection of his. What's more religion is extremely important to many people in all cultures. These people have children who are raised with an obedient conventional moral code that links inscrutability with their elders whose trust is very easy for a neighborhood priest their nearest connection with God to acquire.Watching Amy Berg's effective documentary Deliver Us from Evil is a compelling encounter. Her interview cases betray to the camera virtually insufferable stratums of grief and its audience goes home feeling both bewilderment and anger. There is an integral interview subject who is an Irish Catholic priest who is undeterred by where Catholic orthodoxy has led his decisions to rape and molest 25 children who looked up to him saw him as a father and is living out his days in the Irish countryside. If any citizen otherwise had committed the same crime they would be playing the role of the child to a much bigger stronger rapist for decades. What is it about this ideology that causes people all over the world to treat related matters with superiority over everyone else? I suppose it is the centuries of tradition that is reassuring to society even while these families are burdened with crippling depths of shame for as long as they last. The weight of their shame is directly related to that of the trust they put into their victimizers.The film is not an indictment of people who practice the Catholic faith. Not by any means. It is a buoy for the devoutly faithful subjects surrounding Father Oliver O'Grady who in the 1970s and '80s committed his crimes only to spend a mere seven years in prison and still keep his job a voice and a vent for them. I know I haven't said much about the film itself but the fact that I would rather talk about what the film made me think about should speak of the value of seeing it.".

One thing led to another and I totally forgot about the movie. Recently I started thinking about it again but I couldn't remember the name. I'm glad I tracked it down because it is truly an amazing film. I'm a Catholic and went to Catholic schools from Kindergarten through high school. That being said you don't have to be Catholic to watch this film. You don't even have to be religious. Simply put everybody should see this movie. For those who don't know Deliver Us From Evil chronicles pedophile priest Oliver O' Grady. The film soon unfolds into a decades long conspiracy by the church to cover up O 'Grady's actions. The scary thing about this film is that you're not really sure who the bigger villain is. Is it Father O' Grady a priest who rapes and molests children? Or is the true villain the Bishops and Monsignors who turned a blind eye and just moved O' Grady from parish to parish. Possibly the most disturbing aspect of the film is that while watching Father O' Grady discuss his actions it's hard to tell if he really believes that what he did was wrong. He's so matter of fact and creepy you just want to jump through the TV and strangle him. Deliver Us From Evil is shocking in the sense of how high up the conspiracy goes. The Pope is literally an accomplice in cases such at this. More than anything the one theme I came away with after watching Deliver Us From Evil is that the Church is a business and just like everything else in the world is wrapped up in politics more than anything else.".

A study in the betrayal of trust and the irresponsibility of authority. In addition to giving faces and voices to victims who are often anonymous it offers an interview with a convicted expriest who admits his crimes without remorse. Deliver Us from Evil presents three case studies of Father O'Grady's abuse. Simply put jawdropping.In the 1970s and 80s Father O'Grady was serving as a parish priest in several towns in Central California where he molested children over and over again both boys and girls including a 9monthold. Filmmaker Amy Berg masterfully exposes just how deeply rooted the corruption runs. Armed with anguished testimony from the families of the abused and their lawyers she seamlessly presents indisputable evidence that the Church knew about O'Grady's activities. The hierarchy moved him from one parish to another simply to avoid public scandal and to prevent destroying the careers of those in power.Present day and walking around the streets of Dublin O'Grady peers into a schoolyard with an interest that can only appear perverse after what's been revealed about him. He seems so removed from his crimes that he could be an actor playing the part of a pedophile expriest. That he agreed to appear in Deliver Us From Evil is an indication not just of an oversized ego but also a complete failure to comprehend of what he has actually done. Father O'Grady walks freely today in Ireland not even registered as a sex offender. Deliver Us From Evil has already prompted legal attention in Los Angeles toward Cardinal Roger Mahoney who allowed more than 550 priests under his jurisdiction to molest children without punishment.Watching this documentary and especially the interviews with O'Grady is so much more disturbing than any piece of fiction could ever be. This is a real monster victimizing children and it was allowed by a group that was claiming to do God's work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deliver Us from Evil recounts the life of former Catholic priest Oliver O'Grady as a serial child molester in Northern California from 1973 until his conviction in 1993. During this period O'Grady sexually abused twenty five children while prominent leaders of the church failed to ensure basic legal protections for the victims despite knowledge of the abuse.The emotions in this grim documentary are raw and real. Director Amy Berg uses on camera interviews with the now exiled O'Grady and several of his victims to present a compelling moral indictment against the Roman Catholic Church for their blind engagement and silencing of decades of sexual abuse.The sobering stories of the victims give us a full grasp of the psychological ramifications of childhood sexual abuse the stunted emotional growth and the persistent pain and shame that clings throughout the entirety of a victims life. O'Grady's appearances being equally poignant provide an intimate glimpse into a child molester's psyche. However his candor and seemingly cavalier attitude towards the casualties of his heinous acts is difficult to grasp. The former priest appears unmoved by his wrongdoings and does not express genuine remorse nor shy away from discussing his lewd pedophillic urges.Towards the end of the film we learn that O'Grady himself had been abused as a child by a member of the clergy and his older brother. With this revelation it becomes clearer why O'Grady is the monster that he is.".

During this period O'Grady sexually abused twenty five children while prominent leaders of the church failed to ensure basic legal protections for the victims despite knowledge of the abuse.The emotions in this grim documentary are raw and real.

	schema:reviewBody "Deliver Us From Evil opens this Thursday in selected cinemas. I had already ordered the DVD from the USA but was privileged to attend a preview screening tonight in Brisbane and witness its impact on the big screen and on a large audience.Deliver Us From Evil is an Academy Award nominated feature film about the Catholic Church's routine practice of covering up and refusing to cooperate when accusations of sexual abuse are made against their clergy. We are told of the Church's official attitude that even a molesting priest is more valuable than any lay person.It's a hard hitting story which leaves you shaking with anger at a religious organisation which is fatally dominated by selfobsessed fanatics as well as riddled with cronies desperate to do anything and cover up anything in order to get to the top.No surprise therefor that the Catholic Church refused to be interviewed for the film  however the main subject Oliver O'Grady a serial paedophile with hundreds of Churchaccessed victims is quite happy to talk things over. He discusses his child abuse activities as if they were just bad decisions that he happened to make at the time.O'Grady is a sick man but his supervisors were very well aware of his activities and rather than just do nothing they actually enabled his access to new victims by quickly shifting him to another parish whenever the heat was on. O'Grady's superior Cardinal Mahoney had his eyes firmly set on being a papal candidate.The filmmakers make the clear point that the Catholic Church was sending up a smokescreen in announcing its witchhunt for gay priests in seminaries  when the vast majority of paedophile priests are known to be heterosexual. It is claimed that 10 of USA Catholic clergy have abused children  with perhaps hundreds of thousands of victims yet to be identified.The official film website includes useful information on the press page  such as the 1962 Vatican instruction to all Bishops on the procedure for covering up sexual abuse scandals  with the prime objective of protecting the Church from financial loss. I checked the website for that document tonight and even though it's listed the hyperlink draws a page not found. Hopefully the link will be restored.Pope Benedict is shown as being up to his neck in direct responsibility for the official actions of the Church in systematically protecting paedophiles at the expense of the victims. However we're advised that President George W. Bush Jnr kindly granted him immunity from prosecution. Maybe George is hoping for a reciprocal pardon for the many thousands of deaths he's responsible for in Iraq.Deliver Us From Evil is a necessary force for doing good in the world  opening the viewer's eyes to this further proof that absolute power corrupts absolutely. The Catholic Church will win no new converts because of this film  but you'd hope that those who do remain with the organisation will aggressively demand action to reach out with honesty and compassion to the victims to ensure that in future lay people not the clergy come first and to ensure that no further systemic abuse is possible.This film made me damned glad to be a longterm exCatholic.Definitely 10 out of 10  but with the warning that this is not a date movie unless you've got a thing for heated post movie debriefings.".

Also too much time was spent with the renegade reformer Catholic priest and his views which are not Catholic ones as initially presented. These and other Michael Moore type moments in the film are minor quibbles and for the most part the story is poignantly told by the participants.Strangely enough the major villain is not the creepy pedophile O'Grady. Although an obvious manipulator and liar like most pedophiles he claims he was abused as a boy by both his siblings and his priest whose name he can't recall... he seems to be very simple and perhaps a bit mentally challenged.

	schema:reviewBody "I used to think the best documentary ever made was Morgan Spurlock's eyeopening expose 'Super Size Me' investigating the rampant obesity in America resulting in too much fast food. That is until I saw Amy Berg's masterful 'Deliver Us From Evil'. 'Deliver Us From Evil' besides from being the best documentary I've ever seen is also one of the most important. 'Deliver Us From Evil' is powerful heartwrenching riveting and extremely difficult to watch but it's emotionally rewarding in the end. The extremely controversial documentary exposes pedophilia and sexual abuse of little children in the hands of Catholic clergy members namely Father Oliver O'Grady. The film does this by interviews with different priests bishops and Cardinals of the Catholic church involved with O'Grady interviews with the victims and families of the victims of O'Grady and most surprisingly a willing and cooperative series of interviews with O'Grady himself. O'Grady now an older man living free in Ireland admits to molesting these children admits what he did was wrong but says he just couldn't help himself. Most surprisingly 'Deliver Us From Evil' doesn't go out of it's way to paint O'Grady as a twisted monster but actually to show almost a shred of sympathy towards him. But after seeing the shockingly tragic and tearinducing interviews of the victims and their families it's hard to feel much sympathy for O'Grady and the highranking members of his parish that went out of their way to cover the incident up by just sending O'Grady to another parish somewhere else. That's great solve the problem by sending him somewhere else so he can meet more impressionable young kids to take advantage of. Besides making you extremely sad 'Deliver Us From Evil' will no doubt make you angry at the Catholic Church for not doing anything to solve this problem. Calling it a problem isn't right because it's so much more than that. It's a disgusting and blatant betrayal of trust. Perhaps the most terrifying sequence of 'Deliver Us From Evil' happens towards the beginning of the film during an interview with O'Grady himself. He is talking about what stimulates him and his explanation goes something like this  People ask if I'm aroused by a man. I say no. People ask if I'm aroused by a woman. I say no. People ask if I'm aroused by a child. I say yeah maybe. People ask if I'm aroused by a child in a bathing suit. I say probably. People ask if I'm aroused by a child naked. I say you betcha. If that doesn't turn your stomach I don't know what will. My only complaint with 'Deliver Us From Evil' is it's oddlystructured in some parts. All in all I highly recommend this film to everyone regardless of if they can handle it or not. It's just one of those films that needs to be seen. Grade A".

	schema:headline " O'Grady upset some but deeply remorsefulI don't think so";
	schema:reviewBody "Attn Contains spoilersFirst although O'Grady did have the courage to participate in the making of this film and although he commented several times that the molestation events should never have occurred still he came across as a man not fully comprehending the great harm that he had done to the children he molested many of whom are now grown adults nor to their families. His attitude conveyed in the film was if not insouciant at least shallow Well I did a bad thing and I'm sorry so I'll write a letter to my victims apologizing and then we can all get on with our lives. Although not phony it certainly didn't strike me that he felt any deep remorse for what he had done. Several other comments are these 1 We don't learn until the last third of the movie that O'Grady himself was a victim of abuse chiefly by his older brother Would it have been pertinent if he had participated in the film? but also by a priest whose name O'Grady had either forgotten or repressed. This is not surprising in itself since most pedophiles have a history of abuse but O'Grady didn't seem to draw the connection of these experiences with his own problem. Amazing! 2 It is clear that several members of the higher clergy of the Roman Catholic Church were cognizant of O'Grady's criminal activities. Rather than turn him over to the police and drum him out of the Church they merely shuffled him around from parish to parish. The topping on the cake so to speak was when Mahony appointed O'Grady as the sole priest in charge of a parish San Andreas in Calaveras County CA. Ultimately the Roman Catholic Church failed utterly to address the problem and it is clear by the activities of Father Tom Doyle that it still has failed to come to grips with the issue. The Church's behavior exhibits a perfect example of the ostrich effect Stick your head in the sand and maybe the whole problem will blow away with the wind. 3 The film did bring out the idea of the possibility of the Roman Catholic clergy failing to distinguish among different levels of sexual activity that a priest might have lumping them all together under illicit sex. This suggests that they would equate sex with an adult female as equivalent to sex with a minor when clearly what must be distinguished is the maturity and complicity of the person with whom the priest engages in a sexual act assuming that he indeed do so. 4 It also strongly suggests that seminarians particularly those entering the Roman Catholic priesthood undergo some sort of psychological evaluation by a competent person to determine if they are fit material for the priesthood. 5 The other issue that rose in my mind watching the movie was whether pedophilia is as widespread among clerics of other Christian sects and nonChristian clerics. Even if a man be allowed to marry as is the case with most Protestant pastors Eastern Orthodox priests and Jewish rabbis a pedophile is attracted to young children and the fact that he's married or not probably doesn't bear on his predilection from a psychological standpoint. 6 Given that the film focused on a Roman Catholic priest at the time he committed the molestations and who is still a practicing Roman Catholic no one asked O'Grady the obvious questions that had been going through my mind Mr. O'Grady when you were contemplating molesting a child were you not aware that by so doing you were committing a mortal sin? And by carrying through your thought to an overt act were you not aware that you were committing an even more heinous mortal sin? Surprisingly no one asked O'Grady these questions.".

It's very apparent that very little effort was put into this one.The premise is pretty lame. Keldeo is determined to become a Sword of Justice and to become one he must defeat the monster Kyurem. Ash and the gang tag along for no reason other than that the plot requires it.The three Swords of Justice that have been training Keldeo are all boring onedimensional characters that were not explored or developed properly and we don't even get to see much of them. Kyurem also isn't given much depth and we get no back story about him whatsoever.There are many things that don't work and are done only to keep the plot moving such as the train tunnel ex machina scene and the gang conveniently finding a blimp to get away in from an abandoned museum how did they get the blimp to even work anyway?!.The script is very weak and contains too much obligatory dialogue. The use of flashbacks in this film is far too numerous and is even very strange in some instances. The plot kind of meanders and mostly feels like an extended TV episode. It also didn't help that Iris and Cilan are in the movie.There are some all right action scenes and the animation is pretty nice but at this point that doesn't really cut it anymore.This is one of the worst Pokmon movies if not the worst. This film has very little to offer even the least demanding of Pokmon fans. I just wish more thought and care was put into this.

	schema:reviewBody "Pokmon the Movie Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice 2012 marks the return of theatrical Pikachu short with Meloetta's Moonlight Serenade. I like these anime shorts because they are usually without any human characters and have nice graphics. The Pokmon would be on their own speaking pure Poknese with narrator and though the format seems to be specially made for children personally I quite enjoy watching them!As the title suggests this animated feature is about the battle between the legendary dragon Pokmon Kyurem and the Sword of Justice quartet. It has interesting rite of passage and friendship plot but these featured Pokmon however speak human language through telepathy which is understandable but I thought it was too much to my liking. It is tolerable though. On a positive note the plot could be difficult to understand if we have to figure out everything these characters said in Poknese by ourselves right?What's different with this animated feature compared to older Pokmon films is that since generation IV Diamond  Pearl series there are more alternate forms of Pokmon. They are truly interesting but unfortunately I can't really say I enjoy generation V Best Wishes! series. From my personal Pokmon Movie Marathon I have realised that this generation could be my least favorite but that won't hinder me from reviewing it just like how I did with the rest of the animated features. It only means that I find them less appealing compared to the rest!Those aside Pokmon the Movie Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice 2012 ultimately makes a great family film. Although there are flaws it promotes great values and has great messages. From fear is our greatest enemy being reckless is no good and what we learn from defeat failure is most important the animated feature can be inspirational to all.".

	onyx:emotionText "Pokmon the Movie Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice 2012 marks the return of theatrical Pikachu short with Meloetta's Moonlight Serenade. I like these anime shorts because they are usually without any human characters and have nice graphics. The Pokmon would be on their own speaking pure Poknese with narrator and though the format seems to be specially made for children personally I quite enjoy watching them!As the title suggests this animated feature is about the battle between the legendary dragon Pokmon Kyurem and the Sword of Justice quartet. It has interesting rite of passage and friendship plot but these featured Pokmon however speak human language through telepathy which is understandable but I thought it was too much to my liking. It is tolerable though.

Nowadays people have come up with strange looking Pokmon's of weird type combinations. Basically there is a legendary Pokmon called Kaldeo which is one of the swords of justice along with Cobalion Terrakion and Virizion. Although Kaldeo is not yet a sword of justice it goes out to challenge Kyurem which is said to be the strongest dragon Pokmon due to it being able to be BlackWhite Kyurem. There is no plot whatsoever. Moral of the story is there but quite tasteless. I wish people have come up with more intricate plots.Me rating this 510 is quite generous.".

It nearly killed Dekisugi too. How interesting.Not to mention Nobita's most loyal  helpful friends Giant and Suneo which always accompanies him in hundreds of his adventures and yet for hundreds of times always managed to betray  dishonor their friendship with Nobita by bullying sizing up cornering him being onlyafriendscenarioandopportunitywise and discards him on his daily life Instead of offering a helping hand sincere friendships and encouragements as what real friends would always do. Therefore as expected in this movie Giant and Suneo still lived up to their expectations by teaching Japanese kids about the values of friendship honor and good will. Nevertheless in the end our little heroes managed to capture hundredsthousands of their enemy's soldiers and ordered them all to be put to death by being fed alive to the giant shark. Too bad the movie finished before we can see how their enemies' limbs were ripped apart and eaten by the shark. Must've been censored then.But hey now that these grade five children have contributed to the gruesome deaths of their enemies then I guess there won't be another sequel to the mermaid series therefore it's a happy ending and the mermaids will live happily ever after  Well I'd personally give this movie a 10 out of 10. This truly is a magnificent movie. A true Quentin Tarantino's style movie made for kids. What a genius!".

Or is it because it was the film that came out just at the point when Chuck was transitioning from feature films to DirectToVideo and Television?In fact is it really a bad film at all? Well yes and nodepending on what your expectations are. For instance is DF2 a bad film when compared with Norris' other films? Definitely not! This film is the pinnacle of the latter day Norris persona. He's the superconfident superbearded superman of action tough and gruff but also noble and likable. He a man of few words who shoots a lot of big guns narrowly escapes a lot of very big very orange explosions and doles out justice to the bad guys with no second thoughts. as a sidenote this is very different from the early days Norris personaa basically peaceable karateman pushed into action often the pursued instead of the pursuer sometimes he was mustachioed sometimes his face was gasp naked.. The story is clichd and the characters are clichs personified but I don't think that was an accident. Clich can be very effective in movies if used properly see Rocky. DF2 pushes all the buttonspushes them in all the right spots and pushes them hard. It doesn't try to be ironic selfreferential a parody or a reimagining of anything. Like a John Wayne western it just is what it freaking is.Is DF2 a good film in the BAction film genre as a whole? If by that we mean the BronsonVanDammeSegal level genre then the answer is another resounding yes! DF2 is an excellent example of the kind of simple action flick that no one makes for theatrical release anymore. Is DF2 a good action film if your tastes run exclusively to higher budgeted more elaborate action flicks like Die Hard the James Bond series Lethal Weapon Tarrantino flicks and the like instead of lower budgeted action melodramas? Nah no way in hell. In comparison to the 100 million action epics the acting in DF2 is stiff the action too basic and the story style outdated by decades. Compared to the big studio tentpole Summer blockbusters all Norris films are like home movies. To me personally however the line between these big budgeted action flicks and Chuck's is becoming thinner and thinner as time goes by what at first seems like innovation soon becomes just another clich as it is imitated by everyone everywhere a la The Matrix. SoDelta Force 2. Good movie? The answer's either hell yes! good lord no! depending on who you are.Personally I dig it.".

However for some enjoyable lightheaded entertainment it passed the buck for me compared with the first outing. The two films couldn't be anything but different though. The first featured heavily on political terrorists as this one plays out more like a comicbook revenge story with the drug cartel in his sights. Even though he's still apart of 'The Delta Force' this time Norris goes it alone and tackles South American drug lords led by an impressively juicy and vicious Billy Drago bad guy performance of utter evilness and slime. Norris' personal easygoing turn is less mechanical to his first showing of the McCoy character.Now this one was fullthrottle from the getgo and looked like it had a sizable budget. The gritty action is furious and at times unpleasant. Just look at some of those remarkably creative stunt works involving an intense rock climb and thrilling sky dive. Some of the potent camera work neatly dons some sharp angles and works in the jungle locations to great effect. There are explosions. Big ones. Numerous ones. Norris is that hard to kill that they use a grenade launcher to stop him. Alas with no prevail. And you gotta love the intercutting slowmotion. Aaron Norris yep Chuck's brother directs by throwing caution to the wind and while it's not firstrate handling and freshly organised. He demonstrates enough to keep you watching and lets it tick along. The material is the real weak point. The bloated screenplay is covered with coincidences and dialogues are fairly leaden. The rest of the performances are a can of worms. John P Ryan gleefully hams it up as Gen. Taylor and Richard Jeckal skews in as a determined DEA Agent. The beautiful Begona Plaza is appealingly good too.I was expecting worse of this sequel. Pure tempolaced baction fun where the cold stare of Drago steals the show.".

The film has frenetic action  shoot'em up and spectacular set pieces and for that reason is fun . This is a straightforward ActionAdventureDramaThrillerWar movie . It is tense and exciting  at time bemusing and in average budget . Uneven picture  however being entertaining  amusing and never tiring . Exciting rescue climax but realized in cartoon style  to say the least  with spectacular but silly action scenes . There five crew members were killed in a helicopter accident during filming  the film is dedicated in their memory . The film was originally to be produced with the cooperation of Delta Force's reallife founder and original commanding officer Col. Charles Beckwith . This is a routine actioner with Karate star Chuck Norris as the veteran Delta as he's fine as tough cold stubborn Colonel . It's a predictable shallow and brainless film though will appeal to Chuck Norris enthusiasts because of it contains some acceptable action sequences . Michael Dudikoff and Steve James were attached to the project when it was known as Spitfire Delta Force II . After they passed on it Chuck Norris was given the script which he disliked and was changed into the final product . Nice acting by Billy Drago  he steals the show as a sadomasochist villainous . He is is a reference to Pablo Escobar a similar flamboyant reallife Columbian drug dealer who also had such an entrance to his compound . Atmospheric and functional cinematography by Joao Fernndes filmed in Tennessee and Philippines . Cota's mansion seen in the movie is the reallife Palac located in Tagaytay City outside Manila it was erected by former First Lady Imelda Marcos . Commercial and catching musical score composed by means of synthesizer by Frederic Talgorn including lively leitmotif . The motion picture was regular but professionally directed by Aaron Norris  though Michael Winner was going to direct but Chuck Norris didn't like the script. Aaron has usually produced  playing stunts and directed various vehicles for his brother Chuck  such as Missing in action 3  Hitman  Hellbound some episodes of Walker Texas Rangerand three children films such as Sidekicks  Top dog and this Forest warrior.

It started off pretty slowly however it was never boring and i was always interested plus Billy Drago portrays one of the best bad guys ever in this in my opinion!. While it can't match the original it's still a pretty enjoyable sequel with some exciting action and fun performances!. These type of movies aren't going to win any Oscars however i am a huge fan of 80's late 90's action films and this one is no different! plus the sky diving stunts were spectacular!. . Sure it's routine and familiar however i enjoyed it quite a bit and i highly recommend it!. The Direction is good. Aaron Norris does a good job here with good camera work great angles and some spectacular shots during the sky diving stunts!. There is a bit of blood and violence. We get quite a few of very bloody gunshot woundsbloody corpsesstabbingshead explosiongunshot wound to the head and an impaling. The Acting is great!. Chuck Norris is AMAZING as always and is amazing here he is very likable kicks that ass had some great one liners was very good in the acting department and was really fantastic overall!. Norris rules!. Billy Drago is AMAZING here as the main villain he gives one of the most chilling performances ever as a bad guy he is also one of the most sadistiche was amazing i loved it!. John P. Ryan really seems to be enjoying himself here and gave a fun performance however i am not a big fan of his.Mark Margolis is weak as the other main villain. Rest of the cast do okay.

Without saying a word Billy Drago commands a presence so powerful that I almost hid behind my couch while watching him. General Taylor's blatant violation of military procedure reveals his hatred for the Columbian drug lords. This is evident in one of his greatest quotes from this film Why don't you....shut the fk up!. Simply powerful dialog. To any who deny this film's greatness I say you are a fool who deserves death as quickly as possible. I have watched this masterpiece over 180 times and each time I find something new and beautiful hidden within its recesses.".

	schema:headline " Kids playing action movie as an actual film.";
	schema:reviewBody "An unfortunate misjudged and misunderstood film that could have been something great but only clings to the bottomrung of respectability. For a start it has an unashamedly awful and truly despicable villain who oozes evil from every stinking orifice. When eccentric bad guys are not hammy they are Ramon Cota a sickening performance by villain's villain of choice and villain of the week Billy Drago.Cota is a Columbian drug lord who ships massive amounts of cocaine into America. He kills DEA agents with unnatural glee murders pregnant women tortures people to death in a gas chamber rapes women murders their husbands murders sick babies and uses their bodies to smuggle cocaine  you get the picture this guy is lower than minus infinity.In a rare opportunity to catch him Colonel Scott McCoy the everbearded Chuck Norris kidnaps Cota in midair and drags him into court only to watch him leave with virtually no charge. More DEA agents are kidnapped and it's up to Chuck to rescue them from death. So he heads off to the fictional South American country of San Carlos for some mighty kickingofass. Killing Cota is not his mission rescuing the DEA agents is but you know that Cota is going to get what he deserves with a little bit of slightly unsubtle philosophy from Norris.The script is generic and by numbers. Never before has a movie been so strictly routine but there are some real cool action scenes and so much melodrama that it could fuel EastEnders for a decade. The direction leaves a lot to be desired. If someone other than Chuck's brother had made this we would have a hugely enjoyable film on our hands. Instead plot holes illogical moments and a general feel of immaturity bog it down.The action ranges from Norris flying through the sky swinging through the jungle falling off cliffs and dodging rockets. The main problem with the direction is that Aaron Norris uses the logic If it is in slow motion then it is cool. He wants to drag out every bloody detail every death dance and every penetration of every bullet. It's a shame Delta Force 2 isn't hyperkinetic because the slomo becomes very noticeable.Chuck Norris' methods are also highly questionable. For a man who moves at 48 frames per second he sure does lay waste to thousands of Drago's henchman very well. And beating up the new Delta Force recruits to train them in the deadly arts is just bizarre.General Taylor John P. Ryan a character so relentless gungho and overthetop that he really should be in a pantomime is McCoy's boss and he enjoys himself way too much when he tags along on the mission to blow away zillions of nameless henchman from a helicopter that is so indestructible and equipped with a neverending supply of ammo you wonder why the REAL Delta Force doesn't use this thing over in Afghanistan. Ryan certainly did wrap himself in the American flag for this character. But hey it worked for Stallone with John Rambo.The single spoton aspect of the whole movie has to be the strong and rousing musical score by Frederick Talgorn. If the rest of the movie was as good as this then everything would be different. Instead Delta Force 2 is a mixed bag. There is a good film here desperate to get out but you have to claw your way through to find it.".

It's hard to put your finger on exactly what's missing from the second Delta Force. On the surface everything appears to be there Chuck action fight scenes outrageous stunts explosions evil bad guys  it's all there. But despite it all there still feels like there's something missing.This time instead of Middle Eastern terrorists we have Columbian drug lords who follow every stereotype of South American cultures ever who have kidnapped a load of DEA agents and not only that but they've only gone and murdered Chuck's best friend and his family. Hence Chuck better dust his beard down and kill absolutely everyone he meets. Which he does.It's all good harmless fun if your definition of 'harmless fun' is 'killing thousands of people in gruesome and fiery ways but for some reason definitely feels lesser to its predecessor.

While I remember the older movie Delta Force almost entirely and I did not exactly watch that one a whole lot more. One of the few scenes that I even remember is the scene involving the Delta Force doing a sky jump with the drug lord and the fact this film had a bit of a similar plot to the James Bond film License to Kill however that film is superior to this one as I can remember a lot about that one too. I do not remember this one being particularly horrible or anything I just remember it not being as good as the original and that I got a bit bored during this film another thing that did not occur during the first film. In the end I think it is just one of those sequels that uses the success of the first film to try and market an almost unrelated film. Like this one was supposed to have Chuck in some sort of drug task force but they thought they could get some more bucks by making it a sequel to the Delta Force movie.".

It was total propaganda and gave you the strong impression that countries outside of the U.S.A are pretty backwards and in desperate need of America to come in and kick some butt. Despite this film's political insensitivity I really enjoyed it. I think back to the 80's fondly and remember when everything was black and white. There were the good guys and there were the bad guys. Chuck Norris essentially plays Superman in this film using his martial arts skills to avoid every bullet and destroy all evil doers who dare cross his path. Hi ya!! Drago plays the bad drug lord who is so completely over the top wicked that some of his actions warrant an unintentional laugh. I was half expecting Drago to start killing nuns and the pope just in case the audience wasn't convinced of his absolute wickedness. During this entire film there was no doubt that Drago was eventually going to be vanquished by the mighty Chuck. You gotta love it.This is a fun and predictable action film. It has some great stunts and some unfortunate deaths as a result. My only complaint is that in one stunt you can clearly see the parachute under the bad guy's shirt. It's not that I don't endorse safety I just wish they would have done some better editing. Don't look for academy award material here and you should be entertained. As a concluding note I miss the catchy theme song from the original. That was a cool theme.".

Cast in one of his rare goodguy roles he delivers a jovial performance and chews on the scenery a bit. Drago Frank Nitti in the Untouchables feature film once again offers a master class in supremely oily villainy. This creep is just pure evil and can't die soon enough. People will also notice character actor Mark Margolis 'Breaking Bad' 'Better Call Saul' as a crooked general in league with Cota.What could have been a more interesting set piece when Scott is required to scale a mountain in order to reach Cotas' lair isn't as satisfying as it could have been but at least it offers something fresh in an otherwise formula plot.Adequate pacing and a truly excellent rousing score by Frederic Talgorn help to make this an agreeable diversion for action fans.Six out of 10.".

He made his character have a great personality which it made the role very interesting. Also he made it where you just hate him! Richard Jaeckel John P. Ryan and Dick Warlock also appear in the movie! The action is really good and realistic and the fighting scenes are also realistic. Some parts in the film are a tad rough. The scenes like the skydiving and Chuck Norris' exhibition scenes are really caught on film quite well and its some of the best I've seen in a movie! I think that this is film is a great one and its arguably better than the first! If you like Norris and Drago and the prequel then Delta Force 2 Operation Stranglehold is something else to watch!".

While it's no masterpiece Delta Force 3 delivers the goods. It may struggle for star power most of the players are sons or bothers of Hollywood AGraders but it makes up for it with a nice little terrorism plot and some nifty action sequences. The rattle snake blasting scene was something I hadn't seen before.Sure there's plenty of cheese here... most of which is delivered by Mike Norris son of Chuck but its the cheese that makes 80s  90s action flicks good.

I would recommend it to someone who likes action and wants to be entertained without all the glory of Hollywood superstars. When compared to other 3rd installments of trilogies it still is up there with the best. Much better in comparison to the Godfather 3 and Die Hard 3.810Don't submit to the man fight the power!".

How convenient. Barry Morse puts on an American accent for this not his familiar grandfatherly British accent. Jack Palance plays Omus an evil kind of guyhe played the same kind of evil guy in an episode of Buck Rogers about the same time who has these walkinggarbage can robots who look totally ridiculous and awkward. He also laughs for no apparent reason only that he's amazed himself which isn't hard. All of the costumes of the young people look like they just roller boogied to the moon. The same corridor is used again and again for chase scenesthey just change directions. The miniatures are pretty badfighters that have model parts of the K7 Space Station on the front end. The FX work is largely some glitzy animation that's passable at first but just gets more annoying. Landing on another planet it looks just like some empty lot or tract of land in Canada. Supposedly this was to be a much more ambitious production with Mike Trim having done some production drawings and miniatures made in Englandthat all went when Sylvia Anderson walked off it. In fact that's what Morse was led to believe when he signed on. I read where he said he was taken aback at the cheapness of everything but honored his professional commitment and did his job and finished it as he agreed to do. Harry Allan Towers no slouch at cheap filmscame in and the quality was replaced by the thrift of just getting the film done. I admit I was pretty shocked it was so lowbudget.

Of the bigger Star Warsinspired space fantasies of the era 'Shape of Things to Come' may have the most most in common with 19791981's 'Buck Rogers in the 25th Century' movie and TV series. Though Buck's budget had the advantage the overall look is quite similar. The cheesy futuristic art design materials and props that were available and may have looked 'farout' to the 1980 eye are all in place. The lead actress has Erin Gray's 'Wilma Deering' hairdo and hey there's Jack Palance who played an evil villain in a Buck Rogers 2parter playing well a evil villain in a well very similar costume. Having Barry Morse from the popular 70's British show 'Space1999' also thrown in makes for good measure. There's the ohsoimitated renegade robot with his domed head and oddly 'Robby the Robot'esquire body. He's the comic relief. Noting a theme? It's the era. Appreciation of this film is probably purely generational because the movie is BAD. But it has immense charm. Watching this for the first time in 2009 at age 41 I felt as if I were watching a perfect spoof of the genre I am so nostalgic for.Brooke Ellis".

This is admittedly minor league fare with low grade effects and is an unmemorable adaptation of the story but this viewer found it impossible to actively hate it. It's all appealing enough ultra cheap effects and all. Even the robot characters as extremely clunky looking as they are are endearing in a hearkening backtosci fiBpicturesofthe50s sort of way.

At the same time there is this failed visual effect where ship is hovering with bubble that I always have failed to realize what it stands for. But don't get me wrong you will be just as happy as the crew when you have survived the scene.Other minor nuances are the children of earth and the Robot teleporting which is randomly seeded throughout the movie. While the robots are quite lowtech visual effects I still find them quite interesting part of the movie. The Sparks has few good observations and doesn't nag stupidly like many of the other machines from the same era of movies. Also I still find the robots of Delta Three very intimidating with their heavyduty crushing arms with electrocuting fingers.The main cast performs well mostly but I think the villain Omus Jack Palance really has all the characteristics to carry such an important role with dignity. Although that dignity will suffer a dent in a hilarious effect fumble at the end of the movie.I would recommend this movie to everyone who doesn't have high prejudice or expectations for visual effects from this era and can disregard the hyperspaceballet".

Among his credits are HELL DIVERS with Wallace Beery and Clark Gable TEST PILOT with Gable and Spencer Tracy DIVE BOMBER with Errol Flynn and Fred MacMurray and THEY WERE EXPENDABLE for John Ford with John Wayne and Robert Montgomery. He brought to his writing a love of flying pride in the military and an understanding that a 'greater good' must sometimes take precedence over personal happiness.In THE WINGS OF EAGLES director Ford illustrates how Wead's life was every bit as interesting and dramatic as anything he wrote. A close personal friend so much so that he even cast Ward Bond to play a thinlydisguised version of himself named 'John Dodge' in the film Ford was witness to many of the triumphs and tragedies of the pioneer Naval aviatorengineer's life. After completing THE SEARCHERS Ford commemorated the tenth anniversary of his friend's passing with this sensitive 'wartsandall' tribute.Wead portrayed by John Wayne in one of his most fully realized characterizations...he even sacrificed his hairpiece as the older Wead for the sake of authenticity begins the film as a typical hellraising Ford hero a Navy flier who loved taunting his Army counterparts led by the terrific Kenneth Tobey lived for the sheer joy of flying biplanes even when he was clueless as to HOW to fly them and had the love of a feisty yet devoted woman Maureen O'Hara of course! But in keeping with the tone of much of the older Ford's work Wead's life does not tie itself up into a neat happy package but develops into a complex neartragedy of a man so consumed with his career that his marriage breaks down and has his greatest dream snatched away from him when an accident cripples him. Rather than falling back on the potential aid a wife could provide he refuses her help relying on his Navy 'family' represented by Dan Dailey in one of his most popular roles for rehabilitation. With Pearl Harbor Wead's expertise is again called upon and he leaves a successful career as a screenwriter to rejoin the Navy becoming the innovator of jeep carriers...only to see his health fail him yet again forcing him out of the service he loved.It is a story both sad and moving and Wayne so often accused of being 'bigger than life' and onedimensional in his portrayals again demonstrates his underrated acting talent capturing the frustration of a man who never truly achieves the ultimate triumphs he dreams of. Wead is a 'real' person not always likable but someone you learn to admire for his sheer determination to contribute and not surrender to selfpity.With an excellent supporting cast particularly Ken Curtis as Wead's lifelong friend John Dale Price THE WINGS OF EAGLES may disappoint someone looking for a 'typical' war movie but as a film biography is far more honest than Hollywood's 'usual' hokum. 'Spig' Wead would have loved it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Not one of Ford's best works as a director but it's an excellent film nonetheless. It's one of the best biopics I've ever seen. The subject is Frank Spig Wead a Navy man through and through who despite all his success in the service was never able to make much of a connection with his wife and daughters. It was a very personal story for John Ford who was a good friend of Wead's. Wead was the screenwriter on Ford's excellent They Were Expendable and also Air Mail which I haven't seen. The film concentrates on the man and his relationships. John Wayne gives a downright excellent performance as Wead. Maureen O'Hara is back as his love interest and their interactions here are marvelous. Also giving excellent performances are Ken Curtis maybe his best role in a Ford film Dan Dailey and Ward Bond as the first movie producer who hires Wead. Bond's performance is in loving imitation of John Ford. The Wings of Eagles is a very touching tribute to a friend. The only problem is that it is such a personal story to Ford that the most interesting part the relationship with the wife and kids is not treated fully in order to make Wead look better than he probably did in real life. 810.".

Probably because it's always been such an emotional movie for me. I always cry at the ending...most likely because the very thing Spig Wead wanted seemed to elude him.  Perhaps because his desire was never really clearly defined even to him.As I sat watching it I got the bright idea of looking it up in the IMDB movie database.  I was curious about the writing that Wead did and also the timeline.  I came across a couple of reviews and decided to add my two sense sic worth.I realized today that the things I like about the movie were partially the things that one of the other reviewers didn't.  I LIKE the way Wead's story is presented.  It isn't neat and orderly.  No cheating endings or story movement.  It seems like he was very selfinvolved and dealt better with other men than with his wife.  I suspect that both Spig and Min were trapped by their societal roles in a way that many others were at that time.  They did't have that same open way of spilling their guts that we've all embraced in today's world.Men were men and women...weren't!  LOL!Anyway I was always crazy about John Wayne and had such a crush on him whenever he'd appear in Navy whites.  Something about that craggy face and those blue eyes grabbed me every time.  Plus I share his birthday so that made him extra kewl in my eyes.Ford was wise NOT to turn this into a typical John Hero Wayne vehicle. That was probably why they worked so well together in all of those films. He was no more snowed by Wayne's larger than life personna than Wayne was of Ford's.  I would love to have been a fly on the wall when those two were goin' at it.Although Wayne was fiftyish when he did this film I think he displayed a good youthful Wead as well as the somewhat more mature one.  A better more subtle acting job than the other reviewer gave him credit for doing.Time for Spig to bite it so I'm off now...dmombit".

Dan Dailey has a good role as Wead's best friend in the military while other members of the John Ford company of players contribute their talents to the film.  Ken Curtis shows up a good bit and Ward Bond has a role as a film director that smacked of a caricature of John Ford.  Bond plays this to the hilt and seemed to enjoy the chance to show Ford how he came off at times.The scenes that were very watchable could include several fight scenes between members of the Army Air Corps and their Naval counterparts plus a very heart rending view of Wayne's efforts to rehabilitate himself following a fall down a flight of stairs at his house.

And eventually he did get to the Pacific Theater and served on one of the carriers he fought so valiantly for in and out of uniform.Wayne gives one of his best screen performances and he's equally matched by Maureen O'Hara as his wife and Dan Dailey as his good friend who sees him through the paralysis and eventual recovery.There's no happy ending here for the Duke and Maureen unlike Rio Grande and The Quiet Man. Spig is a flawed human being as dedicated to partying and carousing as he is to the Navy and Naval Aviation. The carousing gives John Ford an opportunity to do some of the rough house comedy his films are known for. As for Maureen who has to deal with the death of one child and the raising of two daughters it does become too much for her. O'Hara is not given enough credit for her performance in Wings of Eagles. She calls him Star Spangled Spig but from a term of derision it becomes one of admiration.Wings of Eagles proved to be the last film for character actor Henry O'Neill who plays one of Wead's Navy doctors. And it is the last film that Ward Bond did for John Ford and the last film the trio of Ford Wayne and Bond worked together on. They did an episode on Bond's Wagon Train series which he was starting right after the shooting of Wings of Eagles. The episode aired right after Bond died in 1960.And wouldn't you know it. Bond's role was as director John Dodge which in fact was John Ford. Rather unique in the annals of Hollywood that a noted director had a broad characterization of himself in his own film.

A good example is this tribute to his friend Spig Wead.Wead John Wayne is a U. S. Navy officer chafing to get up in the air. The way he sees it How else are we gonna get aviation? To that end he takes on the Army Navy superiors and even his wife Min Maureen O'Hara. His commitment to air power is such that it cancels out everything else until a sudden accident forces a change of focus.Spig Wead Min fumes at one point. Never listen to anybody else. Just do exactly what you wanna do all the time.The Wings Of Eagles is one of Ford's stranger movies. Sudden shifts in tone predominate. The film starts out a lighthearted service romp with pratfalls and car chases. Then sudden tragedy occurs. More lighthearted antics follow. Then Ford drops the big boom on Spig. The next halfhour centers on a long painful convalescence.Ford did mood shifts in his films all the time of course. Normally the gears didn't grind so loudly as they do here.Wings Of Eagles is perhaps best known for Ford's insertion of an autobiographical element a director named John Dodge who enlists Wead as a screenwriter which Ford actually did after Wead's Navy career came to a sharp end. An argument can be made that Ford is actually presenting us with a double selfportrait Wead comes off here as difficult selfish alcoholic careerobsessed and unable to hold onto relationships all flaws Ford's biographers say the director had in spades. No wonder Ford can't decide whether to play it as comedy or tragedy.Wayne is flatout brilliant here. Just a year after making The Searchers with Ford the actor was in his peak thespian form and plays the valleys of Wead's life with candid abandon even shedding his hairpiece this one time on screen. For 15 minutes he's required to carry major scenes with his face buried in a pillow and pulls it off. I never got tired of watching him.The same can't be said of the rest of this movie. The mawk runs thick with this one with O'Hara doing a lot of crying into the camera while Spig flies around the world to prove something or other. Much of the rest of the time is spent on merry fisticuffs with rival Army aviators or eyerolling reaction shots from cigar chewing Dan Dailey as Spig's enlisted buddy Jughead.Spig's virtual abandonment of his family is one of the movie's constant themes. When Min tells one of her daughters about Spig's latest aviation record the girl replies Would it be a record if Daddy came home?O'Hara has some good scenes too and so does Dailey the latter especially as a prod to Spig's eventual rehabilitation. Both worked well with Ford and knew how to make use of the director's loose reins.Yet Ford for some reason holds off on the happy endings. Normally this might be a strength but here it comes off as a bit wanton especially when the film pushes so many lightcomedy buttons. Through the chuckles Spig suffers and suffers. After a while so do we.".

However the only negative I have is about Wead's life. If his marital difficulties were as they were described in the movie it was a bit of a downer and made connecting to his character a little difficult for me. While he was a brave and dedicated man any guy who'd give up his wife that easily seems nuts. Plus it just seemed wrong for Wayne and O'Hara NOT to be together. Too bad they couldn't for once change his life to make a better movie after all they did this in Errol Flynn movies all the time!.".

I've wanted to review this film in the past but couldn't come up with a proper explanation of how Ford pulled it off. Another reviewer coined the perfect term  warts and all. Wayne does a fine job portraying Wead. His longsuffering wife is played by Maureen O'Hara. Wead was married to the Navy body and soul but to his wife a whole lot less although he loved her. Wayne and O'Hara were in my opinion a completely compatible acting duo. They made several films together and they just seemed to work so well together.

	schema:reviewBody "Historically inaccurate clichd and quite silly at times.The movie starts in an almost farcical way showing the hero as a lovable larrikin and defier of authority. It gets worse from there and I didn't think that was possible at the time as the next few scenes mainly involve silly punchups. At this point the movie looked like it was meant to be a slapstick comedy and a very bad one at that.From a point however it loses the silliness and becomes a drama. Some scenes are quite emotional and engaging but many feel trite and clichd.The WW2 stuff contains a host of historical inaccuracies. Things occur in the wrong chronological order and this part just seems very sloppily done. This is all despite the producers having some great WW2 footage at their disposal and the help of the US Navy.I mainly watched this because it starred John Wayne. He does fine in the lead role but is miscast. He is far too old for the character he is playing.Considering this movie was made long after WW2 had ended so isn't a propaganda movie and considering how little known Commander Wead is in terms of military history I'm not really sure why this movie was made.".

	onyx:emotionText "Historically inaccurate clichd and quite silly at times.The movie starts in an almost farcical way showing the hero as a lovable larrikin and defier of authority. It gets worse from there and I didn't think that was possible at the time as the next few scenes mainly involve silly punchups. At this point the movie looked like it was meant to be a slapstick comedy and a very bad one at that.From a point however it loses the silliness and becomes a drama. Some scenes are quite emotional and engaging but many feel trite and clichd.The WW2 stuff contains a host of historical inaccuracies. Things occur in the wrong chronological order and this part just seems very sloppily done. This is all despite the producers having some great WW2 footage at their disposal and the help of the US Navy.I mainly watched this because it starred John Wayne. He does fine in the lead role but is miscast. He is far too old for the character he is playing.Considering this movie was made long after WW2 had ended so isn't a propaganda movie and considering how little known Commander Wead is in terms of military history I'm not really sure why this movie was made.";

	schema:reviewBody "All the critics have called John Ford's humor broad and I guess this is a pretty good example of what they mean. The opening scenes involve ancient float planes a Stutz Bearcat people falling into water and a crash into the swimming pool at the Admiral's tea party. Tea party! Subsequent scenes involve gala fist fights between matched hordes of Army and Navy pilots led by Kenneth Toby and Wayne respectively. There are cakes smashed into faces. The whole thing could have been a silent comedy.And yet the humor by no means ever sophisticated is pretty funny at times and not always slapstick either. A good example is the scene in Spig Wead's John Wayne's office with Pincus Tige Andrews and Carson Dan Dailey. Dailey is having difficulty trying to make a longdistance call. Andrews is sitting with his shoe off. Wayne asks what's wrong did he stub his toe? Ah no says Andrews ya see I keep my money in my shoe and every time I step on it  and he's interrupted when Admiral Moffat enters the room. Wayne Dailey and Andrews snap to attention and listen to the Admiral's speech. There is a brief pause after Dailey suddenly shouts into the phone Why don't you GET OFF THE PHONE you dumb head! In the sudden silence everyone stares at Dailey who then looks embarrassed and apologizes to the Admiral. When the Admiral has finished his speech to his respectful listeners he turns to leave the room and notices Pincus a mere enlisted man goes over to him and greets Pincus warmly. Pincus smiles easily shakes the Admiral's hand and inquires after his family. How's da wife sir? And dem lovely kiddies? Fine fine. Good to see you Pincus says the Admiral and exits. Wayne and Dailey gape speechless at Pincus before getting back to business.I've described this scene in extenso because it could NOT have come from a silent comedy. None of the humor is physical. It's what might be called interactional humor. And Ford explains absolutely none of it. We have no idea why Dailey began shouting into the phone during the Admiral's speech or what the hell kind of background the Admiral and the lowly Pincus share. There is no setup for the gags whatever. They come as a shocking surprise and that's what makes them funny.There's a similar unstated quality at the climax of the film. Dailey has saved Wayne's life by taking the bullets himself. He winds up in sick bay playing poker with the other patients. Wayne visits him to thank him. The two have been lifelong friends. Ordinarily under these conditions a viewer expects to see a lot of sentiment even between two plainspeaking macho loudmouths. Instead Dailey brushes off Wayne's thanks brusquely. And later the two don't get together for Wayne's retirement from the ship and from the Navy after a heart attack as if Wayne were leaving a drinking party for a few minutes to visit the bathroom. The sense of loss  of almost tragic finality  is underscored by the absence of any emotional display. And it is left unexplained by Ford just as Dailey's phone call and Pincus's friendship with the Admiral was. This is anything but a routine scene.It's not among Ford's best films. He wanted to call it The Spig Wead Story but the studio objected that no one would want to see it and they were right. Spig Wead sounds like a quarterback for Notre Dame. And the script following Wead's real life meandering is all over the place switching in the middle from a service comedy to a complicated and unfocused story about a screen writer. And it doesn't tell us much about Wead's second career. I didn't want to make it said Ford about the movie but I didn't want anybody else to make it. Probably no one else would have made it.The romance between Wayne and O'Hara is handled clumsily. They're forever breaking up and getting together again  or almost getting together. O'Hara is as always dropdead gorgeous in Technicolor. And I doubt that anyone but Ford could have forced John Wayne to doff his toupee. Yet the acting itself is schematic partly because the dialog is so burdensome. Who could possibly have made believable Wayne's lines after he has fallen down the stairs and broken his back? Don't move me. My back. Can't feel anything. Call . . . hospital. Navy . . . hospital. Sounds like . . . comic book. At one point in the film Ford ridicules himself John Dodge instead of someone in his cast.The director was beginning to run out of steam by this time. He was over 60 and had a lot of scar tissue. Still the movie is worth watching.".

The film is billed as a romantic film but I do not think it is romantic although it is about romance. The presence of American actor William Hurt may mislead the viewer to think that it is a traditional romantic movie but it is written and directed by Tonie Marshall who is half American but was born and raised in France. The journey of Fanette at this point in her life starts when she met an old acquaintance and is reminded of Phillipe an old love that she has not totally forgotten. Also it so happens that the movie An Affair to Remember is showing in her local cinema. This movie also brought up old memories for Fanette. The hope to rekindle an old romance brought Fanette to New York where she met William's Hurt character Anyway if you love Catherine Deneuve like I do you will enjoy the movie. She is still very lovely and did a great job here.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have read devastating reviews of the film but as a Catherine Deneuve fan of course I had to see it. Though I have to admit I can understand most of the critics' reservations concerning the script I think the overall bashing of the movie was somewhat exaggerated.As for the writing it's true in the first half of the film the scenes piled one on top of the other are way too loosely connected so while the writers might have meant them to show Fannette's background the faces popping up here and there form quite an amorphous mess and apart from us seeing them they don't add much to the actual story. As for her brother's appearance it took me almost the whole scene to figure out the man was the brother and even then I wasn't completely sure. In addition the daydreaming hallucinating scenes about Philippe are sometimes long and tiresome. Though Deneuve is gorgeous and her acting is flawless in this first part I felt a bit confused about what the creators were trying to get at.BUT when Fannette arrives in New York it's as if we too entered a completely different universe. Their duo with William Hurt works brilliantly on the screen their conversations are witty and funny and even wittier and funnier the way they act them the two of them together suddenly become interesting and within a moment you get involved in the story forgetting about Philippe and the strenuous blurry images of the first half as is most probably the case with Fannette too. The pace gets more lively and watching the film more enjoyable. Here the conversations are excellent they are the real heart of the story and beautifully mirror the development of the relationship between the two people. Both actors are very convincing and do excellently in their roles making the most of the opportunities the dialogues offer them  Deneuve is beautiful as the nonsensical woman who seemingly doesn't care and Hurt is a heartthrob as the confident admirer of Fannette.I simply loved the end even though I'd have enjoyed just a bit more conventional ending this time. All in all it's an enjoyable film with a bit confused first half and a funny sensitive romantic second one. On top of that there are some scenes which are little gems in themselves the cinema or the kimono scene and I think the writers managed to create and Deneuve and Hurt to act wonderfully one of the most creative and sensual erotic scenes in movie history the bar scene. To that I'd give 20 out of 10 . The movie is 710.".

Catherine Deneuve plays a hopeless romantic who is trying to reunite with the love of her life that she had when she was young.  The story takes place in France and in the US.  The only problem with this movie is the language inconsistency.  I would have liked it to either be all in English or all in French.  Having to switch back and forth takes away from the movie.  It might not be one of her best films but it is entertaining.  The chemistry between the actors is very real and adds to the story.  All in all it is an okay movie.".

I'm a film student and I had the good fortune of being assigned Deneuve's later work for my actor study. I watched this picture after seeing several of her wellknown masterworks such as Indochine Place Vendome Ma Saison Preferee and Les Voleurs. Growing up around film I had the Belle de Jour Deneuve imprinted on my mind. Seeing this film changed that. In truth this film is rather weak and predictable but it is worth watching just for Deneuve who shows us the other side of the ice queen. She is quirky dreamy and often uncomfortable. Aging beautifully in my opinion this film allows her to play sides of the human she normally does not touch. Toni Marshall wrote the piece for her and it is truly a homage and a joy to behold. Loved the incorporation of modern art as well. William Hurt seems miscast and slightly off his game easily attributable to the horrible events of 911 that left the whole set distraught. He still manages some great oneliners. Marshall definitely has a clever idea for a film and for many viewers accustomed to foreign cinematic nuances she will deliver. The DVD has extensive and interesting additional material. It's great to see some Paris great to see innovative art and wonderful to see Deneuve adopting a new element.".

A few flaws keep this one from being a black and white masterpiece. My biggest peeve with the film is the fact that it's not real hard to see who the killer is. They should have done a better job of masking his face. There are a few priceless scenes though. The radio being tossed into the water and the muffling of the music is quite cool. I love the part where the killer is dragging the girl's body by the wrist it's rather wicked. It also has perhaps one of the earliest decapitations. Patrick Magee is fabulous as the aristocratic doctor. This hard to find gem is worth looking for especially for old school horror fans.".

	schema:headline " A very good debut!";
	schema:reviewBody "Back in the early 60s filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola was taking his first steps as a director and after directing two Nudie Cuties his very first two works he began working with legendary producer Roger Corman as an assistant in several tasks such as dialog director actor and finally working in the sound department of Corman's 1963 film The Young Racers. It was while filming this movie in Ireland when Coppola finally convinced Corman to allow him to make his first legitimate film Dementia 13 a lowbudget horror film using the same locations and most of the cast of Corman's movie. Impressed by the script that Coppola and writer Jack Hill devised gave Coppola free reign over the film and went back to the America leaving all set for the debut of a man who would become one of the most important directors of the 70s and 80s.Louise Haloran Luana Anders has a problem her husband John Peter Read has died and therefore legally she is unable to claim any inheritance if John's mother dies. In order to retain her part in the testament Louise decides to make everyone believe that John is still alive and pretending he was sent to New york to work making him unable to accompany her to the family annual Memorial service they do for John's younger sister Kathleen in Ireland. at her arrival everything seems to work out fine at first but John's older brother Richard WIlliam Campbell begins to suspect that something is wrong. However soon this becomes Louise' lesser problem as something bigger and morbid seems to be going on inside the dark corridors of Harlan's Castle.Dementia 13 was written mostly by Coppola in a few days but after Corman allowed them to continue with the project Jack Hill helped Coppola to finish the script. The story is basically a mixture of traditional Gothic horror with elements of the slasher subgenre that was in its early stages during those years Dementia 13 shows a lot of influence from Hitchcock's Psycho and while it is indeed a bit messy and contrived at first sight it does deliver an interesting mystery and good doses of suspense. It's not the most original movie ever not even for its time but it's very noticeable that Coppola was not going for the easy route of showing shocks lots of sex and violence as he supposedly promised to Corman and actually attempts to built a thrilling story of intrigues and madness.While the plot may not be the film greatest strength the direction by Coppola is surprisingly very good for a debut as he shows a raw display of the talent that would take him to the top in the future years. Giving a great use to the Irish castle that serves as location to the film Coppola creates a nice atmosphere of dread and well dementia that fills the film with ominous power and gives it a personality of its own. Despite his limited resources even for Corman's standards he manages to come up with some good although sparse special effects that look impressive when one considers the shoestring budget he had to work with. Of course Dementia 13 is not really a great or remarkable film but it's very good for a first time director and it's also really obvious that this is where Coppola learned many things about his craft.Overall the cast does an effective job and manage to carry the film without too many problems. Luana Anders as Louise Harlan was probably at the top of her game and really shows that she is more than a pretty face. William Campbell as Richard Haloran is also excellent in his performance although a little over the top at times. The film's best performances are given by Eithne Dunne and Patrick Magee who as the unstable Lady Haloran and her Doctor respectively give the film a dignity and a class uncommon in other similar movies. Magee is easily the highlight of the film as he transforms what otherwise would be a twodimensional character into a full fledged character with his charm and enormous talent.This movie is a quite good example of how the cinema was evolving in the 60s as the style and overall tone feel very fresh and young however those expecting to see another of Coppola's masterpieces in Dementia 13 will be sorely disappointed. The movie's biggest problem is the somewhat messy script that not only feels a bit too derivative from Psycho in some moments but it also can become confusing and tedious at times. Fortunately the cast does a very good job considering the limitations in solving this and along with Coppola's original direction literally save the movie from being a failure. Dementia 13 has gained a good reputation over the years and while most of it is probably due to Coppola's later success as a director it's hard to deny that there is real raw talent in the making of the film. Personally I think that the best way to appreciate this early Coppola movie is to go without expectations and be willing to enjoy the ride. A very good albeit flawed horror movie. 610".

This entry has the distinction of being one of Coppola's earliest directorial efforts and it is clearly influenced by Hitchcock though without his budget or seasoned mastery.

Not long into the film one death sets off a chain of events that unleashes a couple of other ones to where no one at the castle is safe and the audience is often not certain who the mad killer is though veteran fans of horrorsuspense shouldn't have that much trouble figuring it out.  The film is far from perfect but given the unbelievable budgetary and filming restraints it does manage to conjure up some creeps and story interest.  The only part that really drags is the section involving an overly inquisitive doctor Magee.  Otherwise there is creativity in the filming of the deaths and a nice sense of atmosphere throughout even if almost none of these Irish characters has anything resembling an accent!

What it turned out to be caught me absolutely offguard. The only thing more terrifying than the film itself was the poor overall rating it received on imdb. This is a superb example of a psychological thriller and certainly the most underrated and underappreciated film of this genre I have ever seen.Dementia 13 is a fairly simple narrative on the surface but underneath it is an interweaving story each branch adding depth and mystery to the story and each branch being a carefullyplanned twist of the senses.My wife being a huge fan of the genre especially of films from the 60s has already encouraged me to watch numerous other films similar in narrative feel such as The Innocents based on The Turn of the Screw by Henry James or The Haunting based on the Shirley Jackson story. After seeing so many films many of which were based on wellcrafted stories by famous authors it astounds me to think that A young Francis Coppola not only directed this superb film but CONCEIVED it and WROTE it as well. The result reads just as well and even better in many cases than many wellcrafted novels itself being a story of an utmost macabre and chilling nature... and the storytelling leaves little to be desired.Francis Coppola only 22 at the time made this film with a miniscule budget of only 20000 and an extremely rushed shooting schedule. It is no wonder Coppola blossomed into a wellrespected master craftsman of film. And the limited resources all but completely excuse any of the flaws in this film. Looking at the facts about the film and its maker surely must invoke jealously in any artist who realizes what true masters can accomplish at a young age.Yes it is true that Dementia 13 takes elements from Hitchcock's Psycho among other Hitch films including anticipatory tension a finely dissonant score and even several camera shots but Coppola isn't just mimicking Hitchcock. He's manipulating the very essence of what makes Hitchcock frightening while adding his own distinct style and flavor to the film.And it IS genuinely frightening. It implies unspeakable things and it toys with one's mind as one watches it. And when the screen DOES show you something you've been anticipating partly in thanks to the demented film score expect to be surprised and expect your skin to tingle something fierce. The psychological angle with which Coppola approached Dementia 13 leaves one with the terrible sense that the human mind REALLY IS capable of this kind of demented horror... which of course makes the film all the more terrifying and satisfying.This film is not merely an amateur's flailing attempt. It is the first masterpiece of a blooming genius.The rating it has on imdb is appallingly low. I can't even begin to wonder what kinds of bad horror films are getting better ratings by people. Maybe more people just need to see this fairly obscure film before it will get its overdue appreciation. 9 out of 10".

Bored with his work as an assistant director on THE YOUNG RACERS he wrote a screenplay and asked Corman for 22000 to let him film it on the same sets used for THE YOUNG RACERS. He shot the film in two weeks and the shooting of the two films at the same sets simultaneously only worsened the quality of the film. I must admit made with this 99 cent budget it's a comparatively well crafted horror mystery with some good scenes but overall pretty dull with a story that makes little sense.The members of the Haloran family gather at their ancestral Irish castle to attend the annual commemoration of the death of Kathleen the daughter of the family who drowned in the lake on their estate six years earlier. One of the sons in the family John Haloran dies of a heartattack while listening to Elvis on the radio. His golddigging wife Louise then dumps the body in the pond and pretends he has returned to New York because she only gets part of the family inheritance when her husband is alive. When staying at the castle she begins an elaborate ruse to convince Lady Haloran that her drowned daughter Kathleen is still alive but soon she is killed by an axemurderer who proceeds to kill of the rest of the family one by one. What follows is who's the psycho? Much inspired by Hitchcock's PSYCHO it bears little relation plotwise let alone in suspense. Coppola puts more emphasis on graphic violence than suspense and the story doesn't make much sense. With some good scenes it kept me watching till the end but that's about it.Not a complete waste of time though as Coppola met his future wife Eleonor Neil on the set.Camera Obscura  610".

	schema:reviewBody "In Ireland the greedy American Louise Luana Anders is disappointed with the will of her motherinlaw Lady Haloran Ethne Dunne on the eve of Kathleen's seventh memorial ceremony. While rowing a small boat during the night in the pond of the Haloran Castle with Louise John Haloran Peter Read has a fatal heart attack. Louise is aware that she will not receive the share of the inheritance if the death of John is discovered so she dumps his body in the pond. Then she forges a farewell letter from John to his mother telling that he needs to go back to New York and she separates some clothes in John's suitcase to simulate his travel. Louise succeeds to convince Lady Haloran and her sons Richard William Campbell and Billy Bart Patton about John's urgent business trip. Later she talks to Billy about the spooky old castle and Billy tells that the place is haunted by his sister Kathleen who drowned in the pond many years ago driving his mother to the edge. On the next morning Richard's American fiance Kane Mary Mitchel arrives for the family's reunion and the Machiavellian Louise approaches to Lady Haloran showing sympathy for her feelings for Kathleen. During the night Louise goes to Kathleen's bedroom and gets some toys then she dives in the pond to prepare a prank to lure Lady Haloran. When she returns she is attacked by a man with a machete and dies when she is not found in the castle the family believes she has traveled without saying goodbye. Later Lady Haloran's doctor Justin Caleb Patrick Magee decides to investigate the small lake and the mystery about the Haloran Castle disclosing a hidden secret in the dysfunctional family.It is curious to see Dementia 13 in 2009 and the greatest attraction is the name of the director and writer Francis Coppola without the Ford in one of his earliest works. Produced by Roger Corman the King of the BMovies especially in the 60's this blackandwhite feature has an abrupt beginning without any previous development of characters or situation. Then the flawed and predictable story of dementia and family curse visibly follows the style of Alfred Hitchcock. I found in IMDb that the original title would be Dementia however it was added a 13 since there is a 1955 movie with the same title. My vote is five.Title Brazil Demncia 13 Dementia 13".

Later Lady Haloran's doctor Justin Caleb Patrick Magee decides to investigate the small lake and the mystery about the Haloran Castle disclosing a hidden secret in the dysfunctional family.It is curious to see Dementia 13 in 2009 and the greatest attraction is the name of the director and writer Francis Coppola without the Ford in one of his earliest works. Produced by Roger Corman the King of the BMovies especially in the 60's this blackandwhite feature has an abrupt beginning without any previous development of characters or situation. Then the flawed and predictable story of dementia and family curse visibly follows the style of Alfred Hitchcock. I found in IMDb that the original title would be Dementia however it was added a 13 since there is a 1955 movie with the same title. My vote is five.Title Brazil Demncia 13 Dementia 13";

The music is very memorable and spine chilling almost like that of HALLOWEEN.The film also has some horrific images such as the girl hanging on a hook shades of THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE here. There's a gory decapitation where the victim's head rolls into a pond. The acting is fairly good all round from Luana Anders as a woman obsessed by greed to the suspicious brothers. However the best actor of the lot is Patrick Magee who shines as the hard initially unlikable doctor. He puts in a brilliant performance in what is an overlooked film in the genre rarely seen or talked about but certainly something of a minor classic.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Early 1960's collaboration of director Francis Ford Coppala and film producer Roger Corman of a horror story set in and around Ireland's Haloran Castle. The movie has really two stories that intersect each other halfway into the movie which sets off a series of brutal ax murders which for the time the early 1960's are as graphic as anything seen in films back in those days. John Haloran Peter Reed dies of a sudden heart attack which seemed selfinduced rowing a boat with his wife Louise Luana Anders on board one night. Getting nothing from John's estate if he dies before she does which was stated in John's will Louise frantically tries to hide John's body by throwing him overboard into the lake. Louise ties an anchor to his waist to keep John from floating to the surface and being discovered.Back home Louise writes a letter attributing it to John stating that he's gone on an urgent business trip to New York and may not be back for some time. Louise then plans to talk John's emotionally unstable mother Lady Haloran Eithne Dunne into rewriting the will and include her in it with or without the survival of her husband. The next day John's older brother Richard William Campball is set to see his fiance Kane Mary Mitchel who's arriving from the USA to meet Richard's family in Ireland. When Kane is picked up by Richard's younger brother William Brent Patton at the airport William tells Kane that tomorrow is the seventh anniversary of their 13 yearold sister Kathleen's Barbara Downing tragic death and the family is having it's annual ceremony to commemorate it. Louise knowing how much Lady Haloran misses her beloved daughter Kathleen tries to manipulate her by trying to prove to her that she's somehow in touch with the dead Kathleen through communications with her from the other side. This is to get her to like Louise who Lady Haloran despises and get her to change the will that she wrote up that left Louise out in the cold if her husband dies in terms of his inheritance. Trying to convince Lady Haloran that she's really in communication with her daughter Louise tries to stage an event by taking some toys from Kathleen's room and planting them at the bottom of the pound where she drowned seven years ago.Louise plans at the right moment to have the toys rise to the surface in Lady Haloran presence to prove to Lady Haloran that she's telling her the truth. What Louise doesn't know by reviving suppressed memories of Kathleen's death is that she set off and put into motion the person who was responsible for it to commit a number of bloody ax murders with Louise being his first victim. Despite a shoe string budget and a unknown cast Dementia 13 is a pretty effective HorrorMystery movie.The murderer is more or less reviled almost at the beginning of the film but in such a way to make you not realize it. In a good attempt of misdirection by Francis Ford Coppala the audience is made to look somewhere or at someone else in the movie which keeps you guessing who the killer is until the very end. Coppala's use of striking black and white photography as well as the effective use of sounds and shadows greatly adds to the suspense as well as creepiness of the movie.".

The opening scene is simultaneously moody and comical and easily the most memorable part of the movie. The story here is pretty morbid with a family gathering at their castle for the yearly memorial of their dead little sister. Louise Luanna Anders married into the family and could care less. She just wants to get written into the matriarch's will oh and get the matriarch offed! so she can get her hands on some cash. Anders is perfect at playing cold and conniving and her nasty character is classic. The score is pretty effective in parts but gets a little overthetop and repetitive at times. The main problem with this film is it is way too short and ends very suddenly. It was filmed on a miniscule budget apparently using the set of another movie during the hours it wasn't shooting so that might have something to do with this. The first half is darkly amusing and atmospheric but the second half is just violent postPsycho exploitation with little payoff. My Rating 610".

The girl drowned in the estate's pond 7 years before and the mother still can't deal with the loss. But then the story pretty quickly turns into a guessing game of who is the mad axemurderer who dwells around the mansion? Coppola himself delivered a wellconstructed screenplay but the power of this film merely lies in the solid Gothic atmosphere instead of ingenious plotting. It's not that hard to guess the homicidal maniac's identity but the butchering heshe commits is disturbingly filmed and rather frightening. The scene in which this killer drags one of his victims through the meadow is efficiently eerie! Francis Ford Coppola's maybe owes his success to Roger Corman but it's definitely the producer's style and trademarks that triumph here. The depressing Irish castle and other dark set pieces make the wholesome look extra chilling and uncanny. The acting is overall decent but the best performance is unquestionably given by the brilliant British genreactor Patrick Magee Asylum Tales from the crypt and A Clockwork Orange.".

As it turns out the man behind The Godfather and Apocalypse Now made his directorial debut with the horrorsuspense thriller Dementia 13 in 1963. It's pretty routine for one of these movies as a family converges on an estate where a girl drowned many years earlier and strange things start happening. It was a little more interesting for me since I watched it presented by Elvira. In said edition the Mistress of the Dark occasionally interrupts the movie and points out the obvious mistakes.Even so Dementia 13 is still worth seeing if only to see Coppola's early effort. Starring William Campbell Luana Anders and Patrick Magee the wheelchair man in A Clockwork Orange. Unpleasant dreams!".

Perhaps this is because many film fans cannot comprehend that a director of Francis Ford Coppola's stature could produce such a rubbish film. No doubt if this film was made by an unknown person people would see it for what it truly is... a poor attempt to imitate Hithcock type suspense.Set in Ireland the film stays true to all the American stereotypical images of the country. So much so in fact that you half expect a Leprechaun to rush across the screen at any moment looking for a crock of gold. The doomed upperclass family all have distinct American English accents while the normal Irish have a country brogue and are portrayed as being rather dimwitted peasants... Apparently the O'Halloran clan went to school in America and then returned to Ireland presumably because in the mind of Francis Ford Coppola Ireland has no colleges or schools but just thatched cottages bogs and castles inhabited by AngloAmericans...The story line is predictable tedious and unrealistic. Most people who watch it can immediately point out the killer the first time the character appears on screen and therefore for the remainder of the film they are simply left waiting for the inevitable unveiling. I have tried to watch this film in full on two occasions but each time i have fallen into a deep sleep. My advice would be to avoid this film and take a look at another film also made by this director...its a relatively obscure film called the Godfather...it quite good.... This however is bile...".

Unless one is surrounded by a screaming and enthusiastic audience of young people or at least people young in heart the picture doesn't really deliver the goods. That said it's a damn good show and Coppola in his first major film knew what he was doing. As in his bigger budgeted but not necessarily better The Godfather he deals with a haunted loving somewhat dysfunctional family in this case in rural Ireland. A greedy American relative figures in the story. The suspense is at times almost painful and the violence shocking and always unexpected. The movie is a brilliant mixture of Val Lewton and Psycho. We don't really have a good sense of who the guilty party is till near the end. William Campbell is awfully good in this and his somewhat mephistophelian demeanor has never been better utilized. Luana Anders is lovely but alas drops out of the picture early on. One of the best things about the movie is that it's not logically developed scenes don't necessarily lead to the next thing one might expect and there's an abstract quality a kind of edgy elegant leisureliness that greatly enhances the way the story is told which is reminiscent of Jacques Tourneur and sadly missing from most of Coppola's later films.".

Some officials can't be bought however and a judge Edward Arnold with a deep seeded resentment of Eager whom he refers to as Thief and humiliates blocks his license. The coldly practical Eager circumvents the problem by compromising the judge's daughter Lana Turner but loses his balance on the tightrope he's walking when he falls hard for her dame.Eager has a crisper look than most noirs and director Mervyn LeRoy deftly handles the storyline and avoids run of the mill by injecting minor but telling incidentals that indicate Johnny's slow transformation. Suspense scenes are well edited and mise en scene is busy and filled with pertinent detail.While Bogart might seem an apt choice to play Eager I doubt he could have played it with the same nervous authoritative energy or insecurity Taylor does here. Most of all he lacks Taylor's good looks which are crucial to romancing Lana Turner. The glamorous Ms. Turner is at first a little hard to believe as a student studying social work but she does acquit herself well in some powerfully dramatic scenes with Taylor. Paul Stewart Glenda Farrell and Edward Arnold chip in fine supporting performances while Van Heflin delivers a magnificent one. Heflin as Eager's alcoholic sidekick and pickled conscience is not only effectively moving but also lends a droll sense of wit to the film with his sardonic observations.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Taylor was to lose his pretty boy image in this film about a sociopath gangster Johnny Eager. Never before had the audience seen him in such a distasteful role as such a bad guy that you just wanted to kill him yourself. Johnny meets Lizbeth Lana Turnerand uses her to blackmail her father played wonderfully well by Edward Arnold the District Attorney trying to put Johnny away for good. There is a split second scene when he is going to drive her home he closes the car door with both hands open on top of the door as it closes we see his hands seeming to be throwing an imaginary thing away his distaste for anyone or anything is apparent. No one means much of anything to him and this is the tipoff. A small but affective movement by Taylor. He seduces her then makes her think she has killed a man to make Arnold play along with the opening of his Dog Track. Van Heflin plays Johnny's alcoholic friend Jeff who is constantly trying to make Johnny understand that there is something to be said for helping others and not being so selfish. He is magnificent in his role and won the Academy Award for his thought to be homosexual overtoned portrayal. When Johnny is visited by Robert Sterling Lizbeth's former love he is stunned to find that Sterling wants to give him money to go away with Lizbeth because she is so in love with him and sick over the hidden secret that she holds within. When Eager goes to her the scene on the balcony between Taylor and Turner is so sexy so real that you just knew they were really in love outside of the film. A comment was made years ago that there was never a sexier woman than Lana Turner being held in the arms of Robert Taylor in this scene. In the end Johnny realizes that Lizbeth loves him and that for once in his criminal selfish life he is really in love. He shows her the so called dead man to cure her hysteria and then goes out in a hail of bullets held in the arms of Van Heflin his best and only friend. This is a great film noir and I truly believe that Taylor deserved a nomination for this portrayal........See it you will be a Taylor fan forever.".

	schema:headline " Robert who??? spoilers included";
	schema:reviewBody "Having only been familiar with Robert Taylor's body of forgettable work from the thirties The Broadway Melodies Camille etc seeing him in the title role of Johnny Eager was stunning.  Tom Hanks's 180 degree turn from silly comedies to Philadelphia might be a modern day equivalent.  Taylor steps into a role that would seem tailor made for Bogart Cagney or Robinson and does an arguably better job than any of them could have.  Yes Lana Turner is present and yes Van Heflin won a supporting Oscar but Taylor owns this film.Not to say that Turner Heflin and a few others aren't outstanding as well. Forget about Turner's sex appeal which is overrated anyway.  She's was a poor woman's Veronica Lake.  Her performance here is heartfelt without going over the top and surprisingly deep for what is a relatively small role. Heflin deservingly won his Oscar undoubtedly clinching it with the remarkable discharge of fluid from his eyes.  That's something you don't see too often even today.  The character of Courteney Robert Sterling is expected to provide a few groans in a film like this but was played very well.  A good girl who falls for a bad man always has to have a good man waiting in the wings to bring her back when the bad guy drops her.  Edward Arnold and the rest of the law were terrific as well.I don't really understand why others refer to Johnny Eager as a film noir. It may have an element or two of noir to a degree but it's really just a gangster film.  A late entry perhaps to a genre that was on it's way out but not noir.  Neither the characters nor their actions are dark enough. Hell all the characters in this film are likeable.  How can it be noir? Most gangster pictures including the good ones and the REALLY good ones usually relied on a pretty elementary plot involving deceit and revenge with a pretty girl thrown in.  The good and really good ones had great and memorable performances Cagney in White Heat Robinson in Key Largo Bogart in Bullets or Ballots eg which made them great.  Eager has the great performances as well a script that transcends just about every other gangster film I've ever seen.  The script has as much characterization for a number of characters as the great dramas.  The dialogue while somewhat dated is quick sharp and often funny.  Heflin in particular was never at a loss for something thoughtful to say.  And the plot is unusually complex with a number of twists turns and characters.  Of course you knew that this being the 40's that Taylor was not going to live happily ever after no matter how much you liked him.  Of course he's not going to.  A criminal in that day and age of motion pictures almost NEVER gets away.  So how was he going to go out?  That was my question as the end drew near.  Was this going to be just another gangster going out in a hail of bullets with one last thing to say with his last gasp of air?  I had a feeling that the writers weren't going to let me down since they had done such an incredible job so far.  It just goes to show that a characteristic of a great movie is that no detail is unimportant.  No piece of information or character that seems insignificant early on will ultimately prove to be so.  The brief mention of the beat cop early in the film followed by a tearful plea from his wife in the middle and finally that same beat cop ultimately gunning Johnny down serve as a beautiful ribbon to tie around a perfectly wrapped gift.Johnny Eager is one of the best films of the 40s as well as one of the all time greats.".

He plays his role with great intensity and complexity making his performance one of the most deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscars in the history of the Academy Awards.

	schema:headline " Toughtalkin' 2timin'  terrific!";
	schema:reviewBody "First the few bad points 1 Paul Stewart's accent  I think he picked it up when it rolled out of a gumball machine.  He's a fine actor and his character Julio was interesting but only half of his dialog is decipherable.  If anything it's even worse than his accent in Citizen Kane and that's saying something! 2 I normally don't mind charactertinged period lingo but this film has way too much of it.  Don't even try to count all the dames' doughs' and suckers.'  After a while it becomes tiresome. 3 Johnny hardly ever refers to his girlfriends by name instead repeatedly calling them sugar.'  How annoying.That said there is much to recommend Johnny Eager.  It is one of my favorites of all time.THE LEADS Robert Taylor Johnny Eager although slightly too young to play this bigboss gangster character gives a convincing performance making a great sociopath.  He manages to turn that perfect face into a menacing sneer staring both friends and enemies alike down with a furrowed brow and an icy coldblooded glare in his eyes.  It is easy to dislike his character which is rare for Taylor.  I have heard that he pushed for the role in order to break out of his prettyboy mold and expand his range and Eager is the perfect vehicle for this.  I just which he didn't have that silly moustache! GAH!Van Heflin deserved his best supporting actor Oscar for his role in this film a rare win for a pathetic character.  He plays Jeff Hartnett the very complex best friend of Johnny  a selfloathing alcoholic homosexual  in an abusive codependent relationship with Johnny.  Heflin is the best male crier I've seen in filmdom see also The Three Musketeers '48 Madame Bovary '49 310 to Yuma.  He excels in conveying sympathy for his characters and their various plights.  Here as Jeff his expressive eyes alone speak volumes as well as do his many philosophical psychological speeches.  Still some of his dialog is bizarre to say the least.  An outstanding performance.Lana Turner as Lizabeth Bard Taylor's love interest gives a wonderful performance as well.  Her character runs the full gamut of emotions all of which she handles beautifully. She and Taylor made a great pair  the posters screamed TNT. Unfortunately they were never paired again.  Herbeauty is so striking that whenever she is onscreen with others you find yourself drawn to her.  It is a very mature acting job for the tender age of 21.The homosexual element in the film is extraordinary for 1941.  I think the Production Code people must have been on autopilot when they read the script.  If this didn't tip them off then you'd think the finished product would.  SPOILER The scene where Taylor cradles the dog's head in his hands after fighting with Heflin is mirrored at the end of the film with the two actors and that's the least of it! I won't give any more away.  Hello?  How it passed I will never know but it makes the characters even that of Johnny so humane and multidimensional. Very impressive and well ahead of its time.SUPPORTING PLAYERS Edward Arnold  Ever dependable again he does not disappoint.  As Turner's stepdad Arnold too expresses a wide range of emotions with ease and total believability as the lawenforcement element of the story.  His conflict over Turner's lifestyle is portrayed fabulously.  One of my favorite character actors ever! Robert Sheridan Great as the noble and selfless Jimmy Courtney Turner's other man.'  I wish his film career would have gone further. Glenda Farrell Lovely but wasted in a very small role.

	onyx:emotionText "First the few bad points 1 Paul Stewart's accent  I think he picked it up when it rolled out of a gumball machine.  He's a fine actor and his character Julio was interesting but only half of his dialog is decipherable.  If anything it's even worse than his accent in Citizen Kane and that's saying something! 2 I normally don't mind charactertinged period lingo but this film has way too much of it.  Don't even try to count all the dames' doughs' and suckers.'  After a while it becomes tiresome. 3 Johnny hardly ever refers to his girlfriends by name instead repeatedly calling them sugar.'  How annoying.That said there is much to recommend Johnny Eager.  It is one of my favorites of all time.THE LEADS Robert Taylor Johnny Eager although slightly too young to play this bigboss gangster character gives a convincing performance making a great sociopath.  He manages to turn that perfect face into a menacing sneer staring both friends and enemies alike down with a furrowed brow and an icy coldblooded glare in his eyes.  It is easy to dislike his character which is rare for Taylor.  I have heard that he pushed for the role in order to break out of his prettyboy mold and expand his range and Eager is the perfect vehicle for this.  I just which he didn't have that silly moustache! GAH!Van Heflin deserved his best supporting actor Oscar for his role in this film a rare win for a pathetic character.  He plays Jeff Hartnett the very complex best friend of Johnny  a selfloathing alcoholic homosexual  in an abusive codependent relationship with Johnny.  Heflin is the best male crier I've seen in filmdom see also The Three Musketeers '48 Madame Bovary '49 310 to Yuma.  He excels in conveying sympathy for his characters and their various plights.  Here as Jeff his expressive eyes alone speak volumes as well as do his many philosophical psychological speeches.  Still some of his dialog is bizarre to say the least.  An outstanding performance.Lana Turner as Lizabeth Bard Taylor's love interest gives a wonderful performance as well.  Her character runs the full gamut of emotions all of which she handles beautifully. She and Taylor made a great pair  the posters screamed TNT. Unfortunately they were never paired again.  Herbeauty is so striking that whenever she is onscreen with others you find yourself drawn to her.  It is a very mature acting job for the tender age of 21.The homosexual element in the film is extraordinary for 1941.  I think the Production Code people must have been on autopilot when they read the script.  If this didn't tip them off then you'd think the finished product would.  SPOILER The scene where Taylor cradles the dog's head in his hands after fighting with Heflin is mirrored at the end of the film with the two actors and that's the least of it! I won't give any more away.  Hello?  How it passed I will never know but it makes the characters even that of Johnny so humane and multidimensional. Very impressive and well ahead of its time.SUPPORTING PLAYERS Edward Arnold  Ever dependable again he does not disappoint.  As Turner's stepdad Arnold too expresses a wide range of emotions with ease and total believability as the lawenforcement element of the story.  His conflict over Turner's lifestyle is portrayed fabulously.  One of my favorite character actors ever! Robert Sheridan Great as the noble and selfless Jimmy Courtney Turner's other man.'  I wish his film career would have gone further. Glenda Farrell Lovely but wasted in a very small role. Patricia Dane Her character is unsympathetic but she manages to inject a high level of humanity into it evoking concern nonetheless. Barry Nelson in his very early twenties and already a decent villain. Paul Stewart see aboveSpecial Mention goes to Gypsy Prince the retired greyhound dog with such a sweet face endlessly chasing the squeaky toy!DO NOT MISS THIS FILM!";

	schema:reviewBody "The celebrated German philosopher Immanual Kant's premise of theory was that there is no originality because we are influenced by what we experience. In that case Johnny Eager 1942is a clichd gangster film. But the clichd roles give way to nuanced characters which have originality within their various slants of their respective stereotypes. Director Leroy achieves this by adding to the clichs of sharp suited mobsters and their dolls anomalies as in the emotional erudite gangster with ethics.A classic stereotype well observed and researched by the production team is that of Lana Turner's character Lizbeth Bard. She is the clichd sociology student. That is she is a middle class naive ingnue whose fascination with her subject matter gets her in too deep. This role gave Turner credibility as an actor! Likewise the film gave Taylor the credibility he deserved as an actor of dimensions. His caricature of the solipsistic gangster gave him an edge which usurped his 'pretty boy' image. Nevertheless Taylor's Johnny Eager seems to have a sense of his beauty that has the women running to him. One example is the scene when the women run to serve him at the desk near the start of the film. This begs the question of was Johnny Eager's looks that had the women eating out of his hand? or was it his 'gangster' image that attracted them? Could Eager have had the women falling for him with just looks alone? His character wouldn't be half as sexy in the role of Bard's other love interest that of the sweet well intentioned good guy as in Robert Sterling's character Jimmy Courtney.The other stand out performance deserved of his Oscar is that of Van Heflin playing the complex sesquipedalian and polymath Jeff Hartnett. He is the cerebral side kick of Eager. Like the women he has got in too deep with Eager because of his homo erotic attraction to the latter.Mention should also go to the excellent turns by Edward Arnald as the over protective Dad who has come from nothingmaking it as a respectable lawyer with ambitions for his daughter to marry a wealthy socialite with a good name. His over protectiveness as Bard's Dad gives way to a subtext of incest. This has Hartnett Heflin mention the famous psychologist Freud.Also outstanding in this film is the clever script which is evidently well researched as in the example of the naive sociology student. The direction of the film is a credit to Mervyn LeRoy who portrays the clichd caricatures of the characters to almost perfection. . The film takes allot of twists and turns which defines it as 'film noir'.This was the film that altered the career of Robert Taylor transforming him from a 'pretty boy' film star to a credible actor. It definitely is worth seeing.".

However given that the film is very polished has somewhat less dark dialog features bigname actors and is rather pretty to look at I would consider this almost like Film NoirLite. This isn't necessarily a complaintit is a good film. However the film just doesn't have that grittiness to it you'd expect for the genrethough all the actors in it did a very good job.The film stars Robert Taylor as the mobster Johnnyquite a departure from his 1930s pretty boy image. Here he pretends to be a parolee going straight but he's still in charge of the local mob and everyone but Taylor's dimwitted parole officer can see this. The man especially aware of just how dirty Taylor is happens to be the father Edward Arnold of the girl Lana Turner Taylor is pursuing. He's the district attorney who hates Taylor and yet is powerless to stop his impetuous girl from throwing her life away on the mug. Why she loves Taylor is a bit hard to follow. Sure he's very handsome and charming but he's also extremely selfish and just plain bad! Johnny is usually accompanied by either Van Heflin as his alcoholic and welleducated sidekick or Paul Stewart who oddly plays a Hispanic! Stewart made a long career out of playing mobsters and why they insisted on sticking this bizarre accent on him is beyond mehe's plenty interesting and menacing already.There are many many twists and turns in the filmtoo many to discuss here. However and important one is a sleazy setup where Johnny convinces his girl that she killed someone in order to give him something with which to blackmail her father!! This and his subsequent actions serve to convince Heflin and the audience that Johnny has no soulthough late in the film he comes to actually feel guilt for destroying Lana and he makes amends in a very rousing and violent finale.As I said the acting was extremely good as was the dialog. About the only negatives were the silly accent by Stewart and the somewhat convoluted and overly complicated plot. Still it's a very good flick and one that old film buffs will enjoy.".

He runs a dog racing racket and has henchmen to do his dirty work. He seems to have everything figured out until he meets a girl who figures him out but still falls in love with him. A guy like Johnny Eager can't have a respectable dame like her falling all over him right? Johnny Eager doesn't fall in love.Robert Taylor stars in the title role and is very good as the classy criminal. The lovely Lana Turner plays the love interest Liz Bard. This was still relatively early in Turner's career. She'd feature in DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE 1941 the same year but make more of an impression later on in THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE 1946. Turner's character is a key component of JOHNNY EAGER but she spends considerable time offscreen.Van Heflin won the Oscar for playing Jeff Hartnett a wellread alcoholic and Johnny's best friend and confidant. He's not interested in the criminal activities but he keeps Johnny company offers him advice and keeps his secrets. A selfish crook like Johnny Eager knows nothing about love or sympathy but even Johnny Eager needs a friend.Heflin would go on to such movies as SHANE 1953 and 310 TO YUMA 1957 in the 1950s but he actually won an Academy Award for this film early on in his career. Heflin's performance was my favorite part of the movie and he deserved Oscar recognition. He really stood out among the ensemble. His character is always halfdrunk but functional honest and prone to colorful literary quotations. The performance is subtle and nuanced compared to the rest of the cast. Heflin is able to convey different emotions throughout the movie and even takes a punch falls to the ground rolls around looks up and leaves all in if I recall correctly one shot.Other viewers have pointed out undertones with Heflin's character that are there if you want to take 'em or leave 'em. The film works fine either way.A bigtime racketeer who uses people for his own advantage Johnny doesn't understand love and has no real friends except Jeff. He'd never even had a pet dog growing up. Johnny Eager is like an emotionless robot until Liz comes along. In the end it is Johnny's newfound shred of humanity that ultimately leads to his downfall. I guess. The ending never made 100 sense to me.JOHNNY EAGER is an enjoyable little film from 1941. Part gangster movie part film noir lite. I really don't know how best to classify this one. But it has somehow fallen out of the public consciousness available only by ondemand DVD from Warner Archive and occasionally on TCM. It's hard to understand why since it's a decent enough movie with two notable stars Robert Taylor and Lana Turner. And it's an OSCARWINNER! One would think people would be interested in seeing the film that provided the Best Supporting Actor of 1941 Van Heflin's shining moment.I caught this on TCM recently and I'd recommend checking it out if you have the time. It's not essential viewing but it's worth a look. Catch it when you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fabulous cast a brilliant screenplay and a truly dynamic pairing really create TNT here Taylor and Turner as beautiful a couple as could possibly be on screen during the golden age of cinema. Even in spite of their age difference Robert and Lana sparkle and this is a single pairing that even outdid Lana's four films with that dear Mr. Gable. Robert Taylor is a parolee and she is the daughter of one of the prosecutors Edward Arnold who sent him up the river. Taylor is obviously not done with the shady life and Arnold is out to expose the corruption involving Taylor and a dog track he is preparing to open while living the seemingly honest life of a cab driver.Van Heflin deservedly won the Oscar as the drunken philosopher who is the heart and soul of the film dying inside due to his consumption but still filled with the truth of life in spite of that addiction. You get the impression that this idealistic drunkard imbibes because he is disgusted with a world that is beyond his comprehension. In fact the drunker he is the more in tuned with his wisdom he is showing how deceptive alcohol can be when it makes you open your eyes metaphysically while closing them physically.There's a great supporting cast with characters who sparkle with cynicism and hardness. Taylor's young niece is all young lady on the surface suddenly exploding in rough talk out of nowhere. The character of Turner's fellow sociology student partner is also amusing as she constantly keeps inserting her foot into her mouth. Former Warner Brothers B star Glenda Farrell has a cameo as an old acquaintance of Taylor's whose desire for help from him has an ironic connection with the finale. Patricia Dane as Taylor's obvious mistress hysterically mispronounces Herod Agrippa and does not remotely display a heart of gold underneath film characters like this usually later reveal.Edward Arnold also is winning as Turner's father who finds himself the victim of blackmail thanks to a vicious game Taylor uses her in showing a disgust with both Taylor and himself as he goes against his own moral code to protect his daughter. Ultimately the film surrounds the heat between Taylor and Turner which explodes in a scene where Turner falsely believes herself to have impulsively committed murder. This is a speedy film that is a preliminary to the growing genre of film noir not as dark as those to follow within two yearsbut utilizing the same types of camera shots and tough dialog that was on the verge of taking over the screen. The fact that pretty people are not leaving a really pretty situation makes this noir enough for me and one that remains a classic to this day.".

Taylor is obviously not done with the shady life and Arnold is out to expose the corruption involving Taylor and a dog track he is preparing to open while living the seemingly honest life of a cab driver.Van Heflin deservedly won the Oscar as the drunken philosopher who is the heart and soul of the film dying inside due to his consumption but still filled with the truth of life in spite of that addiction. You get the impression that this idealistic drunkard imbibes because he is disgusted with a world that is beyond his comprehension. In fact the drunker he is the more in tuned with his wisdom he is showing how deceptive alcohol can be when it makes you open your eyes metaphysically while closing them physically.There's a great supporting cast with characters who sparkle with cynicism and hardness. Taylor's young niece is all young lady on the surface suddenly exploding in rough talk out of nowhere. The character of Turner's fellow sociology student partner is also amusing as she constantly keeps inserting her foot into her mouth. Former Warner Brothers B star Glenda Farrell has a cameo as an old acquaintance of Taylor's whose desire for help from him has an ironic connection with the finale. Patricia Dane as Taylor's obvious mistress hysterically mispronounces Herod Agrippa and does not remotely display a heart of gold underneath film characters like this usually later reveal.Edward Arnold also is winning as Turner's father who finds himself the victim of blackmail thanks to a vicious game Taylor uses her in showing a disgust with both Taylor and himself as he goes against his own moral code to protect his daughter. Ultimately the film surrounds the heat between Taylor and Turner which explodes in a scene where Turner falsely believes herself to have impulsively committed murder. This is a speedy film that is a preliminary to the growing genre of film noir not as dark as those to follow within two yearsbut utilizing the same types of camera shots and tough dialog that was on the verge of taking over the screen. The fact that pretty people are not leaving a really pretty situation makes this noir enough for me and one that remains a classic to this day.";

As well as Van Heflin who received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor as Johnny's sad sack drunk and scholarly pal Jeff Hartenett put on quite a show in the MGM glossy crimedrama Johnny Eager. Doing his parole as a taxi driver Johnny Eager is still secretly running his old crime organization with that cold and hardfisted efficiency that he ran it before he was sent up the river to the state penitentiary. At his monthly parole board hearing Johnny meets two sociology students Lisbeth Bard and Judy Sanford Lana Turner and Dana Lewis and both fall Judy outwardly and Lisbeth secretly for the goodlooking former hoodlum. Later Johnny again meets Lisbeth at a nightclub that he was doing business with and learns that she's the stepdaughter of State DA and the man who put him behind bars John Benson Farrell Edward Arnold. Johnny has all the top police and politicians paid off to allow him to go back to business as top city crime boss. Eeryone but the straight and honest DA Farrell who swore to do everything to put Johnny back in prison. With Lisbeth madly in love with Johnny he sees a chance to take advantage of her blind passion for him to his benefit. Getting Lisbeth up at his pad he has one of his hoods Julio Paul Stewart break in and get into a fight with him. As Julio has Johnny on the floor and is about to knife him Johnny screams to Lisbeth to shoot him with his gun and she does killing Julio saving Johnny's life. Unknown to Lisbeth the gun had blanks and Julio was anything but dead but the thought on her part of killing someone drove Lisbeth into a deep depression. Johnny uses the fact of Lisbeth's guilt to blackmail her stepfather DA Farrell to stop hounding him. At the same time have him approve of Johnny opening the dog racetrack run by his mob! Something which DA Farrell publicly avowed never to sanction. Not realizing how much Lisbeth is in love with him this whole plan backfires on Johnny when she tells him that she's willing to take the rap for him! This in order to keep Johnny out of prison for being at the scene of the crime. With Julio alive this would show not only Lisbeth who Johnny didn't really care that much for but her stepfather the State DA what a lowlife louse he is and throw him back in the clink this time for good. Never really loving anyone Johnny's attraction to Lisbeth and her selfless love for him turned out to be his downfall. Trying to tell Lisbeth that Julio was alive and that she has nothing to feel guilty about only makes Lisbeth fall more in love with Johnny. Lisbeth thinking that he's trying to keep her from going to jail for saving his life by killing Julio. In desperation Johnny now sees that the only way he can get out of this dangerous situation is to make sure that Julio is really dead and this turns out to be a fatal mistake on Johnny's part. Robert Taylor is darkly handsome and effective as the ruthless Johnny Eager as he finds out that his good looks and success with women turned out to be his Achilles Heel. There was a heartbreaking scene at the dogtrack when one of Johnny Eager's former girlfriends Mea Glenda Farrell tried to get him to use his influence to get her husband police officer Joe Agridowski Byron Shores back on his old beat. That way he can spend more time with her and their three kids. It takes officer Argidowski twice as long to go to work and back from where he's assigned to now and it's injuring his feet from walking the twice as long beat.Johnny coldly and unfeeling turns the desperate Mea down even though he could have easily helped her husband. Later there ironically turned out to be a bit of poetic justice for Mea and her husband Joe in the final scene of the movie at Johnny Eager's expense.".

	schema:headline " A superb documentary on several levels";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1966 England won the 8th World Cup in England but that is not the only story. As a result of only one place being allocated to Africa Asia and the Pacific region all but two countries boycotted and withdrew their teams leaving North Korea and Australia. Having been on opposite side of the war neither recognised each other so the game was played in Cambodia. Not giving them a chance in hell Australia and the world are shocked to be knocked about 61 and North Korea book their tickets to England  a political problem since England did not recognise the state of North Korea. After much Foreign Office horsetrading the team arrives and is drawn into the same group and Italy the Soviet Union and Chile. With nobody giving them a chance and a 30 loss and 11 draw behind them the North Koreans must beat Italy to deliver their Great Leader's request of 'one or two wins' and pull off a historic upset.I decided to watch this documentary because it was mere days to go until Euro 2004 kicked off and I was in the mood for football stories however this wonderful film gave me so much more than just that. For most of my generation 1966 only means one thing  England winning I suspect very few not alive at the time know of the North Korean team that went along. For most of us the words 'upset' and Korea' will only bring to mind the wonderful run South Korea had in 2002's World Cup knocking out Italy as it happens! but this story is just as exciting. In terms of football the film is very interesting not only in terms of the story but also in giving an insight into football of almost 40 years ago. Can you imagine a world cup being held in Middlesborough today? Not very glamorous is it! Certainly the idea of any team training on the grounds of a factory in Northern England as Korea did is unthinkable now  seeing the luxury England are living in in Portugal right now is further contrast. The style of football is also a lot less technical and I was surprised how many goals seemed to be scored by individual runs and then a shot.Anyway everyone loves the underdog and this film shows the underdog being supported by the English fans and pulling off the biggest shocks of the 1966 World Cup by sending Italy home and going 30 up in 20 minutes against Portugal. It is fascinating to see the players then  so full of fight and ignoring the odds playing with the sort of spirit that we all wish our domestic sides could muster. To hear them talk as old men just makes the matches even more interesting as they recall their thoughts and feelings  I suspect few of us will not be envious of a keeper who considers his net to be the reputation of his country and would rather die than let Italy score in it. As a sports film it is really interesting and was the first time I had heard the story told however this film is much more than that.As we all know North Korea is a mystery  a few months ago a massive explosion may have killed 100's over a large area but I still don't know more than that and little information ever came out regarding it. We all know the stories of human rights violations and their nuclear programme and this film just makes the place an even bigger mystery by showing a side of the people and the country that is appealing and mystifying at the same time. We hear these stories but yet I watched these old men stand at the foot of the Great Leader's statute and weep as they wished he could be there with them. Likewise many talk of great affection of meeting him and it is clear that they wanted nothing more than winning at least one game for him and their beloved country. It is fascinating because the makers got quite unique access into the country and present us with people's honest opinion  they may be lying for fear of state retaliation but I could only see genuine sorrow in their tears as they talked of their Leader's death. Like I said it is mystifying but it is a very interesting look into the country through the eyes of the football team.Overall this is a great film if you like football stories but also if you are interested in North Korea. I came for the football but the other layers Korea a picture of England  football 40 years ago etc all engaged me really easily. The story of the World Cup is great fun and the wider stuff about North Korea is fascinating and frustratingly confusing but in a good way. The end result is a disarmingly charming documentary that surprised me by just how interesting layered and fascinated it turned out to be  just like the team themselves my expectations were exceeded.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I am not ordinarily a sports fan watching this documentary was an exhilarating and bittersweet experience. The success of the North Korean underdogs in the 8th World Cup was exciting to relive through documentary footage. The workingclass English burb they stayed in Middlesborough clearly adopted them for their cute underdog status for they were wellbehaved polite and hardworking soccer players. And at no taller than 5'5 on average as one spectator put it it was like watching a bunch of jockeys playing. It is comical that when they are bunked in a Roman Catholic monastery they are creeped out by the garish images of the crucifixion. Also impressive were the shots of 20000 N. Korean Citizens doing the most elaborate form of the The Wave known to man. The N. Koreans returned as heroes in N. Korea but still lived in a material way that would remind most Americans of poor people. Team members say they were able to get as far as they did in the competition primarily through emphasis on teamwork and national pride given their physical limitations against the Europeans. Certainly the most impressive achievements of human civilization have always been accomplished when people are united by some ideology or religion bound together for a common purpose. It makes one think of the pros and cons of teamwork vs. individualism free societies vs. communist ones. I was struck by how their atheistic communist ideology taught them to believe that each was responsible for their own destiny and yet the movie is filled with numerous shots of the team making reverential references to their Great Leader exactly in the manner in which a religious fundamentalist refers to God or Allah. A very interesting movie but it was obvious the team could not speak freely to the cameramen. Their words are laced with modesty and communist rhetoric. Strange how the most ideological and theologically governed societies are often the ones lacking the most in free speech. Unity vs. individualism the pros and cons of both soccer and politics.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Game of Their Lives";
	schema:reviewBody "In recent times I guess we're all too familiar with the bad press that North Korea is getting especially in its nuclear weapons programme. One of the last hardlined communist states left in the world we often wonder what goes on behind that iron curtain in its reclusive behaviour that have spawned many questions with little forthcoming answers. And documentaries which offer a sneak peek into what goes on behind that veil of secrecy would also be cast a doubtful eye whether the filmmakers were gagged from painting a more subjective angle.Naturally getting permission to shoot within North Korea isn't easy and Daniel Gordon and his crew spent more than 3 years obtaining that nod and for the fact that they were allowed unprecedented bandwidth to capture what they needed for their movie and I guess the good job they did with this opened another door for their other North Korean documentary titled A State of Mind. For those interested in the landscape of the state beyond the much publicized mass displays and sabrerattling military parades this film offers a wonderful montage of life in the country with plenty of everyday scenes fused into one sequence that was in my opinion too short as it left you wanting more.But let's get back to the subject matter and that's the exploration of what happened to the North Korean football team of 1966 who were very much written off by pundits all over despite their hard work at overcoming Australia in the qualifiers which stemmed very much from a history left unlearned just like how the Western forces underestimated the drive and will to win of the Imperial Japanese forces in WWII. The filmmakers had tracked down almost all the surviving members of that team of 66 and one just cannot believe that they're hardly the straightlaced serious folks that one would expect anyone to become after living under a hard regime all their lives.The film straddles between the present and the past allowing each man to recount their moment of glory on a world stage. Everyone had a sense of humour and this shows during their interviews being extremely free with their words and candid in their responses quite contrary to what one would expect with minders probably being close by nodding in approval at what was mentioned but it's not the case. In many ways Dan Gordon's film will open up many eyes that politics aside they too are human beings with the same hopes and dreams with experience to share and the desire to do so with fellow friends no matter what political system they live under. And you can't help but to chuckle at how confused these guys were when they finally made that leap into democracies during their tour of duty which on one hand they're pretty focused on their mission and on the other in awe at the frenzy happening around them.This film can also be deemed as a football film in a certain sense since it had archived a slice of qualifying action for that sole OceaniaAfricaAsian spot in the World Cup finals of 16 teams then. The 1966 World Cup will always be remembered for a few things and for football fans this film presents and showcases some of those aspects in a year where England hoisted its only World Cup trophy to date and on home soil too. For those who are familiar with footballing legends then this film offered us a glimpse of the 1965 minted European footballer of the year and top scorer of the tournament in Portugal's Eusebio. You'll also bear witness to how the rules of the sport had evolved as back then substitutes were not allowed.But like most sports too there's always this deep affinity with the underdogs and the North Korean team being the representative of Oceania Africa and Asia had its work cut out for them. And probably their success in making up for their lack of technical skills with fitness speed and energy to chase down every ball though lacking accuracy up front to make it count for something. Their Chollima mindset and swelling of pride not to let their fatherland down that neversaydie attitude could have also endeared the team to many fans in Britain especially the Middlesbrough folks who have adopted the team as their own. And the neverending debate on teamwork versus individual flair cannot be more keenly defined when witnessing how through teamwork the North Koreans have overcome opponents though thanks to the Portuguese's Eusebio he had single handedly through conscious bodylanguage. turned the tide in a riveting match that the filmmakers had managed to condense into a tense finish.The film also tries to insert statements whenever it can on how the role of sports can be used to promote harmony and goodwill in building bridges and strengthening ties and cutting through politics and the sore memories of war between those who were fighting on opposite sides a decade ago. But I guess the true value here is that peek behind the iron curtain and for footballing fans an extremely well made documentary that brings a blast from the past in one of the World Cup's defining moments.".

	onyx:emotionText "In recent times I guess we're all too familiar with the bad press that North Korea is getting especially in its nuclear weapons programme. One of the last hardlined communist states left in the world we often wonder what goes on behind that iron curtain in its reclusive behaviour that have spawned many questions with little forthcoming answers. And documentaries which offer a sneak peek into what goes on behind that veil of secrecy would also be cast a doubtful eye whether the filmmakers were gagged from painting a more subjective angle.Naturally getting permission to shoot within North Korea isn't easy and Daniel Gordon and his crew spent more than 3 years obtaining that nod and for the fact that they were allowed unprecedented bandwidth to capture what they needed for their movie and I guess the good job they did with this opened another door for their other North Korean documentary titled A State of Mind. For those interested in the landscape of the state beyond the much publicized mass displays and sabrerattling military parades this film offers a wonderful montage of life in the country with plenty of everyday scenes fused into one sequence that was in my opinion too short as it left you wanting more.But let's get back to the subject matter and that's the exploration of what happened to the North Korean football team of 1966 who were very much written off by pundits all over despite their hard work at overcoming Australia in the qualifiers which stemmed very much from a history left unlearned just like how the Western forces underestimated the drive and will to win of the Imperial Japanese forces in WWII.

Everything is so delightfully predictable that you needn't waste time trying to unravel it. Instead you just sit back and enjoy the presentation.The humour is largely visual but it's not corny or slapstick. It's hard to describeperhaps I'd categorize it with Monty Python's deadpan style subtle and classy while not being afraid to make fun of itself. And this movie definitely makes fun of itself like in the scene where the kids are running from a ferocious wild boar which is quite plainly a stuffed prop. Juxtapose the bizarrely inappropriate Louis Armstrong tune What a Wonderful World on top and you have yourself 3 solid minutes of asphyxiating laughter.Now comedy aside it's important that you know something about the music. These kids are actually playing their own instruments. The fingering and breathing technique is authentic right down to the last flubbed note. I think this is worthy of mention because it adds a certain authenticity to the film much like in SPINAL TAP. Not only are they acting they're really playing too.Let me finish by saying that YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE SWING MUSIC to enjoy this film. Me I'm a fan of death metal. But by the end of this film and for some time thereafter I sure as heck found myself whistling Take the 'A' Train. Can't get the bloody tune out of my head now.".

And this show delivers at all fronts. From the many comedic and zany moments to preaching never give ups the story is breezy and the pacing comfortable. The main leads are rock solid good lookers while the supporting casts consists of quirky characters like the rocker chicks huh? in a jazz band?! watch to find out! gangsterish mechanic wimps and a teachermaestro wannabe brings much laughter even though at times their characters might seem one dimensional.What works is definitely the chemistry amongst the cast. It seems from the out takes that they had tremendous fun in making this film and it shows in the end product.One gripe you may have about this film is that the band when they finally get their act together always seem to play the same old piece when you're craving for more. Well that's what made the finale work by building the expectation then surpassing it  it's 15 minutes of pure musical splendor and it really made me wanna stand up from my seat and swing along. Too bad I didn't do that cos I know the entire audience might just join along with me!

So if there are silly situations it is only because they are a bunch of silly girls that have to come clean in a serious situation i.e. high school competition. Other than not meeting any of Uncle Waldo's criteria for a fivestar movie I have no idea why this movie is not already distributed in USA. And that is a shame.".

So if there are silly situations it is only because they are a bunch of silly girls that have to come clean in a serious situation i.e. high school competition. Other than not meeting any of Uncle Waldo's criteria for a fivestar movie I have no idea why this movie is not already distributed in USA. And that is a shame.";

This movie actually has so much heart its great to watch. Its full of good humor and all the girls of the title are engaging. Part of the time I was reminded of Hula Girls which has a premise that is a bit similar but this is a better film. Its also better than the also similar Linda Linda Linda. The girls learn jazz going through the usual learning curves. The success or failure of this film hinges upon whether you like the characters and I do. They are not caricatures not over the top just girls who want to play jazz. Another thing I liked a lot was that the film doesn't have any soppy coming of age romance subplots which would retract from the fun of this. No need to go into what happens its fairly obvious but this obvious is fun to watch. Highly recommended.".

Therefore she envies the members of the school's brass band who gets to travel with the baseball team. However on this particular hot summer day the band's bus leaves before the caterer arrives with the band's lunches. Because the caterer has another delivery Tomoko along with the other girls in the class decide to deliver the lunches. While on the train they eat one of the lunches and subsequently fall asleep missing their stop. After suffering such setbacks as jumping into rice paddies to avoid an oncoming train and having to wash their socks the girls finally deliver the lunches to the brass band and their conductor. However Nakamura Yuta a boy Tomoko constantly bickers with does not receive a lunch because his was consumed on the train ride. However it seems an angel of mercy was looking over Nakamura when the other members of the brass band suffer a major bought of food poisoning.Nakamura being the only member of the brass band who is healthy is given the task to put together another band for a major baseball game. However only three girls show up to volunteer two punk rock girls who play guitar and bass respectively and Sekiguchi Kaori a sweet nerdy girl who can play the recorder. However knowing that Tomoko ate one of the lunches he spotted a grain of cooked rice on her chin at the baseball game Nakamura orders Tomoko and her summer school classmates to join the brass band. However there number only totals sixteen which is too small a number for a brass band. Yet after a few events Nakamura decides instead to start Big Swing Band.Instead of playing music at first Nakamura makes the girls exercise to build up their strength and lung capacity for a long performance. The girls eventually begin to enjoy playing their instruments but right before the big game the brass bands members regain their strength and perform instead of the girls. However seeds of love for music have been planted in the hearts of the saxophonist Tomoko the trumpeter Saito Yoshie the trombonist Sekiguchi and the drummer Tanaka Naomi and while the other girls quit in order to hang out with some boys this little group with Nakamura in tow sets forth to start their own jazz band.Before actually watching this film my only knowledge concerning it was that it was directed by the director of Waterboys but having yet to watch that film this left me with little information for what to expect. However I received the experience of watching a very enjoyable film that was without violence unless you count snowball fights and Naomi's butt cracking the head of a wild boar when the girls go matsutake hunting without angst without hormonal frustration etc. The young actresses have a wonderful chemistry and seem like actual friends instead of actresses. Also the personalities of Tomoko Nakamura Yoshie Sekiguchi and Naomi are very well fleshed out and each one of them has their own personal quirks Yoshie's falls for every cute boy she sees the mild Sekiguchi excels at whatever she does but is ignored by those around her and the deadpan Naomi has a wonderful dry sense of humor. Combine all of this with a truly outstanding performance at the end of the film the girls later on went to perform in New York and Los Angeles make for a very nice film watching experience.".

However they never lost the passion for jazz. They did what they can to earn money to buy the instrument. They did it.The learning process was hard for them and funny for me to watch. With the help of their teacher they improved quickly their level. Their performance in the music festival was the climax of the movie. The wonderful jazz still lingered around my ears after finished watching the movie.Although its content was simple director Shinobu Yaguchi brought us an interesting and pleasant film. It reminded me that life could be happy. The key is your attitude for life. The girls' show was contagious and impressive. Of cause the lively jazz was the most unforgettable.An excellent Japanese movie. 810".

With the help of their teacher they improved quickly their level. Their performance in the music festival was the climax of the movie. The wonderful jazz still lingered around my ears after finished watching the movie.Although its content was simple director Shinobu Yaguchi brought us an interesting and pleasant film. It reminded me that life could be happy. The key is your attitude for life. The girls' show was contagious and impressive. Of cause the lively jazz was the most unforgettable.An excellent Japanese movie. 810";

As a result of a food poisoning accident thirteen high school girls who know next to nothing about music are drafted to be trained to fill in for the school's brass orchestra. But when the regulars manage to recover sooner than expected the backup girls fake a sigh of relieve but soon find that they have fallen in love with music. While most soon get sidetracked four of them love the music so much that they form the Swing Girls. This comprises a sax player the main character next to the music that is and not surprisingly the prettiest one a bespectacled timid trombone player a girl who needs the sight of a rat to hit the high note on the trumpet the obvious clown of the lot and the slightly overweighed drummer. Added to them are two wildlooking electric guitar players who would want to be anywhere where music is played and a guy on the keyboard. It takes the group a while to find their rhythm with jazz until the melody of Coming through the rye from a traffic light gives them the magical inspiration they need. The rest of the girls now come back to join them.There are anecdotes and other characters aplenty along the way some funny some banal but the movie never wavers from the theme which is the group's love of music. The ending is appropriately uplifting when the band finally gets a chance to do its thing in a national high school competition. Winning is not even important only finding of an appreciative audience. All the characters in the movie are well likable and there is everpopular Naoto Takenaka. As the end credit rolls we see the names of the cast the way they would appear in a programme of an orchestral concert grouped under the sections of instruments they play. The girls and one guy actually performed themselves and the success of the intensive training they received before the shooting of the movie is quite evident. Altogether a sweet little film that will be loved by all who love music.".

One of Japan more popular actors Naoto Takenaka does another fine job playing the part of the powerless teacher.One of the best things about Swing Girls is that the cast really play their own instruments. Most had no experience playing so they practiced very hard for three months. These authentic performances help convey the pleasure of simply played music. It seems the instruments used in the film sold at very high prices after this movie was released.On the negative side there are some scenes that seem impossible. For example some students suddenly are able to play their instrument very well without any practice. In the scene in which the students are chased by a wild boar no one is ever caught or injured. If these scenes were made more realistic I think this movie could be any even more wonderful work.".

	schema:reviewBody "A group of flunkee schoolgirls take up jazz in this hilarious movie by Shinobu Yaguchi. If you're unfamiliar with Yaguchi he's a very reliable director and I would place him on a pedestal as one of the best  if not the best  contemporary directors of comedy films. One reason I feel this way is that he usually chooses a different topic for each film and explores the topic to point of being informative for the viewer. For example his film Wood Job 2014 focused on forestry his film RoboG 2012 focused on robotics and his film Happy Flight 2008 focused on air traffic control. So the viewer usually leaves his film with a slightly greater knowledge of the topic at hand. Swing Girls focuses on how teenagers learn to play instruments  a topic that is certainly more familiar to the typical moviegoer than something like forestry but the informational value of the film is still there.The second reason I love Yaguchi as a director is that his humor is more of the everyday variety which is very funny and very charming. Unlike some other directors of comedy Yaguchi's films never even come close to being annoying or grating on the nerves  which is a huge positive in my opinion. There are no grossout jokes or juvenile dialogue to sit thru. I mean there's nothing worse than being irritated by a comedy and you have nothing to worry about here.Lots of hijinks occur in Swing Girls which include disastrous lunch trips moneymaking schemes to buy new instruments and musical debacles. The setup of how these girls become involved with music is very entertaining. The laughs just keep coming while incorporated within a distinctive cinematic approach that avoids overthetop silliness in favor of quaint welltimed events. One of the more memorable comedic set pieces occurs midway thru in a forest and is very creative in its style of camerawork. The pacing is fast the characters are lovable and the finale has some very catchy tunes. Yes you have some legitimately good music to look forward to here. The opening half focuses on a few songs that the protagonists consistently fail to learn properly but once they progress in their skill set we are treated to some great stuff during the finale.The lead actress here is Juri Ueno who is very popular in Japan because of her screen presence and charisma. Most of her films have not made the jump to American shores but Swing Girls is an excellent introduction to this actress. One of the teachers is played by Naoto Takenaka who is one of those Japanese actors who is seemingly in every film not unlike Ren Osugi  IMDb credits Takenaka for 225 acting roles. He's great in this one and it could be my favorite performance I've seen from him.Swing Girls is great fun and comes highly recommended.".

The opening half focuses on a few songs that the protagonists consistently fail to learn properly but once they progress in their skill set we are treated to some great stuff during the finale.The lead actress here is Juri Ueno who is very popular in Japan because of her screen presence and charisma. Most of her films have not made the jump to American shores but Swing Girls is an excellent introduction to this actress. One of the teachers is played by Naoto Takenaka who is one of those Japanese actors who is seemingly in every film not unlike Ren Osugi  IMDb credits Takenaka for 225 acting roles. He's great in this one and it could be my favorite performance I've seen from him.Swing Girls is great fun and comes highly recommended.";

The girls begin practicing music on the pretext of skipping summer makeup lessons. At first they are not enthusiastic but as they learn little by little to make sounds they become gradually fascinated by jazz. They make up their minds to form a big band by themselves but they have no instruments money or places to practice. They then get parttime jobs to finance their band but nearly all result in failure and they face a crisis of a breakup of band. But with their passion for jazz and their cheerfulness they manage to stay to together and to take part in a music festival at which they give a rousing performance in the film last scene. Besides mastering their instruments the girls also grow mentally and learn to carry out a project to its end.The director of this movie is Shinobu Yaguchi director of the hit film WATER BOYS. He seems to like to make this kind of story. The basic theme of both movies is the same poorly motivated students learn to succeed. As WATER BOYS was the first of its kind the image of WATER BOYS is apt to go ahead of SWING GIRLS. Even if characters turn from boys to girls and the subject turns from sport to music SWING GIRLS may be regarded as only imitation of WATER BOYS. However the praiseworthy thing in Yaguchi movies is that actors and actresses themselves actually perform on screen. In SWING GIRLS the actresses underwent very hard training for to master their instruments in order to create a powerful and appealing performance.While I enjoyed this movie very much there are some unsatisfactory points. The development of story is too forced and too convenient. The process of mastering instruments is especially too sudden. It is hardly possible to acquire such great skills with such halfhearted and short practice. Mastering instruments is never easy and is accompanied by hardships and frustrations. I wanted to see this process and how joyful they are when they learn to play their instruments. It is disappointing that their efforts are not described.But in the face of the actresses' incredible cheerfulness and energy arguments about the quality of the story are meaningless. There are many attractions in this movie. Due to their provincial accents and natural ease at portraying students the actresses make the characters feel familiar and it is easy for us to empathize with them. The rural scenery such as the railroad running through rice paddies and wide spaces completely covered with snow creates a rich atmosphere. This movie is a very good entertainment and can serve to encourage us. I like to watch this movie again when I want to be cheered up.".

The production values are higher than ever. The Indian productions seem to have been taken up a notch or two from the films shot in the 90s. Sun drenched scenery both plush and arid they're a far cry from the relatively frigid realms of the winter locations in Spain and Portugal. For whatever reason the direction feels a little different as well but ironically enough seems to hearken back to the feeling that the earlier Sharpe films gave the audience. There's a sense of adventure intrigue and the exotic as well as the romantic.Sharpe is presented with some internal challenges as well as a plethora of external ones. Teresa though long gone since the fourth film is still very much alive in Sharpe's memory. To find out why you have to see the film.If I had one critique it's that Sen Bean being a smoker has aged prematurely. Oh sure he's old but his smoking habit doesn't help sell him as the dashing hero type. He looks ragged which ironically enough actually helps accentuate the character. Still it would behoove him to toss the cigarettes and add some years to his life.Still it's a solid installment.

I suspect that the influence of Sharpe author Bernard Cornwell was confined to providing the characters because the plot borrowed countless clichs from Westerns of the 1950s. There were several insults to one's intelligence.The most notable was Sharpe's supposedly inspirational speech to the soldiers and villagers as they awaited the final onslaught by the baddies. The references to Napoleon and Waterloo would have meant something to the few remaining British soldiers but nothing at all to the Indian troops and villagers  even supposing they the latter especially understood English. Then there was Harper curiously being cured of kidney stones and Simmerson's remarkable recovery from delirium and his sudden warmth for Sharpe and where did he get his smart general's uniform from after the pursued soldiers and civilians had been carrying next to nothing after crossing the river. The portrait of Sharpe's daughter in the locket looked more like a colour photograph than a painting.Sean Bean was beginning to show his age seemed to go through the motions with his acting and was not at all an inspiring leader.".

	schema:reviewBody "While not quite as romantic as the previous feature film SHARPE'S CHALLENGE this actionpacked adventure is a wonderful farewell to the bad boy English rifleman and his colorful friends and enemies. Personally I would have ended the series at the end of SHARPE'S CHALLENGE when Sharpe has the opportunity to marry a loyal courageous and truly stunning general's daughter and become a general himself in the famed East India Company. But instead Sharpe is just trying to get home and he is roped into escorting a spoiled French beauty through the Indian countryside and villains are after her and one thing just leads to another till pretty soon Sharpe is like Moses leading dozens of castaways in search of safety and a new beginning. Where CHALLENGE had the feeling of an Arabian Nights adventure with most of the action among Indian palaces and Royalty PERIL is more rugged and down to earth with a virtual wagon train journeying through hostile territory like an old fashioned American Western. There are battles every ten minutes and sword fights every five minutes. Sharpe's followers include a lot of Western types familiar from movies like STAGECOACH and MAJOR DUNDEE. The useless missionary the plucky pregnant woman the loyal Indian companion the drunken or lazy troopers all have their parts to play. What lifts the story above Western territory however is the way in which Sharpe himself is forced to look for closure to his personal dramas. Some of his most deadly enemies reappear or their sons do and there are some unexpected discoveries on all sides. The most poignant scenes in the story all revolve around Sharpe coming to terms with past regrets and resolving conflicts. All of it was wonderful even if Sharpe's French blonde love interest in PERIL isn't quite as demure or winning as English blonde love interest in CHALLENGE. But both movies are Sharpe classics both great farewells to a true hero!".

It makes it feel like I'm following them throughout events in their whole lives not just a chapter of it.

The whole long lost brother bit is silly as hell and the only surprises here with it are that they used it at alland that it takes Sharpe so long to figure it out. Also weak beyond belief are Mrs. Sharpe and her paramour Lord Rossindale who both came right out of Central Casting and aren't acted well enough to bring anything but the cardboard cutouts. Finally while Sharpe episodes aren't known for subtlety Justice goes way overboard with the blackandwhite goodandbad. There's no middle ground here Either a character is Good or heshe is Evil.Still and all there's good here too. Sean Bean created Richard Sharpe and he's got the character down pat. Everything is right about his performance. Minus the constant battles of the earlier episodes his character is developed and exposed in a way we've never seen before. Also excellent is the eternal sidekick Sgt. Harper. There's more camaraderie between the two than ever before and it's quite nice. Even Daniel the singer gets good screen time and decent attention paid to him for the first time in the series his momentary disloyalty and later apology show us how worthwhile his character might've been over three seasons if he'd ever gotten the chance.It allepisode and seriesends with Sharpe off to Normandy and Lucille Harper off to Ireland where's Ramona? and Daniel staying with the locals in Yorkshire because he's got no place else to go.

I groan every time it's revealed that Truman is Sharpe's half brother. I mean come on... The way his mother was sleeping around he probably has ten siblings running around the countryside. Not to mention it's the oldest trick in the melodrama book. And then to make the groanfactor that much higher just when he finds out that Truman is his brother Truman goes and gets himself shot. You can just hear me rolling my eyes I'm sure.Ironically my second to least favorite is Sharpe's Regiment the only other episode set in England instead of France or Spain. Hmm... Could it be a trend?

His pant wetting scene at the Duchess of Richmond's ball is brilliant and his obvious discomfort with his wife's murderous plans is clear.

It's also nice to see the return of Hagman and Harris.  I was gutted to see them go I really thought that they might make it through.  Great poignant death scene for them though!".

I'm tremendously sorry to see it end and would love to see more.The producers stretched their TV budget to the limit in order to mount convincing battle scenes for the finale with considerable success although this series will never rival a Hollywood studio production. We are given enough information about Waterloo to appreciate the dramatic events and feel very much in the middle of the fighting. Sharpe is in fine form as are Harper Harris Hagman Wellington Lucille Jane and Lord Rossendale who are all present along with a slew of guest stars and faces from earlier in the series. Rossendale in particular gets a share of the spotlight and his character is developed in unexpected ways. The central plot device is that Sharpe has returned to the army and been assigned to the staff of Prince William of the Netherlands but becomes disenchanted with the prince's incompetence and roams the battlefield saving the day hither and yon. It works.I won't comment on the central issue of what becomes of Sharpe at the end except to say that there is a very moving and intelligent resolution of his military career.The only negatives are First with so much action so many characters and so many stories being concluded the whole thing sometimes seems a bit dizzy. Second the British accents are often very tough for American ears to decipher and important dialogue and plot points can be missed. This is a problem with the Sharpe series as a whole but here with so much shouting and guns blazing in the background the problem is magnified. There is one shot of Jane Sharpe in a negligee that is nothing less than aweinspiring.Highly recommended as is the whole series. The Sharpe series will remind you at various times of War and Peace For Whom the Bell Tolls the Horatio Hornblower stories Vanity Fair The Dirty Dozen The Red Badge of Courage and All Quiet on the Western Front.P.S.  I can't help being puzzled at the overthetop reactions to my comment about the British accents. I have no complaint about the accents any more than I'd have a complaint about a character speaking French in a Truffaut film so there's no need for outrage. I was simply warning U.S. viewers about the issue so they won't be surprised when they have to rewind to catch missed words.

	schema:reviewBody "It was always going to end like this. After four years and thirteen movies battling all over France and Spain it was inevitable that Richard Sharpe and the chosen men would find themselves fighting at Waterloo one of the most famous battles in military history. Given that the previous two episodes had been a bit lacklustre the pressure to give Sharpe a good send off must have been tremendous but they needn't have worried as Sharpe's Waterloo is a glorious culmination to the initial run.Considering what an epic clash Waterloo was all that needed to be done for this particular film was take the familiar characters and drop them into the thick of it and by and large that's what they do but that isn't to say there's no storyline here. Promoted to Colonel Sharpe comes face to face with his treacherous wife Jane and her lover the pathetic Lord Rossendale once more. Tempers flaring Sharpe demands his money back and soon Jane is plotting to have Rossendale kill him in the confusion of the coming battle. At the same time Sharpe must deal with his new commanding officer the inept Prince of Orange who seems determined to pay no attention to advice whatsoever. And the armies of Napoleon are marching ever closer.Okay it might not be the most indepth narrative but nevertheless it delivers on everything you'd expect from a Sharpe movie.

It really feels like the world is ending.In short then a triumphant end to a great set of movies. It might not exactly have a storyline worthy of Shakespeare but it succeeds partly because of this. After all it's a story about Waterloo and the men who fought there so all that was ever necessary was a massive fight and reliable old characters. It's not the best entry Sharpe's Company and Sharpe's Battle are still superior but the reputation remains intact...provided nobody points out the glaring pot hole of Harry Price magically coming back to life after getting his head blown off earlier in the series.".

	onyx:emotionText "It was always going to end like this. After four years and thirteen movies battling all over France and Spain it was inevitable that Richard Sharpe and the chosen men would find themselves fighting at Waterloo one of the most famous battles in military history. Given that the previous two episodes had been a bit lacklustre the pressure to give Sharpe a good send off must have been tremendous but they needn't have worried as Sharpe's Waterloo is a glorious culmination to the initial run.Considering what an epic clash Waterloo was all that needed to be done for this particular film was take the familiar characters and drop them into the thick of it and by and large that's what they do but that isn't to say there's no storyline here. Promoted to Colonel Sharpe comes face to face with his treacherous wife Jane and her lover the pathetic Lord Rossendale once more. Tempers flaring Sharpe demands his money back and soon Jane is plotting to have Rossendale kill him in the confusion of the coming battle. At the same time Sharpe must deal with his new commanding officer the inept Prince of Orange who seems determined to pay no attention to advice whatsoever. And the armies of Napoleon are marching ever closer.Okay it might not be the most indepth narrative but nevertheless it delivers on everything you'd expect from a Sharpe movie. The officer class who disapprove of Sharpe are toffee nosed imbeciles all Abigail Cruttenden's heaving breasts appear to have become even larger and nearly half the episode is dedicated to the titanic battle itself.

I have seen all of the BBC Sharpe series moviesSharpe's Waterloo is my favorite of the films. However I tune in to PBS everytime they air the Sharpe movies. So far all the movies have been based on the Sharpe Chronicles  adventure novels written by Bernard Cornwellthe same author who wrote Rebel.

I sincerely believe that each one of these Films has been good enough to have shown at the movie theatersif the producers had wanted to. Unlike other MadeForTV filmsThe Hornblower films do not have that MadeForTV feeling to themlike most television movies have. However each of the Sharpe Movies picks up exactly where the last one left off. The only negative thing I can say about this movie series is the use of an electric guitar as the background music I have to take points off for that because the sometimes screeching guitar noises can become annoying at times.A common misconception that people who havent seen these movies have is that all of these films go to gether as a miniseries that is not true. The Sharpe movies are not a miniseriesall of these films are individual movies about the same charactor However they are sequels to each other each picking up where the last film left off. with all the same actors playing the same roles in each filmEXAMPLEthink of the James Bond filmsthat same principle applies to the Sharpe moviesbut unlike Bond the Sharpe films are sequelsIf you have seen the Sharpe movies and you liked them and you wish to see more similar themed programing I will suggest AE's Horatio Hornblower movies6 movies in all same basic priciple as the Sharpe movie except Hornblower is in the Brittish Navy to whereas Sharpe is a ground soldierI give the entire Sharpe movie series 4 out of 5 stars.

John Tams as Hagman is my favorite rifleman besides Sharpe and Harper episode and book.Some minor things though. Waterloo would have made a ten out of ten had it been more like the book and more specific on some of the characters' fates.The episode is awesome but in some scenes they would have made it look better had they involved more men as in more soldiers and battalions. But that is only a small thing. Another thing is that they wrapped up a few things without too much detail. For example spoiler when the Prince is shot they made it look as if he had died. Not true though. In the book and in reality he was only wounded. Also they could have put in the details from the book of Sharpe being approached saying that Rossendale had died and Jane was waiting for the news about the battle. Sharpe laughs sourly saying he wont be the one to tell because he doesn't give a dime about her. That would have confirmed the fate of Jane better and the Prince's.All that aside this is an incredible episode and I recommend it to all who are wondering whether Sharpe is worth it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spectacular ending of the Sharpe series. Very fast paced and sometimes chaotic. You really get the feeling a war is going on. 70 of this episode is full of action. Sharpe now Lt. Colonel is more confident than ever. If I had been a soldier in his regiment I would definitely follow him. It is also nice to see that the other officers listen to him when they are talking about strategy. It seems that he finally has gotten the respect he deserves. Paul Bettany as the prince William does justice to the name Silly Billy. Very strange to see that they let him command his army even when it is obvious his own subordinates laugh at him because he is completely incompetent. Lord Wellington was forced to make use of foreign allies since most of the British were sent out to the colonies. I bet the indigenous people would not have mind them returning to Europe. That is the reason why they didn't object to Silly Billy being put in command of his Dutch army. I don't know if this historically is correct. But like most things in the Sharpe series it is about adventure and action. The historical accuracy is a bonus. Prince William is the direct cause of the death of Hagman and Harris when he orders them to open the gate so he can escape. Their death really got to me because I liked them very much. That is what happens when you follow a series like this. You get to know them well and then when something happens it affects you. I loved the reaction from Sharpe when he hears about their death and the cause. I also liked how they left the ending open. Usually I am against these kinds of ending but in this case it was fitting. It made we wonder what had become of Sharpe and is an invite to future adventures. There were two episodes  films that came after. Not as good as the original ones but still decent. I hope that rather sooner than later they will make more. This undoubtedly is one of the best series that has graced the small screen. And if you have not seen it by now you should.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one Sharpe that I failed to see on TV when it first came out. And when I finally did see it I had mixed feelings about it. The film is a kind of reunion and last hurrah for Sharpe and what remains of his riflemen. The pros are of course the reunion of characters that we've come to know through the series of films one of Sharpe's major subplots sees a resolution and for good or ill we see the fates of our riflemen.The film itself is rather kludged together. It feels like a patchwork and the filmed story not the actual story but the shots themselves totter on be incoherent at times as well as some of the actions of the characters. My guess is that the production team were trying to wind up the film series as best they could but in the end all they wind up doing is confusing the viewer with some incoherent actions on the part of the main characters.That and the battle of Waterloo is never fully realized. Considering that this is a made for TV movie and one that has the limitations of a UK budget no less it's no wonder things are a bit scaled down. We're told references to engagements by the characters here and there as they point to one clump of soldiers and then to another. That's not really a big deal. What is a big deal is that we never see the soldiers maneuvering like they're supposed to be. Again this isn't Sergey Bondarchuk Waterloo with tens of thousands of cheap Soviet soldiers to act as extras but ITV's version of the same battle on a shoestring budget. That's not really a big deal. But what is a big deal is that the Sharpe production team did need at least a couple hundred more people in costume to really fake the size of the armies. But we can kind of get over that.What I can't get over is that I'm a huge fan of the film series have read a few of the books and am at a loss as to what the story in this film is all about. Sharpe actually meanders here and there for no rhyme or reason and we the audience are left scratching our heads. Certainly not a fault of the excellent thesping going on here because all the actors hold their own and gives us excellent performances. If fault were to lie somewhere then it's with both the screenplay artist and director probably more the latter than the former.The final scene and final shot are perhaps how the series should have ended which it didn't and is a nice segue into rewatching the films all over again but the meat of the film could stand to use some tweaking. An interesting project would be to go back and insert scenes with soldiers or to digitally add more soldiers here and there to really add size and scope to this production. Even so that's not going to counter for a weak story.It's not a film I'd recommend even for Sharpe fans but like the infamous third season of 1960's Star Trek it is what it is and isn't all that bad I suppose.Give it a shot and judge for yourself.".

Wonder if it was about the time their marriage was breaking up.  He and the author are mates it appears.  The fact that he physically favors my brotherinlaw who lost a leg in Korea has nothing to do with my admiration for the series. But I must say that seeing Essex Boys made me wonder if that title came from him leading the South Essex contingent in the movie.  I really don't like seeing him as a villain but you can tell the English don't mind having their heroes be unfaithful to their girlfriend.  That made me rather squirm as he beds his old girlfriend while married....and elsewhere does the same while betrothed.  But we do have a different style here serial polygamy but no screwing around while you're married....plus a healthy heaping of hypocrisy.Great series.  Somebody make them make some more.".

But I would dearly love to get a French movie depicting the same war...since History is a tale told by the winner.Shall I say anything about Bean's wife now turning into the villain.  Wonder if it was about the time their marriage was breaking up.  He and the author are mates it appears.  The fact that he physically favors my brotherinlaw who lost a leg in Korea has nothing to do with my admiration for the series. But I must say that seeing Essex Boys made me wonder if that title came from him leading the South Essex contingent in the movie.  I really don't like seeing him as a villain but you can tell the English don't mind having their heroes be unfaithful to their girlfriend.  That made me rather squirm as he beds his old girlfriend while married....and elsewhere does the same while betrothed.  But we do have a different style here serial polygamy but no screwing around while you're married....plus a healthy heaping of hypocrisy.Great series.  Somebody make them make some more.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rather than focusing upon one of the most significant battles in history Cornwell's purpose seems to be to degrade the memory of the men who fought at Waterloo.Much of this episode is dedicated to disparaging the man who would later become king William II of Holland. The opening scene shows him with a prostitute and an ugly boil on his rear. Later William's Dutch cavalry at Quatre Bras are portrayed as cowardly and refusing to charge when ordered to do so. Cornwell gives William the nickname Silly Billy and portrays him as being a arrogant fool but in reality William's courage and good nature made him very popular with the British who nicknamed him Slender Billy.The age 23 Prince William is shown as being responsible for losing the La Haye Sainte farm and the death of two of Sharpe's men. The fact is William wasn't even in the farm when it was taken about 6 PM. The farm was mostly burned by Napoleon's artillery and the area taken after an extremely fierce struggle. Sharpe is shown shooting William to get him off the battlefield with MacDuff looking on from a wooden roof window at La Haye Sainte but the French had just taken La Haye Sainte and in reality all the wooden buildings at the farm were burned by the time the French occupied the area. William was actually wounded about a half hour later in a courageous but futile attempt to take back La Haye Sainte.Cornwell and Clegg have Wellington say humbug five times in about 3 minutes. Although it is true Welington did say something like that but not to Sharpe it seems Cornwell wanted to overemphasize that Wellington had been surprised by the speed of Napoleon's advance by having him repeat it no less than FIVE times and sound foolish. Later at the critical moment when the Imperial Guard was approaching the Allied lines Sharpe makes the decision for the men who had been laying low on the ground to fire. The person who really gave the order at that moment was the allied commander Wellington. They also portray as a pathetic coward Wellington's relative who recorded the times of the events of the battle. In reality he was at the forefront of the battle facing the field and was eventually killed by cannon fire. Typical of Cornwell he does not portray Lord Uxbridge as courageous despite the fact that at a critical time in the battle at 230 PM he led a charge that stopped a French advance. Uxbridge was extremely brave he had eight or nine horses shot from under him during the Battle of Waterloo and eventually lost a leg. But Cornwell for some reason usually portrays real historical leaders in a negative way. And Cornwell and Clegg's portrayal of the very brave Frenchmen that day is also demeaning. He has Sharpe repeatedly refer to them as frogs and portrays them as slow marching rigid easy targets even the Imperial Guard considered the finest troops in Europe at the time. Several times the episode shows French troops marching into fire without even trying to shoot back. On a positive note the costumes locations and sets were very good although what they show as La Haye Sainte looks more like the Hougoumont Chteau on Napoleon's left side with the larger stone wall and the more extensive woods nearby. The initial battle at La Haye Sainte in the episode looks more like the historical description of the fighting at Hougoumont. A book that covers the details of the Battle of Waterloo is 24 Hours at Waterloo by Robert Kershaw.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers ahoy...This last major Sharpe episode in the original block of series ties things up nicely and given the limited TV budget does a neat job of portraying Waterloo. Best of all for those of us who've grown to hate Jane Sharpe it provides a satisfying end with Sharpe not responsible for her downfall but she having a disaster none the less. However...The book tries not to fall into the trap of having Sharpe basically win the battle but as usual the TV series has him practically doing so despite the fact plain and simple that in a fit of anger at the incompetent command of the Dutch prince William he leaves the field and abandons his men at a crucial stronghold and a crucial point. I can't imagine Sharpe going so far nor Wellington sparing him after the battle. The French for once are allowed to fight fairly well not being gunned down by the dozen by Sharpe's chosen but would it have been so hard to admit that the battle was nearly lost at the farmhouse Sharpe and his men had been holding? Perhaps this relates to Sharpe's abandoning the place...It would look bad if the hero were shown to have nearly caused the loss of Waterloo in a hissy fit. While kudos to the series producers and director for being willing to show Sharpe shooting a superior officer he believes is killing his men it would have been equally courageous for Sharpe to realize his lack of restraint nearly cost the battle. Sad to see two of Sharpe's last faithful chosen men killed after surviving so much. Nice to finally in this episode see Harper remembering that he has a wife after he'd seemed to have forgotten her in the last two and although he joins in the battle he pulls out soon as he's convinced the victory is won and he's had his peek at Boney.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gekijouban Kamen Rider Decade  All Rider vs Dai Shocker Kamen Rider Decade  All Rider vs. Dai Shocker is an overthetop convoluted and messy film but despite a goofy story and some silly acting it's an immensely enjoyable film best appreciated by diehard Kamen Rider fans.For close to 40 years Ishinomori's grasshopperinspired motorcycle riding Japanese Tokusatsu superhero has entertained Japanese kids in one form or another since 1971. Kamen RiderMasked Rider was one of Toei studio's first humansized heroes to come out and was an instant hit upon its debut. Combining masked wrestling inspired elements elaborate monster costumes James Bond style thrills and a fairly serious dramatic tone it seemed less a kid's show than a manga come to life.This winning formula would be retained and repeated with each subsequent and inevitable sequel the most current of which is 2010's Kamen Rider W Double. Kamen Rider Decade the 19th Kamen Rider Series was quite a departure from its predecessors. While most of the modern riders Heisei Riders or those series that debuted from the late 90s and early 2000s typically shied away from references to other series particularly those series from the 70s and 80s or Showa series Decade took the bold approach of not only bringing all of the past 10 Kamen Riders together in one universe but also brought the classic Riders into the fold as well. Taking its cue from alternate timeline stories like Star Trek's Mirror Mirror episode DC Comic's Crisis on Infinite Earths limited comic book series TV series like Dr. Who Sliders and most recently the Fringe Decade brought all the Heisei and some of the Showa Kamen Riders into one timespanningreality merging epic. The series made quite an impression and the tiein movie was just a matter of time. All Rider vs Dai Shocker is a grand spectacle and finally gave fans of the Kamen Rider franchise a chance to see all 25 Riders in one all encompassing movie. It also marked the return of one of the alltime best Kamen Rider villain organizations the Naziinspired Shocker secret society. In fact the film assembled a veritable who's who of past Kamen Rider villains to battle the Riders similar to Tsuburaya's Ultraman Mebius  Ultra Brothers film of two years ago. With a brisk running time of just over one hour the film seems more like an extended TV special than an actual movie similar to 1984's Jugou Tanjou! Kamen Rider Zenin Shuugou! 10th Rider Debut  Come Together All Riders or some of the later Kamen Rider DVD released specials. The intention was obviously to pay tribute to some of the 70s Kamen Rider movie specials which ran under the Toei Manga Matsuri AnimeCartoon Cavalcade which featured crowdpleasing teamups of the various Kamen Riders or gekijou banmovie versions of popular AnimeTokusatsu TV shows but what was supposed to be a loving tribute to 40 years of Kamen Rider seems more like a movie version of one of those Japanese Amusement Park stage shows albeit with better costumes and better SFX effects.Director Osamu Kaneda and screenwriter Yonemura Shoji definitely know the Kamen Rider World having experience working on some of the Heisei shows like Agito and Decade and they know how to pile on the fan service. While the story's first half involves mostly KR Decade Ikemen pretty boy Inoue Masahiro and plucky ally KR Agito Murai Ryouta battling an assortment of fan favorite Kamen Riders including V3 Amazon X Black RX and Super 1 among others it isn't until the second half when all hell breaks loose and the true villains the Shocker Army lead by Jigoku TaishiAmbassador Hell Osugi Ren Jark Shogun Kato Seizou and Shinegami HakaseiDr. DeathGod played with hammy delight by Ishibashi Renji reveal themselves and do battle with 30 Riders from the past and present. Even the aforementioned 2010 Rider Double makes a quick cameo.Amazingly each Kamen Rider gets his own guts pose moment as they battle through seemingly endless waves of Shocker Hei soldiers and Kaijin beasts but with this many Riders on the screen one can't expect any type of character development or meaningful dialog between each other. In fact they merely are there to show up and be seen. One of the few Riders to get any screen time outside of Decade and Agito is Yuki Joji AKA Rider Man played by enigmatic Androgenous Jpop singer turned actor Gackt. It's merely gimmick to include Gackt but he does have a screen charisma that is appealing and his look is certainly unique if eerie. Regrettably his scenes are very brief and we don't actually see him in action.Osamu's hyperactive directing style and visual flair definitely serves the film well but sometimes it feels like the viewer is assaulted by all the visual mayhem that ensues. There's just so much going on that it all seems almost overwhelming. While this may work with films like recent blockbuster Avatar here it just seems distracting. The film in some ways reminds me of XMen United in that it is just one big long and loud jumbled mess.Some of the visual effects seem a bit uneven. The scene where the Shocker Hei launch themselves like human rockets into Tokyo buildings is just plain silly but on the other hand when all the Kamen Riders jump and do a massive group Rider Kick against Dai Shocker ally Shadow Moon is pretty neat. In the end All Rider... is pure eyecandy. It is a movie whose sole gimmick is the sight of every Rider from the past 40 years on the big screen battling hordes of villains for just the sake of fan demand. While vastly better than the Kamen Rider The First and Kamen Rider The Next reboot films that came out a couple years ago All Rider will appeal mostly to nostalgic older fans and young kids.".

	schema:reviewBody "Polish screenwriter and director Urszula Antoniak's second feature film which she also wrote is a DutchDanish coproduction based on a short story called Woods by Janeck Luter Lenartowicz and was produced by producers Arnold Heslenfeld Frans van Gestel and Floor Onrust. It tells the story about a middleaged nurse named Marian who lives in an apartmentblock. Marian is wholeheartedly devoted to her dying patients works out spends some time with her friends but is longing for intimacy and is infatuated with a neighbor she begins to follow. Though Marian's attraction towards this man she knows nothing about is increasing she doesn't contact him but her life changes when they both witness a crime.With it's distinct urban milieu depictions and significantly foreboding atmosphere this existentialistic and voyeuristic psychological drama draws an unsentimental intimate and heartbreaking portrayal of a humane bilateral and deeply afflicted woman who has given some much of her love to her patients that she is almost dying for a little bit of affection for herself. While notable for its brilliant lowkeyed visuals and the subtle and precise directing by Urszula Antoniak this tense cold and brave artistic expression depicts a clinical and condensed study of character about solitude guilt death and love which goes straight into the conflicted heart and soul of the enigmatic protagonist.This austere unsettling graphic somewhat abstract and characterdriven mystery about a lonely woman's internal scream for solace is impelled and reinforced by the astounding and emphatic acting performance somewhat reminiscent of Isabelle Huppert's acting performance in Michael Haneke's The Piano Teacher 2001 by Belgian actress Bien de Moor in a diverse role and the understated supporting acting performance by German actor Lars Eidinger. An expressionistic metaphoric and excruciating character portrayal of loneliness which gained the Golden Calf for Best Cinematography Jasper Wolf and Best Sound Design Jan Schermer at The Netherlands Film Festival in 2011.".

Excuse me for making a wild connection but this felt more like a giallo than a drama though there are no knives no black gloves or a far fetched denouement at the end.There s a series of murders though but we know 'whodunnit' and there is a certain progression there the first death happens in an operating room and isn't a murder but we do see the protagonist  a middle aged nurse strangely ? reminiscent of the redeemed Lucia de B.  taking a 'souvenir' from the dead patient. Then we see her connecting on her own with a patient whom she later 'helps' die and it looks like the patient is okay with that. Yet even later she wants to 'help' a patient again but this one protests  to no avail though he does wound her and this causes quite a panic with her. We also learn that she has stolen many things from patients before but still it doesn't prove she killed them all I would still say things are starting to really get out of hand at the beginning of the film. In between she tries to live her life but it consists of sad incidents wherein she never really connects with anyone  she witnesses a rape from afar but does nothing she follows a man a neighbor into a video store but later he ends up stalking her and so it goes on.The finale takes things up a notch and des in a way have that giallolike denouement the story had been playing with the notion of coincidence up until then but the nurse and her neighbor meeting as friends of friends at a party is nothing short of overthetop fateful. I won't reveal anything about the finale except that even though I truly dislike the trend of putting in  out genitals for shock value 'Code Blue' gets away with it another strange yet unrelated coincidence...In short this is a suspenseful thriller with plenty elements of drama much focussing on the mental and physical vortex of a person losing control of her life who doesn't seem to have started out being a bad person. Not as ugly and good as Marina De Van's 'Dans Ma Peau' but close and well worth the reference. And of course kudos to Bien de Moor for her powerful performance and Urszula Antoniak for making such a bold movie.A small 9 out 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Urzula Antoniak is someone who understands loneliness. She understands her emotions very well and knows how to express them in a way you can understand even when a film uses mainly visually storytelling and minimal dialogue. I can say that after watching Nothing Personal and now Code Blue. It's a movie about a lonely nurse Marian who attaches herself to her patients because she has no one else to share with. And who better than the elderly who can be seen to be in state more vulnerable than her. They need her help and when she gives them that help she feels useful. At one point she holds hands with an old man then euthanizes him. At another time when she tries to do the same her the patient is frightened. It can't always work out the way she wishes. When out for a run she helps an old woman with her groceriesthey go inside her home to talk and the woman somehow can tell by the look on Marian's face that she's a sad lonely woman. This scene felt a bit forced because I can't imagine a stranger casually inviting her in and making that immediate observation about her. And is Marian who has trouble with people really going to walk in and start conversing with the old woman? Nonetheless pretty much everyone in her life knows her situation. She's asked if she's married? If she has anyone? Which must be awkward for her to answer especially at her age. She however is not the most easy person to sympathize with. From haggling over eighty cents at the market to witnessing a rape and doing nothing about it her loneliness and isolation has probably made her less compassionate. And very lonely she must feel for in one moment she takes the semen from a used condom she found on the ground and rubs it on her vagina. A scene that many may find disgusting but I found poignant. The ending to this film is not one I enjoyed. It was rather disturbing. I mean I understand how pitiful this woman is and I didn't need to see her in such a pathetic state. Despite my problems with it this is a touching film about loneliness that I highly recommend.".

The plot should be evident by now the movie is basically about a 'master' specialized in dealing everything super natural and his two 'apprentices' tying to get rid of a powerful vampire .. There is also a nice subplot as a bonus featuring a female ghost seducing its victims .. The movie is satisfying from the first moment till the last never dragging too much in a certain scene letting you watch the whole experience in awe .. The master is powerful and knowledgeable the apprentices seem dumb nevertheless efficient in their work with minor 'clumsinesslaziness' factor causing most of the accidents filling the whole movie .. The support characters do their job well adding to the richness  they are mostly stereotypes but good ones at that .. The jokes were amusing and imaginative although most of them are slapstick .. I can't comment on the fight scenes in particular never been a fan but never been a hater but I found them mostly intense with clever choreography .. The visual effects were not great but never failed to satisfy the viewer .. As a summary I found this movie in the same league with A Chinese Ghost Story series and to be honest enjoyed it more than that trilogy ..

A rather slow first half hour introduces us to the characters and sets up the basic plot elements the rest of the film sees our hapless good guys first falling foul of the otherworldly creatures and then battling to set things right.Less of a martial arts movie than a comedy fans of fast and furious fight action will probably be disappointed however those who love crazy Chinese humour an acquired taste and one which I sometimes struggle with will find plenty to enjoy as the gags come thick and fast Ricky Hui is particularly funny as Man Choi the assistant who gets bitten by the vampire and almost becomes one himself.But by far my favourite part of the film is the stunningly captured scene which introduces viewers to the female ghost in a mist enshrouded nighttime forest the supernatural seductress is carried by four spooky assistants before gliding gently through the air to come to rest in a tree. Lovely cinematography accompanied by a haunting song make this a totally magical moment.My second favourite moment is the introduction of the gorgeous Moon Lee as TingTing the rich man's daughter. With her impossibly cute features Moon Lee is truly a delight to behold.Although I enjoyed Mr. Vampire I don't seem to be quite as fanatical about it as some. However I do agree that even if you're not a huge fan of Hong Kong cinema with so much craziness and energy packed into its 96 minutes this highly influential classic is well worth a watch.".

Indeed the only weakness in the construction of the film is that we really want to know more about the brokenhearted ghost of the subplot than the vampirecentered plot allows.

Mr. WaiBilly Lau inept head of police is to lead the investigation and arrests Master GauChingYing Lamjust because he has the longest fingernails in the village the wound on Uncle Yam's neck torn open through the use of such sharp weapons. Ingredients for stifling a vampire are sticky rice chicken blood black ink and yellow paper with a specific spell written as a means to keep the undead at bayto protect from the corpse's sting. Wai an imbecilic buffoon will pull the paperplaced on the head of Uncle Yam as to keep him from movingfrom his Uncle's forehead and release him from his slumber. This results in a slapsticky action scene where Wai and ChouSiuhou Chin must outwit vampire Uncle Yam seeking blood as Master Gau tries to help them from his prison cell. After this is a zany scene where Grandpa Yam comes after TingTing with Master Gau's servant Man ChoiRicky Hui blessed with a host of funny expressions which should tickle the funny bone shaking in his shoes serving as her cowardly protector which includes an ingenious use of a bamboo stick. Unlike typical vampire films if you hold your breath you can briefly bide your time as the undead ghoul stops in his tracksGranpa Vampire is blind it seems wondering where human victims are..but you can only hold your breath so long. Unlike Uncle Yam Grandpa Vampire isn't as easy to subdue even the usually effective use of ink string can not do the trick. Not even the village police with all their rifles can bring Grandpa Vampire down. Also interesting is how the vampires can poison their prey in this movie through the use of their nails as in the case of Man who is nearly killed when Grandpa Vampire stabs him in his arms while holding him in a death grip. Meanwhile Chou doesn't realize that a female walking corpse JadePauline Wong very very beautifulis the one who he falls in love withand vice versa but Master Chau notices a bite mark on his neck understanding that he has to come to his servant's rescue. MR. VAMPIRE is juvenile and cartoony plays best as a horror comedy for kids. The actors are animated and theatrical.

He is represented as an unstoppable force and superhuman in power. So do not expect a Westernstyle vampire. The Chinese vampire is quite different and much more interesting to watch they are actually inhuman. No sensitivenewagegodi'msotorturedGothic Tom Cruise types here. Rather he is a tortured soul intent on causing death with either his long sharp fingernails or overflowing mouthful of teeth. He doesn't fly he is not a bat and his limbs are inflexible and stiff. The literal translation of the title is Mr. Stiff Corpse! There are loads of highlights the scene involving the vampires lair and the rodents around him is genuinely gruesome and the supporting cast is great especially Ricky Hui Pauline Wong and Moon Lee. Siuhou Chin is a great assistant to the priest and is the more cocky and acrobatic character. His stunts are fluid and performed with the signature HK matteroffact style.

	schema:reviewBody "A riotous comedy horror that provides satisfaction on many levels Ricky Lau's MR VAMPIRE is one of the highlights of the subgenre that flourished in Hong Kong during the 1980s. While it doesn't quite have the level of finesse of Sammo Hung's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE SPOOKY KIND this proves to be a genre classic that offers virtually nonstop entertainment for the length of its running time.The narrative adopts the knockabout comedy format familiar to any fan of that era's cinema with various characters coming into contact with some creepy vampires most of whom are of the classic 'hopping vampire' mould that I always like seeing in Chinese cinema. Chief of these is a tough cookie played by a justabout recognisable Yuen Wah who proves a fitting villain for the film's erstwhile hero Lam ChingYing playing the vampirefighting 'One Eyebrow Priest'. Lam ChingYing is so successful in this film that he made a career out of the role and who can blame him? The rest of the picture is packed with damsels in distress snivelling villainous folk young upstanding heroes and a plentiful stream of mostly successful gags. The ghoulish humour works a treat particularly in a midpoint setpiece in a prison where the characters have to face up to a newlycreated vampire foe this sequence is exceptionally funny and expertly choreographed a natural highlight for the rest of the production surrounding it.The special effects are fun the action is ably staged the characters and situations are funny and the film offers a cultural look at Chinese superstitions in a playful spirited way. Many sequels followed unsurprisingly after all what's not to like about a film this inventive?".

The ghoulish humour works a treat particularly in a midpoint setpiece in a prison where the characters have to face up to a newlycreated vampire foe this sequence is exceptionally funny and expertly choreographed a natural highlight for the rest of the production surrounding it.The special effects are fun the action is ably staged the characters and situations are funny and the film offers a cultural look at Chinese superstitions in a playful spirited way. Many sequels followed unsurprisingly after all what's not to like about a film this inventive?";

	schema:reviewBody "A young apprentice at the local mortuary is responsible for overseeing the dead bodies of potential ghosts and vampires. But he gets a nasty surprise when some of the bodies become reanimated and start to attack him.There's no reason to worry however because the priest and his buddy have got it covered with their occult kung fu skills.Now they've been hired by a local millionaire who wants to rebury his father in order to change his luck because his business is failing.Turns out his father ripped off the fortune teller that was giving him advice for his burial. And the fortune teller sought revenge by knowingly giving him wrong directions essentially cursing his family line.The priest and his crew are to oversee the extraction and reburial of the coffin. But they can't rebury it in the same spot because that spot is tainted. So they take the coffin back to the mortuary.However at some point during the night the vampire awakens and escapes...killing his son turning him into a vampire as well.But the local officer arrests the priest for challenging his intelligence in front of his cousin whom he loves...saying he wants to avenge the death of his uncle.So the must priest get his two apprentices to do the dirty work for him.But obviously they fail...getting themselves poisoned by the vampire and bewitched by a ghost in the process of trying to help.So they must break the priest out and attempt to take on the vampire together.With hilarious occult kung fu vampire slaying to ensue.This film is so damn cool. Cult as fck. Action packed. Absolutely hilarious. Filled with badass kung fu styles that have an almost scifi element. And educational! Who knew you could prevent yourself from being detected by vampires by holding your breath? Or that you can use sticky rice to burn and weaken them? Not me anyways. But it has been duly noted and added to my repertoire of knowledge.This is definitely one of the best most action packed and entertaining vampire films I've ever seen. And it's hilarious. What more could you ask for?! Highly recommended.9.5 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Yeah a Vampire Movie but a Hong Kong Vampire Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I simply love this movie. As it turns out it is the first in a series of a Mr Vampire franchise and yes it is a movie made during the golden years of Hong Kong cinema. The film is about an undertaker and his two apprentices. It needs to be clear that the undertaker is a sorcerer because in the film his task is to make sure that the dead stay dead. He is asked to rebury a corpse of a leading figure's father as it had been in the ground for 20 years and it was in danger of becoming a vampire. As such it is dug up and the apprentices are instructed to ward the coffin. However as far as young apprentices go they are more interested in fooling around than they are in doing their job and this is seen at the beginning of the film when they accidentally set loose a group of vampires.There is no deep theme in this film but it is very amusing and unlike western films also has a ghost roaming around. The ghost is of a young lady who died before finding love so when one of the apprentices puts some incense on her grave and mourns for her she is released and possesses him. When possessed he believes that she in real and will fight to defend her even though she is a ghost and this will lead to his death.I have seen a few Hong Kong horror films and they are simply not like what one would expect to come out of the US or Europe. We need to remember that Hong Kong is a city where East meets West and this is demonstrated clearly in its classic cinema such as this film. It is comical and it is full of martial arts for those who enjoy such spectacles. One needs to remember that there are horror themes and the themes are Chinese as opposed to western. While I would not jump up and say that it is definitely Chinese culture I do believe that it does give as a window into a different world and a world that I consider to be more entertaining that what we are used to in the west.".

I remembered that the first scene of the Vampire seen in his coffin after it was exhumed and another scene where his long thin sharpnailed fingers stick out of the coffin frightened me a lot. Now this movie is pretty tamed. However seeing this movie when I am older reminds me that this film is a piece of cinema classic and brilliance.A solid plot about a Taoist Priest and his two disciples trying to save the village from an old chief or officer who was resurrected into a hopping vampire. Adding to the suspense one of the disciples gets injured and turns into a vampire himself while the other is seduced by a female ghost. All these plot elements flow smoothly and compliment each other well making this an entertaining and intriguing feature. Ricky Gau did a great job directing and did not drag on the plot with pointless fillers which are evident in many films made in Hong Kong.Actor Lam Ching Ying formerly a member of actor Sammo Hung's stunt team plays Master Gau the powerful Taoist Priest Vampire Buster which would become Lam's signature role. He would reprise this Vampire Buster role in many vampire ghost and fantasy movies that follow.Lam is joined by movie veterans Ricky Hui and Chin SiuHo who play his hilarious disciples. The ghost is portrayed by Pauline Wang who would go on to typecast this role in many other fantasy films featuring a restless ghost. Set in ancient China the village and countryside sceneries are colorful and magnificent alongside the cast members' beautiful costumes. Rounding up the great elements of this film is a wonderfully eerie and orchestral music score by Anders Nelsson.I believe Mr. Vampire is the ultimate and original film of the vampireghost film genre preceding movies that represent what I think are some of the best work of Hong Kong Cinema.Grade A".

This comedichorror is a mixture of Cantonese comedy Taoist priests sticky rice chicken blood and a dash of kung fu that has become a perennial viewing of mine during the Halloween season. Its success did not go unnoticed and spawned many sequels and imitators many directed by the same director as this movie Ricky Lau KoonWai and starring mono eyebrowed Taoist priest fatsi Lam Ching Ying. It also had local critical success and would be nominated for several Hong Kong awards including Best Picture which Police Story would win Best Director two best supporting actors Lam Ching Ying and Ricky Hui. It would win for Best Original Film Score.It is said that when someone dies in anger a breath is caught in the throat. Nothing can exasperate this more than burying the body in an area with bad Feng Shui. Mr. Yam Huang Ha Spooky Encounters has been having inauspicious luck since the burial of his father and has hired Master Ko Lam Ching Ying Prodigal Son to help move the body to sacred ground. Every great master must have bumbling protgs and Ko has two in Man Chor Ricky Hui Plain Jane to the Rescue and Chow Chun Chin SiuHo The TaiChi Mater. Hui brother to Sam and Michael Hui who are also famous HK comedians plays his role quite well and is adroit with his comedic timing watch him in the background in many scenes always busy while Chin is more of a face in this movie though he has an extensive martial arts background. Guess who gets the romantic role in this movie? Part of the problem of having blundering help mixed with caring for the undead is the possibility probability of letting a ravenous choleric bloodsucking corpse loose on the populous. Because of an improperly sealed casket Grandpa Yam Yuen Wah Eastern Condors escaped from his coffin and killed his son unbeknownst to inept police officer Wai Billy Lau NamKwong who believes Master Ko is responsible and arrests him. However younger Yam's corpse is slowly turning into a wandering cadaver like father like son whose body is set in viewing distance of the jailed Ko. Later Man Chor gets injured by the springy corpse's vampirelike nails while protecting Yam's daughter Ting Ting Moon Lee ChoiFung and similar to the effects of European vampires bite wounds he will slowly turn into one unless prevented somehow. Meanwhile Chow Chun is having problems of his own with a beautiful ghost named Jade Pauline Wong who has tricked him into falling in love with her. Some of this story does remind me of Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu the house of the spirit and the way Ko helps repel Jade by the characters drawn on Chow Chun but there are many Chinese stories that have used these elements before Ugetsu.If I was to nitpick about the deficiencies of this movie I would state the abrupt ending as the biggest one  a bane of many Hong Kong films. Also the chicken violence which is real might offend some Harry Angel would like it as well as the removal of a gallbladder from a snake  which is also real though after watching Shaw Brothers release Killer Snakes I have become numb to small amounts of slithering serpent violence. I know some might not like the broad humor associated with Cantonese comedy but I have come to appreciate much of it.However there is much to appreciate from the dancing and comedic aspects of Ricky Hui to the effective use of Kung Fu and stunts. The secondary plot of the ghost love story also worked well for me. The introduction of the female ghost brought into the story was one of the most beautiful shots in the film marred only by an annoying sound effect. And like a good comedy should it finished off with a laugh. During this scene and the end credits there is a wonderful song used named Gwai San Neung Ghost Bride performed by the Kit Yi Chorus. The main strength of this film is that it sticks well to its premise of a comedy and does unnecessarily mix dramatic elements.There should not be a discussion about this film without mentioning the austere pillar performance of Lam Ching Ying. This performance is analogous to Vincent Price in which a career defining House of Wax 1953 set forth a years of horror for Vincent Price. Both actors had years of experience in various genres before their breakout horror roles both had excellent roles before Prodigal Son for Lam and Baron of Arizona for Price and would later have lucrative but strongly typecast roles offered to them afterwords. Lam's rendition of this Taoist priest is so perfect in its entirety his athletic skills certainly help that he has become a cult icon in certain circles. Like all good Taoists he knows the value of sticky rice and its many ubiquitous powers of healing.Along with Spooky Encounters this is a must watch movie from the Hong Kong comedyhorror oeuvre and perfect for introducing kyonsi to your friends  as long as they do not like chickens or snakes and you have friends of course.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm going to keep it short and sweet about one of my favourite flicks. It can't get any more popular than this highly regarded Hong Kong presentation produced by Sammo Hung that got everyone interested in the fantasy  supernatural comedy subgenre. Ricky Lau's 'Mr Vampire' is a creative KungFu supernatural romp with a wicked touch of black humour and an endearing splash of slapstick. The spontaneous storytelling and a busy script are streamlined by the interesting aspects of Eastern superstitious customs and folklore. From the hopping vampires with long fingernails to a restless spirit in love. It's boundless on imagination humour and highenergy stunt work. The horror is worked in with the sprucely choreographed martial arts and bumbling slapstick mishaps but that's not forgetting atmosphere aplenty. Some moodily innovative images mainly the first sign of the ghost in the forest and brooding passages the vampire on the rampage are strikingly matted by extraordinary photography and a breezily whimsical score. The thrills are jarringly fast and the precise acrobatic action packs a lot of oomph with it ending on a spectacular climax. Still the opening half is a little slow and not as abundant with the horrormaterial activity but the broad gags and characters come to the forefront. The contributions by the cast are all fitting. ChingYing Lam adeptly works well off the bungling likable Ricky Hui Siuhou Chin and Billy Lau. Moon Lee is elegantly good and Pauline Wong is rather fun as the persistent lovesick ghost. Wah Yuen is hypnotic as the rotting but destructive vampire. The zany special effects are lively produced costumes stylishly decorated and the makeup FX ably etched out with character. Classic horrorcomedy from the east but it's bizarre lighthearted comic style won't be for everyone's tastes. It would make a great doublefeature with the equally zany 'Close Encounters of the Spooky Kind' 1980.".

They also throw in a subplot involving one of the young lads being haunted sexually by a lady ghost. True it doesn't make sense but who the hell cares it's entertaining! While a lot of what happens is based around mythology in regards to how to beat vampires some things still are very strange. The already mentioned hopping vampires is one but eccentric spells like chicken blood extracted ungraphically on screen mixed with sticky rice and a snake's gall bladder extracted graphically on screen are just flat out oddball.The kung fu is of a high standard while not of Yuen Clan insanity it is still exciting with bodies flying everywhere and stuff being smashed.

In Man's Favorite Sport a story about a man who has never fished in his life having to try to win a fishing tournament in order to save his job he saw a fine opportunity for physical lazzi and active scenes in between the three active scenes of angling and several hilarious misadventures with physical equipment including chairs inflatable waders and a carpark locale misunderstanding he also found time to have his writers write some equally memorable dialogue confrontations of many sorts.

	schema:headline " Bringing up Fishies";
	schema:reviewBody "Howard Hawks did of course create the classic Bringing Up Baby and some comparison between Favorite as a 26year update of the former is inevitable. Hawks did plenty of screwball comedies but above all Hawks was a director who made GUY films Red River may be the ultimate man's man film of all time. And to some extent this film is about Willoughby's Hudson's fraudulent expertise in manly activities such as camping outdoor activities andmost critical to the plotfishing. Life is good for Hudson as the expert fisherman who is big man at Abercrombie and Fitch until brash Abby Page Prentiss destroys his serene existence with a publicity stunt of having Hudson enter an annual fishing contest.After resisting the idea Hudson is soon forced to confess he's never fished in his lifethat his reputation is a hoax. Rather than sensibly abandon the scheme Prentiss decides she can teach Hudson how to fish in 3 days. This inevitably leads to all sorts of misadventures as Hudson is so inept he can't even swim! Some of the more amusing sequences are Hudson's inflatable waders exploding underwater having a bear steal his trailbike or literally running across the surface of the lake to escape another bear. Some of the gags work better than others the gags range from leisurely to elaborate but all in good fun.The fasttalking overlapping dialog is pure Hawks and the uncredited Brackett and is wonderful.Hudson has been criticized for not being Cary Grant how could anyone be? but he actually develops his own persona different from both Grant and his own HudsonDay characterizations. In this film he is partially browbeaten by Prentiss and her sidekick Perschy but ultimately he voluntarily suffers through his ordeals as a matter of penance.Paula on the other hand is a complete success perky beautiful brash and unpredictableshe gives a spectacularly energetic performance. This is the sole film is where Prentiss has the script and the screen time to refine her comic persona. While Perschy and Holt exist to create a triangle and fuel the highjinx they also define the limits of the Prentiss character she is neither exotic like Perschy nor sultry like Holt. In comparison she is pleasantly and very prettily tomboyish often wearing outdoor sporting wear and thoroughly competent at all things in which Hudson had professed expertise.When compared with Baby Favorite perhaps begins with a potentially even richer premise and is less fanciful disposing of rich Connecticut dowagers and University endowments. But it never quite builds to the same frenetic pace and lacks the absurdity of the situations Grant finds himself in remember Mr. Bone? Hawks does lift sequences right out of Baby when Hudson shadows Perschy because the back of her dress is open the Love impulse in men manifests itself in conflict from Dr. Lehman is used by Easy the fish in the pants comes out of Monkey Business.Yet the films are quite different.

Familiarity in the case of this film breeds endearment.The sad part is that Paula Prentiss is so lovely and talented to watch in this film and clearly the critics had huge expectations of her career yet the next year she would do only three small parts in ensemble casts before withdrawing from films entirely for the next five years.

	onyx:emotionText "Howard Hawks did of course create the classic Bringing Up Baby and some comparison between Favorite as a 26year update of the former is inevitable. Hawks did plenty of screwball comedies but above all Hawks was a director who made GUY films Red River may be the ultimate man's man film of all time. And to some extent this film is about Willoughby's Hudson's fraudulent expertise in manly activities such as camping outdoor activities andmost critical to the plotfishing. Life is good for Hudson as the expert fisherman who is big man at Abercrombie and Fitch until brash Abby Page Prentiss destroys his serene existence with a publicity stunt of having Hudson enter an annual fishing contest.After resisting the idea Hudson is soon forced to confess he's never fished in his lifethat his reputation is a hoax. Rather than sensibly abandon the scheme Prentiss decides she can teach Hudson how to fish in 3 days. This inevitably leads to all sorts of misadventures as Hudson is so inept he can't even swim! Some of the more amusing sequences are Hudson's inflatable waders exploding underwater having a bear steal his trailbike or literally running across the surface of the lake to escape another bear. Some of the gags work better than others the gags range from leisurely to elaborate but all in good fun.The fasttalking overlapping dialog is pure Hawks and the uncredited Brackett and is wonderful.Hudson has been criticized for not being Cary Grant how could anyone be? but he actually develops his own persona different from both Grant and his own HudsonDay characterizations. In this film he is partially browbeaten by Prentiss and her sidekick Perschy but ultimately he voluntarily suffers through his ordeals as a matter of penance.Paula on the other hand is a complete success perky beautiful brash and unpredictableshe gives a spectacularly energetic performance. This is the sole film is where Prentiss has the script and the screen time to refine her comic persona. While Perschy and Holt exist to create a triangle and fuel the highjinx they also define the limits of the Prentiss character she is neither exotic like Perschy nor sultry like Holt. In comparison she is pleasantly and very prettily tomboyish often wearing outdoor sporting wear and thoroughly competent at all things in which Hudson had professed expertise.When compared with Baby Favorite perhaps begins with a potentially even richer premise and is less fanciful disposing of rich Connecticut dowagers and University endowments. But it never quite builds to the same frenetic pace and lacks the absurdity of the situations Grant finds himself in remember Mr. Bone? Hawks does lift sequences right out of Baby when Hudson shadows Perschy because the back of her dress is open the Love impulse in men manifests itself in conflict from Dr. Lehman is used by Easy the fish in the pants comes out of Monkey Business.Yet the films are quite different. Grant's character is entirely asocial while Hudson's is the leader of the Hawksian male group. Furthermore Hepburn is quickly determined to snare Grant while Prentiss is to the end ambivalent or in selfdenial.I've seen it commented including by the Voice film critic Molly Haskell that the film is more satisfying when seen for the second time and I wholeheartedly agree with this.

Today the 6th or 7th time I've seen it I found when it was over I wanted to go out and buy a DVD of it.Hawks' films may not have the pictorial qualities that Ford's Welles' and Hitchcock's had but when it came to involving you in a group of characters and their silly yet somehow believable antics he had no superiors. It's not surprising it took the French New Wave with their impatience for tired and predictable dramatic conventions to finally recognize and rank Hawks at the very highest level of film artists.".

If the film had been done 20 years earlier Cary Grant would definitely have been in the lead. The part of Roger Willoughby who wrote a book on fishing based on hearsay from the various customers he's dealt with at AbercrombieFitch would have been ideal for Cary Grant as it has just the kind of physical comedy that Grant was so adept at.However Rock Hudson steps into the role admirably and for once he's the pursued and not the pursuer. Pursuing Hudson every step of the way is the kookie Paula Prentiss who seemed to study at the Carol Burnett school of zaniness for this part. On a bit of advice from public relations expert Prentiss Hudson's boss at AbercrombieFitch John McGiver has him enter a fishing tournament. When Hudson confesses he's never fished and hates the slimy things Prentiss decides to help fake it through.There are a lot of really great laughs in this film but the best scene is Hudson trying out this inflatable suit for those who are fishing and fall in the water. He does and the results are hilarious.Don't miss this film if it is ever broadcast.".

What this film did for me is it brought back the feel of the late 50s  early 60s you know when there used to be a few morals left. Some of you may remember those days. You could see this throughout the whole movie the way they talked dressed and acted toward each other. Even the city and the cars and the mailboxes on the corner remember those? in the opening scene everything was bright clean and wholesome. The atmosphere at Lake Wakapougie? was clear and made you wish you were there too. Even in the lodge No one had tattoos no men were wearing earrings. Can you imagine that?! No men with long hair? No Mohawks? Is this legal?! No one weighed 350 pounds and looked like a World War 3 surviving shopper in Walmart. Just a nice easy to follow fun and relaxing movie complete with great background music that fit it perfectly sweet and calm. What a contrast to what we have now. If the film were to be made now Rock would probably have been a drug smuggler and would have had a long bedroom scene with everyone of the stars in the opening scene complete with as much swearing as they could possibly have stuck in there just to make sure the movie would go over. I mean they do have to sell movies right?! Do I exaggerate? What do you think? This is the main reason I like this film so much. It's just a nice sweet and wholesome film about a guy and girl who accidentally fall in love through a great setup. Yet the people aren't perfect neither is the film. I haven't found a perfect one yet. The only seminegatives I could find were the obvious tieattachedtoEasy scene yet it was funny.I missed how that happened until I backed up and watched it again...if you recall people in the movies back then couldn't do that also there is a time sequence I didn't get. Abigail calls Roger at I think 2 in the morning yet everyone is still up like it's 10PM at night! ... The guys at the bar who also have to be up in 3 hours for the competition John Screaming Eagle... everybody except Roger. That's another thing I thought was a little strange although it added comedy to the film. John Screaming Eagle is always keeping an eye on Roger's 'happenings'. Even at 2AM? and no one is even yawning they're raring to go like they all just got up! ha ha. I sure can't do that. Not at 2 in the morning. All in all though what a great film. and yeah I saw the other films the were mentioned like Bringing Up Baby. I'll take this one over that one although I liked Bringing Up Baby as well. What made a lot of the older films great was great dialog great direction great story lines. grate acting and fresh ideas. This has almost entirely been replaced in today's movies with massive swearing constant drugs rotten personalities sex sex sex. Yes today's films are truly designed for today's people. I guess the studios still know what they're doing after all!".

My wife who is just three years younger than me had never heard of it. We watched it last Friday night and she loved it as much as I always have. It's just a light hearted funny feel good movie and a joy to watch. Yes it is dated and yes the sets are glaringly fake but after a few minutes you forget about all of that and are pulled into the story and the fun that this movie is. A day or two later we watched The Sweetest Thing after someone recommended it to us. Both movies are romantic comedies one from the 60's one from the 2000's and there the similarities end. In Mans Favorite Sport? the two main characters hesitate before kissing one another because it's such a big step. In The Sweetest Thing the main characters dance around a Chinese restaurant singing about mens penises. In Man's Favorite Sport? the raciest thing you see is Maria Percy's bare back when her zipper breaks in The Sweetest Thing one of the characters takes a dress to the dry cleaner to try to get a semen stain out of it. The difference in decades and movie making and societal mores couldn't have been more apparent. Did I hate The Sweetest Thing? No I actually found many parts of it funny though not the parts mentioned above. It's just that the romantic comedy has changed dramatically over the years and not for the better. I'm not saying that we could ever go back if Man's Favorite Sport? opened in theaters today I don't think it would make much money. We've become too jaded and hardened for that. 1964 was a different time and this movie is a product of that time. And I highly recommend it for everyone. It's two hours better spent then on most of what Hollywood is putting out today I can promise you that. At the risk of sounding like an old fart and I'm not I'm in my early 50's they just don't make movies like this anymore and while maybe that's as it should be then again maybe it isn't...".

	schema:reviewBody "Rock Hudson stars as a man posing as a fishing expert who basically passes on information from one customer to another. He has written a best selling book on fishing and no one knows he's a fraud not even his fiance. He is shocked to learn his boss has entered him into a fishing contest and doesn't know what to do until Paula Prentiss and Maria Perschy tell him they got him involved and are going to teach him to fish. This is a pretty good comedy but it does have a little too much slapstick in it. There are some scenes that are taken from Bringing Up Baby and Howard Hawks did ask Cary Grant to be in this movie but he said no because he didn't want to be seen on screen with women who a lot younger then he was. The movie is two hours long and goes by pretty quickly.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rock Hudson and Doris Day made a great box office team for comedy romances. But Rock could also do comedy quite well with other costars. In this case it's Paula Prentiss. Only the theme is reversed in this film. Rock is the pursuer of Doris in their films. Here it's Prentiss who is pursuing Hudson. Form the very start  the title of the film one has as inkling of the fun that is about to get underway. The name Man's Favorite Sport? ends with a question mark. So is it fishing that the cover and plot otherwise lead one to believe? Or is it something else? Again the opening credits and song give it away. So all the viewer has to do is sit back and enjoy this wonderful comedy romance. A lot happens at Lake Wakapoogee when sporting goods salesman and howto fishing author Roger Willoughby Hudson must join the lake's annual fishing contest. And it's all funny. The hijinks are all at Rock's expense and he shows that he can play that end of comedy every bit as well as on the dishing out side. Prentiss is Abigail Page public relations agent for the lake lodge. She is very good in her role with her not so subtle come on to Willoughby. Toss in a fine cast of some fishing impresarios and friends and it's one fine funny film. This is good clean fun for the whole family.".

It's a throwback to the screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s with Rock Hudson as a fishing expert roped into entering a fishing contest by loony PR woman Paula Prentiss. It turns out that Hudson is an expert on paper having never even been near a lake never mind having fished in one. It's all very goofy fast paced and there's great chemistry between uptight Hudson and freespirited Prentiss who attempts to teach Hudson how to fish in some of the oddest ways. It's studiobound to be sure but it's stylish fun and features a very good supporting cast including John McGiver as Hudson's boss Norman Alden nearly stealing the film as John Screaming Eagle and the fetching Maria Perschy as Easy. The great music score is by Henry Mancini.".

The lighting is bland and frequently too bright the sets are all obviously constructed and photographed on a soundstage including all the exterior scenes or so it seems and the final impression is so artificial that the script's deficiencies become all the more glaring.Yes I know that pulling off some of this comedy's elaborately set up sequences some involving some fairly complex slapstick would be very hard to control in natural actual location settings but really one wished they would have tried to do so or at least to make the studio and backlot sets a little more convincing to the eye.

Most viewers undoubtedly grew weary uncomfortable and even irritated with seeing someone with Hudson's imposing size and appearance constantly being put into deprecating situations by Paula Prentiss' constantlyontheedge character Abigail Page. In Hudson's other two major romantic comedies Pillowtalk and Lover Come Backwith Doris Dayviewers were happy to see Hudson's conniving playboy characters ultimately get their comeupance. But his Roger Willoughby character here did nothing to deserve his fate. Many members of the audience no doubt were saying to themselves Enough already. Let the poor guy alone. Willoughby a fishingoriented salesmanauthor at Abercrombie and Fitch had never actually fished. Really a big crime. Page hoping to cashin on his namerecognition at a fishing tournament hosted by her friend's lodge blackmails Hudson's character into competing in the tournament...threatening to expose his secret if he doesn't comply. Once at the lodge Hudson is placed into one humiliating vignette after another...always under the thumb of Prentiss. Even in the matter of a kiss which her character obviously enjoyed Page nonetheless further undermines Willoughby's selfimage by telling him that the kiss ...just wasn't any good. In Pillowtalk and Lover Come Back the audience was happy to see Hudson's characters justly reprimanded by Day in the end. At the climax of Man's Favorite Sport? we instead are happy to see big strong Willoughby finally assert himself against the aggravatingly prickly Page. Prentiss with her wholesome brunette beauty athletic appearance and lively personality expertly assimilates into her character. Cool Germanic Maria Perschy as her lodgeowner friend and stunning statuesque Charlene Holt as Willoughby's ultimately former girlfriend likewise give solid performances. As for Hudson he deserves much credit for agreeing to play an accidentprone character such as Willoughby. The question is why did he do so. The answer is that Hudson obviously was a team player in his films. That is why he was popular among the performers with whom he worked. Character actors Roscoe Karns John McGiver Forrest Lewis Regis Toomey and Norman Alden each adds professional support to Man's Favorite Sport? The Northern California fishing lodge locale likewise is a plus. Again there is much to endorse the film.

The problem is that he's never been fishing in his life the book and the advice he gives to customers is just gossip picked up from various sources. In other words Hudson is a fraud only no one knows about it not even his boss Mr. Cadwalader. Hawks has a feeling for the proper names Peabody is an elite name in Boston while Cadwalader like Rittenhouse is an elite name from Philadelphia.At any rate Cadwalader sends Hudson to join a fishing tournament at a remote lake expecting him to win fame for Abercrombie and Fitch. He's accompanied by two of the corporation's public relations people Paula Prentiss nee Ragusa in San Antonio and Maria Perschy from Austria. They discover Hudson's secret that he's an ignoramus when it comes to praxis and decide to help him. He and Prentiss fall in love and all is resolved.It's one of Hawks' most relaxed comedies and it's not entirely successful. The dopey musical score doesn't help. Many of the jokes are iterative  repetitious or borrowed from Hawks' earlier work. There's even a direct quote from Bringing Up Baby 1936 The love impulse in man frequently expresses itself in terms of conflict. The jokes tend to be flat. An Indian guide with his arms folded across his chest grunts out answers to tourists' questions until money comes up then he relaxes into smooth modern American speech. Boy is that old.Yet if the movie isn't a success it's not a failure either. There are some very funny moments. Even some of the borrowed jokes are still funny. And both Paula Prentiss and Maria Perschy are  umm how can I put this delicately and without sounding sexist?  babalicious? Prentiss falls easily into the pattern of the Hawks woman. She has the proper ditzy quality turning all of Rock Hudson's grumbled objections into nonsense. Perschy can't quite get with Hawks' demands. There are times when Hudson is quite good as the humiliated and incompetent male although he is no Cary Grant who would have walked successfully through the part with his eyes closed.Hawks was an odd character superficially dull laconic slow moving. But he was thoroughly heterosexual and seduced as many of his leading ladies as he could according to his biographer. The invitation was phrased something like Would you like to spend a weekend at the ranch? Sometimes he was aced out by his male actors  John Ireland got to Joanne Dru in Red River and Bogart coopted Lauren Bacall in their first movie together. When that happened the actor didn't work with Hawks again.The director preferred to make one of two types of movies those about solidarity among a team of male professionals eg. Air Force and productions like this one exposing inexperienced eggheads for the poseurs and impractical idealists that they are eg. The Thing From Another World.

	schema:reviewBody "Man's Favorite Sport? was intended as Hawks' homage to his own 1938 screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby with Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant which I unfortunately absolutely didn't enjoy. And Man's Favorite Sport? starts unpromisingly with Abigail Page Paula Prentiss and an unexplained German girl with the somewhat deceptive nickname Easy Maria Perschy girlganging up on Roger Willoughby Rock Hudson. Fortunately the movie then pulls out all stops and becomes an unabashed showboat for Hollywood's dreamcouple Hudson and Prentiss. I've always liked Prentiss and she really shines here although she's a bit too brassy for her persona I hadn't seen much from Rock Hudson so far but I can't really blame women and quite a few men apparently for swooning over him  oh he's so boyish so demure and yet so manly when the situation calls for it! And he always falls into the water and then needs to get out of his clothes with a frequency that was hitherto more characteristic of tacky Bollywood productions.I have profited from Hudson's performance in learning a lot about what women want. It's certainly more entertaining and more insightful than reading books on how to attract women from selfstyled wannabe Casanovas.Well the HudsonPrentiss romance is the movie's forte and it builds a tolerably entertaining story around it. It also curiously starts off with some sexy sport images that seem to be a generation ahead and ends with a blackandwhite scene which is designed to look like it was shot a generation or two ago.Harmless fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Man's Favorite Sport? would have to be my favourite neoscrewball comedy does such a term already exist or can I claim to have invented it? and perhaps the last screwball directed by one of the original masters of the genre Howard Hawks.The factor which by far most surprised me in Man's Favorite Sport? was Rock Hudson. My previous encounters with the actor left me unimpressed leaving me to classify him as one of classic Hollywood's duller leading men. However the fact that I not only enjoyed his performance in this film but found him hysterically funny was such a shock that I was demanding answers. Did Hudson acting abilities improve by 1964? Is he better than comedy than drama or had he just grown on me? It just goes to show that there are very few classic Hollywood stars who can't impress me in at least some small way or another even if my previous impression of them were not very good. Paula Prentiss is also entering my books as a onehit wonder actress I've yet to see her in another film in which she is as joyous and energetic as this with that comically imposing voice of hers. Being a semiremake of Hawk's Bringing Up Baby the two leads could have just done impressions of Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn but the avoid doing so and make the roles their own but like Grant and Hepburn their chemistry is on fire.This movie exemplifies in the early to mid1960's aesthetic with its fashion the cars and overall appearance showcasing the final days of old Hollywood glamour. I want to know who the set designer in this film was the revolving bar alone has to be one of the most unabashedly 60's sets ever. Even the less out there sets such an office or a fishing shop have a certain beauty to them. The film's colorful visuals help give it the appearance of a live action cartoon partly due to the fact that many of the outdoor scenes take place on obviously fake sets but then again isn't a liveaction cartoon one of the definitions of screwball comedy. I also don't normally go for those cheesy opening credit songs from the 50's and 60's often sang by the likes of Doris Day but this one is dam catchy.Unlike the manic intensity of its sister film Bringing Up Baby Man's Favorite Sport? is surprising a very relaxing film to watch aided by lakeside resort setting and Henry Mancini's music score which is so mellow. I just love the juvenile innocence of the gags present in this film such as a bear riding on a motorcycle to many variations of William Powell's fishing scene from Libeled Lady. Likewise the common screwball comedy theme of crises of masculinity permeates the film. Hudson's Rodger Willoughby a name which feels straight from a 1930's comedy is an icon of masculinity from writing books about fishing yet he is secretly a phony who has never fished in his life and completely fails at his attempts at his attempts at outdoor living while being made the foil of two hyperactive women. Man's Favorite Sport? shows by the 60's it was still possible to make these kinds of movies with the same velocity they had back in the 30's.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is one of the finest comic films in my opinion and not surprisingly made by the super genius Howard Hawks. The story is about Roger Willoughby who is a famous fishing expert having written a book about it but ironically never fished in his life. The movie centres around a fishing competition where Roger has to participate thanks to his eccentric boss the great John McGiver who got convinced by Abigail Page Paula Prentiss PR exec at a rest house where the fishing competition takes place. What happens afterwards are a series of funny incidents all sure to make you feel cheerful  rolling in laughter. Some comic scenes are very clever and very funny I can't seem to find such funny movies these days especially scenes of Roger trying to actually fish and those involving Mr. Phipps Roger's client who learned fishing from him but never wanted to pay for 15 for it. Totally enjoyed the beautiful story and the lovable characters. I fell in love with Paula Prentiss she's such a marvellous beauty... and so funny too. Her character exudes naivet at the same time subtle evil vibes throughout. I can't even begin to compare her with some of the female comic actors in the business today. Rock Hudson is a perfect fit to the 'phoney' Roger and does a neat job till the end. Other characters Hawks builds are equally hilarious... I have a huge long playlist and little time for movies but I know for sure I am going to watch this movie again  again when I really want to cheer up. Love it! if you enjoy clever humour with a light heart of course this movie will certainly make you happy too. Go for it!".

The straw Hat Pirates  the Thief Brothers must go to Clockwork Island to reclaim the Going Merry Shank's straw hat Nami and the Diamond Clockwhich the Thief Brothers find to be the most well crafted clock of all.I give credit that this sequel feels like a movie rather than a 2 parter episode. Because it didn't had reused TV opening and closing. The animation and CG is very well done for this film. The cast of characters along with the main are interesting and well thought up. The story had a fast pace to it so it didn't had any dull moment to it. But since it's One Piece it's meant to be as entertaining as the TV series itself. Plus the montage ending features characters who appear later in the series.Overall a worthy sequel that all One Piece Fan will admire. Again the fan sub for it is easy to find off the internet or bootlegs.".

	schema:headline " Great conclusion to the original series";
	schema:reviewBody "Night of the Demons 3 is a serviceable entry in the series with a lot to like about it.SPOILERSTraveling to a party Nick Gregory Calpakis Lois Tara Sloane Reggie Joel Gordon Vince Kristen HoldenRied and Orson Christian Tessier come across Abbie Patricia Rodriguez and her friend Holly Stephanie Bauder stranded on the side of the road. After a trip to a liquor store goes horribly wrong they all head out and try to hide out from the situation. When they come across a house in the middle of nowhere they realize it's the infamous Hull House but ignore the warnings about it being haunted and stay there anyway. Coming upon Angela Franklin Amelia Kinkade who lives in the house they decide to come up with a way to escape. When they realize that they're being killed off onebyone their plan to escape gets even more desperate as the demons try to prevent it from happening.The Good News This one here actually wasn't all that bad at all. The film's best point like all the other entries in the series is that the special effects here drive the film. From the rather fun and interesting looking demons which here still have the distorted faces large red eyes fanglined mouths and demonicscales all over them which manage to impart them with a fantastic look to how the humans and demons are killed to the powers that they demonstrate to terrorize the others around them there's plenty of special effects in here which look really great. There's a great scene where they all change into the various versions of their past lives complete with the bloody wounds that were inflicted before their death yet transformed into the demon makeup and it's overall a great scene. The kills in here are just as memorable with there being a hand punched through a chest and pulling a heart out a police badge thrown into the face having a chest scratched up a forked tongue shoved into the mouth and explodes out the back of the head and having a car run over them among others. There's also the demon's deaths which are again accomplished with the usual holywaterthatmeltstheskin technique that really produces some messy scenes. The confrontations with the demons in here are also really great and the lasthalf hour of the film is just really great as there's just a neverending series of confrontations and chases through the house. From the Satanmasked demon that chases them through the different levels to the main one from down in the basement up into the main part of the house and out into the front yard where there's the great demonic confrontation it has a whole lot of great parts that are just plain fun. The last best part of the film though is that there's plenty of nice cheese in here. From the action to the makeup to the really nice nudity and the romantic scene in the middle of the chase it feels really cheesy and definitely a lot of fun. These here are all that make the film really enjoyable.The Bad News There wasn't a whole lot to this one that doesn't work. The robbery angle here is the main thing which doesn't make much sense at all. This is completely handled the wrong way since it puts every single one of them in danger from the police based on what they find on the surveillance tape yet at the end the survivors are told that there's no evidence of them being on it. This indicates that they had seen it yet the actions that would've been caught by those who were on it don't deserve the police following them and yet the film throws in the segments with them doing all the wrong things to make it go on which is really the biggest part of it all. The film's rather large cheese factor is something else here but the misstep over the cop angle here is the biggest problem.The Final Verdict A really enjoyable and impressive entry if just not up to the level of the other entries yet still being good on it's own. If you've liked the others then there's nothing that should stop a viewing and those who enjoy these kinds of films should as well while those who aren't big fans should heed caution.Rated R Graphic Violence Nudity and Graphic Language".

	onyx:emotionText "Night of the Demons 3 is a serviceable entry in the series with a lot to like about it.SPOILERSTraveling to a party Nick Gregory Calpakis Lois Tara Sloane Reggie Joel Gordon Vince Kristen HoldenRied and Orson Christian Tessier come across Abbie Patricia Rodriguez and her friend Holly Stephanie Bauder stranded on the side of the road. After a trip to a liquor store goes horribly wrong they all head out and try to hide out from the situation. When they come across a house in the middle of nowhere they realize it's the infamous Hull House but ignore the warnings about it being haunted and stay there anyway. Coming upon Angela Franklin Amelia Kinkade who lives in the house they decide to come up with a way to escape. When they realize that they're being killed off onebyone their plan to escape gets even more desperate as the demons try to prevent it from happening.The Good News This one here actually wasn't all that bad at all. The film's best point like all the other entries in the series is that the special effects here drive the film. From the rather fun and interesting looking demons which here still have the distorted faces large red eyes fanglined mouths and demonicscales all over them which manage to impart them with a fantastic look to how the humans and demons are killed to the powers that they demonstrate to terrorize the others around them there's plenty of special effects in here which look really great. There's a great scene where they all change into the various versions of their past lives complete with the bloody wounds that were inflicted before their death yet transformed into the demon makeup and it's overall a great scene. The kills in here are just as memorable with there being a hand punched through a chest and pulling a heart out a police badge thrown into the face having a chest scratched up a forked tongue shoved into the mouth and explodes out the back of the head and having a car run over them among others. There's also the demon's deaths which are again accomplished with the usual holywaterthatmeltstheskin technique that really produces some messy scenes. The confrontations with the demons in here are also really great and the lasthalf hour of the film is just really great as there's just a neverending series of confrontations and chases through the house. From the Satanmasked demon that chases them through the different levels to the main one from down in the basement up into the main part of the house and out into the front yard where there's the great demonic confrontation it has a whole lot of great parts that are just plain fun. The last best part of the film though is that there's plenty of nice cheese in here. From the action to the makeup to the really nice nudity and the romantic scene in the middle of the chase it feels really cheesy and definitely a lot of fun. These here are all that make the film really enjoyable.The Bad News There wasn't a whole lot to this one that doesn't work. The robbery angle here is the main thing which doesn't make much sense at all. This is completely handled the wrong way since it puts every single one of them in danger from the police based on what they find on the surveillance tape yet at the end the survivors are told that there's no evidence of them being on it. This indicates that they had seen it yet the actions that would've been caught by those who were on it don't deserve the police following them and yet the film throws in the segments with them doing all the wrong things to make it go on which is really the biggest part of it all. The film's rather large cheese factor is something else here but the misstep over the cop angle here is the biggest problem.The Final Verdict A really enjoyable and impressive entry if just not up to the level of the other entries yet still being good on it's own. If you've liked the others then there's nothing that should stop a viewing and those who enjoy these kinds of films should as well while those who aren't big fans should heed caution.Rated R Graphic Violence Nudity and Graphic Language";

They see the cheerleader Holly Stephanie Bauder trying to fix her car and they offer a ride to Holly and her friend Abbie Patricia Rodriguez.They stop in a convenience store to buy beer and the clerk suspects of the group and points a shotgun to them but Vince takes the weapon and dominates the situation. But two police officers come to the place and Vince accidentally shots one of them when the clerk grabs his hair. The other policeman shots Reggie in the stomach but they succeed to escape from the store. But the van is shot on the gas tank and Vince decides to stop the vehicle in the infamous Hull House considered a cursed place instead of taking Reggie to the hospital using the shotgun to force Nick and the other teenagers to follow him. But the place is not abandoned and the demon Angela Amelia Kinkade meets them in an human form. Meanwhile the officer was wearing bulletproof vest and was not wounded and the veteran Lieutenant Dewhurst Vlasta Vrana discovers that the clerk is lying after watching the surveillance tape. Dewhurst track them down while the group discovers the truth about the Hull House. Night of the Demons III is flawed but not as bad as indicates many reviews. I saw this movie for the first time on 24 February 2000 on VHS and I have just seen it again. The story has a poor development of the characters and it is difficult to understand why Nick hangs around with Vince Lois and Orson. The fate of Abbie Lieutenant Dewhurst and Reggie are not fair since they are not evil like Vince Lois and Orson. But the movie entertains considering the budget. My vote is six.Title Brazil A Casa do Diabo The Demon House".

As of now this is the final entry in the Night of the Demons series of films  I have to say that I haven't seen either of the two previous instalment's so I can't compare them in fact in the UK Night of the Demons III was renamed Demon House  marketed as an original film rather than part of a series. The script by Kevin Tenney moves along at a fair pace it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously  doesn't try to do anything other than be a straight forward teen horror with lots of oneliners nudity sex  a decent amount of gore. For instance the first time we see Abbie  Holly they are both topless for no real apparent reason other to give the audience what they want gratuitous nudity  for that I salute Night of the Demons III. There's a fair amount of exploitation  all the ingredients that a low budget film such as this needs to make it watchable. The plotting isn't the best the character's are somewhat clichd  there isn't much to it but it's sort of fun on a dumb level it's short enough not to become tedious  entertains.Director Kaufman does an OK job  while the film doesn't have a lot of style it has a reasonable atmosphere a few reasonably effective scenes  he keeps the thing moving along. There are a few demons which look OK  some decent gore a ripped out still beating heart someone is shot in the eye a melting demon  someone has a demon tongue shoot out the back of their head.Technically the film is alright it's competent at least. The opening credits feature some poor computer graphics along with a pretty cool sounding theme tune. The acting varies between OK  downright poor.Night of the Demons III was OK it's not a masterpiece but I honestly don't think it sets out to be. Personally I think it's well worth a watch if your a horror fan other's should probably avoid it. Night of the Demons 1988  Night of the Demons II 1994 were the previous entries.".

And for another thing how many god damn sequels are they going to keep using scenes cut from the original only good NOTD Movie? reshowing scenes of angela floating through the halls wont save this piece of dung. and Angela has went to hell. she doesn't even look scary in this one. and the first and best one wouldn't say so something so dumb as fuck this I'm puttin on some music  Angela part 3. the movie was totally lame and if you think its cool and are deciding on renting it save your money because it SUCKS!";

	schema:reviewBody "... I did say  almost  DEMON HOUSE as it's known in the UK is one of those horror movies made in the 1990s which uses every single clich that caused the slow extinction of 1980s horror movies . It starts off with some horny teenagers in a van saying lots of clever things like  I bet your mother ...  and coming close to killing one another . One can't help asking if they despise one another so much then why are they hanging out together ? The answer is simplethis is a horror movie so all logic goes flying out the window Even so this film is much dumber than most horror movies you will see . For example the story is set up via a shoot out so the teenagers have to go on the run because they think they've killed a cop . That's bad enough but they haven't killed anyone and for reasons that defy any logic a detective decides he'll hunt the kids down because he doesn't want the uniformed cops taking the law into their own hands . Hmmm yeah I'm sure every police detective in the world thinks along the same lines Meanwhile the horny teenagers hide out in a house that is possessed by a demon . Not so much a demon  more of a MILF . I'm sure if you're a horny male teenager then you'd be unable to keep your eyes in when you see a really hot brunette in her thirties wearing very little  but strangely most of the boys don't seem to notice . Intestingly everyone wanders around alone for no good reason so you don't need me to tell you what happens next and you'll be asking yourself why the protagonists didn't do such and such a thing . The answer is very obvious this is a horror movie and not a very good one either".

Female berdemon Angela Amelia Kinkade doesn't look as irresistible anymore as she did in the late 80's but she still tries to convince us of her sexual powers by demonstrating what oral sex of her would look like on a pistol!.

This means that I likely missed many of the nuances and meanings beneath the words spoken by the characters in this play not to mention the subtitles going by at times at a quick clip and I may have missed a couple of the jokes that appeared to get big laughs or the significance of some of the Noh stylistics. But as an ardent fan of Takashi Miike and his body of work that may not be the best of Japanese film Kurosawa or Ozu or Kobayashi would be the one of three good choices but certainly has the widest range of any director picking out something of his to watch however sometimes familiar and derivative is like picking out something from a menu at a reputable restaurant. Not everything is perfect but usually you get a very good meal.Demon Pond is no exception only now there's the distinction of it being live videotaped theater with Miike directing both the camerawork and editing as well as the actors on stage. The play is about a pond of the title and the principle character Yamazawa Hagawara and Yuri. There is a bell right next to where Yuri lives and it must be rung three times or else there will be dire consequences. But there's also a drought going on in the nearby village from a lack of the river from the pond. There's also curses to be had and an irate princess who can't stand that the bell is rung as it keeps here from her one true love and wants to cut it down. There are some other things that happen one of which in the last act that would be a terrible spoiler but suffice to say it's surrounded in fable and mythological lore the likes of which will be more familiar to the students and fans of Japanese mythology and stories.In fact one of the joys of Demon Pond is storytelling as sometimes a character will prove himself by telling a story as one does for Yuri to possibly get a place to sleep for the night. It's also a plus that for much of the time the humor is genuine and I found myself laughing along with the audience at both the absurd little beats in the script and the exaggerated performances by the supporting players while my least favorite section of the play the midsection with the men with their catch of fish there are plenty of crazy laughs. Here and there the story might be a little tough to follow as characters go on and on about things that don't have much to do with the central plot. When it does work however it's a splendid synthesis of superb 'stylized' acting i.e. the princess production design and flamboyant costume designs and sweet and somber music. There are even one or two fairly quotable lines like Don't scream 'Tokyo' at me in anger or I like Veggie but don't call me Mr. Veggie! So congratulations to Mr. Miike as he's somehow pulled off some very good and fascinating direction on a good fantasy playvideo even if sad to say I'd still much rather see how he'd do it as a real film now there would be something incredible. And as another note of interest for Americans I happen to find the DVD as something of an anomaly at my local Blockbuster. 7.510".

It seems to me after seeing almost a dozen of his movies that his signature style is his ability to work in any style now confirmed by this stage play peopled by film actors who are just as good in live theater as they are in his and other directors' films.This play updates a traditional Japanese folktale about the consequences of not complying with the gods' wishes. It's eerily predictive of the 311 string of disasters not so much in exact detail but in the way some elements of society can't be bothered to respect the power that nature can bring to bear on humancreated structures and institutions. In this story nature is chiefly represented by a tantrumprone lovestruck demon princess and her minions. That's pretty telling. For millennia the Japanese cosmology has sought to ease humanity's relationship with the capriciousness of nature. This is deeply ingrained in Japanese daily life but as seen with the aftermath of the 311 Thoku earthquake and tsunami putting a bunch of nuclear reactors on earthquakeprone stretches of coastline is modernism and human hubris gone amok. Nature just is what it is. The way it's written in kanji  shizen is telling. The kanji mean self and as it is. People disregard it at their own peril and to the detriment of others around them.The leads are played with heart and skill by Tomoko Tabata Shinji Takeda and Ryhei Matsuda. Miike makes good use of a supporting cast of other wellknown movie actors in multiple roles some human some animal some shapeshifting demons gods and other supernaturalswithout major adjustments in their appearance unlike all the technological costume and makeup resources he availed himself of in his other big supernatural story Ykai Dai Sens. Likewise the stage set is simple and uses lighting and sound not so much naturalistic in either case as evocative to indicate locale. Where there might be bloodshed he doesn't even make use of stage blood trusting the audience and his actors to make the experience real.Although this is a stage play the camera work is closer to that of a TV production well coordinated to make the best use of small moments in closeup. However it never tries to be anything other than a stage play and the audience's response and participation are critical to appreciating it as a realtime work. It's the next best thing to being there.".

Although this is very much a static production with a handful of actors sharing dialogue on stage Miike shoots from various angles to keep it interesting.The story itself is quite simple about a couple living near the titular location who are visited by various old friends fishermen and thugs. Personal and political relationships are the focus here and there's a great deal of fast dialogue to get through. Unfortunately the film lacks narrative focus and at least half of the running time seems to be about topics which are purely extraneous. There's quite a bit of comedy to boot. However the ending is suitably dramatic and the performances are spot on I was particularly pleased to see a couple of familiar faces from THE RAID 2 as part of the mix.".

This title of a series of Crayon ShinChan films describes very well what the good old days there were when the Japanese lived in 1960s and 70s and at the same time how eager the 5yearold boy ShinChan is to live believing in his future and his family. Yesterday Once More the group to plot attract all grownups by appealing to their nostalgic memory invents a huge Tokyotower like construction at the center of Saitama Prefecture where ShinChan and his family live. All the grownups in the city are attracted to the construction's exhibitions imitating exactly the Expo '70 held in Japan. The leader of the group Ken denies the future saying that the 21th century we are living now is not the same as one we expected in the 70s. Drived by disappointment of the present and the future he insists on returning to the good old days of Japan. More and more grownups abandon their life and leave children only to become kids again who are playing their nostalgic toys in the construction. ShinChan and his friends decide to get back their future and family out of the hands of The Empire of Grownups as ShinChan names Yesterday Once More. The film is filled with nostalgic stuffs so familiar to the Japanese more than 30 years old. It may be hard for nonJapanese viewers to understand though I believe that people can share nostalgia no matter how they are different from one another. And people can have more to share when they see ChinChan's resolution to get back his future because his belief in his possibility is so strong that it can impress all the viewers in the world. This fiveyearold boy is powerful cheerful and impressive!".

And I felt that time cannot return and we must not be about to do it. The best scene I think is ... Shinnosuke calls back Hiroshi in the 20th century when Hiroshi starts to return the 21st century from the 20th century. Shinnosuke constantly says You are my father! Let's go back with me!. And Shinnosuke makes him smell his shoe and says Can you notice me?. Hiroshi says ...Yes... with tears. This scene gave me goose flesh.So I want you to see this movie .".

He has discovered that jealousy is one way to obtain this feeling. So he tries to get the young doctor interested in his wife by doing such things as getting them drunk together and having the doctor develop naked pictures of her. The doctor is already involved with the family's daughter but she is not nearly as physically attractive as the mother.This is a movie based on the novel The Key by Tanizaki Jun'ichiro. I have read the English translation and can say that the changes which have been made serve to help the adaptation work on the screen.Overall it is an entertaining film. The ending differs from the book somewhat and I found it to be quite comical.".

The characters are seen too dark and sick way in this movie and viewer can't really emphatize much with them. This alone makes it fight against the very idea of the original masterpiece of Tanizaki. In addition the characters are different than described in the book. Especially Kenji's wife Ikuko is much younger than in the book which steers the movie already out from the right path. In addition Kimura's character is seen too selfish. Also the refer to key which kagi means is somewhat superficial and synthetic. The original book was written through the couple's diaries which offered much more depth to the characters and allowed person to get inside their heads. The movie tries just shock people which it really does. Another surprising thing is that the movie was rated K16 here in Finland. May I ask why?? The strong visual content instead makes this movie work and was the reason why I bothered myself to rate this here in IMDB. It's really well made and the visual cutting brings up emotions very efficiently. In today's movie this wouldn't work but when we think that this was made in '59 it's somewhat interesting. Also actors do proper job. For all those who have read the book you might be disappointed to this movie. Others I can recommend with reservation.".

The lead is an older male who is having impotency problems. So he receives injections more about that later and gets his sexual satisfaction drugging his wife and photographing her nude or putting her in intimate situations with a young doctor they don't have sex but the old guy enjoys feeling jealous of themit makes him feel younger. Unfortunately the old guy is REALLY sick and dies after watching his wife strip for him. Then in an odd twist of fate the wife the doctor and the old man's odd daughter all accidentally ingest poison and die! Well not all of it was accidentalthe daughter put poison in her mom's tea because she was jealous of the relationship between the doctor and the mother. Too weird! Although I guess I liked it just because it dared to be so different it is not a movie I would rush out to watch. Another problem is that the version from The International Collection has crappy dubbing. In the prologue to the movie the doctor must talk for about 5 minutes and NONE of it was subtitledwhat he said is completely beyond anyone who doesn't speak Japanese. Also the material is VERY sexually charged though there is no nudity in the film but they talk so cryptically about the impotence I had a strong feeling either the people that did the subtitles left A LOT out or perhaps the movie was originally very cryptic. For example we have no injections what sort of injections the old man gets or why it's BAD that he's been getting them so often. I was just baffled.".

I saw it many years ago and foolishly tried it again last night. I kept falling asleep it's a legitimate form of criticism and no I hadn't been drinking. The film starts with Tatsuya Nakadai star of many Japanese classics as Dr. Kimura detailing how humans decline over the years. He points straight at the camera and says this decrepitude will come to us all so you know this film is going to be different. The doctor is giving an old man injections to treat his impotence no Viagra in those days and the old boy invites him to his home hoping that the doctor who's already involved with his daughter will dally with his young wife. The idea is that jealousy will revive his flagging libido. One problem is that while the male actors are interesting the women are not. I don't know why from a land with so many exquisite and enchanting actresses Ichikawa chose two puddings with particularly unfortunate eyebrows. I don't know the younger one but Machiko Kyo from Rashomon and Teahouse of the August Moon was normally attractive. The old man has high blood pressure and the wife seems intent on finishing him off by overexciting him so maybe Ichikawa made her look ugly to mirror the ugliness inside the character. Another problem was Japanese inscrutability. Nobody seemed passionate about or even very interested in anyone else. It was hard to see why the doctor went along with their games. The son of a fisherman he was young handsome and ambitious so why did he bother with two women with neither beauty or money? the old man had reputation but no means.".

	schema:headline " Complete and utter failure";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is just a poor attempt to combine all sorts of action movie clichs brought together with a hope that it will attract action movie fans to the film. I am afraid that was a false hope as I think this film was an utter failure. Its performance cannot even be compared with the first Taken film which I loved. Liam Neeson is marvellous as always but the scenario is awful. There are many ridiculous points throughout the film 1 How does the girl manage to use three grenades in Istanbul without getting caught by Turkish forces?2 Are we expected to believe all Turkish police cars are from 1970's and 80's?3 It is not even a whole day spent in the city and I think we heard more than five hundred calls for prayer... 4 Liam Neeson fights and shoots almost 1015 guys and I cannot remember him receiving one fist on the chin. Are all bad guys idiots that they let Liam Neeson on his own for hours to let him make phone calls and arrange his escape. 5 Again the bad guys who are shown to be burning with the desire for revenge are not actually that bad as they treat the guy and his family pretty well. 6 The bad guys fire almost thousands of bullets and miss every single shot whereas our ex agent seems to be hitting the target every single time. 7 We see an exceptional impossible! driving performance of the girl in narrow and unfamiliar streets of Istanbul where she stepped her foot for the first time in less than 24 hours. Maybe we are expected to believe she inherited ! those natural skills from her bionic father the day she was born. 8 We are expected to believe that one can consider barging into an embassy courtyard driving through the security and be allowed to walk free by just one call to a guy in the golf field. Seriously??? 9 Some of the fighting scenes are too fast it is impossible to understand what's going on. You just have to sit patiently for two minutes to see who collapses and who is still on his foot to understand who was a better fighter. 10 I thought counting in the car for the turns and noises for boat music instrument and something else that I do not remember now was so cheesy. The boat and the music guy being in the same place forever and ever is just a laugh. ..... I think I can continue with the list and add 2550 more ridiculous items. In short I am trying to tell is that this film is not worth going to the cinema and wasting time and money on that. If you had liked the first film and expecting this one to be similar you will be very disappointed. The story is so poor that I think it is an insult to the audience's intelligence.".

He escapes from the place just like that and then is followed by Turkish police cars from 1970s. Kim who was not able to drive automatic car in US right away makes all these car moves driving a stick Taxi in the most narrowed streets. I also have to mention that all the women appeared in the movie were dressed in black veils I don't know why someone should explain that also Turkey does not have a border with Albenia.

The plot follows Liam Neeson after the events of the original and well its the pretty much an identical situation. The climax however is the main issue  it's rushed. It just happens and I was left wondering why it just ended so fast. I cannot say this movie was terrible because it wasn't it was just a movie that could not even close live up to its predecessor due to lack of depth and originality.

Kim has her swimming session and the villains don't bother her at all until they have neeson and his ex wife.3.

Taxi drivers in Istanbul have better cars than the police of turkey who have something that resembles ladas.6. You can set off many grenades in a dense city but no military or police will look for you.7. When villains catch you they will not pat you down for hidden weapons or mobile phones they will just tie you with cheap plastic bands then leave you alone for you to escape.8. While in a gun stand off and a baddie pointing a gun to your wives head will conveniently let you make a phone call and cant find your daughter even though you just told her in front of the baddies.9. Albanians speak English with each other but some speak their native language.10. You can drive a car into a US embassies courtyard heavy artillery is fired at you but not a single bullet hits you nor does any bullet damage the engine or tires of the car.11. A girl who fails her test many times is all of a sudden able to drive a car like transporter.12.

You get slashed on your neck with a blade and are hung upside down to bleed to death yet later your wound automatically heals over a few hours and your fresh to go again.15. While fighting camera angles and during car chases camera angles don't have to make sense you have to use your imagination.16.

There was no sharp dialogue and some scenes bordered on the risible especially when Liam Neeson was trying to give directions to his daughter on his whereabouts.

Grenades that you know the Turkish authorities don't mind anyone bringing to their country on a plane. Grenades that evaded metal detectors.

And in fairness in hindsight it would have been tough to measure up to the first one on the basis that there is very little more than could have been done with the idea short of seeing Neeson kidnapped and his daughter deliver the I will find you and I will kill you spiel.

And in fairness in hindsight it would have been tough to measure up to the first one on the basis that there is very little more than could have been done with the idea short of seeing Neeson kidnapped and his daughter deliver the I will find you and I will kill you spiel. To be honest that might have been better.";

	schema:headline " Uninspired and less exciting than the first Taken 2 is a barely passable sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "Liam Neeson's actionman renaissance in 2008's Taken was a most unheralded critical and boxoffice hit for a seemingly generic revenge flick. Writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen managed to captivate audiences with a streamlined story of a retired CIA operative using his skills to locate and rescue his kidnapped daughter. It was a simple concept in that it utilized family bonds as motivation but it was made exciting through a mixture of intriguing resourcefulness and crafty violence. Everything about the story of Taken was so concrete that there didn't seem like any obvious direction for a sequel but a gross of 226.8 million on a 25million budget talks and so we have Taken 2 but what Besson and Kamen have come up with this time fails to measure up to the original in almost every way.This shouldn't surprise anyone considering again no justification existed in the original story for a sequel. Kim Maggie Grace couldn't just get taken again and part of the intrigue was Mills Neeson having to find her despite being hours behind her captors with no idea of where they might take her. In Taken 2 it's not as complicated and the stakes don't feel nearly as high.Simply the Albanians that Mills killed en route to finding his daughter want revenge so they track him to one of his private security jobs in Istanbul. As it happens Kim and her mother Lenore Famke Janssen decide to surprise him by flying to meet him there though to be fair it's not that obnoxious of a coincidence as Mills had invited them to come after hearing Lenore's current husband had canceled their family trip to China.During their first full day together in Istanbul Kim gets the idea to let Bryan and Lenore have some alone time in hopes of rekindling their relationship but when they go into town they are followed by the Albanians and despite Mills' best efforts he and Lenore are taken.The entire setup here is forced  really forced. It feels as though every single plot point or detail exists solely to create circumstances in which our main characters can get kidnapped with ample occurrences both inconvenient and convenient to allow for problems and general suspense while also providing enough room for a solution.We already know what Mills is willing to do for his family so his motivation is identical to the first film plus we know he's too skilled to stay kidnapped for long. What's required to compensate for not raising the stakes in terms of both motivation and danger is substantially more creativity and that's where Besson and Kamen really come up dry.There's one scene early on as in once the film gets going early on in which Mills uses Kim to help pinpoint his location in the city instructing her to set off grenades so he can figure out how far away she is by how long it takes for him to hear the blast. It's just a tease that the film might reach its predecessor's level however as the ingenuity never gets any more exciting than that.Director Olivier Megaton a frequent Besson collaborator takes over for Pierre Morel and does nothing to help nor hurt the picture. His style is a bit more frenetic as he heavily edits the action sequences to the point where you don't get more than a second and a half at any one camera angle but that's not a problem so much as the film's failure through and through to prevent the audience's indifference to what's going on. We were given plenty of reason to doubt Mills' success inTaken but this time around we haven't a shred. There's a moment in which we think something might take a surprisingly darker turn but it's over in a flash.The script also attempts to be a bit more themedriven than the first film whether just because or in effort to compensate for its pointlessness. The father of one of the Albanians Mills killed the infamous Marco from Tripoja the main bad guy played by Rade Serbedzija has a few conversations with Mills about taking the lives of family members and when revenge is or isn't justified. It's legitimate notion but a bit out of place we're asked to consider the feelings of the random European thugs who we normally see as killing fodder for our action movies. We don't care if you're someone's son  you're a tattooed meathead who deserves to be offed if for nothing but our amusement.Taken 2 isn't offensively bad just uninspired and unable to make the case for its existence. At 91 minutes it's a harmless exercise in generic action filmmaking aimed at placating the folks who clamored to see more of one man's particular set of skills even if they're the exact same skills applied in a lessthanspectacular manner.Steven CThanks for reading!

	schema:reviewBody "So its a stinker!If you came to see Liam Neeson kicking ass my advice is turn back now and save your money. This is entirely due to the inability to actually see what the heck's going on in all of the films actions sequences and stunt co ordinations. The film looks like it was filmed on the site of a permanent earthquake with a camera dangling by a rope. If you have epilepsy this might be one to avoid considering how quick its been edited. Its almost like director Olivier Megaton said yeah we're going for the subliminal message type look edit it like that And you want anything remotely reminiscent of the first films action? well forget about it because it hasn't been included. What you will be treated to however is a cheap watered down child friendly completely unrealistic trashy knock off 'Rom Com with bullets' B reel sold purely on the title of Taken alone.Huge plot holes dominate the script from start to finish in its purest form its basically an awful rehash of the first film but 1000 times worse placing Maggie Grace Bryan Mills daughter as the heroine trying to rescue her parents from a load of bungling Albanians yes they are literally that bad think of Manuel from Faulty Towers and you have your starting point . Liam Neeson does his best with what he's got but there's only so much you can do with a turd script like this. Unfortunately its so laughable that Neesons character starts to look like a paranoid delusional psychopath that sees kidnappers everywhere. They must have forgotten to include the scene where Neeson gains his super power to spot evil doers just by looking at them but hey that's what happens so get over it!Not only that but did anybody even look at a map before this script was written? Had anybody even been to Turkey or Albania? Clearly its the best location in the world to magically learn how to drive a car because that's what Maggie Grace does! However there's also a dire lack a qualified torturers because no one can do it or interrogate or generally manage to do anything right! Alternatively if you feel like throwing some hand grenades off rooftops without anybody batting an eyelid then this might just be the place for you. Don't worry about the police they'll be to busy driving around in there 1970s bangers they hauled right off the scrap heap where this movie also came from.Unfortunately the worst news is that Taken 3 already seems to be on the horizon. Many of you will be asking 'how...why....who....???' but unfortunately money speaks louder than taste. I imagine the plot will be an all black screen and Liam Neesons voice over Your money has been taken. The horror that it was a 12a should have sent alarm bells ringing before I even bought the ticket alas my money and respect for the film industry is now gone forever. What's even more painful is the fact that Luc Besson is partly responsible for this mess Luc Besson! director and producer of some truly awesome films. Please don't see this film please don't be 'Taken' in".

	schema:reviewBody "In 2008 I enjoyed the film Taken mainly because of Liam Neeson's solid performance which added deepness to the screenplay because of his conviction and intensity I will refrain from mentioning that the TV series 24 was quite popular in that time and Neeson basically played Jack Bauer but on the big screen. Now 4 years later we have Taken 2 which unfortunately is a pathetic action film with an incredibly weak screenplay insipid direction and some of the most boring action scenes I have seen in the last years.Neeson made his best effort in rescuing Taken 2 bringing the seriousness and conviction from an authentic professional actor who trusts in the screenplay...or at least pretends to. For the rest the film is a collection of forced domestic melodrama Kim couldn't obtain her driving license Bryan distrusts of Kim's new boyfriend Lennie has problems with her new husband etc. and confusing action scenes completely lacking of any energy and impact. I was almost falling asleep during the car chase through the narrow streets of Istambul and the fights are edited into microshots of less than a second and as a consequence it was very difficult to notice what was happening.But the worst thing of all is that Taken 2 retroactively harms Taken because the villains are so inept that they make us doubt about the hero's ability. He was maybe just lucky of finding a gang of idiots who leave him alone during long periods of time in order to give him the opportunity to escape kindly allow him to make phone calls while they are having him held at gunpoint and start to endlessly make a monologue when they should be having the revenge they enjoy mentioning so much. As for the violence Taken 2 is strictly PG13 material the main character employs magic bullets which always hit the spot but without shedding a single drop of blood on the opposite the villains employ bullets which inoffensively dissolve through the air or at most only work on walls. In conclusion Taken 2 is an unbearable film whose 90 minutes feel like 180 because of the poor screenplay and director Olivier Megaton's laziness. I liked his previous film Colombiana but he fell so low in Taken 2 that it will be difficult to have any enthusiasm in his future films. In other words save your time and your money and don't watch Taken 2. I just hope that this piece of junk isn't economically successful and we won't have a third part in which Neeson will have to look for the cup of coffee he accidentally left on his car's roof. After Taken 2 I think any foolishness would be viable for producer Luc Besson.".

In fact most of the time he looks like a pompous clown trying to be serious while playing a stupid script. As in a regular cheap movie bad guys are not really bad and are very respectful to the main characters always giving them plenty of time to talk and to run away. What irritates even more is ridiculously large amount of product placement. Save your time and money don't watch this movie in theaters.".

The police cars in the movie were 1980 models and they are now exhibiting in Tofa museum.Our police cars are recent as our buildings.But there is a huge difference between the buildings in the movie and the buildings in stanbul.Director was focused in the old stanbul called Historical Peninsula and in this area there are so many ancient buildings bazaars and mosques. In modern stanbul most of the women does not wear veils as the men in stanbul doesn't have beards like pilgrims.

However I just hated director's point of view about Istanbul and Turkey. In some scenes you see some women wearing pitch black clothes as if they live in a country governed by Islamic rules . No!!! Turkey is not like that!!! Its constitution is more democratic than many 'democratic' countries in the world. And especially women had their rights before many 'democratic' countries in the world. For example Turkish women can vote or can be elected since 1934! Just check the history. You will see Turkish women had such rights before millions of others women living in other countries. But I do not understand why there is not any Turkish women seen in the movie. All the movie was taken in very weird and suburban areas and you do not see any women but the guys. This is not Iran this is Istanbul! I am very sorry about the director's attitude and I did not like it at all. Turkey is a secular democratic and modern country. You can see the people with very modern looking all over the city not ninjas! The people of Turkey do not wear such a pitch black clothes like the people living in an Islamic country. Not only the appearance but also the thoughts are modern and contemporary in Turkey! Why did director say a big lie to the world? Is there a political reason? Should a director act like a horrible politician? I am fed up with seeing such horrible movies hiding the truth! Make movie of what you see not hide the truth! Movie certainly deserves 7 out of 10 but the director does not deserve even 0! I hope my review was useful to correct some mistakeslies about Istanbul...".

The intimacyconnection between the mum dad and daughter seemed ever so fake.Having been to Turkey a number of times i have no idea why they would pretend that Albania borders on to Turkey when it does not. As other reviewers have said the police cars were ancient relics which have been decommissioned for decades... The actors playing Turkish people clearly should have been better researched. I have been to Istanbul a number of times and women appearing headtotoe in a burqa is certainly NOT the norm. Many observant Turkish Muslim women dress in tesettr a headscarves and light coverall topcoat when going out in public. This satisfies the Islamic admonition to modest dress without infringing Turkish law which prohibits religious dress in public places.You may see women in burqa fullbody covering with veil but they will probably be visitors from other countries with a stricter interpretation of Islamic dress traditions. The veil is actually outlawed in Turkey but the law is little enforced and even the wearing of headscarves in secular contexts universities government offices etc. is controversial. The films depiction of Istanbul is VERY far from the true image. European dress styles prevail for sure.Towards the end Lenore the mum falls in and out of consciousness about 15 times. It is completely unrealistic.Kim the daughter who has yet to pass her driving test in the US is suddenly an expert at driving with a gear stick and performs some truly remarkable stunts around the narrowest streets of Istanbul. Again completely unbelievable. Never mind the distance she ran over various roofs and no one stopped her or the fact that she sent a number of grenades exploding in one of the busiest cities and one of the busiest tourist hot spots in the world.Bryan the dad performs his usual fantastic fight scenes and is cool throughout his interactions with the horrible Albanian family who have returned to seek their revenge. The whole thing with the daughters new boyfriend was unnecessary but i did wonder throughout the movie whether he would somehow be linked to the Albanian family... The ending is somewhat predictable but i'll let you discover that on your own. In summary I feel it was very badly researched and was somewhat rushed. The first movie was fantastic and Taken 2 was truly abysmal. Liam Neeson's fight scenes are the only part of the movie worth watching. Oh and visit Istanbul for yourself. It really is a fantastic city.".

But if you want to see action dialogue believable characters and some gritty but realistic mostly violence Taken the first was awesome. If you want to see action dialog some believable characters and some gritty but realistic mostly violence then go back and watch the first Taken movie. You will not find much of any of these in Taken 2. To be fair Taken 2 is not the worst movie that I have seen in the theaters this year. That honor goes to Dark Shadows which is I believe the new standard for disappointment in a film that had great actors great directors and great promise. But wow Taken 2 came close to being as bad. I always indicate May be spoilers in my reviews on IMDb in case I let something slip but I try not to let many details out because regardless of how good or bad the film was I believe that the people involved deserve respect for their efforts and I am willing to admit that I may be wrong in my reviews so I don't want to ruin any surprise. Fortunately with Taken 2 the above warning is not all that necessary. It is an ACTION film. In theory. After about the first half hour things eventually started moving at more than the glacial pace the movie started with and that began with Liam Neeson OMG! knocking on someone's door. Taken 2 wasonce you get past the first half hour or sowildly predictable. A few and very few Luc Bessonstyle fight scenes and one really long car chase. There was one twist where Winnie The Pooh looked down through a hole in the roof and said It puts the honey in the basket or it gets the hose again and that was kind of scary. But wait that didn't happen. That must have been when I nodded off and dreamed that a child's cartoon combined with a bookmovie written more than 20 years ago had more entertainment and action value than Taken 2. The key to a great movie is to have a great opening sequence to bring people in a middle sequence with a great story with great characters dialog action romance etc. and a great endingoften with a twist involving the characters dialog action romance etc. The key to a good movie is to have twoor even one and quarterof these attributes. Taken 2 had well none. Opening sequenceboring. Middle sequencepoorly put together. Endingweak weak weak. I could add another weak and that would almost make for a month that you should avoid wasting your time or money on Taken 2.

Again same story His daughter will be kidnapped and CIA agent will come and get her. I think next one will be in Palestine or some other country that is against Muslims or it might be in Vietnam. Indeed it did not have to involve Muslims there. Muslims are not friends with US and I am so tired of it. I see it in the news and in such freaking movie too And dude was a hero of all times before it was King Kong now it is Liam Neeson. He got couple alcoholic friends who can solve issues and they got connections in Embassies all over the World. Plus I hate it how they show Istanbul police. I been to Istanbul and i have seen how strong and good looking was police in turkey. But in this movie they are riding some old small cars and tripping on the road  Like one of those France cops used to drive in 1960It was funny how Yellow cab in Turkey simply went inside US embassy without any problem. Totally fake.Conclusion I was very disappointed. This actor was one of my favorite  He looked too old and wheww...when he said it   I will be back  or when he said it  I will go and do I was taught to do  or smth like thatmeaning he got trained to kill and he do not know anything else in this world   it was fake disgusting and too old fashioned phrases. It was from Terminator... It was before we used to like it when actor says smth very cool... But these days we expect and like movies to be more humble and to shut your mouth and do the damage. I mean exactly this Keep it gang keep it cool and do not tell us you are trained very very well...And should we think Albanians are such nerds? It looked from their faces they are born killers. And how come they can't shoot even straight Too tired of politics involving movie...I was on the side of Liam and his daughter on Taken 1. But here Taken 2 I was hoping at least the story gonna end with gangs gonna kill Liam.

Its a great film slick fast sets up its own universe rules as just the more realistic side of a James Bond movie and it doesn't break those rules or lapse into total absurdity. Sure Neeson does impossible things but we get that and go along for the ride.Here though something went seriously wrong. The action relocated to Istanbul could have been potentially very interesting and the basic story as shown in the trailers so no spoilers here is that the family of the men he killed in the first film want their revenge. I like this idea that those seemingly meaningless extras whose job it was to basically die in the first film actually have friends and relatives who care about them and want to see Neeson dead. In the world that Taken has set up this is all very plausible and I am sure seemed a great idea on paper. So what happened? The script then becomes riddled with ideas that are beyond dumb and Istanbul is reduced to a minor backdrop and not used to its most effective use and as can be seen from other reviews Turkish people found the film and its depiction a little offensive I am not surprised. Most of the film could have been set almost anywhere except for a couple of wide shots. Characters do and say things that make no logical sense at all and the rules of the Taken universe are constantly broken. Yes we can suspend our disbelief to a point but the film reaches a level of absurdity where your just squealing in your seat that this really is awful. Some of the acting from the supporting cast isn't great either but maybe that's down to the very poor tools Script they were given to work with. The action scenes are dumb and seem devoid of the tension and abrupt impulse that came with the first movie. Such a shame because with a good script I would be quite happy to watch this character in any number of scrapes and I do enjoy a well written and well directed action flick with a good story unfortunately this had none of those elements. If you have to watch it wait for the DVD even if there is an extended cut I fail to see how it will resolve any of the issues here. Wake up Hollywood we really aren't this dumb. So many Producers on one movie  ever heard of 'Too many cooks?'".

	schema:reviewBody "Andrea Marcocci's life takes a tragic turn when family and social problems threaten him with total collapse pushing him further into drinking and farther from his youngest son whose own story unfolds innocently enough even in the midst of a painful adult world. In a configuration which would do Welles proud Pietro Germi not only helms the project with an empathetic directorial eye making use of a fairly 'restless camera' in the process he also pens some meaningful dialogue and narration as well as jumping enthusiastically into the putupon role of the lead character Andrea. Providing the basis for these three main corners of the film's development the overall vision is tightly organized and wellcrafted. There is an evident love for tracking shots which are handled well and with theatrical ease. The viewer is whisked through homes along sidewalks matching the movement of any number of forwardmoving folk. Which is another large aspect of this film there is solid forward momentum  towards death or life one cannot say at any point but the film proceeds there at a confident speed. As a bonus a bittersweet score interacts quite well with what happens onscreen and evenly matches the tone and pace of the film.With echoes of The Bicycle Thief this is a serious but not devastating film offering an emotional look at the workman's Italy in the 1950's. What makes it special is the occasional inspired scene or performance which hints at the greatness lurking just beneath its halfsentimental surface. Of special note are the shifts in focus between the various occupants in the story such as the relationship and stark contrast between the dark goingson and Andrea's young perceptive boy Sandro. Although the child starts the film intrusively enough he quickly becomes an integral and engrossing part of the story taking charge of the narration even and guiding your hand through his family history as much as he interconnects and guides the family in the creation of that history. Certain touches highlight the immense depth he wields yet also the unmarred innocence. He's at once very young and very old very naive and very wise ... a startling character which grounds a great deal of the film.Also of worth is the continual upswing and downswing in mood throughout the film. In one moment it seems like a marriage will be mended the next it seems about to shatter. In one moment a man is drinking his life away when only a short while later his life is immersed in a scene seemingly straight out of the ending of It's A Wonderful Life. And this is where there exists a major separation from the tragic Bicycle Thief as much as life can hit hard and swift so too can it blindside one with blessings forgiveness and hope. Bittersweet though the climax may be it nonetheless imparts a view that some days are indeed diamonds to be cherished while you have them and most days are coal to be weathered as best one can striving for a bright horizon that may not come.

	onyx:emotionText "Andrea Marcocci's life takes a tragic turn when family and social problems threaten him with total collapse pushing him further into drinking and farther from his youngest son whose own story unfolds innocently enough even in the midst of a painful adult world. In a configuration which would do Welles proud Pietro Germi not only helms the project with an empathetic directorial eye making use of a fairly 'restless camera' in the process he also pens some meaningful dialogue and narration as well as jumping enthusiastically into the putupon role of the lead character Andrea. Providing the basis for these three main corners of the film's development the overall vision is tightly organized and wellcrafted. There is an evident love for tracking shots which are handled well and with theatrical ease. The viewer is whisked through homes along sidewalks matching the movement of any number of forwardmoving folk. Which is another large aspect of this film there is solid forward momentum  towards death or life one cannot say at any point but the film proceeds there at a confident speed.

	schema:headline " The disintegration of a family....told semi NeoRealistically.";
	schema:reviewBody "I am pretty sure you could interpret Il Ferroviere Man of Iron or The Railroad Man multiple ways. On the basic level it's about a seemingly average workingclass family who through the course of the film disintegrates. On the other hand I am sure that many seeing the film might see it as an indictment of the hypocrisy of the Italian family. Whether the writer and director intended this to be the case is anyone's guess though I am sure it could easily be seen both ways. Of course the film ALSO could be a story about hope.As I mentioned above the Marcocci family seems pretty ordinary. The father is an engineer for the railroad and two of his children are grown and one is still a small boy. Through the course of the film you learn more and more about the family and ultimately the people within it slowly lose control and the family unit is at stake. First you see that the father drinks a bit too much. Then you learn that he's a bit of a bullywith the old fashioned idea that the father Andrea is the dictator albeit sometimes benevolent in the household. This is actually a pretty 'normal' style of parenting in the day. Not healthy but probably not that unusual. He occasionally slaps around his wife and his kids because to Andrea that is how a father keeps order. But the family has had enough of the control and violence and rebellion begins creeping into the seemingly happy household. Will the family survive and rebuild? Or will the worst happen? I could easily talk more about this but really think you should just see the film.The film is very interesting because it does something very unusual. At times the film shows from the viewpoint of the director who also played Andrea by the waysort of a neutral observer. But the in an odd twist the young child narrates at timesand I really liked this because although he only looked about 7 yearold he was VERY astute and really seemed to have a great understanding of what was happening around him much of the time. So while Pietro Germi directed and starred in the film the one who later ending up upstaging him was the boy Sandrino Edoardo Nevola and this made the film very unusual.Now as for the style of this film I've seen it described as an Italian NeoRealist picture. While some might agree I am not so certain. It's almost like a NeoNeoRealist film. Let me explain. In the 1940s Italian directors like Rosselini and De Sica made some wonderful films about working class people. But just because a film is about these people doesn't make it a NeoRealist film. They also had to be acted exclusively or almost exclusively by nonactors. Perhaps the lead could be an established actor such as Ingrid Bergman in Stromboli but the rest of the cast or nearly all of them should be nonprofessionals in natural settings. However most of the characters in Il Ferroviere had been in other films and were quite experienced. This is NOT a complaintthis IS a good film. But it isn't exactly like the earlier filmsmostly because with the mid1950s Italians who had been in financial ruin since WWII could now afford paid actors and even nice sets if needed! So in essence the NeoRealists stopped making these films because they could afford to make prettier and more polished filmsand the public probably demanded this as well. I am sure this was liberating for the filmmakers but some of these earlier and 'rougher' films were masterpieces such as The Children Are Watching Us and Umberto D. and I really wished they'd continued making them.So what did I think of this notquiteNeoRealist film? Well I loved it and can live with the fact it isn't 'pure' NeoRealism because it is a very well made film. However I need to tell you up front that it started very very slowly and I could see someone losing interest. Stick with this one for many reasons. The acting is great the direction amazing AND the ending is terrificthanks inexplicably to little Sandrino!! I also loved that although some folks seemed bad in this film you COULD understand them and they weren't all badlike most real people. Well worth your time. And so good I even considered giving it a 10...though didn't because I almost never give movies a score that high.By the way in no way is this meant as a criticism but as an American I can't help but notice that in so many old Italian films people seemed so incredibly emotional and loud. This is NOT criticism but I was wondering if this is a true portrait of the people or perhaps a bit of a clich. I honestly don't know and would love your input. I just know that few American families are quite THIS intensely emotionalwhich may or may not be a good thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Il Ferroviere is the story of train engineer Andrea Marcocci and his family in good times and bad seen mostly through the eyes of his youngest son. Marcocci is a lover of wine and song but he is also an obstinate proud man his own worst enemy as he manages to alienate family and coworkers in post war strike prone Italy. The film opens with him in high spirits but he is soon beset by problems which include an unmarried pregnant daughter a deadbeat older son a work accident that ruins his career performing scab labor and a drinking problem.Il Ferroviere is a rather mawkish melodrama with weak neorealist roots. The child's viewpoint and the father's shame echoes The Bicycle Thief but with less of a sense of desperation. Italy is a decade out of the war and well on the road to recovery. The problem is the bellicose sometimes brutal Andrea who brooks no descent or criticism.Looking and acting like Kirk Douglas Director Pietro Germi casts himself as Andrea. He is all bombast and not very effective at modulating his moods. He's all rage and melancholy. It is left up to his forever suffering wife to bring out the good in him. Sure he's beat her but he works hard for his family she reasons. In Patriarchal 1956 Italy this is acceptable behavior and to drive that point home we have a scene where Andrea pummels his pregnant daughter while neighbors listen but do not intervene.I find it ironic that director Germi who brilliantly eviscerated Italy's antiquated marriage laws with the classic comedysatire Divorce Italian Style 61 condones Andrea's family battering by making him an overall sympathetic character. He is quick to be forgiven but his pride won't allow him to be as fast.As a timepiece Il Ferroviere provides some disquieting insights with it's sentimental chauvinism but overall it's little more than a heated family drama with an operatic tone that sounds off key most of the time.".
