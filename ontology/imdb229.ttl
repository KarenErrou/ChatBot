The audience will be in constant anticipation of the couple's next meeting as meddling acquaintances a former schoolmate Edmund Chen a food delivery girl Terri Kwan and pure bad luck conspire to keep the wouldbelovers apart.Meanwhile the leads Takeshi and Gigi share good onscreen chemistry together albeit briefly.

It is a fairy tale for grownups with humour sadness and a bit of slapstick. Lovely Gigi Leung plays her part of Eve Loi the romantic daydreaming and slightly clumsy lover of poetry delightfully and handsome Takeshi Kaneshiro plays the romantic awkward and intensely shy John Liu to perfection. I was glad the corny temptation to resist naming them Adam and Eve was resisted. The symmetry of the parallel events is fun to anticipate and the antisymmetry of the two evil countercharacters adds to the complexity and a foil to the perhaps a bit saccharine sweetness of the main plot and characters The incidental parallel subplot of the avaricious landlords also meeting and exchanging phone numbers in the rain is a nice touch.

Not only faithfully materializing the conception from the poetic illustrations in the book the movie also adds witty dialogs and funny buffoon performance of the supporting roles for the whole story which does not exist in the original. The movie debuted as number 1 in the box offices of Singapore Malaysia Hong Kong and Taiwan. The original book has been sold for more than tens of thousands copies in more than five languages.Personally I like this movie very much as a great love story and fairy tail for the grownups. I believe the movies might be more touching for the Asians especially for the residents in Taipei or Taiwan where I came from and the movie filmed since the whole movie surrounds only one single idea in Chinese as Yuanfen which is deep rooted in Asians' mind and personally I think there is still not a proper vocab for translation. Fate is close but not exact. And the story the people and the scenes are so familiar for me that it just like my neighbor's story.Another reason I might suggest to treat this movie as a fairy tale is that they do have many goofs or things seems not so logical in the movie as described by other users. But who cares? Just like nobody questions why the lion in the wizard of oz is so coward. This is still a great love story and grownup fairy tail for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am normally a fan of Johnnie To and Wai KaFai though lately I have found they forays outside of macho allmale films a bit distressing. Stylized though films such as Chung Fo and PTU were films such as Running on Karma and Turn Left Turn Right can not but make me wonder about if they have any sort of talent outside of the genre made great by the likes of John Woo.The film based on a story by Jimmy a comic book writer of a gloomy variety from Taiwan takes the premise that two people who having met once when they were small are fated to take on lives which parallel each other's. Without giving too much away it follows the typical boy meets girl boy loses girl boy finds girl routine. Fair and well. But the good things I have to say end here.Chip on shoulder warningIt is difficult to take a film seriously when it attempts to portray a violinist who is supposed to be good enough to be hired from Taiwan to work for an orchestra in Vienna when the actor himself can not be bothered to learn to hold a violin properly let alone bowing properly to the music he was supposed to be playing. Equally it is difficult to root for a girl who get scared translating German  horror novels into Chinese when her very job was translation of such texts. Perhaps the use of the Polish poet and her poem served some dramatic purpose which eludes me though I suspect its only purpose was to show how classy and refined our heroin was. But the Chinese translation she kept mumbling on about was so badly done so hard on the ears so devoid of literary artistry that it only served to alienate me the audience rather than giving me the sense of fate and romance that it was supposed to. In short two rather lacking actors playing two unconvincing and rather lacking characters. Apt perhaps. Interesting? No.Then there was the supporting cast. I fail to understand what the script writer and the director thought throwing two comical supporting characters into what should have been a gloomy film shot all in a grey tone would achieve. The moment I laid eyes on them in the midst of what would otherwise have been a delicate and sensitive story about fate and unrequited love I wanted to reach into the screen and slap them silly.Though the premise was interesting the film grew tiring very quickly when every scene has to be repeated almost verbatim once by the other leading character. That was simply a clumsy and sloppy way of showing how their lives parallel each other and was very trying on the audience's patience. Effectively the film could well have been cut into 50 minutes and be done with.Perhaps I should say that the script writer and director should be lauded for their ability to take a perfectly interesting idea and making it uninteresting and taking a cast for whom we would potentially have sympathy for and making them formulaic and laughable.".

But the Chinese translation she kept mumbling on about was so badly done so hard on the ears so devoid of literary artistry that it only served to alienate me the audience rather than giving me the sense of fate and romance that it was supposed to. In short two rather lacking actors playing two unconvincing and rather lacking characters. Apt perhaps. Interesting? No.Then there was the supporting cast. I fail to understand what the script writer and the director thought throwing two comical supporting characters into what should have been a gloomy film shot all in a grey tone would achieve. The moment I laid eyes on them in the midst of what would otherwise have been a delicate and sensitive story about fate and unrequited love I wanted to reach into the screen and slap them silly.Though the premise was interesting the film grew tiring very quickly when every scene has to be repeated almost verbatim once by the other leading character. That was simply a clumsy and sloppy way of showing how their lives parallel each other and was very trying on the audience's patience. Effectively the film could well have been cut into 50 minutes and be done with.Perhaps I should say that the script writer and director should be lauded for their ability to take a perfectly interesting idea and making it uninteresting and taking a cast for whom we would potentially have sympathy for and making them formulaic and laughable.";

And soon to find out he's also the director of this piece. With experience one starts to feel as part of the family of Sam Hul Carl Maka Sylvia Chang why I even was at their wedding ...Again there were cute details that made me laugh out loud. Consider a high security access system that plays TicTacToe and can be cheated with extra hardware. There's a glimpse of that old boy's humor again.The German CinePlus DVD has the English soundtrack for which I'm very grateful the German dub added excess silliness. And if you care to spend another halfhour a very rich set of cut scenes some adding new content to the plot some just outtakes. Silent just with the title music but ample proof how much hard work goes into making such a film  innumerable retries of the fight at the Seine or just the scene in Bond Street which starts at street level and then pans up to a window.I must say I have now acquired the Zuijia Paidang taste and look forward for 4 now ".

King Kong attempts to steal the jewel at the Hong Kong Police Headquarters without his partnerincrime Detective Albert Baldy Au Karl Maka knowing.Like the previous movie the plot is fastpaced and full of adventure. the story has slightly less corny jokes and silly action than the previous movie and incorporates some slick and daring crossculture references like the appearance of James Bond villain actor Richard Kiel and Mission Impossible actor Richard Graves. There are also characters named James Bond and Oddjob in the movie  obvious references to 007 films. King Kong trying to pull off a heist while not betraying his partners is a pretty captivating plot.There is wild action in abundance but still doesn't quite capture the fun of the original film. Still it's worth a watch.Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "The third Mad Mission movie  a very high paced slapstick parody of the James Bond and other spy movies with some Asian influences  is probably my favourite one of the entire series. Some silly toys of the first two movies have disappeared the pace is much higher in this movie because of extremely interesting action scenes like on the Eiffel Tower and the jokes are even funnier than before and add a hilarious slapstick style to the movie for example when Samuel Hui plays Tic Tac Toe with cheats in a high secured area or when Carl Maka gets seduced and cheated in the most ridiculous way possible by his friend and a beautiful woman in a restaurant. A very special gem in this movie are the exotic locations for example in Paris and the appearances of some actors of the James Bond movies like Richard Kiel. Only the later MissionImpossible star Peter Graves is awful and boring in this very entertaining flick filled with action and absurd humour. One can also see that the budget was higher than in the first two movies and most of the action scenes are really well executed.The only negative point is that the quality of the special effects is very low. You can for example easily see strings when Samuel Hui uses his flight machine to escape after a robbery or when he is fighting in the submarine. You can also see that plastic models of ships or planes are used instead of real material. Another negative fact is that the dubbed versions are really awful.But those details and this lack of professionalism doesn't change anything concerning the fact that this movie is still very entertaining over twentyfive years after its creation even if some effects ideas and the story line are very old fashioned but at least in a charming and nostalgic way. I have seen this movie at least four times now and it is still entertaining and memorable in my opinion. So if you are looking for a very funny and high paced parody of the James Bond and other spy movies with some charming characters this movie is the perfect choice for you and it is also a good introduction to the whole Mad Mission universe in my opinion. That's why I can highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes action or comedy movies.".

It is pretty chaotic but that was the point here and this is where the charm of Turtles lays. I see it in a way as a parody of the detective movies with a simple plot a crime happened police is chasing them the criminal is caught. Here we have no crime the whole spying looks a bit surreal until the very end the detectives talk nonsense most of the time the clumsiness of the investigation is hilarious. Many scenes look just random but again this is why they are funny. Dancing hairdresser or the lottery with 'fabulous' prices might not add much to the development of the spy plot but they help to create a great impression of a crazy life the main character is leading. It is the accumulation of the surprising elements and the unexpected that put the smile on my face. You can also find bits parodying teen movies Suzume crush on Katou and their rendezvous years later and once again I could not stop laughing how awkward but how close to real life that was. All in all I think it is really worth giving it a chance just sit back and relax and if you don't expect a highly intellectual film you might love it as I did.".

So when I came across the hilarious online trailer for Turtles Swim Faster Than Expected I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Lucky for me I found a copy with English subtitles and went into it with huge expectations. Little did I know that pretty much all of the funny moments in this film are already shown in the trailer. I could compare the experience to already knowing the punchline to a joke but then having to go through listening to the setup.The biggest problem with the movie is the story or lack thereof. It does have an interesting premise but definitely does not live up to its potential. I was quite disappointed with where the plot was going about half way into the film and the ending was just a mess! The film all too often strays away from the plot and gets down right ridiculous in some instances.I'm glad to say that not all is lost. Juri Ueno's performance was spectacular and her on screen charisma is what makes this film at least somewhat watchable. Yu Aoi was just as charming and adorable as she is in every film but wasn't used nearly enough. I also must comment on the song playing at the end. It was very catchy and put a smile on my face even though the movie as a whole was a big letdown. Don't get me wrong there are some funny parts in the movie but they are few and far between.Overall I'm extremely disappointed even though the movie was still decent. Its more of the fact that it had so much potential and wasted it. An interesting premise  Juri and Yu would seem to be a sure thing but instead the writers went with total absurdity  underdeveloped characters  pointless plot and thought that would somehow work.I give the film 610 but that is largely due to the performances of Juri and Yu.".

Suzume is an ordinary housewife whose husband is away on business when he telephones her all he is interested in is whether she has fed the pet turtle. One day as she is going about her mundane life she spots a tiny advertisement which say that anybody interested in becoming a spy should phone the given number. When she does she finds her life changing in subtle ways having been ordered to act as ordinary as possible while awaiting an assignment she strives to do nothing that might attract attention this is sometimes a little tricky as her friend Kujaku Peacock draws attention where ever she goes! She learns that several people in her town are also employed as spies for an unknown foreign country each striving to go unnoticed to the point that one is famed for his soso ramen even though he could cook it much better.For an impulse buy this was a real treat there were lots of laughs and some fairly surreal humour. Juri Ueno was great as Suzume and Y Aoi was a lot of fun as Kujaku it is a pity her character wasn't in more the rest of the characters were also pretty funny too. The plot was never very realistic but then it was never intended to be which is why it can be forgiven the anticlimactic but very surreal ending.".

The plot never really fully struck home and shone through on the screen.

	schema:headline " A nice little taster for Satoshi Miki's offthewall humour";
	schema:reviewBody "While there's no doubt that its willfully unassuming title will throw off at least a few highminded filmgoers 'Turtles Swim Faster Than Expected' is an accessible and undemanding comedy that showcases director Satoshi Miki's inimitable brand of unconventional humour. Juri Ueno already in her second cinematic lead role at the tender age of 19 plays a bored neglected housewife who chances upon a rather small to put it mildly recruiting poster for spies. Her decision to join a furtive band of gloriously inactive secret agents allows her to gradually regain the sense of initiative and selfworth she once possessed in her student days but had lost along the way.Of course it's not nearly as formulaic or wooden as all that and the movie above all is a vehicle for Miki to flex his comic muscles. There are some lovely moments mostly involving the delightful pairing of Ryo Iwamatsu and Eri Fuse as the husbandandwife team of spies who become Ueno's mentors the restaurant scene is particularly enjoyable and Ueno plays the painfully normal Suzume with a consummate and quiet ease which has informed all her other characters to date. She is clearly a natural actress and coming off the heels of 'Swing Girls' here is another main part that Ueno breathes life into with such understated confidence.Everything however is run through with Miki's discerning eye for the quirky which is more amusing than funny and the movie doesn't quite reach the level of inventive tomfoolery that it clearly aspires to. 'Turtles' is determinedly lowkey lofi and lowmaintenance meaning that for every joke the price is exacted in meandering narrative and lack of focus. Miki also criminally wastes the charming Yu Aoi as Ueno's uninhibited friend a character who drifts in and out of the story and fails to provide the comic momentum that is hinted at.'Turtles' is a fairly enjoyable film in its own right but the main interest for it lies in the fact that much of the cast and indeed style would go on to help create Miki's next project the brilliant TV series 'Jiko Keisatsu Limitation Police'. For those who enjoyed 'Turtles' this comic drama is essential viewing and if the movie left you underwhelmed know that 'Jiko Keisatsu' is a thrilling realization of the potential Miki showed here and you could do a lot worse than checking it out.".

The story screenplay cinematography and direction are all brilliant. While I'm aware that the English dubbing may not totally reflect the dialog it also comes out as hilarious and well done.

In fact there is one hairraising setpiece involving a huge fire lit by a gang of blackclad assassins which is hugely effective and followed by more serious blood and violence which was enough to earn this film an 18 certificate here in the UK. Despite not being the masterpiece I was lead to believe that this was THE PRODIGAL SON is an engaging skilfully made comedydrama which benefits from some great performances.The first belongs to Yuen Biao taking the lead as Leung Chang a young arrogant boy who believes himself to be a kung fu expert when in reality he is little more than a beginner. Biao's credible transform from wouldbe master to lowly student to real master makes for engaging viewing and as for the martial arts Biao has never been better especially in the final battle where he takes on nasty villain Frankie Chan in a duel to the death. THE PRODIGAL SON also boasts a weird eyebrowless turn from Lam ChingYing playing an extremely camp opera singer whose dubbed homosexual voice is the most annoying aspect of the movie who becomes an unwitting mentor to our young learner. Sammo Hung stars in a minor but comedic part as ChingYing's wise brother also a kung fu expert who attempts to teach his comely daughter some of the skills of the art.The direction is strong with Hung admirably holding fast and the film is particularly well photographed. The fight scenes tend to be closelyspaced and both fast and frenetic and thus hugely satisfying. The end result is a lot of fun. Not perhaps one of the most memorable kung fu movies out there but THE PRODIGAL SON still has a lot to offer for martial arts buffs and at least proves that Yuen Biao can hold his own in a film instead of being just another Jackie Chan sidekick.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant authentic old school Kung Fu movie! 710";
	schema:reviewBody "Review This is a classic old school Kung Fu movie with a lot of silly jokes but a dramatic ending. Its about a boy called Leung Chang Biao Yuen who things that he's a Kung Fu master because his friends pay people to take his beatings. When he finally comes across someone who is not willing to fall down he realises that his skills aren't that great and his friends tell him about what they have been doing behind his back. He then seeks training from his opponent who is reluctant on taking him on as his apprentice. After much persuasion he finally teaches him Wing Chun along with his brother who has a different style. When he returns home after some intense training his master gets murdered by a man who wants to challenge all of the Kung Fu masters so he steps up to revenge his teacher and friend. Basically it's the old concept of You Killed My Master which we have seen many times in this genre but I never get bored of it. Although this film is extremely authentic with some great action scenes Sammo Hung's script was quite silly and camp which was a bit weird for films in this genre in the 80's. I did chuckle at a few scenes especially the funny English dubbing and it reminded a lot of when I used to watch Kung Fu movies on VHS. Anyway it's definitely one to have in your collection if your into your old school karate movies and it's one that I will never get bored of. GREAT!RoundUp This movie was directed by Sammo Hung 63 who brought you movies like Project A Wheels  Meals Dragons Forever Moon Warriors Evil Cult Mr. Nice Guy and One Upon A Time in China and America. He's starred in over 160 movies and he's starred in the lead of a successful series called Martial Law which made him a household name around the world. He has a comedic style very much like Jackie Chan who he has starred alongside for many years and he is highly respected in his native country. This movie which has become an all time classic pushed him major stardom in the 80's and his chubby stature proved that you can still pull of some amazing moves no matter what your weight is. He hasn't directed a movie since 1997 but he is still starring in movies like Once Upon A Time in Shanghai and the Last Tycoon. Personally I find his jokes a bit too silly at times like I did in this film but it still worked. Anyway the bonus material on the DVD was as interesting as the movie so it's one worth purchasing.I recommend this movie to people who are into their actioncomedymartial arts movies starring Yuen Biao and Sammo Hung. 710".

This is another movie that many people like but unlike the others I feel it deserves it's attention and even more so because it is a very entertaining movie with great fight scenes comedy dialogue characters and sets! Basically this movie is a winwin firing off on all cylinders my only complaints are that it ended and maybe there are 12 things I would have changed or done differently but overall if you want to watch a good Chinese martial arts film with a great English dub and want to be entertained I say look no further! I just hope you understand some of the jokes in this movie because some are lol funny and others will make you scratch your head but you have to take it all into context and realize that the WHOLE movie is a comedy with great action and a good storyline involved so basically if you see something weird it is SUPPOSED to be that way and it's not that way and it's similar to kungfu hustle in that sense though I would prefer watching this movie if i had to be given one on an island because for me it has more value throughout.".

It takes a major catastrophe to finally convince Leung to accept Biao as his student and teach him kung fu. This training comes in handy later on when Biao exacts some revenge upon the young nobleman who causes the demise of the theatre troop that Leung yeetai works for.The action scenes are very clean and choreographed well. There are some scenes that look sped up but the ones that they left alone at normal speed are excellent. Biao's athleticism is on display at its finest. Lam Ching Ying also fares well. Sammo Hung is almost unrecognizable perhaps because he's 30 years younger in this film and his acrobatic big guy routine is great along with his acting.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Burg Theater made in Austria in 1936 is a fine example of the work of underrated director also writer and actor Willi Forst who at his best had the stylish charming touch of a Lubitsch or Ophuls. The film opens with scenes actually taken in that famous Viennese court theater of a fictitious veteran actor Mitterer Werner Krauss doing Goethe's Faust. Despite his popularity Mitterer leaves the building after and wants to be by himself. Krauss is best known today to film buffs as Caligari in that landmark German silent but had other strong roles such as this.During the play there had been a dissolve up to the peanut gallery where an aspiring actor Josef the young Carl Esmond yearns for such a role. Mitterer in a scene reminiscent of Faust itself sees a young woman Leni in church and is taken with her. She is his tailor's daughter and the girlfriend of the youth we'd just seen. Josef tries out as Romeo in German translation but is interrupted as the elegant BaronessOlga Tschechowa sweeps in. She is known for her jours a Friday salon at which the elite of Vienna's theater scene gather. Leni steals a salon invite the Baroness had sent the aloof Mittererto give Josef an opportunity to advance.When the youth shows instead the guests think Mitterer deliberately gave his invite to another as a snub but the Baroness turns it to her advantage to avoid embarrassment.At this point a nice song written for the film Servus about the special AustroHungarian word for goodbye is performed by the salon pianist and then passed along to different scenes a coffee at the tailor's to which Mitterer and his prompter have been invited and an outdoor cafe. Josef is happy he now has a small role in Don Carlos where Mitterer will play Philip.The youth is described several times as stuermisch ardent but Esmond overdoes it somewhat. The Baroness to whom he expresses thanks finds herself attracted to him setting up a romantic rivalry. It's her he goes to in her period horse drawn carriage after the play leaving Leni to go with the increasingly smitten Mitterer to hear a military band in a coffee garden where two accordionists play Servus at their table.Mitterer thinking he's found happiness now wants to retire. Meanwhile Josef is announced for the part of Ferdinand in Schiller's Kabale Und Liebe leading to a false rumor that he got the role because of a liaison with the Baroness which makes the usually absent Baron husband jealous.The Baron accuses Josef of cheating at cards.There's also an amusing in joke when the prompter played by character actor Hans Moser who was notorious for his mumbled mutterings which even those fluent in German have trouble getting tells the youth to speak more clearly! Meanwhile we see several scenes from the ongoing Don Carlos in which the elderly Krauss as a Spanish king about to be abandoned displays a theatrical dignity worthy of Louis Jouvet or John Barrymore. After the play though he laughs taking off his makeup at the mirror when he sees a ring he'd given the prompter to seal a wedding engagement with Leni has been returned.Josef also has a disappointment when he loses his acting job due to the scandal. In the climax he goes to an upper level to kill himself accidentally drops a charm with Leni's name on it that had brought him luck before and is recognized by the lonely Mitterer in the darkness. The rivals finally meet and Mitterer encourages Josef by reciting lines from famous plays about the beauty of life. As the theme music returns the jaded old actor slips out so the young lovers can reunite.The last scene is the camera moving in to a poster of Faust and we see Mitterer acting it once again as the lovers watch in the upper gallery. As a side note to this review for those who want to learn more about the striking Tschechowa whose closeups here are beautifully lit check out the book on her by military historian Anthony Beevor. Beevor's argument is that the actress though a favorite of Hitler at the time was actually a Soviet spy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Burke and Hare is not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it is not a bad film either or completely deserving of all the panning it got. It is far from talented director John Landis's best film not like Blues Brothers or An American Werewolf in London but it is not his worst either as is the case with Blues Brothers 2000 and Beverly Hills Cop III.Does Burke and Hare completely work? No it doesn't. Is it entertaining? On the most part yes even with the hits and misses. The film to me was never laughoutloud hilarious excepting two or three scenesJessica Hynes's eureka moment inventing funeral parlours being one most of the time it was still amusing. In my view the sight gags were better than the script. The sight gags range from nicely understated such as the pot shots at Wordsworth Lister and Greyfriars Bobby to crass slapstick such as chamber pot contents being dropped on heads. There is even a sex scene that raised a laugh decide for yourself whether it is intentional or not whether it was or not I personally did find it amusing. The scriptthe smart black humour kind varies as well from having a good chuckle raising a smile to where I found myself rather blank faced.John Landis does do a credible job directing. He mixes contemporary innovation and social issue with ease and although he doesn't quite make Burke and Hare the dark smart hilarious homage to Ealing comedy it strived to be or the throwback to American Werewolfthe comedy and horror elements are decent on their own but have mixed results together there is evidence of the effort which is what mattered. The character development is very straight forward that I do agree with but the cast do make an effort to make us empathise with them and I think they succeeded there. The Georgian setting is also convincing the sets are beautifully evoked and I quite liked the costumes and cinematography too.I do think all the cast have done better before but I cannot deny this is a great cast. Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis are a wellmatched double act. They work very well together and both give entertaining performances in the process. I also liked seeing Christopher Lee Ronnie Corbett Paul Whitehousethe scene where he is pushed down the stairs is hilarious and Bill Bailey even if their appearances are rather brief. Isla Fisherthe love story between her and Pegg though is pretty weak and underdeveloped and Jessica Hynes are alluring and do show at least some flair for comedy Hynes actually is very funny and while they should have had more screen time Tom Wilkinson and Tim Curry are suitably antagonistic and compelling. I do agree about the accents being variable I had little problem with Pegg and Serkis and Wilkinson's was convincing Curry just about passes while Fisher's comes and goes and some of the cameos don't quite make it.In conclusion entertaining enough if somewhat hitandmiss. With a longer length perhaps more tighter pacing and some more care on the accents it could have been more. But the direction setting and cast convinced me so I enjoyed it. 710 Bethany Cox".

Isla Fisherthe love story between her and Pegg though is pretty weak and underdeveloped and Jessica Hynes are alluring and do show at least some flair for comedy Hynes actually is very funny and while they should have had more screen time Tom Wilkinson and Tim Curry are suitably antagonistic and compelling. I do agree about the accents being variable I had little problem with Pegg and Serkis and Wilkinson's was convincing Curry just about passes while Fisher's comes and goes and some of the cameos don't quite make it.In conclusion entertaining enough if somewhat hitandmiss. With a longer length perhaps more tighter pacing and some more care on the accents it could have been more. But the direction setting and cast convinced me so I enjoyed it. 710 Bethany Cox";

Although this is the 8th time their story has been brought to the big screen this marks the first time that we see them as two likable lead characters.From a screenplay penned by Nick Moorcroft and Piers Ashworth and directed by the legendary John Landis Burke And Hare harks back to the days of the old Ealing Studios dark comedies like Kind Hearts and Coronets 1949 and The Ladykillers 1955 which director John Landis is very fond of. It looks at the friendship between these two guys and focuses on the idea of who the bad guys really are. The doctors or the killers themselves?

The biggest challenge the story faced was turning two mass murderers into characters you can follow laugh with and have empathy for and I think this film does it really well. As Burke is talked into the business with Hare there's never the slightest feeling that his friend is purposefully leading him down a path to his own downfall unlike the real Hare who gave Burke up in the end to escape a public hanging. Another element of the movie which was enjoyable was seeing so many familiar faces turning up in smaller roles Ronnie Corbett decked out in his red and blue uniform as Captain McLintock Christopher Lee as Old Joseph one of Buke and Hare's early unfortunates and perhaps the most hilarious scene of all is when they push Paul Whitehouse down a flight of stairs!

	schema:reviewBody "It is good to see a John Landis film back on the big screen but i feel he missed a trick or two with this average effort. Firstly for a film set in Scotland i found it odd that the cast was almost entirely English betraying the roots of the story and of the English cast only Tom Wilkinson a splendid actor managed to give a good approximation of a Scots accent.This film felt a bit of a homage to the Hammer films a point made when a certain Hammer Icon makes a cameo appearance i won't name the individual as i don't want to add a spoiler. I am guessing Landis is a Hammer fan and to be fair to him the sets and locations work quite well giving Edinburgh a spooky feel to it. Both Pegg and Serkis are OK in the lead roles and do their best to sound Irish. It was also good to see Jenny Agutter make a brief appearance too especially as she is invariably remembered for appearing in Landis's American Werewolf in London nearly 30 years ago...a nice touch by the director. In fact there seems to be quite a lot of casting British film and TV icons in this film Ronnie Corbett being another so i'm guessing that maybe Simon Pegg or Andy Serkis only agreed to do it if certain British childhood icons of theirs were also given parts.To be honest the Burke and Hare story has been better done before but this film puts a comedic twist on it that doesn't always work. The bad language feels unnecessary for a start and the gore isn't as bad as i thought certainly not on the levels of the Hostel or Saw films...and not even as graphic as the Final Destination franchise. There are some genuine laughs to be had but usually when Pegg and Serkis are on the screen. The story itself also swings back and forth between gruesome and the unexpected romantic angles that may have been intended to show Burke and Hare as committing their crimes for something other than just greed.Basically this is a reasonably graphic horror story with heart and morality that has some good laughs but falls flat in a few areas. The cast give it their best shot and whilst it has an old fashioned feel to it in many ways it is the unnecessary postmodern touches the inconsistent rate at which the comedy comes and the rather odd casting that jarred me. However do keep an eye out for the odd cameo appearance from some famous actors and comedians.".

	schema:reviewBody "The latest release from Ealing Studio brings us nothing but anguish. Here an English production which too brings together the crme da la crme of British comic talent is spearheaded with American director John Landis.

Simon Pegg is awesome dark humor is fun the story is a recognizable classic the history is interesting heck even Tim Curry and Christopher Lee hang around for some moments of awesomeness. Wilkinson and Serkis and Pegg all fit together surprisingly well it's weird how clearly their characters connect with each other.In the end I actually do sort of like the historical and technological references a little more than the silliness and speculation. The story has been done before but the era still feels yet to be explored with a lot more connections shining under the surface. Fascinating to research are things like the parallel developments of photography and autopsy and I love how the movie winks towards modern forensics.Nevertheless as the opening title frame mentions everything is true except what isn'ta pretty common joke in the world of cinema theseadays where pretty much any half heard urban legend can unironically get a based on a true story mention. What is fun in this movie is the fanciful as it is basically another slacker comedy about people who kill people. Can't go wrong with that.It also has some pretty gorgeous shots of Scotland which is great. I was visiting there recently and it was nice to see some of the places I've been on screen. Scotland would be a hard place to shoot because of the commonly gray and drab weather but John Mathieson makes it look good while also delighting in older era muck.PolarisDiB".

	schema:reviewBody "John Landis helms a cinematic release for the first time in over a decade and he returns to his familiar and previously successful hunting ground of the macabre comedy. It's almost 30 years since Landis scared us and entertained us in equal measure in An American Werewolf in London and he returns once more to the UK with this period piece based upon the reallife murderers perhaps the world's first serial killers Burke and Hare. Simon Pegg Burke and Andy Serkis Hare are the eponymous duo stalking 19th century Edinburgh for cadavers to sell to the city's medical school. All they have to do to keep the money rolling in is to keep the bodies coming. With the team behind the two recent St. Trinians movies writing the screenplay I couldn't help but wonder if this might be more farce than frights and that the film would not strike a fine balance between the two in the way that An American Werewolf in London did so brilliantly. And so it was although to even elevate this dross to farce would be too much. Landis keeps well away from providing scares and instead directs a film that reminded me of the awful 1992 attempt to revive Carry On films Carry on Columbus. Burke and Hare is littered with obvious jokes and they all miss rather than hit their marks. It also seems to rely heavily on having famous faces pop up for cameos Christopher Lee Ronnie Corbett Stephan Merchant Reece Shearsmith Bill Bailey Paul Whitehouse Ray Harryhausen the list goes on. Landis even has the gall to include Jenny Agutter and John Woodvine of An American Werewolf in London in a film that simply does not deserve to pay tribute to that previous collaboration. It's not so bad to have plenty of cameos Landis had already done so with much success in The Blues Brothers but only if the material they are involved in is worthy and this certainly is not. It almost seemed as though they hoped that the audience would pay more attention to cameo spotting than the weak script. Based upon these performances Andy Serkis should stick to wearing an all in one gimp suit and being filmed for a CGI character a la King Kong and Gollum. Simon Pegg comes out of this no better and he must surely be hopeful that his stock as the fanboys' fanboy will not be dented by such a dreadful turn. Tom Wilkinson and Tim Curry scrape by purely because their characters are neither interesting nor have much screen time. Isla Fisher and Jessica Hynes even overplay their parts as the love interests of Burke and Hare. It's easy to blame the script. It must have read like a bad pantomime and so was performed like one. There seems to have been no quality control present and any joke thought of was included. Otherwise I would hate to see what did not make it into the final version. The only redeeming features I can think of is that the Edinburgh locations looked good and that it only last for 90 minutes. Landis' best work is over 20 years ago and any chance of a return to that form looks as dead as the cadavers Burke and Hare provided. Go and see Burke and Hare? Over my dead body! My Rating 05".

	schema:reviewBody "In recent times John Landis has somewhat been in the wilderness in delivering feature length films as he has been sticking to TV shows or documentaries with his last film coming out in 1998 but the British produced Burke and Wills was a welcoming return to the comedy sub genre. So another attempt at this infamous story of Edinburgh's most infamous murderers? Where Landis takes a horrific legendary tale of corpse snatching mass murdering and scientific medicine to make a genuinely humorous and fruitful black comedy led by the animated performances of Simon Pegg Andy Serkis Isla Fisher and Tom Wilkinson as Dr Robert Knox. Edinburgh 1825. Burke and Hare are two cohorts looking to make a quid where they discover they're on a gold mine when they come about a dead body which one doctor Knox would pay very well for his work. To come across more the two arrange a series of deadly accidents but while easy at first with the money coming in they begin to realise it's a lot harder to set in motion and soon a downward spiral begins. It's conventional in its laughs and very much has Landis signature touches throughout. From references to cameos and then the visual slapstick gags. Period setting costumes and setdesigns are richly detailed. The at death's door story is sharp and characterised by it's punchy script but it can languish in some wearing subplots that simply go round in circles and you feel it could gone a little more further in its approach of the material. Nonetheless it perfectly captures the inner struggle of right and wrong of one of its protagonist the ironic chain of events that would follow and it's a fun enterprise with the perfectly nailed buddy combination between Pegg and Serkis. Watching these two together scheming were the best moments of the film. While their actions are appalling you can't help but find them appealing. Also costarring is Tim Curry Jessica Hynes who's enthusiasm standsout Michael Smiley Ronnie Corbett and Bill Bailey contributing to the narration as the hangmen. Then you got the likes of Christopher Lee Paul Whitehouse Ray Harryhausen and Jenny Agutter in bit parts.This is thirsty work".

	schema:reviewBody "John Landis' retelling of the true story of the notorious bodysnatchers of the early 18th century supplying fresh bodies for the purposes of medical research sometimes so fresh that the hearts hadn't stopped beating until Burke and Hare made sure they did is a curious movie.The expression which kept going through my head while I was watching it was knockabout comedy. Now I'm not saying that comedy and horror can't happily coexist  Landis' own American Werewolf In London is a case in point  but there is a difference between comedy and knockabout comedy.

Now I'm not saying that comedy and horror can't happily coexist  Landis' own American Werewolf In London is a case in point  but there is a difference between comedy and knockabout comedy.

Because the folks they 'procured' weren't dead when the pair found them. Eventually the two were caught and the rest is history. This horrible series of crimes was the basis for many movies over the yearssome of which changed the details and some of which stuck quite close to the actual events. I've already seen The Body Snatcher Corridors of Blood and The Flesh and the Fiendsand there are several other versions of the story out there to be seen. Of those I've seen clearly The Body Snatcher which is a fictionalized account that was written by Robert Louis Stevenson is the best.In this 2010 film the filmmakers have attempted to do something differentto make a comedy about the events. This is very problematic for two main reasonsit's hard to make a comedy about such grisly things and because the film just isn't very funny. If you are a fan of Pegg's looking for another Hot Fuzz or Sean of the Deadkeep looking. The problem is that the film just plays it all too straight and isn't wild or crazy enough to make the whole thing darkly funny such as how they handled this sort of thing in Sweeney Todd. As a result the characters are unlikable and flat.If you can ignore the fact that the film is not especially enjoyable you can at least appreciate the look of the film. It looks very 1820sexcept when they talk about photographing the corpses as photography wasn't even invented until a decade LATER!!! Also if you do watch look for the least romantic sex scene ever filmed.".

Which is the main reason I found this limp lame attempt at black comedy horror such a clunking disappointment.Burke and Hare just isn't funny. Neither is it properly 'black' or scary. What it is is boring and offensive in roughly equal measure  the former of which is quite an achievement considering the sensational subject matter. The real Burke and Hare were by all accounts two of the most unpleasant characters you'd ever hope not to meet. They murdered 17 people many of whom were old or infirm for money. And I for one fail to see the humour in that.Don't get me wrong. I love a good horror comedy. I can handle as many buckets of Kensington gore as the makeup man can mix up. My personal list of favourite horror comedies would include Brain Dead Basket Case Reanimator The Evil Dead Shaun of the Dead Theatre of Blood and Dr Terror's House of Horrors. But all those movies had wit style and characterisation  elements sadly lacking in Burke and Hare.Now there have been lots of films about reallife serial killers some good some bad some terrible. But I'm honestly struggling to think of a single one where the filmmakers actually held up the murders and their victims as objects of ridicule played their deaths for cheap laughs or no laughs in this case. Just because Burke and Hare's crimes were committed a long time ago doesn't make them legitimate subjects for comedy in my opinion.True the movie boasts a fabulous cast. But as plenty of other reviewers have pointed out they're all decidedly unScottish and most of them are given nothing to say or do that makes you want to watch them. Or worse make you care a jot about what happens to them. What Landis has forgotten and his writers sadly never seem to have known in the first place is that comedy even  especially in fact  black comedy requires empathy from the viewer to be successful. The reason that we come away from Withnail and I feeling both elated and dejected is because we've really gotten to know those two outofwork actors and when they part by the bedraggled wolves in rainy Regents Park at the end well it's heartbreaking.I can't tell you how I felt at the end of Burke and Hare because my wife and I switched over less than half way through and watched Million Pound Drop Live instead.

	schema:reviewBody "I had the pleasure to see this remarkable and inspiring film screen at SXSW Film Festival in Austin TX. The film is truly unusual and unique. It is the type of film that leads you to appreciate the freedoms that Americans take for granted. However flawed journalism is in the United States our first amendment allows journalists to report freely. In Burma journalism is a crime and those who report the truth are risking their lives to bring the story of their country's repressive regime to the rest of the world. Burma VJ is the story of the efforts of a remarkable group of Burmese photojournalists  with the Democratic Voice of Burma DVB  who secretly videotape during the failed Sept 2007 uprising against the Burmese military regime. The bravery of the journalists who attempt to report these events and the monks who led the rebellion against the military is humbling and the videos they take are mesmerizing.Sadly these events made headlines for a few days in 2007 and then the world promptly forgot about Burma yet again. It remains today one of the most isolated and forgotten places on Earth. Its regime remains one of the most repressive in the world perhaps only behind that of North Korea. This film is a cry for the world not to forget the ongoing tragedy of Burma. The story almost tells itself as it gives us the chance to bear witness to the crimes against humanity committed by the military junta. Of course the video quality of recordings on small hidden cameras sometimes leaves something to be desired but their very shakiness reflects narrowness of the link connecting us back to suffering of the Burmese.This film is testament to the Burmese struggle and it should be viewed by all those who believe that all humans deserve the right to live in freedom. It is a beautiful eloquent testimony to the human desire to be free and I hope many people watch and rally to the support of the longsuffering people of Burma. Their story deserves to be told and Burma VJ is an unforgettable film of human courage.".

The bravery of the journalists who attempt to report these events and the monks who led the rebellion against the military is humbling and the videos they take are mesmerizing.Sadly these events made headlines for a few days in 2007 and then the world promptly forgot about Burma yet again. It remains today one of the most isolated and forgotten places on Earth. Its regime remains one of the most repressive in the world perhaps only behind that of North Korea. This film is a cry for the world not to forget the ongoing tragedy of Burma. The story almost tells itself as it gives us the chance to bear witness to the crimes against humanity committed by the military junta. Of course the video quality of recordings on small hidden cameras sometimes leaves something to be desired but their very shakiness reflects narrowness of the link connecting us back to suffering of the Burmese.This film is testament to the Burmese struggle and it should be viewed by all those who believe that all humans deserve the right to live in freedom. It is a beautiful eloquent testimony to the human desire to be free and I hope many people watch and rally to the support of the longsuffering people of Burma. Their story deserves to be told and Burma VJ is an unforgettable film of human courage.";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Burma VJ";
	schema:reviewBody "To create that sense of realism tension and excitement even the fad nowadays is for filmmakers to employ the use of the nauseainducing shaky cam. For the multiple independent video journalists in Burma documenting instances of oppression and suppression crying for the attention of the outside world it's not a technique used for vanity or stylistic reasons but one stemming from sheer necessity. One can imagine if one is caught with a video camera recording street arrests and such where the penalty would likely be endless interrogation to put it mildly and probably being conveniently forgotten.Joshua and his crew from DVB  Democratic Voice of Burma  a group of clandestine journalists operating from within Burma had plenty of footage that they manage to smuggle out of the country either through online means or trusted couriers where news networks had used to tell of the plight of street protesters in September 2007. Utilizing small consumer cameras hidden in bags and whisked in and out for clips lasting seconds you can feel that real sense of danger that these folks go through just to get actual ground conditions to the outside world.Director Anders stergaard had assembled various clips from that fateful event where the monks took to the streets which for days an unexpected nonresponse from the military government provided that spark of optimism that change was coming. For those familiar with the aftermath from that affair watching this on hindsight made one feel a little saddened even because we know what would be coming up next. With some moments re enacted and spliced together with actual footages Burma VJ became a riveting documentary where the draw is having to become a witness to what's happening on the ground being in stark contrast to official state media's interpretation and perhaps to think about how an event as this one shouldn't be allowed to just fade away.And the footages are nothing short of amazing astounding and shocking even. There was a progression of sorts technically probably stemming from collective courage of the masses where temporal pointandshoot strategies gave way to lengthy unflinching recordings. From the journalists' first hand accounts as seen through their viewfinders we take to the streets with them in a people power movement even going right up to the villa where Aung San Suu Kyi was held under house arrest appearing to greet the monks. We also get a sense of how the military's strength in numbers were called upon to cordon off areas and provided a standoff with their weapons locked and loaded and executions at point blank were all caught on camera from grainy digital zooming of lens watching from afar.In some ways the film progressed as per how the movement gained momentum in a slow brew of relatively smaller demonstrations to a frenetic charge toward large masses before night time raids and arrests of the protesting monks led to a systematic fizzling of drive and ultimate dispersal and the flight for cover as the DVB journalists had to lay low following crackdown by the secret police. For the superstitious as the military junta is touted to be there's a quick mention of Typhoon Nargis too which I recall when it struck had many tongues wagging that it was a celestial response to what was done to the monks here in a scene that I've never seen a lifeless body floating on a river with a cracked skull.Burma VJ is a powerful documentary and I do urge anyone who has the chance to watch this to give it a go.".

But this absorbing documentary tells the story of a sadly failed revolt that took place in 2007 as well as the story of those who reported it in defiance of the authorities. And it's a shocking film to see if the monks protest against the government the government has no qualms about killing the monks. When the army for whatever reason refused to break ranks with its generals the revolution was doomed fundamentally noone want to die. The generals' propaganda would almost be funny if it wasn't backed up by the utter willingness to use lethal force even in the face of peaceful protest.

They work as a network but rarely meet communicating using mobile phones and internet chatrooms and frequently putting themselves at great personal risk. Being captured could mean death with our narrator known as 'Joshua' having his footage wiped early on by secret police and being forced into exile. Clever reconstructions of Joshua receiving updates on a new uprising now known as the Saffron Revolution led by the Buddhist monks forms a tense narrative.The footage captured by the DVB is astonishing with the action taking place right before your eyes. It is also at times incredibly intimate. Early on the monks distrust the DVB suspecting they are secret police. When the cameramen are attacked by plainclothes military the monks protect them and trust is immediately solidified. You are instantly swept up by the protesters elation and feel their incredible sense of hope so it's absolutely shattering to see it all torn away. Director Anders Ostergaard weaves the footage together expertly and the film is wholly deserving of its Best Documentary nomination at the Academy Awards in 2010 and probably deserved to win.

They were not teabaggers but people willing to die for freedom.";

Like such documentaries as The Square and Karama Has No Walls it consists of some amateur filmmakers risking their lives to record efforts to bring democracy to their nations by standing up to the thugs running the government. Unfortunately while all these are very brave films the Oscar folks have nominated them and yet DIDN'T give them the Oscars. Lesson learnedsuch films often seem to get nominated but also seldom win.This particular film is about the freedom movement in Myanmar Burma in 2007. After 19 years of being led by a repressive military junta a mass movement of monks and the public took to the streets to protest. Unfortunately the government didn't seem to have much problem with arresting and killing these people. Footage of the repressive soldiers doing awful things were secreted out of the country and the film is made up of this footage. The footage is quite interesting. The film's narration however seems very impromptu and could be better and less rambling. It could also have used a bit of editing to tighten up the film a bit. Still it's an exciting film and one that is worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " A catandmouse game ... but with a real dangerous cat this time !";
	schema:reviewBody "Never touch the cage. You're locked in a house together with your autistic brother who is hard to handle and you are attacked by an intruder and a catandmouse game starts. In this film Burning Bright they have taken the cat part quite literally because it's not some kind of escaped psychopathic madman who loves charming goodlooking women for breakfast but a fullgrown tiger who hasn't eaten for already two weeks. The only thing Kelly needs to take care of is to stay away from the tiger's claw's.An original idea for a movie. I can't remember that it was already used in another film. That's the only thing that's original in this film the tiger because the rest is so predictable. It's an exciting Saturday night movie which is pleasant to look at and not only because of the beautiful Briana Evigan.Kelly Taylor Briana Evignan is about to go to college and wants to place her autistic brother Tom Charlie Tahan in a special home. When she can't pay the bill she is forced to take him back with her again and return to her stepfather Johnny Gaveneau Garret Dillahunt to find out where the money went. It appears that the stepfather bought a tiger for his wildlife park that he would like to open shortly. Kelly and Tom's mother apparently committed suicide in the past after which Kelly was solely responsible for the education of Tom. And then they end up in the home of her stepfather which is hermetically sealed with wooden boards because of the oncoming storm along with the hungry tiger.Revealing more is a bit absurd otherwise there's nothing left to look forward to. It's evident that a hell of a manhunt between predator and humans is the result. It becomes an unnerving game between the two in which Kelly uses all her talents she has developed those skills during her membership at the local scouts as they organized farreaching survival games I guess while keeping her brother under control. He doesn't want to be touched otherwise he starts yelling hysterical which in given the circumstances is not advisable  and when he's hungry he starts screaming for food resolutely and after a while again louder and louder. Again not recommended. The motivation to carry out this plan of them trapped with the tiger is one that we have already seen in hundreds of movies. The final denouement was not very original. And the corny closing was also one to frame along all the well known corny moments out of the film world.The acting itself isn't that bad. Meatloaf was introduced as a surprise act at the beginning of the film as the seller of the tiger. I didn't recognize him immediately because he's quite shrunk in volume. Garret Dillahunt 12 Years a Slave Looper has a limited role as a future owner of a park and as cruel stepfather. Briana Evignan is really a picture and a female version of John McClane. For me the best fragment was the exciting moment when she tries to escape through the dirty laundry shaft. Charlie Tahan Ethan from I am Legend began to get on my nerves with his autistic behavior but for someone of his age I thought it was top acting at times. However the great stars of the film were Katie Kismet and Schicka the three tigers that were used.Beside some silly flaws it was an enjoyable movie. I found it odd that in one moment an oak door wasn't an obstacle for the tiger and it broke in two with some hard whacks from the tiger. But some wooden boards of a closet apparently were more resistant to this animal force. And I would have rammed that sharp object right into his eye for sure.A typical clich story with quite some excitement. Good for a rainy Sunday afternoon!

	schema:reviewBody "Burning Bright is a horrific gem. One of those films where you ask yourself why wasn't this released in theaters? That is exactly what I was wondering while watching. I felt my heart beating throughout the 50 minute action sequence. The premise will immediately catch your attention a young women and her autistic brother are trapped in a house with a hungry tiger during a hurricane. The house is barricaded. How did the tiger get into the house? Will they survive? It's surprising the amount of things occurring throughout and it's a nice change from almost every onedimensional horror films nowadays. It is also extremely believable this can happen to anyone of us. If you thought Freddy Kruger was scary try taking on this tiger. It's unfortunate that it was never credited because the tiger is the star of the film. Briana Evigan also gives a terrific performance as the hot women in trouble and fits this film perfectly. There are no real flaws in Burning Bright. It is quiet perfect of how to make a suspenseful thriller. It's a thriller that actually thrills. It goes the extra mile making sure your heart is pounding out of you chest at every moment. A couple of scenes are simply unforgettable. Burning Bright is a bright light for every inspiring filmmaker out there. It doesn't matter if your film gets the attention it deserves someone will notice and appreciate the work that was done. The filmmakers know how to make a great film. They didn't just think of the good plot they also spent time perfecting it and it's noticeable. Burning Bright was never released in theaters and frankly it should have been. It's one of the most thrilling films I have seen in years. The suspense will eat you alive.".

I don't know how the tiger scenes were done but they are more than satisfying in few scenes even buzzed me out of my bed.

Two people a girl and her younger autistic brotherare trapped in a house with a tiger Awesome. The tiger is there because their stepfather wants to start a safari park so he bought a tiger. Guess who he bought it from Meatloaf Awesome. The Tiger is real for the vast majority of the time Awesome. The movie is very well filmed and acted. The plot though ridiculous is still believable sort of Awesome. If your a Briana Evigan fan you'll love it. She spends nearly the entire movie in her underwear and at one point is soaking wet. Awesome. The effects look good. Barring one point where they look decidedly dodgy. But not to the point where your saying oh my that looked dreadful. No you'll be saying haha did you see that. That was brilliant. Awesome. The only way you wont enjoy this film is if you're some kind of movie snob or a robot. I'm sure even snobs and robots need to switch their brains of and just enjoy some mindless entertainment every now and then. So do just that and you'll enjoy yourself. 8 out of 10. Awesome.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had absolutely no idea what to expect of this movie which has a rather odd title that has nothing to do with its weird plot. After the death of her mother Kelly is the only person who can take care of her young autistic brother but she has tough decisions to make as she is also contemplating college as an option. When she takes her brother to their stepfather's house to discuss money matters. Things are hectic as a hurricane is on the way and the house is being boarded. He informs her that whatever money their mother had left he has used to buy a tiger for his next project turning this property into a safari park. Later Kelly wakes up to find out the stepfather's gone she and her young brothers have been boarded in the house and the tiger has been left loose inside...Yup... this is actually the premise of this film. It stretches believability in so many respect that it detracts a little but the actual film is rather entertaining once you get past that. For much of the remainder of Burning Bright it's all about Kelly trying to survive in this house evade this huge tiger... and of course do all that while having to care for Tom. Briana Evigan is really great as Kelly. She does well portraying a caring older sister she definitely has charisma on screen and she adds a certain physicality that is vital to the action taking place as she has to crawl climb twist and run in several scenes. It doesn't hurt that she is easy on the eye and spends most of the film scantily clad but really I see legitimate actress talent there and her deep voice coupled with her looks reminds somewhat of a mix of Demi Moore and Jodie Foster. I had no idea who she was never seen her previous mainstream credits which are impressive in some way but she is definitely the number 1 reason to watch. Christine Coyle Johnson and Julie Prendiville Roux have penned a story that has some heart but has obvious plot holes that Il will not reveal to avoid spoiling things. I think it is admirable how autism doesn't take a complete backseat in the story. It's not just a cheap plot device and there is an attempt to address this while still keeping this an action thriller. Director Carlos Brooks is able to walk the fine line too.Without a doubt the star of the film for many will be the tiger. Everybody knows cats of any kinds are somewhat difficult to train and are considered dangerous at all times. Most of the scenes in this movie do a decent job at making us believe the tiger IS in the house WITH our actors but some technical shortcuts had to be taken. Brooks wisely elect to use a real tiger and has little CGI as possible but few scenes show any interaction between the tiger and its potential preys. The result is still a very organic film with some stunning scenes featuring our big cat one in particular where he licks sweat off the floor was memorable to me. Credit to the filmmaker this is an old school movie featuring a live animal some character development in what is otherwise a by the book action thriller. Bonus points for having actor Garret Dillahunt play the creepy stepfather. One more creepy role for this fascinating actor. The whole thing plays out like a mix between a wild animal movie such as The Edge 1997 and claustrophobic thrillers like Panic Room 2002.Are there plot holes? Yes. Could this have gone to theatres? Probably not. But if your expectations are low you love tigers and enjoy decent thrillers you will probably find this entertaining enough. I also want to command the producers for providing information regarding autism and also regarding the possible extinction of tigers we are facing during the end credits. If only one person goes to those websites and find information then the movie will have done more than its job as far as I'm concerned.".

This comes down to the actors themselves and a decent script from which the director did get a few nice scenes out from. Those scenes are really well shot and executed. Nice framing and editing as well. You can watch it once and it will do it's job even if you start thinking about the things that just seem to happen conveniently.There are logical errors and you might argue that the moral is a bit too much but then again this could also be called nitpicking. Can you oversee those obvious flaws and enjoy it as little movie that could? If so rent it and watch it".

This comes down to the actors themselves and a decent script from which the director did get a few nice scenes out from. Those scenes are really well shot and executed. Nice framing and editing as well. You can watch it once and it will do it's job even if you start thinking about the things that just seem to happen conveniently.There are logical errors and you might argue that the moral is a bit too much but then again this could also be called nitpicking. Can you oversee those obvious flaws and enjoy it as little movie that could? If so rent it and watch it";

Some of the scenes in the house are incredibly tense and the director is to be applauded for that in a genre where most things have been done before. Although it's a film with a modest budget it is well made and professional. The acting is mainly just average apart from a believable and spirited performance from the lead actress Brianna Evigan. I liked the ending of the film which thankfully didn't undo all the previous good work. Burning Bright is an intelligent tense and highly enjoyable film that is a cut above many of it's higher budgeted rivals. Better than it's current rating of 5.9 would suggest. Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quid Pro Quo director Carlos Brooks and An American Girl Chrissa Stands Strong scenarists Christine Coyle Johnson and Julie Prendiville Roux have whipped up a genuinely suspenseful little claustrophobic thriller about murder and mayhem that relies less on CGI and more on the real thing. An idealistic twentysomething college student and her autistic little brother find themselves trapped in a house that has been boarded up for a hurricane with a ravenous Bengal tiger that hasn't been fed in two weeks. Brooks and his writers have done a splendid job setting up the predicament that confronts our heroine and they play everything straight down the line. The exposition about the tiger and his lust for human flesh is established early on when the guy who is selling it informs the buyer that the cat is downright vicious. This fellow tells the new owner that the animal leaped a 16foot high cage and ate a horse while everybody else in the circus fled. He warns the new owner not to put his hand on the cage. Later after he has bought the beast and driven it back to his home he warns the workmen there who have to board up the house not to touch the cat. Inevitably somebody ignores him and the cat bites a guy's hand so badly that the fellow has to go to the hospital to keep from losing a finger. Shrewdly Brooks and company confine the bulk of this nimble 86 minute epic to the interior of an ordinary twostory house. Meantime the sympathetic heroine has been struggling to find someplace to take care of her little brother. Eventually when she does she learns that the evil stepfather has drawn every last cent out of the bank account. Kelly Taylor Briana Evigan of Step Up 2 The Streets brings her brother Tom Taylor Charlie Tahan of Nights in Rodanthe who is afflicted with autism to the house. Calculating Johnny Gaveneau Garret Dillahunt of Last House on the Left has bought a dangerous maneating tiger and takes it to his house where Kelly and Tom are awaiting him. Before Johnny leaves he turns the tiger loose to roam the premises while he bellies up to a bar for a beer or two. Kelly and Tom wind up playing a game of cat and mouse with the tiger and Brooks does a splendid job of setting up the situation. Little Tom is a walking and talking story complication. Of course Kelly leaves her cell phone where the cat is. Later when she has enough time to get onto a computer to send out a distress call the computer doesn't work because it cannot locate the server. Burning Bright is a lowbudget but entertaining nailbiter that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This tense whiteknuckled thriller delivers good performances and tensionclinching action. Undoubtedly the best scene occurs when our heroine takes refuge from the growling tiger in a laundry chute. Literally she has to squeeze herself up the chute and the tension that comes from maintaining her impossible position while the curious tiger wanders around the room is superb. Eventually she drips a drop of perspiration and the tiger licks it off the carpet and looks up at her with a glint in its eyes. Suddenly the tiger lunges up the chute and our heroine is put to the ultimate test of scrambling up the slick interior of the chute to the door upstairs while the tiger claws against her the chute. The filmmakers derived their title from British author William Blake's poem The Tyger published in 1794.".

Terminator TV actor Garret Dillahunt gives a limited performance as the Stepfather who purchases a Circus Tiger from Howie played by Meat Loaf who can't wait get rid of the animal.

Novice Carlos Brooks direction is effective enough however the Tiger never comes across as menacing. The animals trainers clearly don't want to bring out the Tiger's nasty instinctive streak and he ends up looking like a Tony Tiger of Frosties cereal adverts.For most Evigan's in shorts and a vest top climbing bare foot up laundry pipes and jogging though out the film maybe enough to keep your interest. On the other hand some may find how she handles her demanding autistic brother and the Tiger itself fascinating. It's a film with big ideas but a small budget let down by the ludicrous set up of how the Tiger gets to the house and the elaborate reasoning why he's been let loose. Should the tiger had just escaped from a Circus truck in a storm and gets into the house it would have given the story some credibility and weight. Less in this case would have been more. Still it's because of it cinematic look and feel the weirdly titled and bizarre story inexplicably keeps you watching until the end.".

For conflict reasons the protagonist's brother is autistic. Now autistic people consider routines important but in my experience they kinda pout when something throws off their routine maybe not even that. Shouting and screaming seems doubtful. Autistic people are impaired in communications ability and social behavior they're not incapable of understanding if their lives are in jeopardy. Yet said brother makes an awful lot of noise for someone in danger.It's really unfortunately there's no commentary because whether or not this character was based on an actual autistic unlikely but maybe... is kinda important.

	schema:reviewBody "Trapped together during a vicious hurricane a woman must protect her autistic younger brother from the vicious maneating tiger her stepfather illegally bought in the house with them.Overall this one wasn't all that bad but definitely wasn't all that great either. What really tends to work for this one is the fact that there's some admittedly chilling stalking going on here as this one really manages to exploit its main premise quite nicely. The fact of getting the early scenes of the creature attacking the different workers and its backstory give off a quite effective reasoning here for the terror of the creature and it manages to really work these quite nicely once it's loose in the house as there's a lot of genuine tension here of the monstrous beast walking around oblivious to the family members who leave just as it enters or trying to pass by undetected while attempting to do something else. This stalking here gives these scenes from the attack in the laundry room while trying to dial here which it traps her in the vent shaft leading out of the room upstairs and the stalking in the bedrooms trapping them under the bed makes for some thrilling action to go along with the thrilling stalking. Moreover downstairs is just as much fun with the fine encounter in the kitchen and a big chase through the house trying to lead it away from her brother trapped in a closet that has been opened rather nicely which is pretty terrifying and makes for quite an impressive enough sequence. As all of these are done by the use of a reallive tiger for the actions it gives this a much stronger sense of realism that impacts the film greatly but it's still not all that great as there's some individual problems that do creep up here. The main thing really holding this one back is the central premise which not only doesn't seem usable in a fulllength feature film but doesn't provide all that it could've been used for here. This one here is basically only useful for generating means of keeping the two out of harm's way in order to keep the tiger with viable targets to hunt and that wears thin quite easily with the fact that it spends the entire time forcing that issue and really sapping the suspense that could've been generated from these incidents. Likewise the fact that the brother is autistic doesn't do this many favors since it's more of a gimmick than anything else to bring about another challenge to get over as whether or not his antics will bring about them getting caught or not and they get annoying enough to the point of hoping the tiger gets him anyway in hopes of just ending it. This also brings about the film's other big flaw in the lack of a big body count here as there's only three main characters here and the chance for really letting loose with a graphic bodycount filled creature feature isn't possible with what's attempted here. Otherwise this one wasn't all that bad.Rated R Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.".

As all of these are done by the use of a reallive tiger for the actions it gives this a much stronger sense of realism that impacts the film greatly but it's still not all that great as there's some individual problems that do creep up here. The main thing really holding this one back is the central premise which not only doesn't seem usable in a fulllength feature film but doesn't provide all that it could've been used for here. This one here is basically only useful for generating means of keeping the two out of harm's way in order to keep the tiger with viable targets to hunt and that wears thin quite easily with the fact that it spends the entire time forcing that issue and really sapping the suspense that could've been generated from these incidents. Likewise the fact that the brother is autistic doesn't do this many favors since it's more of a gimmick than anything else to bring about another challenge to get over as whether or not his antics will bring about them getting caught or not and they get annoying enough to the point of hoping the tiger gets him anyway in hopes of just ending it. This also brings about the film's other big flaw in the lack of a big body count here as there's only three main characters here and the chance for really letting loose with a graphic bodycount filled creature feature isn't possible with what's attempted here. Otherwise this one wasn't all that bad.Rated R Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.";

So as it happens the inheritance is tied up to the kids..but they don't know about it yet.The film starts by the heroine trying to put her autistic brother into a special school and the cheque bouncing because her stepfather has spent all the money on a tiger as he is converting their home into a safari park??? as you can see the grasp of reality gets lost early on. This bit of the story which took fifteen minutes to evolve now gets scrapped as the stepfather who happens to be having their home boarded in lieu of a hurricane that's heading their way.He uses this as an ideal opportunity to board up the front door while the two children are in there just after releasing the lion which we are repeatedly told has been starved for two weeks to let him know who is master??we then spend the next hour watching Briana Evigan who is not too sore on the eyes dressed only in her knickers and vest peering around cupboard doors to the point it gets ridiculous.Quite often she leaves behind her younger autistic brother which I would think most grown ups would not do at any point only to return in concern for his safety. Later in her journeys she finds a gun a knife five bullets some sort of bar meat and drugs or drugged meat but seems unable at any point to make any good use of them to either open a door or kill or even injure the tiger.

Somehow studded walls locked doors and glass partitions were no match for our Tony the tiger however a chest freezer is an impenetrable fortress which despite warnings on air supply she spent the night in with her brother and a lit lighter.The next morning stepfather arrives unscrews the front door presumably with the intention of being shocked to find their mauled mutilated bodies which he was going to somehow explain away as accident this bizarre happening but instead of finding that he finds all three alive and well...hey but you wont be surprised to find out that in a shock twist of events guess who gets their just deserts as suddenly...yeah you guessed it.".

The film is more cautious about showing footage of the tiger and it's for the better. Not that the tiger isn't convincingly menacing but you know...'Jaws'.It's a pretty basic flick even though it has a not too gripping 40 minutes to set up the convincingenough situation that involves Meat Loaf as the seller of the tiger in the opening scene and who sets up the tiger as the most viciously intelligent beast the world has ever seen by telling a story about how the tiger killed people and a horse at a circus.When the autistic boy was introduced who started screaming and hitting his own head merely because he got touched on his arm by his sister alarm bells went off. That boy trapped in a house with a tiger? Well this is going to be an excruciating experience. Astonishingly enough it turned out to be bearable even though in one scene he sits down at the kitchen table and yells WANT EAT! WANT EAT NOW! while his sister fights for them to stay alive with a roaming about tiger in the house.Overall it's a fun enough time with a few nicely played jump scares and one standout sequence in which Sweat Girl grabs onto her wet life in a slippery pipe that leads from the ceiling up to the next floor. When one of her precious sweat drops hits the floor the lucky beast licks it up discovers her in the pipe and reaches for the stressed steamy meat so with all her might she tries to climb up to reach the opening before the tiger reaches her wet ass.

A real tiger was used for this film and there are some very tense scenes between that and the lead actress. And it's a freaking scary looking man eating tiger! It's an interesting premise for a film and it kept me entertained the whole way through with it just being set in the house.

I never put much hope into a comedy because so often they either aren't funny at all or put every joke in the preview. However I figured it deserved a chance considering my love of Olivia Wilde especially but also the other big names like Hugh Jackman Jennifer Garner Ashley Greene and so on. Now be warned this is not the movie to watch if you expect to take anything seriously. That isn't to say it's a comedy about people doing stupid things and being immature quite the opposite but everything is taken in exaggeration. After all it is a movie about sculpting butter so don't expect some pulse pounding drama.That being said if you have a good sense of humour and want to laugh then this is the movie to watch. The acting was amazing from everybody Garner gave me chills when angry Wilde had me in tears from laughing and Yara Shahidi was unexpectedly amazing in her role as the young foster child. I absolutely recommend it.".

	schema:headline " A delightfully funny satire";
	schema:reviewBody "Butter is a delightful little comedy that has most of its best jokes in the trailer but still manages to make you smile throughout. It is set around a 'Mastery in Butter Sculpting' competition which is very popular in Iowa. I just found out the competition has been a staple event at the Iowa State Fair for close to a century. Veteran sculptor Bob Pickler wants out but his much feared wife Laura is in no mood to give up just yet. There's a new kid in town with a knack for sculpting and more trouble arrives in the Pickler household in the form of a stripper. What follows is a surprisingly entertaining hour of satirical humor leading to a mushy climax. Destiny is a foster child who lives out of a suitcase in all her homes in the hope that her real mother would turn up. She is unbelievably good at things and doesn't give herself any credit for it. Her latest foster parents are quite surprised when she decides to take up a traditionally redneck vocation. Rob Corddry and Alicia Silverstone play her immensely likable foster parents who suddenly add a warmth to the film making it even more palatable. As a political satire the film pits a typically Godloving semi racist conspicuously Republican Laura against a young AfricanAmerican kid who has a way with words. Geddit? There's a dinner table scene which later gets sculpted into butter that reminded me of American Beauty. I suspect that was an intended nod.The language is wonderfully profane with most of the quickfire curses flying out from the pretty mouths of Garner and Wilde. Comedies usually stage a huge setup around sex scenes but Butter takes you by surprise on more than one occasion with the unlikeliest of people getting intimate with each other.One doesn't have to look closer to see that the film has many problems. Bob hooking up with Brooke Wilde makes sense and the narrative flow leads up to it but Laura doing it with her one time flame Boyd Bolton was completely out of place. I am not justifying Bob's actions and condemning Laura's it's just that whatever she did was not to get back at Bob but to use Boyd's services and get back at Destiny. Kaitlen Pickler played Ashley Greene has a halfbaked character and goes nowhere. She's a typical teenager who hates her family but that's not the issue. Her little experimental fling with the stripper Brooke is shall we say pointless. Wait what? I cannot believe I am complaining about the hot girl on girl action. Never mind.Wilde is a firecracker as the stripper Brooke she is the funniest even though her character hangs very loosely to the story. The Jackman cameo which is what it is felt a tad inapposite as well. Actually most of the actors felt underutilized as they didn't get enough screentime. It always gets problematic when kids act like grownups. Destiny is a cool kid and all that but the final scene with her advising Laura was way too cheesy or should I say buttery.The film's strength is its short runtime. At a little over 80 minutes the film opens up quick makes you chuckle and sometimes laugh and wraps up before you worry about its problems. It is necessary for me to address these problems but I honestly didn't care much for them. I had a lot of fun watching it.".

When she comes up against a truly talented 10 year old orphan Destiny Yara Shahidi the gloves come off as Laura Pickler fights to keep herself socially relevant. While the film isn't perfect the script by Jason A. Micallef provides some fun satirical wit and director Jim Field Smith guides a good cast through the hit and miss material well enough to entertain. And while for the most part Butter is a fun satire of middle America it does have a tendency to divert attention to subplots that don't serve the story. No more evident then Bob's involvement with a hooker Olivia Wilde who then becomes involved with the contest and Bob's daughter Ashley Greene. It provides some sex and spice to the film but nothing to the plot as does Hugh Jackman's brief appearance as an old flame of Laura's. While the film's focus does wander there is enough there to make this an amusing enough watch and the cast helps carry things well enough when it flounders. More like 6.5".

Yes there are notso thinly veiled political undertones that enrich the film this is an easy watching fun film. I thought Micallef did a fine job balancing the very real world of butter sculpting competitions from the Great Plains states and the absurdity of this unreal black comedy. Olivia Wilde is a tour d' force in this film. She plays the drifting sexy Delilah with control and command. No doubt she steals her scenes or is allowed to steal the scenes from the rest of this straight laced line up of characters. Not to be out done Jennifer Garner offers a fresh and unpredictable performance. We have grown to love the often tender Garner it was fun to hate her this time. Ty Burell gives us more of what we love him for. Mr. Kicked in the Groin has never been more masterfully perfected than by Burell. If I could I would buy stock in Yara Shahidi. This young actress will win your heart and have you rooting for her from her first scene. Shahidi is surrounded by a strong cast but she finds her own light and performs above the fray. The art direction photography costumes and other creative rolls are completed well within the expectations of well funded Hollywood backed indie film. The Weinstein Co with their RADiUS distribution are are again testing the VOD prior to theatrical distribution model. Only time will tell how this will work out but Itunes users are popping for the 9.99 rental. I think the multiplatform distribution model will be perfected and small projects will benefit in the end.".

Butter tries to delve into the area of something like Best in Show or Waiting for Guffman where people take smalltime events and blow their importance WAY out of proportion.I wish it had been a bit longer to flesh out some of the characters better. LOVED Rob Cordry who was very lowkey compared to his usual roles.. he was great as was the little girl who played Destiny. I didn't mind her adult speeches as did some reviewers. She was really sweet.If the script had been stronger and a bit more wicked with the satire this would be a strong comedy rather than just a decent one.At least there wasn't a lovable 'manchild' anywhere to be seen so tired of that branch of humorIf you like films like I mentioned at the beginning of my review than give it a try it's not a black comedy as some people said as it never goes very dark at all. Just a soft satire".

LOVED Rob Cordry who was very lowkey compared to his usual roles.. he was great as was the little girl who played Destiny. I didn't mind her adult speeches as did some reviewers. She was really sweet.If the script had been stronger and a bit more wicked with the satire this would be a strong comedy rather than just a decent one.At least there wasn't a lovable 'manchild' anywhere to be seen so tired of that branch of humorIf you like films like I mentioned at the beginning of my review than give it a try it's not a black comedy as some people said as it never goes very dark at all. Just a soft satire";

It's very much in the vein of the rather wonderful dark comedies that come from the Coen Bros. e.g. Fargo O Brother Where Art Thou? The Hudsucker Proxy etc. In fact I checked out the postfilm credits to see if they were involved. They're not but I wouldn't be a bit surprised if their comedies inspired the screenwriter and director. The screenplay direction and acting are superb. And the young star who plays Destiny Yara Shahidi is adorable and extremely talented. I hope big things come her way.Very funny totally enjoyable. If you like the Coen Bros. you really like or love this movie. It's a must see in my book!".

	schema:reviewBody "Butter hasn't received much press until just now as it is hitting the festival circuit. A trailer has yet to be seen and a release date has only recently been nailed down. All we knew about it was that the cast is full of good names it is a satire built around a buttercarving competition and that director Jim Field Smith is only known for bythenumbers romantic comedy She's Out of My League. But somewhere somehow the name Juno was mumbled by someone and comparisons were just waiting to be made.The question of similarity to Juno would be appropriately enough raised but I'm afraid the similarity ends just past the 'Jennifer Garner movie' and 'Midwestern family ensemble comedy' labels. Butter has a bit of bite but it lacks both the quirk and emotional depth that Juno had. The screenplay goes more for gags than being clever and fails to really shine outside a handful of scenes.This is not to say the film isn't going to be surefire entertainment for many moviegoers. There were a few times in the film when I couldn't even hear a few lines because the whole house was laughing for so long. Garner newcomer Yara Shahidi Olivia Wilde and Kristen Schaal all do some comedic heavylifting. Shahidi provides a bit of tenderness as both the narrator and the heart of the film. Garner meanwhile gives us a performance we haven't ever seen from her. She will be an Oscar player one of these days.I went into this one hoping to be surprised by just how great it was but not expecting to be. I wasn't surprised but I wasn't disappointed either. A lost opportunity but not a waste of time.2.5 out of 5 stars.Check out more reviews by Cameron McAllister at Reel Georgia  www.ReelGA.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Butter sculpting is one of the many things I wish I could do but can not. I don't have the time the patience the eye or the craft to pull off something as skillful as molding pounds and pounds of butter into an object or a replica of an event. Such a talent will require devotion and commitment and certainly a helluva lot of free time.Jim Field Smith's Butter is a bleeding gums satire on suburbia and follows the lives of those white people who seem to have it all but will never recognize it. We take a look at a Conservative Midwestern town in Iowa where its residents are just as quirky their interests. Our first main character is Laura Pickler Jennifer Garner wife of professional buttersculpture Bob Picker Ty Burrell who has decided that after fifteen years he will retire and live a more quiet controlled life. This upsets Laura who decides to continue Bob's legacy by pursuing the buttersculpting championship whether or not one actually exists baffles me but it certainly wouldn't surprise me. It is at first unknown to Laura that Bob has been unfaithful and has agreed to pay a local stripper a plethora of money to afford her rent. The stripper is the hilarious Brooke played by Olivia Wilde who steals every scene she is in. She will join the championship as well knowing she will get under Laura's skin and show her that Bob and her were meant for each other.Laura has competition mainly with a young black orphan named Destiny Yara Shahidi who has traveled from house to house finally finding a family with Rob Corddry and Alicia Silverstone. After claiming to them that she isn't skilled at anything she becomes an overnight sensation in the town for being able to mold anything carefully out of butter. The other competitor is the dimwitted yet goodnatured CarolAnn Stevenson Kristen Shaal a fan of Bob's who becomes convinced that she can win the next title although she is victim to her own ineptitude.Butter plays just like Alexander Payne's film Election did with its heavily satirized look at suburban culture and also providing us with a character that has redeemable and despicable qualities. In Election Reese Witherspoon plays Tracy Flick a cocky brown nose who pesters her classmates and her teacher played by Matthew Broderick in an attempt to win a school election. She loves to believe that everyone likes her but Broderick's character has it out for her the entire time even setting up a dense football player to run against her so she won't run unopposed. Payne used wry humor and hilariously overthetop performance to make Election a winning film. Smith employs virtually the same techniques but in a little subtler of a manner. We laugh at the character's bizarre personalities how they react towards each other and the way they treat this preposterous competition more so than their actual reactions and monologues. Either way it's a favorable combination.Butter is a film I believe could work equally as a documentary as it does a quirky satire. Seeing the obscure in films has always been a favorite of mine I believe that butter sculpting or clay soap or ice sculpting could've made for an enticing documentary as long as the passion and heart was there. It would also hopefully answer a question that was looming in my head since I began watching the film after all is said and done and the competition has been judged critiqued and the winner awarded what happens to the sculpture itself? Surely electric bills for the cooling containers wouldn't be paid contently.Starring Jennifer Garner Ty Burrell Olivia Wilde Rob Corddry Ashley Greene Alicia Silverstone and Hugh Jackman. Directed by Jim Field Smith.".

I mean you could tell that Jenifer Gardner Hugh Jackman and Olivia Wilde were obviously playing a role and they aren't actually funny. If you watch Knocked Up or 40 Year Old Virgin it's genuinely funny bc the actors are real comedians. I think this was by far Olivia Wilde's worst performance and SHE WAS A STRIPPER! I should have loved her. But she failed at the 1st thing u have to be to be a stripper and that's you have to be attractive. She wasn't lustfully attractive at all and played the role as unattractive. She should take notes from of all people Hillary Duff in War Inc. She wasn't a stripper but she was a slutty pop star with plenty of sexual innuendo and she killed it. She was sexy as hell along with being cheap and trashy. I written too much already on a sub par film so I'll end with the star who stole the film young foster kid with a hidden talent Yara Shahidi.

Butter is a movie about a couple Bob Ty Burrell and Laura Jennifer Garner who met when the husband was a champion butter sculpture then fifteen years after they meet he has won the so many times that know they are asking him to step down to let someone else win. The other part of this story is about a little girl named Destiny Yara Shahidi who has been with many foster parents comes to a new batch of parents who she describes as Really White. Then when a new butter competition starts Laura decides to take over for her husband but she has strong competition for the young girl. Also another plot point is a stripper named Brooke Olivia Wilde who is looking to get payed from Bob after sleeping with him many many times.This main storyline of the film is a very strange one as I feel that the idea of this small town caring so much about who is the best at making butter into shapes that appeal to people. The film is directed by Jim Field Smith probably most known for She's Out of My League it is also written by first time writer Jason A. Micallef. The fact that this film got the actors it did surprises me as I feel most of the actors deserve better. The film has most of it's story explained by Laura and Destiny and they are just as bad as the script is. The whole time the butter competition is happening is hard to watch and because it's the most talked about thing of the film just makes me hate it more.Garner playing this highly unlikeable women is OK as at times I found her funny even through the times when I could not stand her. Yara playing Destiny is OK but knowing this was her first film I will let her get away with the fact that at times she was very stiff. Olivia Wilde playing Brooke was OK but I wish she was used more as she was the best person in the film not for her stripping but her acting. Other cast members include Hugh Jackman Ty Burrell Rob Corddry Kristen Schaal Ashley Greene and many more people are in the film but they are completely wasted of their talents that would be great in this type of film.I did not like the film feeling that it lived up to my expectations by that I was not expecting it to be good and it was as horrible as I thought. The ending of this film where Laura runs for Govner felt weird and uncalled for because I felt we should have ended on a shot of Destiny.MOVIE GRADE D MVP MVP Olivia Wilde".

It would have been one thing if all social groups were made fun of but that was not the case. I was also struck by the narrator's derogatory comments about white people throughout the movie. I have no idea what was suppose to be funny about that or what it brought to the story. I really couldn't see how race had anything to do with a comedy about butter carving. I can't think of a reason why it is OK to be negative about any race weather they are a minority or not. I hope the directorstudio can spend less time making political statements and more time making something that is actually funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Jim Field Smith's sophomore foray into feature film comedy fails to break the boorish mold of what little we've come to expect of them fleeting fun cheap laughs and tiresome attempts of tossing in anything redeemable. Butter attempts and misses The Hangover's gritty charm and Superbad's unadulterated and endearing honesty. However it does seem to stride passed Smith's mediocre 2010 teen comedy She's Out of My League this is perhaps due to Butter's unfamiliar gusto with its wacky butter carving premise and even wackier cast of Middle America characters. Bob Pickler Ty Burrell is white America's humble and handsome Michelangelo a masterful craftsman of buttercarved sculptures. His hilarious renditions of The Last Supper and a scene from Schindler's List enamor his redneck community but also stoke the pride and aspirations of his selfimportant wife Laura Pickler Jennifer Garner whose mavericky gunghoness satirically smacks of Sarah Palin. When Bob decides to modestly end his victorious decadelong reign as champion and pass his buttery torch Laura becomes absurdly livid suspecting their successes as everyone's envy and cannot fathom this year's First Prize going to anyone but a Pickler. So with no experience of the craft and with some mantraborn confidence absorbing lines from The Secret she struts to the competition signup table and declares herself a participant. Only she's not alone to Laura's dismay two more contestants vie for buttery glory and the insults and connivery that follow in this triangle of adorable but more often annoying treachery make the cake of this flimsy film. One is a humorously vengeful stripper named Brooke Olivia Wilde and the other is a strong and clever orphan named Destiny Yara Shahidi. Wilde's Brooke is a perpetually scantilyclad sarcastic saucy mouthed sex bombshell that rides a small child's BMX bike. She gets the guys' juices flowing and leaves everyone's eyebrows levitating above their heads. But that's all the former Dr. Hadley of House fame seems to aspire to mere Megan Fox eyecandy. Brooke only joins the competition to remind Bob of her unpaid services rendered unto him in the backseat of his minivan. Destiny's motivations on the other hand are pure and estimable. After enduring travesty after travesty of awkward and inept foster parents she finally lands a nice couple that's more promising and capable of fostering her untapped artistic talent. Mr. and Mrs. Emmet Rob Corddry and Alicia Silverstone are a smiling white couple happy to make a difference to an underprivileged and disenfranchised little girl. They provide for her and encourage her interests in butter carving as good parents should. Here it seems Butter has found its heart something redeemable within the crass and the obscene. But perhaps not. Destiny if you haven't already guessed is African American. It's just hard not to cringe when Shahidi performs with so much spirit and charmon more than one occasion she adorably cracks wise about the weirdness of crackers because what casts a dreary shadow over her is the unashamed and unaware racist undertones and stereotypes stupidly frolicking about. Of course it's only the white couple that can provide a stable and caring family and of course it's only they that have the benevolence to take Destiny in. Needless to say it is drug addiction that cost Destiny her loving mother. This is disappointing because it manages to eclipse what Butter did so wellnamely being an above average comedy that makes you laugh. Much of this movie is after all a liberal poke and jab at the crazed conservatives and Godfearing folk of Middle America. They ostensibly trump family values over everything and the Pickler's are apparently representative of this image. Smith doesn't fail in gleefully toying with these conservative truths. Laura Pickler is actually a stepmom and the Picklers' daughter Kaitlen Ashley Greene is an attractive and bored lesbian that despises her retarded parents. Bob cheats on his wife only to feel the apathetic hand of Laura chiding him like a teenager out past curfew. Even Laura eventually skirts her conservative morality cheating on Bob with Boyd Bolton Hugh Jackman a grinning cowboy car dealer with a big hat. He later thanks God for his sexual exploit in the front seat of his shiny corvette You're more awesome than I thought God! Okay bye.So Butter like butter can be good or bad depending on how you use it. Enjoy the taste and accept the fatty consequences or make the effort to settle on something healthier. But more often than not it's best left in the fridge.".

His wife Laura Pickler Jennifer Garner is extremely proud of this accomplishment and plans to use it to further advance her fortunes by having Bob run for political office. But that all changes one day when the organizers of the butter carving event ask Bob not to compete this year so that others can have a chance. Naturally being the understanding type of person he is Bob reluctantly agrees. His wife on the other hand is incensed and sees this as an attempt to thwart her ambitions. To that effect she announces that she will compete in his place instead. That being said although Laura has some artistic talent she soon becomes distressed to learn that a young black orphan by the name of Destiny Yara Shahidi has also chosen to competeand Destiny happens to have a natural artistic ability that is quite extraordinary. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that what made this film so entertaining was the way it tended to highlight some of the attitudes of certain people living in the Bible Belt of America. While they may profess to being Christian their actions clearly say otherwise. Yeteven though many of these scenes were quite funny in their own rightI must admit that there were a couple of scenes that were just plain vulgar and they detracted from what could have been a truly outstanding piece of comedy and satire. Even so I enjoyed this movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.".

One day she meets Miriam hard of hearing and a little ingenuous who feels sympathy for Eunice and takes her home.

Butterfly Kiss introduces two startlingly distinctive unique women opposites drawn together by loneliness and a need for balance. Eunice is a dispairing tortured soul who searches the bland grey motorways of England for the everabsent Judith does this abstract  individual really exist or is she another figment of Eunice's amazingly complex and unstable psyche?. People who turn out not to be Judith tend to end up the victim of Eu's homocidal wrath note though that Judiths importance to Eu was going to end up in mortal sacrifice also. Eunice has no inhibitions no scruples her behaviour is repulsive obnoxious sexually promiscuous extravagantly moody. She acts purely on impulse and instinct rarely using her devastated mind for Eunice actually wants to be caught and wants to be punished. In fact she consistantly pushes her luck in aggravating people beleiving God and I guess the rest of the world has forgotten her. Consequently she is forced to punish herself wrapping her scrawny body in chains that hurt and bruise her. It is quite possible that a lot of her other actions throughout the film which are illogical and cruel up front are more attempts by Eu at selfpunishment though that is left for the audience to mull over. Miriam by contrast is water to Eu's fire a metaphor even she explains in her black and white interveiws dotted throughout the film as she tells their story to a camera. Miriam at first looks to be dim naive childish and ineloquent in her speech. Reading between the lines this version of Mi fails to convince instead giving the image of perceptive openminded in the extreme generous and angelicly kind. Whether this was supposed to be Mi or was Saskia Reeves'  true intelligence mistakenly worming its way to the surface is unknown and it doesnt really matter the character was nontheless adorable.  As lonely and lovestarved as Eunice their similarities end there. Mi is totally honest and forthcoming her love for Eunice is complete and unconditional. Along with being painfully direct Eunice is also implicitly dishonest. When Miriam discovers Eu's homocidal nature she is already in love. She disposes of the body without encouragment from Eu and sets out to support Eu and make her a better person. Rather she becomes a murderer herself though through more subtle indications she retains all the original beauty and kindness of her placid personality. People who may dislike this movie are being subjectively incorrect in saying that it isn't good. Truly it is not a pleasant film to watch but it is still a worthwhile peice of artistry riddled with talent.".

Eunice is young deranged woman wandering along gray English highways looking for a girl named Judith. She tries to find a record with a love song but can't remember the words...just a piano part. We later learn it's Singing for England England...song about love as she kept repeating. By pure chance deranged and dangerous she met young gas station clerk Miriam. They clicked immediately. From this point on Miriam  model daughter and humble small time girl  falls for Eunice's charm...and things go terribly wrong.The dynamics between two women is strange and can be seen as an abusive relationship. Miriam is submissive totally succumbed in what will prove to be a complete life changing experience.Saskia Reeves Miriam gave excellent performance but let's face it  brilliant Amanda Plummer Eunice steals the show!Plummer is fascinating in this role threatening full on crazy dominant with distinct will and determination. Ravages through this film like a force of nature. But what is Eunice looking for? I think she felt abandoned testing the limits of evil she can inflict before God intervenes and punishes her for her sins. But the guy above might just be too indifferent or otherwise engaged.Miriam is strangely lured to Eunice trying to help her and perhaps make her see the good in herself. Although she appears irrational Eunice has this strange understanding of things warped yet somehow precise ability to read people. She said to Miriam You think you can make me good? I'll make you evil before you make me good. What is butterfly kiss? It's a gentle act of affection. Hard to find anything gentle about this story unless you read between the lines but they are blurred.90's brought us some very interesting cinema that goes against the grain. Especially indie drama Brits do so well. The cinematography is realistic there's lack of sentimentality in harsh urban setting. Nihilism and spleen are dragged into spotlight and Butterfly Kiss delivers these qualities in spades. Such a gem wonderful and unjustly overlooked film.".

Looking at BK however gave me the strong idea that she had to be British speaking with such an explicit  Northern English accent.... IMDB learned me that she is American after all. Tops!! Of course her role is a very bizarre one a manhating lesbian who seems to kill others at random. She takes Saskia Reeves with her in a negative downstream which finally results in an ending that can't give a good feeling to anyone seeing the movie. In spite of that after having some doubt I found that I truly liked this movie. Thanks to those two fabulous playing actresses I'd never seen Saskia Reeves before but I liked her right away. Not thanks to the story I never found out what the  rue reason was behind all the killings. 7 out of 10.".

The fact that Plummer is extremely sloppy about when and where she kills  and the fact that she wants to be caught  would suggest that it's highly unrealistic that she wasn't caught earlier this is Western Europe after all not the Ukraine. The film is definitely not for children or people easily shocked the body metal that Plummer wears is unlike anything I have come across in a film before.

On the face of it a British road movie with a fairly deranged Eunice played by Amanda Plummer and Wendy played by Kathy Jamieson who gets attracted to her despite herself. And that's it really apart of course from all the bloody killing and Eunice's weird and plentiful body piercings. Plummer is brilliant and completely believably convinces as the needy sort of lost soul who might do anything if riled or if they feel like it. Jamieson is equally good and it is shameful she has made so few films. Here she plays a more gentle and innocent lost soul trying to 'look after' her new found friend and finds herself getting very involved indeed. Despite the wild craziness of this 'Thelma and Louise meets Silence of the Lambs' as my box references it as with so much of Winterbottom's work it remains essentially a very English film. The motorways and traffic couldn't really be anyone else's the landscape and skies similarly and the uniquely awful roadside petrol stations stores and eateries. This is such a dark film filled with horrible happenings and yet there is a warmth in the stupid relationship and a feeling of belonging. Maybe I should try and compile a list that represents 'England'. Anyway this has certainly prompted me to see even more of the directors many and varied output. Excellent.".

But it is a surprisingly wellplotted and thrilling puzzle of a movie that has it share of great moments but the twist can be guessed by most and it changes up the rules of the first two.We follow Sam who lives whose girlfriend Rebecca was murdered 5 years ago. Like the previous movies he has the ability to travel back in time to key moments to gain some new information and sometimes even alter the past. He uses this to help the FBI catch killers beforehand. Only this time the movie adds a few new elements 1Sam can travel back to ANY moment in the past whether he was present there when it originally happened or not. 2 He doesn't need to use journalspictures to travel back and can do so at his will anytime. 3 A few more but they are spoiler territory.But once he gets the information that the killer who is behind bars for Rebecca's murder is wrongly convicted he decides to break his own rule of not altering his own past to travel back to the night of the murder but through a mistake creates a serial killer for the world.Unlike the second movie which had a large amount of plot holes and ridiculous decisions by the protagonist this one is for the most part wellplotted presented as a puzzle piece instead of a traditional thriller and creates suspense by adding the element of guessing the killer's identity. It has a lot of thrilling moments particularly in the last half hour. Unfortunately the twist the movie tries to pull is predictable in the movie if you are paying attention. Although that doesn't mar the experience it ruins the element of surprise. Also some fans of the original may not like the changes to the rules of the first. The actor's did a surprisingly good part in the movie. The dialogue was good although the little attempts at humor failed more than worked.Overall this is a recommended thriller especially if you are a fan of the original. It tries to do something different by adding the element of a serial killer into the mix and gives the protagonist much more stake in the movie rather than just saving the life of a loved one. If only it wasn't for the predictable twist my rating would be higher.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well lemme just say I've seen the first movie of the series and was semi impressed but more confused.Never saw the second one. Just watched the 3rd.Let me just say I honestly was intrigued through pretty much the whole movie. FOcused around 'time travel' but not in the traditional 'got a special machine sense'.Based around a number of grisly murders where the main character is attempting to 'witness' or even change the course of events by finding out who the killer is. I have to say I was curious to find out who it was and even though the discovery moment of the movie was kinda a weak climax for such awesome horror foreplay I have to say I went away generally satisfied. Not too bad of a twist but then generic at the same time. However the overall experience is very entertaining.I recommend watching it. The acting isn't bad for the most part and while the movie seems really confusing at first if you pay attention it actually makes sense at the end.Check it out not for anyone but I'm sure a lot will get a kick out of it.".

	schema:headline " really enjoyed this surprising sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "I was a huge fan of the original Butterfly Effect although I liked the concept more than the execution. When Ashton screamed You don't know me! I don't even know me! it made me remember why certain actors should stick to lightweight material. I had very low expectations for this one mostly because the second movie was unwatchable. Aside from a couple of problems I was pleasantly surprised. First the problems This movie has nothing to do with the original or the sequel except that the Butterfly Effect power is SIMILAR  not exactly the same because in this one the main character Sam travels by just focusing on the past and his sister Jenna monitors him but then he seems to forget the intervening years when he returns to the present. The other problem is that sometimes characters and relationships are unclear and a couple times I had to ask my wife who this person was or why this person thinks that now but she understood it pretty well and felt that the confusion was intentional so that the audience would feel like the main character who's really confused by all the time travel.The two leads in this one  which probably couldn't get big stars because of its low budget  were both outstanding. Chris Carmack shows major dramatic chops. I can see him being the next Viggo Mortensen. Rachel Miner is also really great and so are the minor characters especially the wellendowed bartender. Was that a visual reference to Catholic Schoolgirls in Trouble from the Kentucky Fried Movie or am I reaching? There were a couple of strong dramatic scenes that wouldn't have felt out of place in a studio Oscarbait type of movie. I guess that's a credit to the writingdirecting too since it didn't feel overdone or hammy.The cinematography was also solid and I liked the score. Usually movies like this skimp on those elements and just use a cheesy synth score but this one was solid.My only complaint about the cinematography is that sometimes it felt claustrophobic  we're always inside someone's apartment or in some dark cramped place. I guess that fits with the theme but I would've liked to be able to breath every now and then with a nice landscape shot or something. Maybe that was also a budget issue.Overall although I didn't see this movie in the theater  it was out for a week apparently   watching it at home felt like I'd caught a really cool latenight TV show. It's a fun ride. I could see this turning into a TV series or something like Quantum Leap.".

	schema:headline " Low expectations equals surprising results";
	schema:reviewBody "To say that expectations are low for the third installment of a franchise that was fairly woeful to begin with is a pretty massive understatement. The original Butterfly Effect starring Aston Kutcher was more a vaguely interesting concept masquerading as a feature film than a fullyrealized story. Butterfly Effect 2 is an inept pile of cinematic garbage that was only made because the same German audiences that go apeshit for David Hasselhoff also think that Butterfly Effect is the Citizen Kane of Aston Kutcher timetravel movies. And lastly Butterfly Effect Revelation the anchor of Horrorfest's 8 Films to Die For festival has had such a lackluster marketing plan that it was nearly impossible to find out when and where it was playing until a few days before it opened.So as the lights dimmed at the 1000 showing of Revelation at Mann's Beverly Center Cinema the odds were that it was going to be a long night.But then a funny thing happened. The movie started and it was actually pretty...good. Okay it was clearly made on a pretty small budget and there were some of the edges were a little rough but generally this was a pleasant if not elevated genre movie with some good scares at least one standout performance and an interesting take on a series that was worn out before it began.Unlike its predecessors the most surprising thing about Revelation is that it actually has a story and fullyrealized characters.A disturbing cold open murder in a Detroit park sets a gloomy tone and introduces us to Sam Reed Chris Carmack who callously watches the murder take place from a safe distance.We soon learn that Sam possesses the power to jump back anywhere in time in his own personal past. Unlike the protagonists of the previous two Butterfly Effects Sam uses this power not to change the circumstances of his own life but for a tidy paycheck from helping Detroit police to solve cold case murders. This by itself earns the film penned by up and coming screenwriter Holly Brix and directed by equally rising filmmaker Seth Grossman a gold star over the previous efforts in the franchise. The Kutcher version at least had novelty going for it even if it was missing a story but the second film is simply a remake of the first with an unknown cast and director.Brix's script while not perfect is miles ahead of its predecessors in terms of creating a film that is more plot than gimmick. Grossman's direction is interesting as well but flawed. Some very nice moments in the film are undercut with overlong scenes and sloppy editing. Several times in the movie I caught myself mumbling the word cut to myself with increasing urgency. Good lines of dialogue that should have ended the scene were lost in unnecessary further expository jibber jabbering by the actors.As the film goes on we're introduced to Sam's sister Rachel Miner who is both his caretaker when he is having his time traveling out of body experiences and his ward as an emotionally fragile sardonic shutin. Miner's performance nails a character really well and when she's on screen the movie really comes to life. Miner best known for her relationship to the Home Alone kid shines in this movie to the extent that she overshadows Carmack's heavyhanded take on his character. This appears to be a problem with the direction or casting as the acting is frequently uneven but Miner proves that all of the performances could have been better. Although spotty Carnack manages to pump out a few scenes that reach an authentic emotional quality.Sam soon learns that someone else is jumping into a mutual past and changing events faster than he can. Soon he is a suspect in the murders that he formerly helped solve and the real killer is closing in on him.The killer's identity is well concealed until it is very close to being revealed at which point it seems the filmmakers had run out of red herrings to use as distractions.Overall however Revelation is a pleasant surprise against such radically low expectations and while it is not Citizen Kane it is an entertaining genre movie with some great writing decent direction and an inspiring performance from Miner.".

All the changes that Chris Carmack makes during his jumps are quite interesting and the way they change the story as well.If you just want some good entertainment watch it even with its not so good parts it still falls into the first 15 movies in the world especially with all the crap don't even know what else to call it that has been coming out lately...Enjoy and drop a few words so others can benefit as well..peacelove".

But as soon as the music starts you have to say to yourself Just a minute there seem to be talented people involved here. The biggest improvement is that the hero is not a mere whiner he's a guy with determination he's an altruist he's a crimesolver. That said the actor playing him suffers from the disadvantage of a fashionmannequin face.As sometimes happens as a premise becomes more and more familiar to the audience it becomes more and more commonplace in the fictional world as well. How many people turn out to have survived the destruction of Krypton by now? So in this movie there is an old master timejumper who presumably has any number of disciples by now. I think a movie is stronger when the hero is alone with his superpower but I suppose it's impossible to make a lot of such sequels with different heroes.Others have remarked that the sex scene jumps overboard from the movie I'd like to add that if you're keeping track of the script you realize that the scene is important to the plot but that it is supposed to be over with very quickly the way it goes on and on may have added commercial value but it turns a bit of the movie into nonsense.Aside from that thank goodness the plot does hang together and does carry us along the ending is solid if not entirely unpredictable and although timejumping seems to have become not only more commonplace but much easier than in the first film the portrayal of a person's struggle to alter the ostensibly inevitable and the consequences of that struggle makes 3 a legitimate contribution to the franchise and I'd say quite a favorable contribution.

The film is confusing and it does make you think a lot! But I do believe that it was intentional trying to put you in the shoes of the main character.Its a film that gives you everything that you expect blood gore nudity a great plot and storyline and fantastic acting especially from Rachel Miner who plays Chris Carmack's psychopathic mass murdering sister. Not saying that Chris Carmack himself was a bad actor he did an excellent job of showing major dramatic chops.I went into the film expecting to be confused I came out of the film feeling concluded and liberated! A fantastic film!I would give the film a 8 out of 10 and defiantly add it to my top 100 favourite films.Sam Micel".

There was no apparent purpose of his time travel and it would become obvious that things were not going to end in his favor. Revelations did not have as many plot holes as the first movie. But that was only because we were not aware what Sam was doing at the time he traveled back. In the first movie we knew exactly what Evan was doing and were familiar with the scenes.WHAT I WANT FROM A FUTURE BUTTERFLY EFFECT MOVIE The original concept of time travel be kepti.e the protagonist can only travel back to certain life events. The audience should be intensely familiarized with each of these events. The time traveler experiments with his abilities to analyze and memorize every piece of information at these events.

The second isn't quite as good and the third goes down hill from there. Occasionally as is the case with Final Destination the second movie is as good as the first and the third slips a long way. In the Butterfly Effect we have the rare exception. The third movie is arguably better than the first and considerably better than the second.This movie is nicely complicated but the plot is still easy to follow. And what a plot it is. The maze of temporal changes is just delicious. What's more the temporal twists and turns avoid the tired clichs. You expect the obvious to happen and it simply doesn't. This is such a welcome break. Despite the changes Sam makes to the past most of the present stays relatively similar. This movie even avoids the clich it is named after where a small change in one place creates huge changes elsewhere. The Nazi's never show up in this movie no matter how much time travel takes place  thank you! The plot is fantastic and much effort is made to befuddle the viewer as to who the killer in this murder mystery really is. At the same time plenty of legitimate clues are included. I must admit because I was braced for a bad third movie I expected one of the obvious choices to turn out to be the killer. I was greatly impressed with the ending.Like the first two movies there is a theme that time travel is bad. However it is downplayed and overshadowed by how cool and functional time travel is. What's more time travel provides all the solutions for this thriller although the director can't help but include a final terrible cost.The time travel brain damage is placed nicely in this movie. It threatens to overshadow everything and ruin the movie with a tired clich and then backs off and vanishes. The movie also has a rather adult homage to Ground Hog day. This and plenty of gore give the movie its rating. Sam sleeps with an inviting young lady and then time twists around so they don't know each other any longer.The dialogue is well written and really drew me in. The time travel genre is rife with cheesy lines that easily could have been used. This movie manages to deliver some age old time travel scenes in a new way going so far as to use a Scooby Doo reference that was both horrific and funny.Like many movies I would have liked five more minutes but instead it leaves you wanting more. This is probably a good think heck I know it is. It was the perfect time for an ending. Anymore and you would expect a second shoe to drop. While the director does leave a loose thread for a sequel but the movie wraps things up so nicely and it's so well done I just don't see anyone pursuing that kind of cheesy angle for any further movies in this series.I can't believe this movie did not make it to theatres locally. Unfortunately Final Destination 3 and Butterfly Effect 2 put a lot of nails in the time travel movie coffin. Having just watched S Darko and the 2009 Land of the Lost this is definitely the best time travel movie this year and in the last few.Mark Charke".

But with each attempt to fix what he's altered he only finds himself in a deeper mess.Who would've known a directtoDVD sequel would rise another directtoDVD sequel? After all these secondrate casts and secondrate scripts surely don't attract people into watching these movies...or do they? This third film in the Butterfly Effect franchise may not be as bad as you think which is both encouraging and unfortunate I suppose. The plot in here is actually good because it's different from the first two. The first film was a good movie by itself. The second was just like the first but on a much much much smaller scale.However the third is quite different. In fact unlike the first two films there aren't many consequences here. The protagonist's life doesn't really change so much which is great in my opinion because there's no more repeat. The story however is more like a serial killerSawtype movie with very gruesome death scenes one very random and quite graphic sex scene and one jawdropping scene in the end that matches the second movie's gay blow job scene. There's also a very contrived twist ending that doesn't really blow your minds away because it's too contrived and trite like many twist endings that tries too hard to surprise people.But other than that the movie is interesting enough on a very small level. The girls get all the eye candy they want from lead Chris Carmack while the guys get all the guts and gore in the death scenes. I also liked the end...very much which is quite surprising I'm not talking about the twist ending. For a directtoDVD threequal the film is surprisingly decent but that's not saying much because our expectations are just too low. The performances were decent and the end leaves you very satisfied unlike the depressing ending from the first movie. If you're a fan of this series go ahead and watch it. If not don't bother wasting your time in a secondrate movie.".

In Identity it was psychology here is physics or rather the paradoxes of time travel. Now this is the first one I see from this franchise so bear with me if you have already seen the others.The main theoretical difficulty for traveling to the past is that it may create impossible contradictory situations. The best known thought experiment about it is that of a man who goes to the past and kills his own grandfather while this last is still a boy so he won't have any kids so the killer will not be born so he won't be able to kill his grandfather. The solution to the paradox lies in the idea of an infinite number of coexisting alternate universes realities containing each possible outcome for each possible event. It's like a plot which starts with a man coming out of his house and a taking a walk b being hit by a car c taking a bus d.. All these secondary eventsand the ones coming after and the next to infinityare there available but it's only one or rather one lineal sequence of them which constitutes what we call our reality chain of events History. ex. said man takes bus goes to his office. That's all you need to know to understand the plot of this movie.Sam can travel to the past and change events and so change the future of people. He uses this gift also to witness murders past tipping the police about the murderers. He has been warned also he shouldn't change things as he'd change also chains of events. He did it once when going back in time to save his sister from a fire in which she died. He saved her but at the price of losing their parents in the same fire. What torments now Sam is that his girlfriend Rebecca was murdered later by what seems to be a serial killer. He sets to find her killer after being begged to do it by her sister who despairs that an innocent man will be executed for that crime. As feared Sam makes matters worse when now both sisters are murdered because of his intervention. The movie moves along this line of action with Sam insisting in going to the past to repair things only to make them worse creating a bleak present for him and those around against strong pleads from his sister. In that process people who liked him now hate him some are killed and then reappear alive and so on. Finally he uncovers the killer but he's confronted then with the most heartbreaking dilemma of his life. He takes the right moral decision he had no other choice really as his primary objective was to save lives.This is mostly an action driven flick for which the cinematography and the action just need to be appropriatewhich they are. Little known actors fit well this kind of plot as they'll just have to pretend they are in the given situationno need to fill the screen please. The pacing is good the plot development impeccable. The tension and mood set in from the beginning and stay for the duration. Atmosphere is not something you'll be missing here.But above all TBE has a very well structured plot. Some may feel cheated by the identity of the serial killer at the end but they shouldn't. This isn't your regular psycho who murders to indulge in his twisted fantasies or for revenge for wrongs past but a human psyche who has regressed to savagery. This killer can be really seen as a wild animal in human form which marks its territory and then attacks anyone entering it. That's why this murderer doesn't fit the usual serial killer profile. Also don't fall for the simplistic It was just a dream formula as it seems to be used here. This one is trickier than that. The fact that both Rebeccaor her sisterand the parents are alive doesn't give us any clue as it would have been so in any case. We don't even know if the sister really existed nobody mentions her. Was it all just a dream Sam had while napping in the car? What we saw before that really happened? Are the actions of the kid at the closing a hint of reincarnation or worse the shape of things to come? Sorry but no hints there draw your own conclusions. 710.".

Dave has a beautiful new young girlfriend named Kim Maria Pitillo but still sports a wandering eye. Vic whose soul was definitely bruised by his exwife is just agreeing to go on a blind date with Lucille Janeane Garofalo. As for Donny Paul Reiser he is also having severe trouble moving on holding his former wife in high esteem even though she has remarried. All of the men have children that they love deeply and who fall into their custody at the appropriate times. Yet meeting their former mates at such places as McDonald's in order to exchange their children still gives everyone a pang of hurt. Will Dave learn to commit himself to one woman? Will Vic let go of his resentments and take a chance on a new love? And will Donny realize his ex is never coming back and give himself permission to love someone else even if it is Dave's former wife Amy Brenneman? As for the kids will they be able to weather their parents divorce too? This is a truthful and touching film about divorce in modern America. Yes it is very common now making life complicated especially when children are involved. But even so it is not the end of the world as all of the men women and kids discover in this movie. All of the actors are wonderful with Quaid especially giving an extremely humorous and thoughtful performance. Special mention should also go to Garofalo for her dropdeadfunny neuroticyetlovable portrayal of a divorce. Then too the California setting is lovely the costumes very well chosen and the production values quite high. Most of all the script is funny original and brutally honest. If you have been down the divorce highway you should definitely make time for this film. It will help heal wounds with its laughs and sensitivity. But even if you just want to find a film that will let you yuck it up this one is a terrific choice.".

Since the kids are under the mother's custody the fathers have the right to get them for weekend visits.All three friends seem somewhat adjusted to their new realities. Vic looks as the most grounded man of the trio. Donny is the saddest case and Dave who is a wishy washy man is trying his hand at a new relationship with a much younger woman. The wives on the other hand have moved on with their lives. The three women appear to have no problems with their new status.The exchange of children occurs in a suburban McDonald's a neutral territory. This is a type of brand placing that Hollywood films love to show. Fast food alas stands for an allegory of what's missing with most marriages these days when most families don't even share a meal together. There is also the talk radio personality who is in the air taking calls from divorced people and advising them what to do yet he doesn't even have a clue about what he is talking about after all he's been married five times! The acting is adequate. The best thing in the film is Randy Quaid who as Vic makes the most of his role. Janeane Garofalo appears as a date from hell in a funny sequence. The ensemble cast does fine work under Sam Weisman's direction.The sad fact of this story is that all these children we see in the film will probably go through divorces in their own lives.".

Each provides a heartfelt performance and Rob Reiner is also solid as a 'radio shrink' whose intermittent broadcasts seem to taunt the trio as he laments the state of marriage today and constantly sides with the wives when discussing divorce. For all the angst that the film builds up  suggesting that fathers always lose out in the divorce process  the comedy treatment dulls any axe that the film has to grind. Janeane Garofalo has the funniest scene of the film as an awful first date whose rampant feminism amusingly gets in the way of all conversation and dining however her scenes are far removed from the divorce woes at the heart of the film. The film indeed works best when it is not trying to be funny with a memorable scene early on in which one father gets very annoyed at his exwife spending her alimony payments on her car rather than the kids. Another great scene has one of the men staring out of the window at his exwife's lazy new lover sunbathing with sunglasses on moping around and doing nothing. The sense of indignation in this segment is quite heartfelt how could she prefer him to me? without the need for a single word to be uttered. As mentioned though the movie is mostly comedy and never an especially engaging one at that. The film's heart is certainly in the right place but a slight change of tone could have done wonders here.".

Best of all it's not a depressing downer of a movie. It's fun to watch and emotional at the same time. The most effective part of the film for me was the relationship between Paul Reiser and his daughter since it reminded me so much of my dad and sister. All of the actors are extremely well chosen minus the very bland Mathew Modine. It handles the topic of divorce responsibly and doesn't load on the melodramatics.

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this movie twice now and I have to post my opinions as to why this movie is crap in terms of writing directing and editing... possibly even casting.Bye Bye Love stars the TV star Paul Reiser as a guy who divorced his wife for reasons we never really know... and he is still in love with her. Matthew Modine plays an always smiling never acting charmer.  Randy Quaid plays another odd character that never is well developed because the movie has too many plots and characters to really focus on anyone in particular.One thing that sickens me about this movie is how much blatant advertising is done within it.  Off the top of my head I remember Kettle Chips Minute Maid and last and certainly not least McDonald's.  I bet MickeyD's patroned the entire movie to show that divorcees should meet there every weekend to trade their kids seeing as the divorce rate in America is over 50 of all married couples.  What a demographic to hit for!  I never heard of people meeting at fast food restaurants to exchange their kids for the weekend before this.Next thing Eliza Dushku hitting on the guy who works at McDonalds?  How realistic is that?  Yes I realize all of you Buffy fans that she is Faith but it doesn't make up for the fact that her character was undeveloped and weak.  For example when she gets drunk and screams at her father and says all of that typical i broke up the marriage crap... where did any of that come from?   We are given no clues as to why she's angry except for Reiser's that age between 13 and 36 quote.The chronology in this movie was hard to follow too because most of the scenes played independent to the others while going back and forth between the 40 stories going on.  The music montages added to the story making it even worse than it already was.  The lovely wrapup at the end really made the story feel like it ended at a very awkward place.  The climax was very... semiclimatic.  Quaid's character is a rollercoaster of uncertainty. He's not a dynamic character... he's a schiz.  So is his lovely date Garafolo.This movie doesn't give insight as to what men are going through after a divorce... it gives what women want men to be like.  I would only recommend this movie to people who want to be brainwashed by Dr. Lauraesque psychology and the mesmers at McDonalds.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm SHOCKED at the number of comments claiming this to be a great best touching poignant believable movie or the like. If you treasure shallow emotionally cheapened drama laced in mostly banal humor then this may be in your treasure chest.Granted 'Bye Bye Love' is harmless entertainment with several anecdotal family or relationship moments strewn throughout. But let's keep it in perspective folks. It's not garbage but this is no 'Parenthood' or 'Author Author' either.This movie may hit home only if you view life from the perspective of a pampered 14 yearold middle to uppermiddle class teenager who learned about life from TV. It is chock full of onedimensional caricatures of married life divorce and parenthood. It rarely mimics real life unless you've lived your adult life at the maturity level of teenage relationships and priorities.Grab your wife or girlfriend even the kids it's pretty safe maybe some snacks and sit together for a couple hours of diluted Reader's Digeststyle family entertainment. Expect nothing more.I must agree with others that the scenes involving the characters of Janeane Garofalo and Randy Quaid are priceless standout comedy treasures but wasted in a film about adults acting like children acting like adults.".

If you treasure shallow emotionally cheapened drama laced in mostly banal humor then this may be in your treasure chest.Granted 'Bye Bye Love' is harmless entertainment with several anecdotal family or relationship moments strewn throughout. But let's keep it in perspective folks.

	schema:headline " To Get On With Life";
	schema:reviewBody "A sometimes humorous but more often poignant look at the trials and tribulations of divorce and trying to get on with life is covered in Bye Bye Love' directed by Sam Weisman.  Told primarily through the perspective of three divorced fathers it offers an overview of what has increasingly become a significant segment of family life in America.  Donny Paul Reiser hasn't yet accepted that it's over between himself and his ex Claire Jayne Brook he still feels too much for her.  He tells his friends he'll start dating again when it feels right It's been three years.  At the same time he's having trouble communicating with his fourteen yearold daughter Emma Eliza Dushku who according to Donny is in That difficult age group twelve through thirtyfive.'  Dave Matthew Modine has a fairly amicable relationship with his ex Susan Amy Brenneman but still shies away from commitment and has a string of girlfriends.  At one point his son Ben Ross Malinger asks if they could wear name tags to make it easier on him. Vic Randy Quaid has the hardest time of all he and his ex Grace Lindsay Crouse are barely civil to one another which of course makes handling the situation with the kids all the more difficult. The film does a nice job of addressing the various dilemmas faced by all involved including the children without ever delving too deeply or getting so serious as to take the story in an entirely different direction from the Friday transfers of the kids from mom to dad to the attempts at weekend bonding' with their children by the fathers who desperately want to stay close to the needs of all the adults to find the love and relationships necessary to move on with their lives.  There's some memorable moments as well here one is a thoughtful sequence played against Mary Chapin Carpenter's wistful song Stones In The Road' and another is an especially hilarious scene in which Vic has a blind date with a young divorcee named Lucille Janeane Garofalo which starts off badly and goes downhill from there.  Their dinner together at an Italian restaurant is priceless pure classic comedy.  Another nice touch to the overall story is using a young man Max Johnny Whitworth who works at McDonald's and is training Walter Ed Flanders a seventyyearold working on the adopt a geezer' program as a kind of before and after contrast to where Donny Vic and Dave are currently at in their own lives.  Max is just entering the arena of romance he has an eye for Vic's daughter Meg Amber Benson while Walter is a widower who lost his wife after fortyeight years of marriage and still pines for her.  Interjected throughout is another nice bit as radio talkshowhostmarriagecounselor Dr. David Townsend Rob Reiner of station KGAB dispenses advice even as he prepares for his own fifth wedding. The supporting cast includes Maria Pitillo Kim Dana WheelerNicholson Heidi and Pamela Dillman Sheila.  The performances are good all around most notably Reiser who conveys his angst and frustration particularly well and Quaid whose bitterness and caustic sarcasm are almost tangible. The real standout here however is Garofalo who takes hold of a lesser role and absolutely shines creating a singularly unforgettabe character in Lucille.  This may not be a masterpiece but it's a good movie and one you're going to want to see more than once or even twice.  Anyone who has ever been married divorced a parent a kid or any of the above will find something here with which to identify.  Bye Bye Love' is sometimes funny sometimes bittersweet and touching and one you're going to remember and I think  appreciate.   I rate this one 810.".

When I started playing this movie a weird feeling hit me and it never left me after that point. It was a feeling of dread perhaps. Bye Bye Love is trite. It's hard for me to call a movie trite because I find myself being onenote on occasion. The movie was a long string of inconsequential oneliners punctuated by stressed emotional moments. I really liked Janeane Garofalo here as a crazy blind date for Randy Quaid who was the most genuine of the three fatheractorsMatthew Modine Reiser and Quaid. The Bplot of the movie seemed to shift focus between Rob Reiner's lousy radio psychiatrist and Ed Flanders as an old man trying to find use for himself as a McDonald's employeein his last role wasted on this movie. Reiner provides the psych evaluation of divorces and the segue into the weekend ritual of swapping kidsat the corporate sponsor of the movie McDonald's whose ominous flags and arches loom in the background of too many of the exterior shots and gets his comeuppance at the end of the movie at the hands of Quaid. This seems like a good John Hughes movie gone terribly terribly wrong complete with silly montages and the expository scene at the end where everybody has a revelation and warm feelings. I think someone was trying to package this movie as a The Big Chill 'the next step' with the requisite soundtrackincluding much Everly Brothers hence the name of the movie. One thing that creeped me out about this movie was the presence of both Amber Benson and Lindsay Crouse and Dushku who all worked together again in the fourth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Danny Masterson was also present as the stereotypical stonerdrunk kid and in blinkandyou'llmissthem roles were Jack Black as a party DJ and Steven Root as a disgruntled neighbor.".

I know this film comes off as a light hearted comedy but it got no laughs from me. The one thing it does show correctly is what marriage has become in America these days. How selfish grownups can be and that kids in marriage are nothing more than part of the deal...Ya know we have a house two cars cat and dog and now we need kids. If it does not work than oh well cause its all about me after all.The date scene in the restaurant between Quiad and Janeane Garofalo is so poorly written as to be embarrassing. She was the date from hell that could not make up her mind about what she wanted to order and by the time the scene ended I was so exhausted I wanted to scream.

Jodhi May badly cast as gypsy with a heart of gold. Director Savary spoke at film fest and said he believes in as little dialog as possible to that end he didn't bother to subtitle several sequences in which characters spoke French or English.

	schema:headline " If only the script had equalled the performances and the atmosphere";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a fascinating brooding highly creative film which is ultimately unsatisfactory because of weaknesses of script and direction. The story more or less disintegrates into confusion at the end and I challenge anyone to be able to say what it all means. The film is worth seeing despite these faults because of its spectacular use of the truly brilliant talents of James Thirre and the Polish girl Izabella Miko Miko is a shortened version of her long Polish surname and she is not Japanese! Miko is so amazingly beautiful to look at and moves with such angelic grace as a dancer and acrobat that she seems supernatural. Indeed maybe she really is. She has the same special beauty as the young Julie Delpy whom she resembles closely enough to be her sister. A good casting idea there! The most intense performance in this film is given by the everamazing Jodhi May who has spent her entire career jamming all the cameras with the torrential rain of her feelings. I am always so harrowed after seeing a Jodhi May performance she specializes in the darkened brow and the glowering eyes of a girl who is perpetually in a frenzied state and may commit a crime of passion at any moment and often does that I need time to recover every time. But as if Miko and May were not enough this film has the genius of James Thirre on virtuoso display. I first saw him onstage performing circus routines with his parents and sister Aurlia when he was a child and subsequently I have seen two of his stage productions. No one can question that he is a genius. But then so are his parents JeanBaptiste Thirre and Victoria Chaplin. It is Victoria Chaplin who with the exquisitely innocent and inspired genius which is uniquely her own best preserves the legacy of her father Charlie Chaplin. And by saying that I by no means intend to denigrate the splendid achievements of her halfbrother Sydney Chaplin see my review of him in CONFESSION 1955 or her sister Geraldine who has charmed everyone for decades with her gamine qualities and profound talent. But the 'true genetic Chaplin line' runs directly through Victoria to James and his resemblance to his grandfather is so unnerving that one has to pinch oneself to remember that it is not Charlie without makeup at all but the living image of him in the shape of his grandson whom one is watching perform all of his incredible physical feats and inventing whole worlds of magic such as his mother has also done all her life. This film also has one of the countless fine supporting performances from the French actor who professionally calls himself 'Michael Lonsdale'. Never having met him I have absolutely no idea why he adopted that strange name. Most people outside France believe him to be British! Derek Jacobi plays the owner and manager of a small travelling circus which has once known better times and Miko is his daughter while May seems to be his mistress and semiadopted sister of Miko and mother of his illegitimate child. He is by profession a ham actor and emcee and Jacobi easily plays such a part since he is one of those actors who needs directing or he lapses into being an actor with the emphasis on the second syllable. No one doubts Jacobi's splendid talents it's just that he needs controlling that's all. Here he is partially controlled but it is OK because the part is over the top anyway. This film is a spectacular display of acrobatic 'aerial choreography' created by James Thirre for himself and Miko. The young director and coauthor of the film is Robinson Savary. He is highly creative and has a taste for evocative and surreal filmmaking heavy on mood and atmosphere. But in this early work he has fallen down in the story department and has also gone for 'suggestive editing' rather than expository editing sacrificing clarity for hints. He has thus been a victim to the artistic illusion that the power of his vision will make itself clear without the need for explanations. But this does not happen. People do need things explained to them. Not all films can be LE CHIEN ANDALOU which after all was a short let us not forget. Kubrick made this same mistake with 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY. When it opened in America Kubrick's film was 45 minutes longer and made perfect 'story sense' having followed Arthur Clarke's perfectly comprehensible screenplay. I watched Kubrick make that film over a period of two years and know many of the things which went wrong. Sometimes my friend Andrew Birkin who worked on it and I compare notes and reminisce about that strange adventure. But the morale is clear directors have to tell a story first and then 'get creative'. If you try and 'get creative' without telling a story you make a mess of things. If only Savary had not made that mistake! By rendering his film imperfect Savary has deprived Thirre and Miko of their perfect showcase for their unique talents and abilities. The circus trapeze sequences where they perform together as 'the White Birds' are so amazing that they are like a miracle and the editing of those sequences is very good. The film could have been a classic but it isn't. All we can do is salute Savary for trying and watch the film anyway ignoring its story imperfections and paying attention to the splendid visions which it offers us as if explanations were really unnecessary in the way that the impressionistic director honestly believed. Savary has also directed a 25 minute short film with James Thirre which I recommend which shows him rehearsing one of his amazing stage shows. But that film is hard to obtain outside of Paris and French Amazon appears not to sell it.".

I couldn't wait to come here to the IMDb because I just knew I'd find some raves  as I was watching this dreadful film I thought no one in their right mind could rave about this  but I always underestimate the people who review or stick up their thoughts for the world to read.This film wants so badly to be poetic  pathetic maybe poetic never. The dialogue is wretched the plot is nonexistent as are the characters. Poor Derek Jacobi eats every piece of scenery in view. The director is a young person and he's so in love with his little filmschool homages and art but like most youngsters who get to make films these days he had no clue as to how to tell a story or make an audience give a flying Wallenda about anything they are seeing.I don't know what film the ravers saw but it sure wasn't this one. Different strokes for different folks? I guess there IS a sucker born every minute.".

And the comments here astound me so many people coming to a message board to complain on a film that isn't a stage show. Or a book. Or an editorial. Different media sometimes not always to be sure necessitate a change or alteration in a story adaptation. Yes Rosie's ethnicity is down pedaled in the film mainly because Chita Riviera wasn't in it but they don't eliminate it entirely by the inclusion of a hideous black wig on Janet Leigh. I didn't miss Albert not being an English teacher as opposed to a chemist at all it doesn't change the essence of his stillhenpeckedbyhismother character. On a different matter I'm a little surprised to learn that Dick Van Dyke apparently had a bruised ego because of the strong emergence of costar AnnMargret in the film his name still comes before hers f'heaven's sakes! but what can you do? The film is a fun bright pseudosatire of the generation gap teens Elvis and most of all Ed Sullivan!! The finer numbers include the AM introduction in How Lovely to be a Woman followed by the insane ensemble piece Sincere which contains one of the funniest closing camera pans ever used in a film. Kids is also fine but Put on a Happy Face is hampered by the limited dancing ability of Janet Leigh through no fault of her own mind you but an obvious hole in what should have been a boygirl dance duet which they try to hide with excessive trick camera effects. The film's standout number IMO is A Lot of Livin' to Do a nightclub extravaganza sung by THREE different leads advancing two different plots of the story at once. With stellar direction by George Sidney and inventive choreography by Onna White it first appears as a conventional girlswooning solo for the title character but quickly shifts to the catandmouse antics of torn lovers AM and Bobby Rydell who lead the entire club in a kind of challenge dance. And while it isn't her first film this is the scene for me anyway which shows AM's breakout performance dancing in a bare midriff and pair of hotpink capris and she blows the roof off the place. No surprise that the next year she was cast opposite Elvis himself. Check it out and try not to break into dance yourself I dare you!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I am usually in the corner of those who complain about how Hollywood generally altered many classic Broadway stage musicals into something radically different when they were made into movies. Most of the time the changes were ridiculous and weakened the property dramatically.Bye Bye Birdie though is the rare exception where the changes made to get it to the big screen were absolutely necessary. And nothing demonstrates this more than the fact that the faithful 1995 TV version is a lumbering slowmoving mess that manages to demonstrate perfectly how what plays great on the stage does not always translate effectively to the film medium.By contrast the 1963 film version decided to make itself a bright colorful film extravaganza that played to the strengths of the film medium. And the results in my opinion worked wonderfully. To a stage fan like citybuilder who rips the changes from the play he needs to stop and think of how the structure of the stage version which has the Sullivan show moment and the punching of Conrad as an Act I finale would never have worked on film. It simply makes more cinematic sense to move that to the end. And the whole big deal over Rose's ethnicity which was really done to showcase the talent of Broadway lead Chita Rivera would have been a distraction as well because spotlighting Albert's mother as a racist would have gone against the whole tone of the movie and truth be told Spanish Rose is not that great a song. Likewise it's better to have Albert sing Put On A Happy Face to Rose rather than a nameless Conrad Birdie fan we never see again.Dick Van Dyke and Paul Lynde offer the right amount of gravitas from the Broadway cast Janet Leigh in her black wig gets to show off her dancing talent which she seldom got a chance to do her singing is admittedly a bit thin but she gets by and of course AnnMargret totally elevates the role of Kim McAfee into a star vehicle and who can blame them for doing this? Her rendition of the title song written for the film is enough to leave one gasping for air yet she still manages to be convincing as the wideeyed teenager just the same.Ultimately stage fans can be satisfied that they got the version they prefer done on film though it should be noted that the 95 version is not a pure rendition of the 1960 stage script but rather the 1991 touring revival but movie fans got the better end of things with this version in 1963. It will never be among the great movie musicals but it is two solid hours of colorful early 60s fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "When 'Bye Bye Birdie' was the hit of the '59'60 season on Broadway it was as much for its satirical edge as for the talent on stage or the innovative direction by Gower Champion. By that time it was only too clear to savvy adults that Elvis Presley and rock'n'roll had been thoroughly coopted and mainstreamed by Hollywood and Madison Avenue. For all its supposed danger and subversiveness in 1956 Rock was a pop culture commodity like any other by the end of the decade.And by the time BYE BYE BIRDIE hit the screen in 1963 that point was too obvious to have any edge. Presley had long since become a bland and unfashionable movie personality and rock itself had devolved into the kind of inconsequential JuneMoon tunes that in a slightly different form had been hit parade staples for decades.So the point is the teen world BYE BYE BIRDIE was parodying was largely gone by that time already. Just a year later when the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan ironically he was still a King Maker but not for much longer that world began to dissolve and reform unforgettably. So BIRDIE is the swan song for an era and an expression of Baby Boom nostalgia for kids who were too young to have enjoyed the '50s in quite the same way their older brothers and sisters had. How many children in '63 thrilled to the vigorous twitching of AnnMargret and Bobby Rydell hoping that was the teen world that awaited them in the future only to discover by '68 that alienation and anger were the currency of the day? Not that those emotions were misplaced  the times themselves demanded them. But there was a sense of loss too a sense that we had been cheated out of fun silly twitchy dances and full skirts and snug pastel pullovers. There's a reason this film made an indelible impression on children then and perhaps most on girls and gay boys.It was an oldfashioned musical in a movie era that was confused but evolving rapidly and AnnMargret was a transitional star of that moment. A throwback to another Hollywood she gets the traditional star buildup here and it works spectacularly. Like Rita Hayworth in GILDA AM was the goodbad girl  fresh and sweet and direct enough to please any elder but with a smoldering animal eroticism so potent the screen seemed barely able to contain it. She is hot in the runway opening and delicious thereafter but she doesn't really become a star until a pivotal moment in the 'Got A Lot Of Livin' To Do' number when her eyes narrow she smiles and grits her teeth and her hands envelope the head of a chorus boy while she parses out the lyrics of female sexual emancipation  Daddy won't know his daughter indeed.It was a sexual call to action that kids understood and responded to. So THIS was what being a teenager would be like! In that moment and the few minutes that followed even gay boys felt the tops of their heads come off. It's an excitement that doesn't return until the coda once again AM is on the runway but this time any pretense that she is sweet innocent Kim McAfee has gone  this is AnnMargret and the sexual light and heat of a new star is palpable. Unfortunately she was almost immediately to become outdated. Within a few years she was a joke in pictures and had to wait until 1971 and CARNAL KNOWLEDGE to make a 'comeback'  at the age of 30 no less. She had made the mistake of starting too late and being too traditional a Hollywood star just when Hollywood decided to do away with stars at least those that were provokingly lovely.So BIRDIE trembled on the edge of a new harsher era and those of us who were caught on the cusp of that upheaval feel great affection for the fantasy of rock stars like Birdie for Sweet Apple High and for the bouncy shiny crisp teenagers we never were.".

	onyx:emotionText "When 'Bye Bye Birdie' was the hit of the '59'60 season on Broadway it was as much for its satirical edge as for the talent on stage or the innovative direction by Gower Champion. By that time it was only too clear to savvy adults that Elvis Presley and rock'n'roll had been thoroughly coopted and mainstreamed by Hollywood and Madison Avenue. For all its supposed danger and subversiveness in 1956 Rock was a pop culture commodity like any other by the end of the decade.And by the time BYE BYE BIRDIE hit the screen in 1963 that point was too obvious to have any edge. Presley had long since become a bland and unfashionable movie personality and rock itself had devolved into the kind of inconsequential JuneMoon tunes that in a slightly different form had been hit parade staples for decades.So the point is the teen world BYE BYE BIRDIE was parodying was largely gone by that time already. Just a year later when the Beatles appeared on Ed Sullivan ironically he was still a King Maker but not for much longer that world began to dissolve and reform unforgettably. So BIRDIE is the swan song for an era and an expression of Baby Boom nostalgia for kids who were too young to have enjoyed the '50s in quite the same way their older brothers and sisters had. How many children in '63 thrilled to the vigorous twitching of AnnMargret and Bobby Rydell hoping that was the teen world that awaited them in the future only to discover by '68 that alienation and anger were the currency of the day? Not that those emotions were misplaced  the times themselves demanded them. But there was a sense of loss too a sense that we had been cheated out of fun silly twitchy dances and full skirts and snug pastel pullovers. There's a reason this film made an indelible impression on children then and perhaps most on girls and gay boys.It was an oldfashioned musical in a movie era that was confused but evolving rapidly and AnnMargret was a transitional star of that moment. A throwback to another Hollywood she gets the traditional star buildup here and it works spectacularly. Like Rita Hayworth in GILDA AM was the goodbad girl  fresh and sweet and direct enough to please any elder but with a smoldering animal eroticism so potent the screen seemed barely able to contain it. She is hot in the runway opening and delicious thereafter but she doesn't really become a star until a pivotal moment in the 'Got A Lot Of Livin' To Do' number when her eyes narrow she smiles and grits her teeth and her hands envelope the head of a chorus boy while she parses out the lyrics of female sexual emancipation  Daddy won't know his daughter indeed.It was a sexual call to action that kids understood and responded to. So THIS was what being a teenager would be like! In that moment and the few minutes that followed even gay boys felt the tops of their heads come off. It's an excitement that doesn't return until the coda once again AM is on the runway but this time any pretense that she is sweet innocent Kim McAfee has gone  this is AnnMargret and the sexual light and heat of a new star is palpable. Unfortunately she was almost immediately to become outdated. Within a few years she was a joke in pictures and had to wait until 1971 and CARNAL KNOWLEDGE to make a 'comeback'  at the age of 30 no less. She had made the mistake of starting too late and being too traditional a Hollywood star just when Hollywood decided to do away with stars at least those that were provokingly lovely.So BIRDIE trembled on the edge of a new harsher era and those of us who were caught on the cusp of that upheaval feel great affection for the fantasy of rock stars like Birdie for Sweet Apple High and for the bouncy shiny crisp teenagers we never were.";

Yes we all know how it's a parody of Elvis so I won't go there but add Ed Sullivan russians slamming shoes on the table etc. That was an era that would end too soon. On a personal note my father tragically died early in 1964 so this movie does bring back very special memories for me Other than that while it's in no way a break through in cinema it's sheer joy from beginning to end. And just look at the list of names of people connected with this that would go on to become major stars after this Dick Van Dyke AnnMargret Paul Lynde Maureen Stapleton the musical comedy writing team of AdamsStrouse and keep any eye out for some extras including Kim Darby !

The theatrical film production of Bye Bye Birdie is leaps and bounds of fun over its stage counterpart and the wretched TV remake.  Every cast member gives it their all with scene stealing performances from Paul Lynde from the Broadway cast and Maureen Stapleton. Dick Van Dyke from the Broadway cast and Janet Leigh are wonderful as Albert and Rosie Bobby Rydell proves that he can act and dance as well as sing but it is AnnMargret who caused such a sensation when the film was released.  She may not exactly look like any sixteen year old you know but she's just plain perfect in the role.  The musical numbers choreographed by Onna White are exceptional.  Every one of them is a highlight.  This is one of the best screen musicals ever.  Don't miss it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Although George Sidney directed some classic MGM musicals his adaptation of the Tonywinning Broadway hit Bye Bye Birdie for Columbia is not often mentioned. The oversight is unfair because Birdie is a lively tuneful and often inventive film musical. Where Grease strove to create nostalgia by invoking the 1950's and 60's Birdie was filmed in 1963 and is the real thing. Although the music is generally more Broadway than late50's rock the film includes a genuine 1950's teen heartthrob in Bobby Rydell and an authentic icon of the period in Ed Sullivan. Both Rydell and Sullivan were still popular when the film was made and unlike the bygone stars in Grease were not dragged from the attic for walkons.Conrad Birdie a thinly disguised Elvis has been drafted. Aspiring songwriter Dick Van Dyke and his secretary Janet Leigh in an awful black wig concoct a plan to have Birdie bestow a goodbye kiss on one lucky girl and sing a song to be written by Van Dyke. All of this to take place on the Ed Sullivan Show. Ann Margret from Sweetwater Ohio is the lucky girl.Although AnnMargret is a bit hot to be the steady of Bobby Rydell she is dynamite on the dance floor and smolders during her numbers. Obviously the director and producer fell in love with her and she upstages everyone including two members of the original Broadway cast Van Dyke and Paul Lynde. However Lynde does hold his own as AnnMargret's father and he has an amusing musical number in Kids. Also funny is Maureen Stapleton who stomps around in sensible shoes and a fur coat as Van Dyke's mother. To Leigh's frustration Stapleton does everything to keep her baby from falling into marriage and out of her control.Bye Bye Birdie has a number of good songs some lively choreography and clever effects that distinguish it from the more traditional musicals like Show Boat that Sidney directed for MGM. Although Van Dyke has the central role he is not a standout. Perhaps the part of Albert Peterson was meant to be a bland foil for the two women in his life who spar for control. Although Leigh is miscast as Rosie DeLeon a Latina part that belongs to Chita Rivera she does well despite the wig. However AnnMargret opens the film closes the film and in between sizzles and dazzles in a starmaking role.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really mean it. On the surface it appears to be a funny innocent slaphappy musical. And it is  at least during the first half of the movie. Then it starts to wink at itself. I was ten when I first saw it and though I enjoyed it a lot of it went way over my head. Watching it now ten years later I realize that BYE BYE BIRDIE is actually a smart sophisticated satire that's not for kids.The title character is Conrad Birdie a vain oily rock'n'roll star who's been drafted by the army. In fact the movie focuses not so much on him as it does on the other characters  a songwriter and producer Dick Van Dyke his girlfriend Janet Leigh and a teenage girl named Kim AnnMargret. Forget Jesse Pearson who plays Conrad it's Van Dyke and Margret's movie all the way.As I said this film is actually a satire. There are so many injokes and jabs at the 1960s that watching it is almost like reading an issue of MAD or CRACKED magazine. In particular the Cold War comes in for some heavy ribbing this movie was made during 1962 the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis the Soviets are made to look like pompous buffoons with one guy even whacking himself in the head with his shoe hint hint. It's still pretty funny nearly four decades later but I can imagine how much more of a punch it would have packed back during those foreboding times. In other scenes the movie predates the style of John Waters by poking some fun at suburbia.Lots of satire  and most of it decisively adult. You can bet that kids simply won't understand the scathingly sarcastic remarks delivered by Kim's Archie Bunkeresque father Paul Lynde or Kim's budding sexuality. And of course they're not going to be familiar with Ed Sullivan himself. Still there are lots of joyfully kinetic dance numbers and memorable songs most notably Going Steady Got a Lot of Livin' To Do and the tune everybody remembers Put on a Happy Face. Kids will want to fastforward the VCR to the musical numbers and also the funniest moment in the picture which involves a glass of drugged milk and a ballet conductor.An excellent wellmade highly underestimated comedy and infinitely superior to the madeforTV version from 1995. So get a bowl of popcorn and check out this classic piece of popular culture. Just be prepared to explain a lot to the kiddies...".

An excellent piece of musical filmmaking.  The casting is superb and I still laugh throughout the movie.  Dated?  Somewhat.  Perhaps only superficially.  'N Sync was just in town and their effect here makes me think there's something fundamentally timeless about the behavior of teenage girls.  I've heard it was the same when Frank Sinatra was a young singer. And there may be something timeless about us guys too... I'm still a sucker for the beginning and ending with AnnMargret singing.  She opens the movie sounding like a whining petulant little girl and at the end her reprise is as a worldly sophisticated sexkitten.  Just too cool.".

	schema:headline " Original Broadway Cast Members save the film Others distract by miscasting.";
	schema:reviewBody "The original Kim McAfee on Broadway was a typical small town girl not a bigbreasted pinup. As charismatic as AnnMargret was in this her presence is a major distraction and by having her belt the newly written title song over both the opening and closing credits shows where the focus will be. She's certainly soft and sells How Lovely to Be a Woman very well changing from teen glam to jeans sweat shirt and baseball cap and for this she can be forgiven the excesses given to her by the film's producers. She certainly gives her all singing tenderly with Bobby Rydell the film's major love song One Boy and it isn't her fault that she was shapelier than most teens of the era. Like Marilyn in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes this changes the mood of the film and results in a different Bye Bye Birdie than what was seen on stage.The stars on Broadway were Dick Van Dyke and Chita Rivera and while Van Dyke returns for this his film debut Rivera has been replaced by the nonLatina Janet Leigh. Unlike Rita Moreno who was an extremely appropriate recast for the film version of West Side Story Leigh's obvious American looks sneak through the short black wig even if the character of Rose is obviously American born. Still Leigh puts forth her best effort appearing only a little embarrassed at times for taking over a part she knew deep inside she wasn't quite right for and should be praised for her bravery in possible public backlash. Rivera would prove her screen mettle only once as Shirley MacLaine's sidekick in Sweet Charity and even if producers felt she didn't have the box office appeal for this film Ms. Moreno would have fit the part better.Van Dyke however is outstanding but this is barely even close to what he had done on stage. Yes he is the songwriter and rock star agent for Conrad Birdie Jesse Pearson and takes Sweet Apple Ohio by storm by getting him to kiss Kim before he goes off to the army with the Ed Sullivan Show present to record it for posterity. Kim's parents are aghast by the invading of their home by Birdie and company none more than Harry McAfee Paul Lynde who isn't happy until he finds out that his hero Ed I Love You! will be recording his daughter being kissed on National Television. In the Broadway versions Van Dyke sings his big number Put on a Happy Face to a group of teens at the train station to cheer them up over Birdie's drafting. But here it's changed to a duet between Van Dyke and Leigh's happy conscience as she sits there in a grumpy mood watching. Disney might as well have produced this by the presence of some silly animation. Still this is one of the great standards of Broadway so it is great to hear in any shape or form. More successful is Birdie's Honestly Sincere in which all the women of the town and a few young men pass out at the swiveling of his hips. After years of fame on Broadway Maureen Stapleton was now famous enough on screen to garner the role of Van Dyke's harpy mother clad in mink coat and rubbers covering sensible shoes. The stage version was much more comical than what is written here Stapleton directed to overplay the bossy condescension towards Leigh and as a result her character is much more characterature than flesh and blood. She's really hard to take especially when she pushes her way between Lynde and his wife as they sit alone in the school auditorium.Everything comes together for two late musical sequences Gotta Lot of Living to Do! and Leigh's Shriner Ballet in which her grave miscasting is all of a sudden forgiven. Columbia obviously had no faith in the success of the original Broadway version adding in a Russian ballet that is somehow speeded up thanks to medication in the conductor's milk resulting in a silly sequence that slows down the action and really serves no purpose than to add tension if Birdie will have time to sing his final song and get to kiss Kim.What is more heartbreaking about this movie is the fact that it was directed by George Sidney responsible for many of MGM's great musicals of their golden era. But Van Dyke and Lynde both then becoming very famous thanks to their television appearances save the day Van Dyke's rubber face and legs prominent yet never hiding his handsome looks and Lynde's cynical line delivery perfect for his big showstopper Kids What's wrong with Sammy Kaye? and of course his declaration of affection towards the undisputed king of the variety show Ed Sullivan who is amusing in his few scenes in this film as he was in the first big nun musical The Singing Nun several years later.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many of the comments on this page have been negative... saying the film was horribly butchered with ridiculous plot twists and a horrible Conrad Birdie and better yet a sorely miscast Janet Leigh.  I beg to differ!I have been a fan of this film for years and recently bought the 1995 version.  While the film DID change plot aspects as oft happens when a Broadway show is brought to Hollywood and I realize that Dick Van Dyke and Paul Lynde were very upset by this and delete songs most of them belonging to Rosie who happens to be my favorite character it is a far cry better than 1995's TV version.1995's version bored me.  The only good thing about it was the inclusion of An English Teacher Normal American Boy What Did I Ever See in Him? Baby Talk to Me and a ridiculously altered Spanish Rose and a great performance by Vanessa Williams.  Too bad she definitely didn't look Hispanic.  The choreography was boring the cast paled Jason Alexander was all right just not an Albert type and Marc Kudisch was disgusting as Conrad Birdie... it just wasn't FUN.But this version is.  Dick Van Dyke repeating his Broadway role is superb. I love this man and he's SUCH a triplethreat talent it's insane.  He's hilarious as Albert the mama's boy who's been taking his lovely little Rose for granted.  Rose.  Little rose.  A precious flower that I trampled on. Then you have AnnMargret.  Yes we know she's sexy but there is more to her than sexappeal.  Her vocals in this film are incredible much more big Broadway sounding than Chynna Phillips could ever hope to be and far more believable as Kim.  She's great.  Paul Lynde is HILARIOUS.  He is THE Harry MacAfee without a shred of doubt.  As incredible as his and Dick Van Dyke's performances were I must say you couldn't tell that they hated this film. For some reason I really enjoyed the mother in this film as well... reminded me a bit of Donna Reed in character and style.  Maureen Stapleton is perfect as overbearing obnoxious Mae Peterson.  And Bobby Rydell is the BEST Hugo Peabody.  He's funny he's kind of gawky but highly adorable... he's terrific.  But let's get to the one person that everyone seems to dislike in her role as Rosie.Janet Leigh.Granted her voice is not up to par with the likes of Chita Rivera.  But really who is?  Chita could have done a terrific job in this role but I understand that they were looking for a name and there honestly was no one better than Janet Leigh.  She's funny she's beautiful she's warm she's charismatic and at least she's onkey!  Her dance with the shriners is a riot and there is nothing cuter than the moment when Albert catches her in his arms.  She and Dick Van Dyke have amazing chemistry in this film.So would I recommend this movie over the 1995 version? ABSOLUTELY.  ANY DAY!".

For me it brings back a time of domestic simplicity and carefree ways that in today's society aren't really stressed too highly.  All right I will readily admit this I was not even alive when the film was made but just seeing the way the settings and the overall pastely look of the film is the biggest treat.  I especially love the scene between Dick Van Dyke and Janet Leigh out in the garden One Boy and Put on a Happy Face.  That gazebo!  That astroturf! The little stream! It looks almost like heaven! And of course the late great Paul Lynde.  What more can I say?  As a fan of the film musical and musicals in general my only regret whenever I see this film is that they didn't use the full score as it was written for the theater.  I would have really loved to have seen Spanish Rose done for posterity on film.  Another issue I have with the film is that I really do think that they could have at least tried to get Miss Chita Rivera to reprise her role as Rose de Leon in the film on the stage it's Rose Alvarez.  Some of my favorite musical numbers in the film areThe Telephone Hour an alltime great One Boy a great duet with fabulous camera angles and Hymn for a Sunday EveningEd Sullivan what can I say other than Paul Lynde was great in this oneAll in all this a great fun and lighthearted no brainer of a film taking us back to another era in American History.  Watch this one and enjoy it! Put on a happy face!Rating 4 stars".

I know that woman and she's my former motherinlaw only Stapleton's version is the funny one.  Being a female I can say I see that AnnMargaret looks great in this film and I understand why so many of the male people who have commented here have spoken at length about her performance.  I do want to say something about Jesse Pearson who plays Conrad Birdie.  I disagree strongly with what others here have said I think he did a fabulous job as the Elvis impersonator he was slotted to play.  He's got the Elvis looks the swagger the voice he's tall and he has a great dimpled smile.  He's quite sexy indeed.  And so unlike that yobo they landed for the '95 TV version who's as sexy as Wonder bread and has the voice that I imagine Maureen Stapleton would have if she ever sang.  UGH! In every way this 1963 movie version is vastly superior to the TVplay version of '95.".

The real purpose of their visit is to solve unfinished family matters but they soon loose the grip and find themselves fleeing the answers they came looking for. The girls are rescued by Rni a local fisherman who gives them a lift in his old Ford Granada decorated with zebra covers flower lights and a stuffed crocodile in the back. On their journey up north they meet among others a fallen rocksinger missionary grandparents thirsty wedding guests and a Jesus wannabe.

It was the first time I had ever seen a film in the Faroese language even BARBARA  a film based on Faroese legend  is in Danish. There have been a couple of films before this one in Faroese but I hadn't had the chance to see them I have seen one since. I loved this movie for those reasons but I also thought it was quite enjoyable in and of itself. I would have to see it again before I could speak more critically on it since on the first viewing I was just so excited to see it all. But some interesting things to watch in this film are the hints of colonialism and the search for identity that I feel are such a part of the Faroese psyche. Notice the relationships with the Danes  who speak only Danish in the film for those who don't pick it up. This film is also truly quirky which makes it a lot more interesting to me than other road films. As a film grad style counts a lot for me since so many films are so devoid of it.

Many aspects of it are just too clich andor out there for me to have enjoyed it.One great scene in the movie spoiler is when the two characters checked into the hotel and spoke french thinking that the lady behind the counter didn't speak the language. spoiler end Great scene and seeing as it was in the very beginning of the movie I thought Hey this movie seems alright... Wrong! Even though it still had it's moments they were all to scarce and far between all the rubbish and bad acting that I again was almost on the brink on turning off the TV even though this was the first faroese movie ever made!!! I didn't turn the TV off... I watched the whole thing and ended up with the feeling off annoyance. That a movie with the potential for being a good one had to turn in to such crap just because Katrin threw all realism towards faroese lifestyle and people out the window just so she could follow the road movie format...But in conclusion this is a special movie for me only because it is the only one of it's kind and therefor I give it a 5 in hopes that there are more and better movies to come...Spoiler! PS When saying that the movie was out there and not very realistic I was in particular referring to Jhan  Kollafiri getting his ass kicked by the gangsters... What the hell was that all about!?!?".

Okay i'll put it simply it's funny and it's fun and in a way anyone can understand. I walked away feeling good feeling happy and not feeling like i had been treated to a cheese feast like some light comedies. I have seen other examples of comedy from the Asian countries and maybe i just didn't get the subtle cultural jokes along with the others but i saw the comedy was very accessible beyond national boundaries. I was also surprised to see a comedy from Tsui Hark after being introduced to him through his much more tragic and pessimistic Green Snake. As for Hark he gives a fluid and lyrical direction along with a sense of timing which helps make this movie.

Trops that you see in cooking dramas and even cooking style anime is here to please the fans. Amidst all of the when i am older watching this movie what it is ismore than a cooking competition show . It is in its core a story of heart and love for the things that you do and the one that you love. Even if the subtitle is noy great im sure since meaning is always lost in translation a qoute from the movie for you it will all be for you still left me crying.";

Maybe it was because I finally had something on TV I could understand or at least read the subtitles or maybe it was just funny. Whatever it was this movie was worth the time.I had just arrived for my foot and head massage when they gave me the remote so I could watch TV. Usually I would turn the darn thing off but I stumbled upon this crazy movie and got hooked.The plot if you could call it a plot sort of revolves around a cooking competition and sort of is a love story and the food in this movie is the real star. If you like Iron Chef and many of the other cooking shows currently in the reality TV mode then you will love the scenes with food in this movie.It goes fast and the subtitles are so fast you better be up on speed reading for this one. However the action is mostly slapstick so you don't always have to read the entire subtitle to get the idea.The main actress is lovely eye candy and the main actor isn't bad to look at either. They are both worth watching. Finally if you have some time to kill and want a good laugh this isn't a bad choice for both.I don't speak a word of Chinese but I was totally able to understand the cultural humor of this film. For those who do speak Chinese maybe it is even better. Overall I give this an 8 out of 10 and currently I am even looking to find a copy to have while I stay in China and keep for when I come back home it will be a nice reminder for me of my time in Yangchun and a silly afternoon at the massage salon watching a silly movie.".

Supporting characters are also based on real people but their names were top secret in the Soviet Union. Today astronautics.com reveals some of the real names and accurate original cast from the German premiere booklet. Soviet censorship pressured the filmmakers by ordering many scenes to be deleted so the storyline was altered several times.The film's release was planned on April 12 1971 the 10th anniversary of Gagarin's flight but the film was censored. It was buthchered several times until it was seen by the Defence Minister Ustinov and General Secretary Brezhnev which led to further censorship related to rocket science and politics. What's left of the original film today is a patchwork of scenes about rocket launches technical discussions mixed with politics and a fictitious love story. Paranoia of the Cold War is shown in scenes with nervous discussions about the arms race. Filming locations were top secret in the Soviet Union such as the Baykonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and the Gagarin Space Center near Moscow. The Soviet Red Army guarded the secrets of rocket science technology so several scenes where actors did a good job with rocket equipment were deleted. Filmmakers expressed regrets that several beautiful scenes on location at Baykonur Cosmodrome were deleted by the Soviet censorship. The original director's cut lost many scenes before it was cleared for public release in April 1972. While the original director's cut ran almost four hours the released version was reduced down to two and a half hours. Director Khrabrovitsky was under pressure from Soviet leaders who guarded their secrets. Before the reduced version was released to public I was at the private showing where director Khrabrovitsky presented the director's cut to the cast and crew it was a longer version of the film that is unavailable today. I still remember vividly my impressions from meeting the actors who portrayed historic characters. Filmmakers were half happy after some rough censorship and delays the film was finally allowed for public release albeit in a reduced version.The film's timeline spans from the first experimental rockets in the 1920s to the Katyusha in WWII to the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and the flight of Gagarin the first man in space in 1961. The scenes of the illfated Soviet Moon program were censored. But in 1969 American astronauts walked on the Moon and two more landed there in 1971 leaving the Soviets behind. Then the Soviet leadership released this film where space race and arms race are shown from the Soviet side. Stalin and the nuclear scientist Kurchatov are portrayed with careful exaggeration as well as historic figures of Tsiolkovsky and Gagarin. The fictitious parallel story of the main character's wife has no chemistry while his mother's story is nice. Cinematography with two cameras is impressive and the music score by Andrei Petrov is memorable. Director Khrabrovitsky works with some of the finest Russian actors such as Lavrov Smoktunovsky Popov Gorbachyov Kuznetsova and Gerdt among others. Lavrov's range and nuanced acting is arguably the best in his entire career.Part of the art of filmmaking is about editing the truth cleverly in order to improve the story. This film was a work of art before it was butchered by the Soviet censorship.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ukroshcheniye ognya 1972 is probably among several most important visual documents of the 20th Century RussianSoviet history. The film was made in dangerous times of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the USA when the two superpowers were about to destroy each other with nuclear missiles. Deadly Russian missiles and nuclear explosions and more interesting stuff is superbly shown in this epic film. It isn't important that the leading character is based on Sergei Korolyov who was the number one rocket scientist in the Soviet Union. More important about this movie is the rare view through the Iron Curtain an original insight into the Kremlin politics some intriguing atmosphere of Soviet secrecy and enigmatic ambiance of Russian military science of that era. Lavrov's acting is superb as he leads a nice ensemble of top Russian stars such as Smoktunovsky Kuznetsova Gerdt and Popov with other actors. Excellent cinematography with two cameras. Powerful depiction of the first military use of missiles during the Nazi invasion of Russia in WWII. Interesting shots of Russian space centers and rare footages from the original flight of Gagarin  the first man in space. This epic is a desirable collector's item.".

The character called Andrei Bashkirtsiev is actually Sergei Koroliov the father of soviet spaceships. I don't know why they didn't use his real name maybe some sort of state secret?. In this film there is also a scene where another famous scientific appears Kurchatov the maker of the first soviet atomic bomb. Also the actor that does the role of Yuri Gagarin resembles quite much the real one. Photography here is excellent and also the music. It's a very well done score. I saw this film a couple of times more than 30 years ago and I still remember the scene when they take the big rocket out of the hangar en route to the launching pad. By the way the dialog between Gagarin and BashkirtsievKoroliov was the real one as Gagarin told later Koroliov What would you think of a flight into space? just a small trip to and fro. Gagarin It's OK if there's enough fuel. I still remember that phrase when he is shown the first prototypes of jet fighters Piervava liubov First love because he started thinking about building jets but then dedicated himself to rockets. The famous Katiushas. Among the many historical characters depicted here there is a very important one Konstatin Tsiolkovsky. He was interpreted by the famous classical Russian actor Innokenti Smoktunovsky.".

Before WWII he was in prison in GULAG camp then in sharashka  a secret research center under supervision of NKVD. Anyone interested in real facts of Korolev would read Wikipedia and would not not watch this movie.Next is the main idea that is driving Bashkirtsev flying into space to Mars and to Moon. This movie never says that the main goal of Korolev research center was to create an intercontinental ballistic missile. A space program was just a side project that was used later by Soviet government as another propaganda vehicle. Thsi movie shows as if Bashkirtsev is a lunatic driven by a single idea to launch rockets into space and military usage of rockets has nothing to do with him or the whole Baikonur launch site. This is again a propaganda clich.".

The writer and director is Roland Klick and he was not even 30 when he made this film a contender for the most known work of his career now that he is approaching 80. But I really hope it is not his best as the watch was fairly forgettable and I personally did not care for any of the protagonists especially not the very young one referenced in the title. Luckily for us the film stays under 90 minutes. Still I must say it was not a complete failure but not a success either. It is very much on par with the 1960s in terms of German cinema a decade that is probably the weakest of the second half of the 20th century and some may even argue weakest decade of the entire century if they love silent films especially. I am not familiar with Klick and I cannot say that this film made me curious about other projects from his body of work. Same can be said about the cast. No big names here but nobody stands out either. The character development is also subpar. As a whole this is a very mediocre outcome with regard to everything. I do not recommend the watch.".

Adolphe Menjou is an ideal choice to play this kind of genial cad.  Gail Patrick also is perfect as an elegant but venomous young performer.  Constance Collier is amusing as the wouldbe mentor for the younger actresses.  Andrea Leeds is very sympathetic in her role.  Most of the other characters in the boarding house get only small stretches of screen time but they all make good use of it.  It's also enjoyable just to see the likes of Ann Miller Lucille Ball and Eve Arden in some of their earlier roles.The cast is the most obvious of its strengths but the writing is also quite good and Gregory La Cava's direction is very good maintaining a good pace without rushing anything and keeping a good balance between the amusing and the serious sides of the story.

It's a brilliant way to spend a couple of hours where else would you get an allstar cast that would make your jaw drop today Katharine Hepburn Ginger Rogers Lucille Ball Eve Arden Ann Miller etc. etc. and a clever witty script played to the hilt by the astounding cast? The story is fairly simple Terry Randall Hepburn moves into the Footlights Club to begin her career as an actress. Viewed as an odd cookie by the rest of the girls her roommate Jean Rogers especially she starts to win them over until she wins the part belonging to Kaye Andrea Leeds. Not wins so much as given. It takes a tragedy to turn Terry into the actress she could be and the friend she eventually becomes as she remains in the Footlights Club.This film benefits from a truly amazing cast Hepburn is glorious as Terry an independent inyourface girl from the upper class unsure why she's not liked by her new friends as she blithely and unknowingly talks down to them but fiercely loyal and protective of them nonetheless. Witness Terry's outburst in Powell's office or the way she puts Jean much the worse for wine to bed. Hepburn is truly great in her emotional scenes when she is called to perform on stage despite the revelation she's received just beforehand. Hepburn alone doesn't make the movie though as she eventually does in lesser vehicles with less worthy costars. Ginger Rogers as Jean is a breath of fresh air. She's quirky charming and just generally appealing in her role playing Jean with a wonderful confidence that bodes well for the character. You warm to Jean immediately. I love Rogers' drunken scenes with Menjouditzy yet sweet. The supporting cast is fantastic as well Lucille Ball never missing a chance to steal a scene or make a quip Eve Arden fast on her heels. Andrea Leeds overacts a little I think but is generally good in her demanding role as Kayeshe does an excellent job on the staircase towards the end of the movie.Absolutely A.

Unlike most classical cinema the goal towards which the film is striving is quite tenuous. Basically the goal is for Katherine Hepburn to get a part in a play and give a good performance but it is never stressed. Instead what we get is more of an ensemble piece. There are characters who are more central than others but we get to know well a great number of characters. And we live with them experience their dreams hardships and successes falling more and more deeply in love with them every minute caring about them as we would dear friends or siblings.It is most often referred to as a comedy and the dialogue tends to be hilarious Ginger Rogers is in full form here wisecracking at the speed of light but the film's drama is very affecting too. This film's ending is so beautiful and like all great films we're reluctant to say goodbye to the characters. Fortunately since I have it on tape I can visit the boarding house any time I want. Unfortunately since this film is neither on VHS nor DVD you probably cannot. Watch for it on AMC or TCM or other stations that play classic films. You will not be disappointed. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "With Katherine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers firmly in place at the acting helm and the combination of Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman as its writers 'Stage Door' could be described as already having a lot going for it. However the biggest coup for the makers of 'Stage Door' was in its superb casting of young female talent the ones who make up the bulk of 'The Footlights Club'. Sure many of the women who star in this film were no strangers in front of the camera by the time they made 'Stage Door' but it should be stated that it was with 'Stage Door' that many of the young players took their first real big step up the ladder of film success Hepburn Rogers and Menjou excluded of course. Lucille Ball had already been in 30 films before landing the role of Judy Canfield the wannabe actress who eventually gives up acting in order to get married. In her 30 films prior to 'Stage Door' Lucille Ball was often just an extra sometimes not even worthy of an ending credit. After this movie she would stand toetotoe with the Marx Brothers in 'Room Service' not in a Margaret Dumont kind of way either and later as a passenger on an illfated flight in 'Five Came Back'. Of course she would ultimately shatter her movieacting career with a career in television on a show that would bear her name. Lucille Ball would become an American icon the first lady of television and perhaps it's most famous personality. You could say that it all really started with her break in getting a part in 'Stage Door'.Eve Arden would remain a Bactor throughout her career but just like Lucille Ball she too would star in her own television program during the later part of the 1950's. Seeing her in the role of 'Eve' it would be easy to say that she was perfectly typecast for 'Stage Door' as herself. But the biggest surprise of young talent in 'Stage Door' comes from Ann Miller. It's hard to believe she was only 14 years old when she made this. Miller would become famous in films such as 'Kiss Me Kate' and 'On the Town' before retiring from making movies in the mid fifties.But about the movie.The dialog in 'Stage Door' sprays the screen in a rapid fire mainly through the cheeky insults traded back and forth from the films' principal stars Hepburn and Rogers. Hepburn plays Terry Randall the spoiled rich girl who relishes an uphill battle whether it's from embarking upon a new profession with no prior skills in that profession like acting or in alienating the poor and desperate women at the Footlights Club by her posh appearance. It's through these attributes that another girl Jean Maitland Ginger Rogers finds her as an archenemy. Naturally Terry and Jean become roommates as this arrangement provides the film with many of its humorous situations.The cynical barbs are not always aimed at each other however. A lot of the time the women appear to be harboring a lot of selfloathing either for themselves or for their career decisions. The film features a lot of cutaway close ups of these oneliners perhaps in an attempt to make the movie not appear too much as a stage play. The close ups also provide many comic visuals such as a lot of eye rolling and shoulder slumping. It's to the film director's credit George La Cava that these actions never really come across as tiresome. When the film frame is widened out from close ups the dialog sometimes overlaps visual jokes whiz by and many different characters run in and out of frame. This is a movie you will have to watch more than once just to hear and see the all of the jokes crammed into its 90 minutes. I'm sure that Howard Hawks watched this film more than once before making 'His Girl Friday'.It's not often one gets to see so many women wearing cynicism as a protective blanket against rejection failure and their own arrested development. This film should be treasured.Oh yeah Ginger Rogers playing a ukulele is adorable.910. Clark Richards".

You could say that it all really started with her break in getting a part in 'Stage Door'.Eve Arden would remain a Bactor throughout her career but just like Lucille Ball she too would star in her own television program during the later part of the 1950's. Seeing her in the role of 'Eve' it would be easy to say that she was perfectly typecast for 'Stage Door' as herself. But the biggest surprise of young talent in 'Stage Door' comes from Ann Miller. It's hard to believe she was only 14 years old when she made this. Miller would become famous in films such as 'Kiss Me Kate' and 'On the Town' before retiring from making movies in the mid fifties.But about the movie.The dialog in 'Stage Door' sprays the screen in a rapid fire mainly through the cheeky insults traded back and forth from the films' principal stars Hepburn and Rogers. Hepburn plays Terry Randall the spoiled rich girl who relishes an uphill battle whether it's from embarking upon a new profession with no prior skills in that profession like acting or in alienating the poor and desperate women at the Footlights Club by her posh appearance. It's through these attributes that another girl Jean Maitland Ginger Rogers finds her as an archenemy. Naturally Terry and Jean become roommates as this arrangement provides the film with many of its humorous situations.The cynical barbs are not always aimed at each other however. A lot of the time the women appear to be harboring a lot of selfloathing either for themselves or for their career decisions. The film features a lot of cutaway close ups of these oneliners perhaps in an attempt to make the movie not appear too much as a stage play. The close ups also provide many comic visuals such as a lot of eye rolling and shoulder slumping. It's to the film director's credit George La Cava that these actions never really come across as tiresome. When the film frame is widened out from close ups the dialog sometimes overlaps visual jokes whiz by and many different characters run in and out of frame. This is a movie you will have to watch more than once just to hear and see the all of the jokes crammed into its 90 minutes. I'm sure that Howard Hawks watched this film more than once before making 'His Girl Friday'.It's not often one gets to see so many women wearing cynicism as a protective blanket against rejection failure and their own arrested development. This film should be treasured.Oh yeah Ginger Rogers playing a ukulele is adorable.910. Clark Richards";

	schema:reviewBody "I have always found this wonderful film neglected and I can't understand why. It's director Gregory La Cava was highly respected for movies like RUGGLES OF RED GAP and STAGE DOOR in the 1930s but never got the sort of notice he deserved. Students of film talk of the De Milles and the Wilders and the Lubitschs and the Fords. They may take serious note of Michael Curtiz or Leo McCarey. But La Cava is sort of relegated with Henry Hathaway or George Marshall as well crafting with his material but nothing outstanding as a type of symbol of their singularity or originality. In fact many people probably think of La Cava more as one of the intimate friends of W.C.Fields like Eddie Sutherland another director than for his films.But in 1937 two years before George Cukor did an all female cast movie THE WOMEN La Cava did this film version of the George F. Kaufman and Edna Ferber drama STAGE DOOR. This film does have men in the cast Samuel Hinds as the wealthy father of Hepburn Adolphe Menjou as the stage producer with the moral code of an opportunist Jack Carson as a suitor for Lucille Ball and Grady Sutton as a suitor for the servant in the boardinghouse Franklin Pangborne as Menjou's too perfect butler Frank Reicher as the stage director  who finally sees his troublesome star perform the role properly in her own way. But most of the really meaty parts go as they should to the women in this cast. The women are all the inhabitants of a boardinghouse in Manhattan for aspiring actresses. As the film progresses we concentrate on Ginger Rogers Katherine Hepburn Andrea Leeds Gail Patrick and Constance Collier. Three others in the supporting cast are notable as their subsequent careers showed Lucille Ball Eve Arden and Ann Miller. Rogers is interested in advancing her career as is Patrick as is Leeds and  as we learn  is Hepburn. But Rogers is street smart and initially she sees that her chief rival is her roommate Patrick who has been romancing Menjou. When Rogers manages to replace Patrick momentarily she does nicely materially as Patrick did but she does not see her career notably advance. She ends the relationship with Menjou by suggesting marriage. Hepburn is determined to show what she can do as an actress she's been to college. All she succeeds is to get a lead role through nothing that she has done  but through outside influences she knows nothing about and her gain is at the expense of the delicate talented and ill Leeds. Hepburn does pick up various pointers about acting from coach and supporting actress Constance Collier but most of the women in the boarding house think the pair of them are snooty phonies.Eventually Hepburn does give the performance of her life  but it takes a tragedy to get her to do it. Up to then her lack of training keeps preventing her from reciting the lines correctly to the dismay of the dramatist as well as Frank Reicher the director. When she is aware of the tragedy an unforgettable moment in the film when it occurs she is transformed into a figure capable of delivering the performance correctly. Hepburn used dialog from a failed Broadway play she did called THE LAKE and the opening scene is shown in the film. It sounds pretentious but her The callalillies are in bloom again.... became part of her legend whenever attempts were made to imitate her in cartoons for example. All the characters and actresses show their strength in the conclusion with Collier demonstrating a surprising strength of character to steel up Hepburn's weakened backbone. Rogers vents her spleen to Hepburn doubly hurtful because she and Hepburn had slowly been working out the problems between them. And so it goes with the rest of the cast. I don't know of too many other ensembles films where everyone had a moment to shine as here THE OXBOW INCIDENT comes close. It was a first rate film and deserves more attention than it has been given over the years by the critics and public.".

Timing is everything and in comedy it's particularly so and the director Gregory La Cava  who cut his teeth in the silent era as a director beginning in 1916  doesn't miss a beat with this one.From a play by Edna Ferber of Giant fame and George S. Kaufman the film tells the story of what happens to a group of aspiring actresses who happen to board at a place called the Floodlights Club in New York City supposedly. Of course there are minor players as in all plays  Lucille Ball Eve Arden Ann Miller and most of the men the exception being Adolphe Menjou as a caricature almost of the Big Bad Producer of those days. The majors Katharine Hepburn as Terry Ginger Rogers Jean Gail Patrick Linda and Andrea Leeds Kay form the core about which this story revolves.Which when all is said and done is about the ascendancy of Terry as an actress and the decline of Kay as another out with the old in with the new if you will. That would tend to make for a somewhat pedestrian story if it were simply that. Happily what sets this apart from say the almost maudlin characterization by Hepburn in Morning Glory 1933 in a similar situation for which however she did receive a Best Actress award in 1934 is first the scintillating dialog. Which means the viewer must really listen it goes so quickly between characters that you'll miss the oneliners and sight gags if you take a chomp on a sandwich or sip of coffee or whatever. So be prepared.What's left? Well of course the great acting by Hepburn Rogers Ball Miller Menjou Arden Patrick and Leeds the latter getting a Best Supporting nomination for her somewhat overly tearful acting so much so she reminded me of Olivia de Havilland in looks and style.The direction already mentioned is in the hands of an old hand and it shows explicitly. Add to that the camera work that included almost manic cuts up and down stairs superb faceon tracking shots and perfect timing while up to a dozen people would mill about in the frame concurrently  and with dialog. Confusing? Perhaps to some. Just concentrate on the majors.What's more interesting for me however is the subtext of this comedy. Made just before USA finally shook free of the Great Depression as you listen you'll hear many references to the hard times at the Floodlights everybody is down but not out rich and unscrupulous producers just want to use and abuse actresses the women are all scraping for even the lowliest acting or dancing job at the meanest of wages despondency and depression are endemic. Despite all of that the women 'soldier' on pushing themselves to their emotional and physical limits.Women in the audience at that time must have felt the pull don't deny your dreams of selffulfillment despite what chauvinistic clods of men might say and do even powerful men. It's a stirring message albeit idealistic but it sets the tone for the larger section of a country that was about to engage in the world war which in a very real sense changed the role of women as never before. So some may die yes but the show must go on...There have been a number of introspective and selfreferential films about the acting business Morning Glory being the earliest I've seen. Others include A Star is Born made and remade many times All About Eve 1950  arguably the best I think  The Dresser 1983 The Player 1992 and others but all heavy dramas. So it's refreshing to find a gem that's prepared to treat the matter lightly more rather than less.A final thought it must have been fun for the actors to act at being actors it's even more fun to know that the director used much of the banter between the women offcamera to actually use in the film  much to the playwrights' displeasure so I understand.Recommended for all.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant Ensemble Showcases Young Actresses Pounding the Pavement in a Classic Dramedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Far more than George Cukor's vitriolic femmeextravaganza The Women this 1937 ensemble dramedy shows how vital women were during Hollywood's golden era especially when they are not relegated to stoic wife roles or placed purely in adversarial positions. Following up on his 1936 screwball classic My Man Godfrey director Gregory LaCava guides a GradeA cast made up primarily of freshfaced actresses many of whom went on to create legendary careers of their own. Speaking the lasersharp dialogue provided by Morrie Ryskind and Anthony Veiller fluidly adapting the original play by Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman the ensemble fills in the distinctive characters with intelligence and enthusiasm. Even though the storyline creaks a little seventy years later this still holds up as a genuine cinematic classic.Mostly set in a ramshackle boarding house one could assume was modeled after Manhattan's Barbizon Hotel for Women the story focuses on the women living there all aspiring actresses who bond amid failed auditions and nonexistent callbacks. It's an unacknowledged sorority house with a den mother and an assortment of theatrical archetypes milling about. At the outset the alpha female is Jean Maitland a dancer whose cynical wisecracks mask an unflagging pride in her talent and integrity. Complications ensue when she is made to room with the new girl Terry Randall a selfconfident debutante whose patrician airs alienate almost everyone around her. Terry is determined to make it on her own as an actress but once word gets to producer Anthony Powell that she is the daughter of a wealthy investor she gets cast in the starring role of a drawing room weepie called Enchanted April. Unfortunately that's the role desperately desired by Kay Hamilton another actress in the house. Kay impressed critics a year prior but she hasn't had any luck in replicating that success. Of course once Terry lands the part she is disastrous in rehearsals until a tragedy occurs. The last part of the movie is played out as pure melodrama but it works in deepening our affections for the characters involved.As Jean an Astaireless Ginger Rogers expertly zings with abandon and grounds the film with her nononsense manner. Katharine Hepburn although playing a blueblood variation of the same actress she played in Morning Glory has the comparatively tougher role as Terry since her character's priggishness must give away to a revelation of humanism. She manages the conversion expertly and parries gleefully with the alwaysready Rogers in the movie's best scenes. Adolphe Menjou has the right gruff spirit as the pompous Powell though he seems a bit weathered to get away with his ladies'man shenanigans. In very early roles Lucille Ball Eve Arden and Ann Miller show off the unique talents that would soon bloom. Arden in particular delivers her scabrous lines with devastating wit. In roles that perfectly reflected their screen personas Gail Patrick plays the nasty Linda with the same venom she spewed as Carole Lombard's talonbearing sister in My Man Godfrey while Constance Collier brings out all the vainglorious pomp in Terry's aging mentor.The standout at the time was Andrea Leeds' poignant turn as Kay. A sharp actress who would retire within a few years of this film Leeds is the only one who doesn't get any funny lines and consequently is made to come across as an oversensitive albeit beloved wet rag. However she makes the most of her last scene to powerful effect. The 2005 DVD has a reasonable though not outstanding print of the aged film. Other than the theatrical trailer there are just two extras. The first is a silly twentyminute musical short from 1937 called Ups and Downs about an enterprising elevator operator who tap dances. It stars a bleached blonde babyfaced June Allyson in her film debut and features an almostasyoung Phil Silvers as a manic tailor. The more interesting extra is a condensed radio production of Stage Door with Rogers and Menjou repeating their roles and Rosalind Russell taking over for Hepburn and Arden taking over for Patrick.".

It can't be denied though that this is an excellent movie about female relationships that predates SEX AND THE CITY by 60 years. One line spoken by one of the minor players in the movie reaffirms that all these women can talk about is men and dating because What else is there?Of course this makes Terry Randall Hepburn an outcast in the boarding house where she has come to reside in while she pursues a career as an actress  grounded selfassured if not a bit arrogant and essaying a variant of the Hepburn persona she not only criticizes the ladies for sitting around and not taking charge of their lives but in doing so alienates the majority of them especially Jean Maitland Ginger Rogers with whom she shares a room with. Jean is a struggling dancer who has a lot of bark and who throughout the movie seems at odds with Terry's attitude. This comes to a head when in a turn of events another roommate Kay Hamilton Andrea Leeds loses a part in the play Enchanted April due to interests invested by Terry's father unbeknownst to her and the play's producer Adolphe Menjou to have her be the actress filling the part Kay wants. Rogers plays Jean reminiscent of Paulette Goddard's portrayal of Miriam Aarons that another femaleheavy picture THE WOMEN and is a good match to Hepburn's haughtiness which would have been hard to counterbalance.If at times a little shrill and cute especially in its stagey feel whenever we see the bit players come on screen and deliver their little more than one line moments STAGE DOOR nevertheless gives a view of what the casting couch system was about especially in the double sequence featuring Rogers and Hepburn as the targets of Menjou's casual lecherous advances and deceitful promises although its portrayal of struggling actresses in the 1930s is a tad unrealistic but who wanted to see realism in a time of massive unemployment rampant poverty? Hence why this boardinghouse is filled with females dressed in gowns closer to Adrian than to what their meager salaries would allow them to wear.Interesting as well is watching Lucille Ball in a rare appearance in an Afilm. Her career until then was mainly Bpictures and would remain so right up until her foray into television as Lucy Ricardo which suffice to say immortalized her beyond her dreams. Ann Miller also has a small part and seeing her here with the confusion of her birth year it's not hard to see a fourteen year old playacting eighteen but already she showed the dancer she'd become in the following decade. Gail Patrick and Eve Arden inhabit underwritten parts made more for wisecracking filler than actual people.A very good movie one that has one of the few subtle acting moments as the one where Andrea Leeds does a reverse Norma Desmond as the voices in her head grow stronger it also bears a passing resemblance to other theatre films such as ALL ABOUT EVE and MORNING GLORY.".

Best.The first thing you have to confront is a tidal wave of fast overlapping group dialogs. The Footlight Club is a flop house for young woman who want to make it on the stage. One zinger after another by these actresses all without jobs but avoiding dejection by sheer humor and sarcasm. It's a dizzy fun beginning and it never lets up. Never. Which is great. We get young Eve Arden even younger Lucille Ball Ginger Rogers in her famous prime she dances briefly and Katherine Hepburn the rising star who is cast perfectly here as someone who doesn't fit in. They even make fun of her accent which the audience can laugh along with knowingly.And then there is plot as several of the actresses get involved in either work or men or both. And some competition and just a little tragedy but very moving and tragic a surprise of tears after all these laughs. Men don't fare well here reminding me of The Women where they don't appear at all. La Cava is as good as they get when the going gets fast and complicated. He reminds me of Michael Curtiz in this way with rooms full of people going every which way and all if it making sense foreground and background music and dialog. You could watch Stage Door twice in a row and still want more. It's a screwball and a fabulous one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Katharine Hepburn takes up residence in a theatrical rooming house in Stage Door one of the great examples of ensemble acting in film. Besides Hepburn the film features Adolph Menjou Lucille Ball Ann Miller Ginger Rogers Andrea Leeds Eve Arden Constance Collier and Gail Patrick. Hepburn is a the daughter of a wealthy man who comes to New York to try her hand at acting. She talks a good game but as we soon learn she has no emotional understanding or connection to acting at all approaching everything intellectually. All of the women are pursuing careers in theater some with more success than others and Patrick has a sugar daddy Menjou. Leeds is the tragic character a star from the previous season who can't find work but is desperate for the lead in Enchanted April. The atmosphere created by director Gregory Lacava perfectly evokes the lively atmosphere of young women living together sitting in the parlor complaining about food men and work or lack of it as they sing joke play piano strum the ukulele and talk on the phone  all at once.The acting is uniformly excellent with each actress creating a unique character. Lucille Ball gives evidence of the comic timing that would make her one of the greatest TV stars of all time and there are plenty of ironic oneliners to be had from Eve Arden and Ginger Rogers matches her in sarcasm. Ann Miller was supposedly 14 when she made this film it doesn't seem possible but that was her story and she stuck to it. We do get to see a little bit of her tapping. Andrea Leeds bearing such a strong resemblance to Olivia DeHavilland gives a touching performance as the doomed Kay who does not have the emotional stability to withstand what can be a devastating career. It's an extremely melodramatic role and rather than have her play against this LaCava had her play to it thus dating what could have stood as a compelling performance even today.The climactic scenes toward the end are pure '30s stripping the film of previous lightness and going into tragedy but are effective and real tearjerkers. By the film's end though we've come full circle.The film is based on the play of the same name which is actually quite different. The whole idea was probably based on the Studio Club in New York City. Stage Door is wonderful and the script acting and direction make it a deeply satisfying experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Katharine Hepburn gave two classic performances as young aspring actresses. The first was Morning Glory which netted her her first Academy Award. The second is this film Stage Door.But there is a world of difference between Eva Lovelace and Terry Randall. Eva's a naive young kid from the sticks with a burning desire for the stage. A whole lot of kindly strangers whom she charms with her naivete help her along until her debut.Terry Randall of Stage Door is the daughter of a millionaire who's brimming with self confidence. She's never really had to worry about where her next meal is coming from. That sets her apart from the other tenants at the theatrical boardinghouse where she's come to reside incognito of course. Kate's father Samuel S. Hinds wants his daughter to give up this foolishness. He can't get anywhere talking to her so he cooks up a plan to secretly back a show being cast by lothario producer Adolphe Menjou with the proviso that his untried daughter be cast in the lead. Kate doesn't know that's why she's been cast in this show.Of course it breaks the heart of fellow boarder Andrea Leeds who was thirsting for a role she would have been great in. Leeds was the only one of the cast up for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. She gives the best performance in the film. Among other things Leeds is doing is starving herself because she can't afford the extra charge for boardinghouse meals. Today we would be calling it bulimia and this may very well have been Hollywood's first attempt to show it. You have to remember that this was the depression and a lot of people went hungry in the Thirties. It wasn't to keep her beautiful figure that Leeds is not eating but the result is still the same.Stage Door proved to be a big break for many. Ginger Rogers got her first good notices as an actress not a musical performer. Lucille Ball also received her first big break in this film she'd been playing bit roles for about five years before Stage Door. Ann Miller made her debut in Stage Door at the age of 14. She lied about her age to the RKO casting people to get the part. But this was Hepburn's film. It's the story of how she actually developed from an airhead debutante to an actress of substance and worth. The key to the film is her change and Hepburn is a good enough actress to make it convincing.".

Leeds was the only one of the cast up for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. She gives the best performance in the film. Among other things Leeds is doing is starving herself because she can't afford the extra charge for boardinghouse meals. Today we would be calling it bulimia and this may very well have been Hollywood's first attempt to show it. You have to remember that this was the depression and a lot of people went hungry in the Thirties. It wasn't to keep her beautiful figure that Leeds is not eating but the result is still the same.Stage Door proved to be a big break for many. Ginger Rogers got her first good notices as an actress not a musical performer. Lucille Ball also received her first big break in this film she'd been playing bit roles for about five years before Stage Door. Ann Miller made her debut in Stage Door at the age of 14. She lied about her age to the RKO casting people to get the part. But this was Hepburn's film. It's the story of how she actually developed from an airhead debutante to an actress of substance and worth. The key to the film is her change and Hepburn is a good enough actress to make it convincing.";

	schema:reviewBody "STAGE DOOR RKO Radio 1937 from the successful stage play by Edna Ferber and George Kaufman is made into a highly popular motion picture under the expert direction of Gregory La Cava. It's not so much a movie about the theater but a story about aspiring actresses living together in a boarding house awaiting for their big opportunity on stage. STAGE DOOR takes an important step in cinema history by pairing for the first and only time Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers the reigning queens of RKO supported by a large assortment of actresses in true fashion living out their life imitating art by playing young hopefuls themselves particularly three honorable mentions the tap dancing Ann Miller in one of her first screen roles and comediennes Lucille Ball and Eve Arden whose recognition and popularity were to be a decade or so away especially on television during the 1950s. As with the others in the story some have taken whatever parts offered never really catching on while others in the cast have disappeared to oblivion. As for its theme from A STAR IS BORN released that very same year STAGE DOOR centers upon life's struggle towards stardom and the lasting appeal it may or may not have for that chosen one.The plot development gets underway at the Footlights Club a theatrical boarding house somewhere in New York City consisting of a handful of individual characters Jean Maitland Ginger Rogers a hardboiled wisecracking dancer whose constant quarrels with Linda Shaw Gail Patrick causes her sophisticated roommate to move elsewhere Kay Hamilton Andrea Leeds a despondent actress whose popularity only year ago finds herself currently unable in getting past the casting office Catherine Luther Constance Collier a hasbeen Shakespearean actress turned acting coach Judy Canfield Lucille Ball from Seattle Eve Eve Arden whose constant companion is her cat the gum chewing Annie Ann Miller among many others. Enter Terry Randall Katharine Hepburn a newcomer to the Footlights Club. She is not immediately liked by her peers and finds things cut out for her when she finds herself rooming with Jean. It is later learned that Randall is none other than Terry Sims a socialite whose ambition is to become an actress much to the discouragement of her father Samuel S. Hinds the Wheat King. As Kay craves for the lead in producer Anthony Powell's Adolphe Menjou upcoming play Enchanted April it becomes an upset to many when the inexperienced Terry is offered the role instead causing Kay to become even more bitter towards herself.STAGE DOOR returns Katharine Hepburn to her origins the theater the type of role that suits her best an aspiring actress. An improvement over her Academy Award winning performance as actress Eva Lovelace in MORNING GLORY RKO 1933 where the focus was centered upon Hepburn alone STAGE DOOR's success relies on the focus on everyone. Hepburn's Terry Randall is much more confident than Eva Lovelace believing acting to be only common sense. Eva in MORNING GLORY was naturally talented. Terry in STAGE DOOR is a bad actress as proved during rehearsals yet when tragedy strikes gives a surprising performance of her life. While Hepburn was worthy for an Academy Award nomination this time around along with Rogers in the supporting category it's Andrea Leeds a name not so well known today on loan from Samuel Goldwyn in exchange for Anne Shirley in STELLA DALLAS whose standout performance was recognized for the supporting category. Had Shirley been a few years older she might have handled the Kay part quite well though not as good as the gentler Leeds.Highly original in many respects with a cast dominated by females STAGE DOOR has its share of actors none as romantic interests. Adolphe Menjou is the middleaged producer who auditions his wouldbe actresses on the casting couch. Rogers taking time away from her dance musicals opposite Fred Astaire doing one number at the Club Grotto opposite Ann Miller has one scene with a guy named Bill William Corson whose character along with other male companions Mr. Milbanks Jack Carson Butch Grady Sutton and Duckenfield Fred Santley are briefly presented and not fully developed.For decades latter reissue prints of STAGE DOOR have been available to commercial and cable television American Movie Classics Turner Classic Movies and later video with opening credits elevating Lucille Ball Ann Miller and Eve Arden to costarring status. The 1937 theatrical print which premiered on TCM in April 2005 and available on DVD brings forth its original opening and closing cast credits with Ball Arden and Miller's names midway towards the bottom with an added bonus of a restored brief segment focusing on poor Kay's tombstone.There is never a dull moment in STAGE DOOR. It's funny sad timely and classic in every sense from its immortal line The calla lillies are in bloom again to the last wisecrack by Rogers. ".

The feeling of seeing the hardest things in a lighter way. this romantic philosophic comedy has a straight line story.A brat Jane Fann wong who doesn't care about life in any manner but the thing is she is living. She can do anything for her drinking and drugs. A sophisticated shy guy Sam Peter Ho who works as a journalist in HK. He needs a story and she has the story nothing but her story. Slowly a sensitive relation develops between them. Circumstances lead them to live under one roof. Here Jane starts living with a hope and Sam with a fear. Then comes the story of separation and reunion. But that is not that simple to say anyway.Well the power of this movie is its simplicity and continuity. Let me tell u one simple sequence after Jane undergoes an eye surgery she comes down by lift of the hospital. On one floor she observes a family crying on death of their relative and on next stop of lift she notices a man in joy on his new born kid. Then the narration thru her says that life is both optimistic and pessimistic it's the what u chose for yourself that matters. see how simple yet powerful.i personally feel that i don't mind watching this movie again and againRaj".

Let's not pretend that sexism and religious hypocrisy are something new...even in our own society. These are men who abuse religious laws and principals for their own gain and too keep women subservient. However the director does show other sides of these characters as well struggling with their own beliefs and decisions in private as to not show weakness in public.The film is beautifully filmed as well with the sweeping shots of the village landscape and the poetic images of chadors moving in the wind.I never come on IMDb to write reviews but 'The Stoning of Soroya M.' was such an intense and beautiful film that I had to spread the word. It deserves a much wider release than its getting because its a breath of fresh air in a summer movie season full of inane comedies and action romps.".

The Stoning of Soraya M. is wellpaced overall and does a fantastic job of bringing the audiences into Soraya's helpless situation as we just as helplessly witness the malicious or cowardly decisions of others that will eventually lead to her demise.The film treats Islam with sensitivity and in no way implicates the religion itself in the brutal practice of stoning. Shohreh Aghdashloo's character a Muslim decries the stoning as against the will of God.It is important to note that the film accurately depicts a stoning and is therefore not for the feint of heart but seekers of truth and justice will appreciate the candor with which it portrays the gruesome nature of the heinous practice.I commend Cyrus Nowrasteh Shohreh Aghdashloo and the film's producers for their courage in making this film.

It may be too visceral for critics also like United 93 but film lovers should definitely seek it out. The ending is not supposed to be a surprise ... we know it is inevitable and that creates a deep empathy for the character and the injustice she experiences. Yes there are more than a few flaws here. Sometimes the score becomes intrusive and there are some lines that don't work. But if audience involvement is any indication this is an unqualified success.".

It's an extremely tough trick to pull off and Marno does so admirably.Navid Negahban is riveting as Ali the husband who falsely accuses his wife of adultery so that he can get out of his marriage in order to be with a much younger woman. One by one he convincesblackmails the people in Soraya's village to turn against her. The moment in which he coerces his young sons into joining the angry mob and to toss rocks at their own mother's head is one of the most powerful horrible scenes depicted in a film in recent memory.It's the type of film that makes your blood boil because of the horrible injustice inflicted upon the innocent. Small intimate and gritty. Highly recommended for those that can take this sort of thing.".

He can't afford two wives so he demands a divorce from Soraya who refuses for economic reasons. Instead Ali conspires with the local mullah  a fraud who has to keep Ali from exposing him  to frame Soraya for infidelity. The evidence is laughably transparent but as Soraya notes in the film voices of women do not matter here.Her aunt Zahra played by Shohreh Aghdashloo provides the central voice for the film. It's mostly told in flashback as she explains what happened to the journalist who only came to town because his car broke down. Aghdashloo provides the voice of conscience and reason in a town gone mad a village where Soraya's own father calls her an unprintable name and where her sons join in the stoning. Even with most of the film in subtitles it is easy to follow and heartbreaking and enraging to watch.The performances are universally excellent. Aghdashloo an Iranian expatriate herself brings Zahra and her defiance and despair to life. Mozhan Marno portrays Soraya beautifully especially in the execution scene. Jim Caveziel plays the journalist and while he doesn't get much screen time he does well with what he has. The villagers are portrayed with surprising nuance. Navid Negahban provides a malevolent presence as Ali while David Diaan's Ebrahim winds up being perhaps the worst of the villains  a good man who refuses to stop an injustice he knows to be happening.It's brilliant infuriating sad powerful and oddly enough ends on a somewhat uplifting note.".

Persian being one of the languages I speak I could relate to the movie to a whole different level.I couldn't help myself but cry Islam was the most peaceful religions yet polluted by lust and greed it has mutated in some what a barbaric perhistoric practice. Womanizing is indeed the highest sin a Muslim can commit after Shirk considering another Sovereign besides one God but Stoning is the highest degree of punishment. Before this stage the Mehram a man who is either a blood relative or a husband has the responsibility to take far less violent steps to try to stop this illpractice. For instance it starts with the husband not talking to his wife then if she continues he would stop sharing his bed and so on and so forth. Under no circumstance is the Man to physically hit a woman. And what about the Man in all this just like a woman is to be stoned if all other methods fail and if proved guilty a Man is supposed to be lashed 70 times in front of a gathering.I couldn't help myself but cry and the last time I cried this hard was eight years back. The innocent women gets the stone while the man is set to roam free. Unfortunately it is true nine out of ten times the so called Justice is clouded with greed and lust hence...I would definitely recommend this movie to EVERYONE specially those involved with Human Rights for all that it is about its about bending the laws and values of a Religion for personal gains which to me is probably the biggest sin bigger than Zinah womanizing greater than Shirk.

Aghdashloo who plays Zahra Soraya's aunt tells the story to a man who's car breaks down in her village.The film is carried by the performance of Shohreh Agdashloo who arguably should have won an Oscar for her stunning work in House of Sand and Fog. The narrative however is so violent brutal and completely chilling it's actually offputting to the viewer. As we watch this woman endure this torment and abuse from her husband and even her children all before even the stoning occurs it becomes a bit too much for audiences to handle.This is based on a true story and in many ways it needed to be told. Although if you're an educated person you would know the woman's battle in the middle east and of course right here on our main land sometimes too but the way director Cyrus Nowrasteh presents the material is terrifying. Getting the viewer's attention is the easiest task when performing such an act of honesty and raw natural spirit demonstrated by Aghdashloo and Marno. Those two are brilliant in their respective roles.The film is gripping and intense with a heartwrenching third act but it's so vicious you might need to disengage from the cinematic experience just give yourself a dose of reality whatever your reality may be. The score and cinematography are superb and of course the performances are as powerful as they are distressing.If you can stomach the film it's definitely worth a watch.

Getting into the bigger picture this film truly portrays that how much ill informed the majority of Muslims and their leaders are about this beautiful religion that is Islam. Instead of being knowledgeable followers of the religion Muslims have become puppets of the people in power who try to manipulate religion for their own vested interests. This is just not the story of one village in Iran these kinds of heart wrenching stories can be found in majority of villages in the Muslim world. I just hope more and more Muslims watch this movie and lessons can be drawn from this so that these kinds of heinous acts are not repeated in future.

The world needs to know the reality of life for women in patriarchal societies and this movie tells just one of the many stories of women who have endured the kind of treatment Soraya did.To sum it up this film broke my heart. The two female leads are such strong actors that you feel like you're experiencing the events with them. You feel their disbelief their rage their fear their helplessness their pain. When Soraya bravely walks to the spot where she knows she will die when she sees the pile of rocks when the first stone strikes her... and the next one and the next one...you feel what she feels. Even though you know from the beginning what happens to Soraya you keep hoping that somehow the events unfold differently than they do. But they don't and the result is absolutely devastating.Be forewarned this film presents a graphic depiction of a public stoning. It is brutal cruel and extremely disturbing. The scenes will stay with you. But that is the point. The world needs to know what Soraya and countless women like her have experienced because educating ourselves is the only way atrocities like this will end.".

With ridiculous and evil aspects of The Middle Eastern culture that promote violence and inequality for women it's no wonder that a film about the horrors a woman faces in The Middle East is breathtaking and disturbingly powerful. A drama set in 1986 Iran and centered on a man Sahebjam whose car breaks down in a remote village and enters into a conversation with Zahra who relays to him the story about her niece Soraya whose arranged marriage to an abusive tyrant had a tragic ending in The Stoning of Soraya M. Unbiased cultural attributes formatted by director Cyrus Nowrasteh portray the harsh reality for women in The Middle East. The previous relationship with Soraya and her family is more haunting than the actual violence she faces. We see how this trapped woman faced her families oppression and how her own husband and sons turned against her throughout her entire life. With stunning cinematography and symbols added in to create an emotional and mental struggle for the audience and the protagonist this film will leave you haunted and moved about a degrading belief system that pollutes a gigantic region of the largest of the seven continents. Not getting too political this film focuses more on how a certain character is trapped in her own life and how hope and desire are what feed her a sense of happiness and relief. Look deeper into the picture and you'll get a fine human drama that activates the most dangerous practice women face in The Middle East.".

Suddenly one day he decides to hitch up with a 14 year old girl instead. That's gratitude for you. But you won't give him a divorce due to the fact it would leave you virtually penniless. So he does the only thing a nasty bastard could do... he makes up a cock and bull story about you having an affair with a neighbour... and enlists the help of the local corrupt law officials in his plan. And the punishment for such a crime is... well look at the title.The Stoning Of Soraya M as told by Soraya's aunt after the event to a journalist is one of the hardest films to watch that I've seen in many a moon. Throughout the sense of injustice and frustration at such an unfair situation makes you want to scream and the uncomfortableness factor is moved up about 50 notches at the stoning itself... when everyone from Soraya's sons to her own father takes it in turns to chuck rocks at her while she's half buried in the soil. Of course the injuries are graphically displayed... Making this possibly the most upsetting final act since Jesus's fate was sealed in The Passion Of The Christ. Both are extended slow deaths where nothing is left to the imagination so make sure you're mentally prepared before submitting yourself to such a brutal experience.Brilliantly acted and echoing with the ring of truth as the epilogue reminds us this sort of barbarism is still taking place all over the world.

	schema:reviewBody "This is almost from the start a painful movie which by the end becomes an absolutely brutal movie and is almost all the way through a very frightening movie. Set during immediate postrevolutionary Iran religious fervour which has little to do with religion and almost everything to do with fervour is running rampant. In the midst of that maelstrom an already abusive husband decides that he wants to divorce his wife so that he can take up with another woman. But then he realizes that he'll have to support her and so he concocts a story accusing her of adultery  the penalty for which is stoning. We watch as the husband engineers rumours and innuendo against his wife we watch as the whispers become shouts and as suspicion becomes rage we watch as almost an entire village turns against a woman that they all seem to know is innocent but whom they nevertheless choose to condemn almost as if this warped action will prove their worthiness to God.It's a brilliant performance from Mozhan Marno as the accused and condemned Soraya. She knows that she's done nothing wrong she has an almost naive conviction that eventually people will realize that. And yet it's clear that from the beginning this cannot be stopped. The momentum is too great there's no way to put an end to it even if there was a desire to.In the end this becomes very graphic and bloody. It does indeed offer a brutal depiction of a stoning and it pulls no punches as we watch a bloodied Soraya slowly die under the barrage of rocks thrown at her. As a viewer you're left with a queasy stomach in stunned silence. In a way although obviously the movies are very different this reminded me just a little bit of The Passion Of The Christ  the bloodiness and inevitability of the end. Those who are remotely uneasy about bloodiness in a movie will want to avoid the last half hour of this. It is not for the feint of heart.The story is true  based on a book by a FrenchIranian reporter played by James Caviezel. As the movie opens he shows up in town on the day after the stoning needing his car repaired. The story is related to him and unfolds for us through the witness of Soraya's aunt Shohreh Aghdashloo. As the movie ends the reporter has to desperately escape the town as he's chased by a mob wanting to prevent him from smuggling the story to the outside world. This movie achieves a delicate balancing act. It shows the dangers of religious extremism but doesn't come across as antiIslam. Indeed Islam is portrayed fairly here Soraya herself and her aunt being faithful Muslims who point out to the men their betrayal of Islam in what they're doing. It would have been easy to turn this into an anti Muslim diatribe. It managed not to turn into that becoming a critique perhaps of culture and of the ability for less than honourable people to use religion for their own unworthy ends. 810".

The men wheel and deal as Ali works out a deal to free the father of his future teen bride. Soraya leaves him to work for a widower and her husband creates suspicions regarding infidelity which if proved under the local laws written by men of course bring charges of adultery which is punishable by stoning to death.A kangaroo court comes together to give a show trial and Soraya is subject to a mockery of justice which is astounding to see. The movie is too important to be turned into political anti Muslim propaganda. All religions can be dangerous when taken to extremes the examples in history are too numerous to recite here. Watch the film for a real life drama about mob mentality and needing to belong to a group without speaking out in dissent  it is a universal message. Lastly the highest accolades to Shohreh Aghdashloo as Zahra and Mozhan Marno as Soraya. The two actresses are tremendous in fact as good as I have ever seen.".

The movie is too important to be turned into political anti Muslim propaganda. All religions can be dangerous when taken to extremes the examples in history are too numerous to recite here. Watch the film for a real life drama about mob mentality and needing to belong to a group without speaking out in dissent  it is a universal message. Lastly the highest accolades to Shohreh Aghdashloo as Zahra and Mozhan Marno as Soraya. The two actresses are tremendous in fact as good as I have ever seen.";

	schema:reviewBody "Shohreh Aghdashloo  Jim Caveizel The Stoning is a foreign film with English subtitles. Some people sadly lack the concentration for such films but this is worth every moment. The film is set in rural Iran shortly after the ousting of the Shah and the introduction of Sharia law. From the producer of The Passion of The Christ it deals with the true story of Soraya a young married Iranian woman who's abusive husband is seeking to divorce her and how he manipulates the Sharia law to solve his problems.Soraya's story is told by her aunt in the form of a narrative as FrenchIranian journalist Freidoune Sahebjam stumbles into the small rural village of Kupayeh. The film has several levels to it. Firstly it's a beautifully shot film with some wonderful cinematography. Secondly the story itself is riveting. It's so well told that it is totally compelling and despite subtitles you are completely riveted. The pacing of the narrative is perfect. There's a few moments of lighthearted daily life to remind you that Soraya was just a normal woman living a normal life in a difficult male dominated primitive society. However for the majority of the film you're swept along by the events of the moment and whilst it's a celluloid narrative you somehow feel as though you're there witnessing it all and frustratingly unable to stop what's happening.There is a third level to this film. It doesn't jump out at you and shout grabbing you by the shoulders and shaking you no this one is very subtle indeed . It's hidden almost subliminal in the occasional line of dialogue or a single scene where there is no dialogue but in the tradition of a picture can paint a thousand words. This third level is the evil that is sharia law. A law which neglects the rights of women and allows men to use and manipulate it twisting it to suit their needs and always claiming that it is God's law God's will. It's important to know that the original book was written by Freidoune Sahebjam and like many Iranians who fled after the Shah was exiled he loved the Iran of old and could see how under the Ayatollah and the Muslim clerics Iran had lost all of it's ancient culture and civilisation to become a primitive land of brutal dictatorial hypocritical tyrants. This view is very cleverly and subtly woven into the fabric of the film like a delicate pattern that you see without seeing.There was something else I found myself wondering whilst watching the stoning where was it shot? Clearly it was in the Middle East. I found myself thinking perhaps it was Turkey or even Israel? The extras all looked Iranian. But knowing how sensitive fanatical Muslims can be about criticising their religion or laws which Islamic country would have agreed to make this film in their country? And would making it in Israel only serve to fan the flames of hatred? Interestingly no where in the ending credits does it say where the film was made. Normally you would see credits such as Lebanon casting Turkey production or Israel transportation. The only relevant credit was right at the very end hidden in small text almost the last thing credited it simply said Shot entirely in the Middle East. Clearly then the producers knew they were making a film that would anger the Iranian Mullahs and Islamic fundamentalist.The Stoning of Soraya M is a powerful compelling film one which makes you feel angry but one that should not be missed and left wing dogooders should understand it is the same Sharia law which some Muslims wish to bring into practice in the UK and other Christian countries which allows this kind of evil to take place in God's name.I loved this film in the same way that i loved Schindler's list or The Passion if to say loved is the correct word i fear not. But it's a beautiful poignant powerful film.910 Would be 1010 if not for the little Hollywood bit at the end with the car not starting.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have an affinity for sports biopics because they usually celebrate qualities such as hard work perseverance and sometimes sheer luck for an athlete to overcome the incredible odds facing them and to come up on top. Naturally winning is all that matters because nobody remembers the losers unfortunately and it's always inspiring to witness how others overcome their challenges which sometimes surpass that of which an individual could handle.If an equivalent of a sports biopic is to be done in the Singapore context in relation to the Olympics it could perhaps be our pioneering medalist weightlifter Tang Howe Liang to relate how he went quite on his own without the current support structure in place for our athletes of today to win glory for our nation. Similarly Liu Changchun Li Zhaolin goes down in China's history books as the first athlete to represent China and a medal winning one at that in the 1930s 10th Olympic Games held in Los Angeles USA.And naturally the road to glory is not paved in gold especially when you look at the tumultuous period he belonged to in China's history where they were on the brink of the SinoJapanese war and the country in turmoil with priorities other than to consider expending budget in sending an athlete overseas to compete. It's an incredible pressure and one can only imagine the immense anxiety he has with the burden to shoulder the hopes of millions of people in epitiomizing all of them with the indomitable spirit to compete at the highest level and to shake off the Sick Man of Asia tag given the Japanese invasion. Representing the hopes of a nation especially for a pioneer can be nerve wrecking but for the support from this father and understanding wife he begins on the arduous journey to get himself represented which this movie spent a lot of time focusing on the difficulties from war to crippling bureaucracy.Those moments were told in flashbacks and we chart his trip to the USA from the start on sea where he's travelling with only his coach Professor Song Shi Liang as they try to squeeze in some minimal training. And with inexperience comes the bickering with his coach with one wanting to train continuously against the coach's recommendation to cater for some adequate rest time. And as we know sometimes lessons are learnt the hard way which requires some eating of the humble pie to root one back to reality after a series of overconfidence.The movie boasted very high production values with no efforts spared in having nifty special effects recreating countless of moments from sets to backgrounds used to capture and recreate the era and the Games back then. The narrative also took a leaf out of Forrest Gump in having juxtapose the current actors into those black and white archival footage and did so very competently and convincingly. Director Hou Yong also filmed the sprints under very exciting terms with slow motion otherwise everything would be over in mere seconds and tight angles to frame all the action which probably required multiple takes given the multiple angles shown and to imagine the attention to details and accuracy to have the actors all come in at the right moments as cast in historical stone.If there is a gripe I thought they should have filmed the winning race rather than to not to so with the narrative rara about determination and the likes set the expectation that he's on a winning streak. Li Zhaolin was very believable as an Olympic medal winner given his very chiselled features and well toned body befitting an athlete. Notable cameos include David Wu and Hu Jun as a generalheadmaster. And yes Singapore also had a contribution here with Sun Yanzi being part of the singing ensemble for the team song along with the likes of Jackie Chan and Wang Lee Hom.I had the chance to watch this as inflight entertainment but sleep overrode that opportunity. And I am thankful to have watched this as it drops automatically into my recommended list of films to watch in relation to the Olympic theme this festival seems to be taking.".

	schema:headline " Great and dark Hong Kong triad film";
	schema:reviewBody "Patrick Yau is a great and talented director. I haven't seen anything else by him yet than this THE LONGEST NITE 1997 but his other works include The Odd One Dies and Expect the Unexpected which have also been hailed by HK fanatics and specialists. However THE LONGEST NITE alone shows the director's talent and this is easily among the most interesting and memorable HK films of the late 90's.Tony Leung and Lau Ching Wan are the two leads here. Tony is a wonderful actor with smooth and kind face yet his character here is anything but nice or kind. He plays a rawly violent and corrupted policeman who solves some mysterious triad war in which he is himself somehow related too. Also a mysterious bald headed stranger soon arrives in Macau Lau and soon these two men are against each other and time. It all happens during one night filled with depravity violence and seemingly no hope for a better tomorrow..I think the plot and story is very hard to follow after one viewing and the less you are experienced with English subtitles the more times you will have to see this film in order to understand the whole plot and its turns. I have seen this twice now and still there are elements which I cannot yet explain but they're not so important as the things this film gives and has are already visible to me.The film lacks every imaginable bit of the usual lightening humor and slapstick attempts. The film is as serious and gritty as they come and the film is produced by the legendary Johnnie To a directorproducer specialized in this kind of gritty and dark stuff in Hong Kong cinema. One of his most incredible achievements is a triad thriller The Big Heat 1988 starring Waise Lee which is among my personal all time Hong Kong favourites in its insanity and overthetop dark and infernal atmosphere. Johnnie has done many other great films too which include The Heroic Trio 1993 and its sequel both directed with the choreography genius Ching Siu Tung.THE LONGEST NITE features a nice soundtrack which is little like Giorgio Moroder's music in De Palma's Scarface 1983 and it adds very well to the atmosphere of the film. But the strongest element in THE LONGEST NITE is the photography and lightning which are often very gorgeous in the hands of a talented Hong Kong director. Films like Dr. Lamb Danny Lee 1992 City on Fire Ringo Lam 1986 or Red to Kill Billy Tang 1993 would not be as powerful as they are now without the usage of haunting colors like blue which bath in fog and mist usually the light or should I say darkness coming through windows. The final gun battle between the two protagonists in THE LONGEST NITE is among the greatest scenes I've seen in Hong Kong cinema in recent times and it features exactly this usage of blue nearly as powerfully as possible.The violence and brutal world the film is set in is often off putting but never gratuitously graphic and exploitative. There's no blood spraying all over the walls but realistic aftermath when someone decides to hurt some other. Violence never pays in this film as it doesn't in real life either. THE LONGEST NITE doesn't glorify violence at all it just depicts people who are so desperate and weak they use it very often and so the film and ending is pretty pessimistic too. Unlike in many Hollywood action nobrainers like the Steven Seagal films in THE LONGEST NITE wickedness and violence always has its consequences and results.THE LONGEST NITE is very welcome addition to the gritty triad films genre of the Hong Kong cinema and due to its great and believable performances and characters gorgeous visuals and overall honesty it will last many viewing times without losing its power and impact. I gladly give this 810 and maybe my rating will rise after subsequent viewings.".

He gives his most deepest and powerful performance since playing the mentally tough protagonist of John Woo's Bullet in the Head1990.  In the tradition of the pessemistic noir pictures of the 1940s.  A complex and thrilling story with surprising plot twists. Mixture of Martin Scorsese Fernando Di Leo John Woo and Takeshi Kitano.Another fabulous movie from Patrick Yau with his tight and taut direction. Has Patrick Yau done anything recent as it seems he hasn't done anything since Expect the Unexpected1998.  The most talented director from Hong Kong of the late 1990s.  Involved in the production was Johnny To who is known for his dark and grim action and crime thrillers.  The sequence in the warehouse is stunning.Ching Wah Lau is terrific as the cool and enigmatic stranger.  The whole gangster poltics in the movie echos the ideas of Martin Scorsese's mob flicks and Fernando Di Leo's Italian Crime movies especially Il BossThe Boss1973.  The gunbattle between Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Ching Wah Lau reminds me of the best of John Woo.  The final scene reminds me a lot of the final sequence from the Takeshi Kitano movie Violent Cop1989.  The Longest Nite1997 is more closer in tone to Takeshi Kitano than John Woo.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a bleak dark nasty ugly film of the sort Hong Kong no longer makes. Tony Leung plays a corrupt cop who is trying to make a peace between two of three powerful crime lords on Macau. Things are going from bad to worse as word hits the street of a contract on one of the crime bosses. A tall bald headed fellow is wandering about and seems intent on collecting the cash reward no one knows who is offering. Worse for Leung is the fact that someone seems intent on making his life miserable beginning with a naked dead man in his apartment. Things only go down hill from there as Leung tries to unravel the plot and stay out of increasing trouble.A fever dream of foul things this was started by one director Patrick Yau who shot five scenes before hitting a creative brick wall and then was finished by the producers Wai Kafai and Johnnie To who stumbled around trying to stitch it together. The result is a really violent bloody affair with no hope and no light. Much of the film operates in a seeming dream logic as it becomes clear that a greater power is operating just beyond Leung's view. Its all comes together in the end but until then its like being trapped in blood soaked nightmare with an occasional severed head. I'm kind of at a loss for words this movie operates on a level somewhere underneath the surface and sends out shock waves.I really like the film but at the same time find it rather disturbing. Its the sort of bleak rough edged crime drama that Hong Kong excelled at in the 1980's and 1990's but which it seems to have stopped making.Recommended if you can find yourself a copy and like rough edged mind warping crime dramas.".

Meanwhile a mystery begins to unravel where Leung faces some serious careerending dangers in which he must take specific actions to avoid. Lau Ching Wan plays a riddle in an enigma who hides in the shadows to conduct and puppeteer the actions of many other characters.

This is a very strongly written thriller with moody cinematography throughout the nighttime streets of Hong Kong an excellent film of Johnnie To's one of his best. The performances by Leung and Lau are great as well they really make great adversaries like you'd expect from the cover. Although the reason I don't rate this thriller higher are some erratic moments of absurd bloodshed which are almost comical in execution. Rrated Looney Tunes styled death sequences. They only last but seconds regardless they were enough to take me out of the film. Another detractor is the sense of limited closure on specific characters which I would have liked to see more development on in the conclusion. Besides a few minor complaints I still love this movie and will enjoy watching it again. 810".

Besides a few minor complaints I still love this movie and will enjoy watching it again. 810";

Why? The constant music was nothing special and at it's worst slightly annoying.There are a few somewhat wooden performances. Tony Leung Chiu Wai was far better in Hard Boiled. I don't think TatChi Yau knew how to wring all of the potential Tony has out of him for this film and it shows.There was a certain dynamic that's almost a staple of the HK actioncrime genre missing... The power of the weapons wasn't conveyed as I've seen it numerous films over the years. What I mean is that the guns didn't truly seem as powerful as they should of. The shots underpowered and it's a bit underwhelming when I'm used to even pistols coming across as these loud near deafening definitive things. Small thing but it ran through the entire film and I think it's worth mentioning.Could of been about 20 minutes longer with more characters being fleshed out a bit more. Film could of benefited a lot from that.Bad subtitles. Quite a few misspelled words and I'm sure I missed the gist of multiple things because of the poor subs. Ah well.Those are all relatively small issues I had with though and on the flip side it's got a lot more positive things going for it. A great buildup of suspense at multiple times through the film a pretty complex interweaving plot two very interesting I might dare say original action scenes which made me grin...To boot it was brutal and uncompromising. No humor Though the random unexplained vomiting kind of teetered on it A few nice brutal for this kind of film scenes that pleased the inner gore hound in me. The coloring throughout the film as mentioned by others was nice and added a nice dynamic to the film.Hehhehehee the movie also stars without a doubt the most unrelentingly sweaty character in the history of film. Tony Leung literally wipes his face down with a towel every few moments for almost the entire film. Hey it's the little things that I get a kick out of. He kept washing his hands and what not too. I think he had some kind of sanitation issue.Overall a 7.5 out of 10 in my very personal opinion. Well worth hunting down and adding to your collection as it's a very solid entry in a sadly still declining genre.".

If you like me love those violent dark and gritty  evoking an almost apocalyptic atmosphere  Hong Kong crime films like The Big Heat another Johnnie To film even if Tsui Hark had a firm hand on the creative process then you ought to get glued to the screen in a similar fashion. But unlike The Big Heat the comedy here is totally nonexistent. The city of Macau depicted here is ridden with criminals and corrupt cops who sometimes associate themselves with one of the two major gangs. Both have been at each other's throat for some time making some businesses go down in the process which displeased an old but powerful triad boss who owned a lot of them. He then threatened both to stay low and to preferably leave the city. Tony Lung delivers a very good performance as the protagonist a corrupt cop  violent but surprisingly calm  who tries to keep the peace between both gangs. Unfortunately a price is put on the head of one of the two bosses and it is rumoured it could be the other one who did so. Things then become sour setting the stage for this gripping crime thriller. Lau Ching Wan plays this badass outsider  a mean one but not from the cool breed  with a mysterious purpose. He initially seems more like a nuisance to Tony Lung's character Sam but as the movie advances his unknown motives start to feel all the more distressing. In the bleak world of The Longest Nite there's no real good characters to root for. Sam is the closest to a good guy as you'll find but early on his bad side is more obvious as he is not the victim he'll become later the story taking unexpected turns and unfolding in a fashion reminiscent of Se7en. The film starts with a short narration briefing you on the situation right before throwing you deep into the mess. Afterwards you'll need to assimilate as much as possible of what is happening to understand well what is happening and it can sometimes become hard to follow when you forget which boss is who. Anyway the filming style is great too the camera often looks around while not being so steady giving a certain grounded feel making you feel a witness of the events the movie shows you. The title being quite appropriate the whole thing mostly takes place during a single night. The film isn't that long so things can become a bit hectic not rushed but you can feel how stressed and always on the edge the characters probably are. All this can be felt through the visuals too. Almost the totality of the film is taking place at night occasionally under the neon lights of the Asian city. Add in smoke here and there some other lighting work and the likes and you've got everything to love about the aesthetics of Hong Kong crime cinema further reinforcing the gritty and bleak mood conveyed through the story and characters.The Longest Nite is an essential viewing for anyone into these intense violent and gritty Hong Kong crime films. Not necessarily like the more romantic and theatrical work of John Woo  feeling almost like Greek tragedies  but more down to Earth stuff even if it's quite unrealistic in how bleak the whole thing is.".

I mean if they can show a closeup of a fellow getting shot in the family jewels... what in the heck are they AFRAID to show? Probably just some female nudity since there doesn't ever seem to be anyone really naked in this movie... just the suggestion of nudity. One scene seemed to be a direct takeoff homage? copy? ripoff? of the famous interrogation scene in Basic Instinct. Maybe it was a more faithful recreation in the original cut?

When you see this you will find some cliches in it between some of the characters following a well worn path but the story and action more than make up for it.  I gave it an 8 but then generally I prefer Hong Kong and Japanese action movies to American ones.".

More importantly the story is simple but captivating with characters you can love or hate respectively and the cinematography is razor sharp using strong hues to paint each scene in mood and mystery when needed or flooding scenes with light in time to punctuate the occasional comic relief.

However the thing that lets it down is Clarence Fok's choppy direction. This guy's films always seem incredibly dated to me because of his overstylised editing and the like and NAKED KILLER is no exception. I actually enjoyed NAKED KILLER 2 directed by Andrew Lau more because of this not to mention 2004's SO CLOSE.Still NAKED KILLER provides some things of merit for Hong Kong movie fans not least an amusing role for Simon Yam as a disturbed cop who vomits every time he draws his gun. Chingmy Yau garners all of the attention as the impossibly beautiful young woman who becomes an assassin and she's well supported with a knowing performance from Kelly Yao as the older professional. I also spotted Jackie Chan's bodyguard Ken Lo playing a sleazy businessman.As is usual for these films the movie is surprisingly light on nudity with the main actresses teasing throughout but delivering little only the unknown supporting actresses are willing to strip off. Carrie Ng has a minor role as a ruthless hitwoman. The action scenes come out of nowhere and are way over the top with the shootout in the car park being a particular favourite of mine although the ending is also fun. NAKED KILLER is certainly no classic but it passes the time for fans of this sort of stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is awesome. It is very similar in plot to Out of Sight but in my opinion it is a billion times better. I guess it is the erotic scenes that add much more to it as this fully delves into the love that exists between the killer and the cop.Naked Killer is about a woman Kitten who witnesses her father murdered by her stepmother's lover. She vowels revenge and storms his office and kills him. After that she finds herself trapped and inevitably turns to an assassin for help. She helps her and takes her in and trains her. Her advice always acts around being seductive but avoiding a relationship as that unhinges you and makes you a less effective killer. Sex is bad because it attaches you to somebody. Unfortunately Kitten is attached to a cop who she cannot get away from.They really emphasis this relationship in the fact that this is the only woman that he has met that arouses him. He is determined not to leave her and in the end she folds and runs to his arms but can now never return to the world of the killers.It is the plot that gives this movie a lot of strength. The plot is a standard Romeo and Juliet plot but the character developments far surpass that of Out of Sight. The action scenes in this movie are at the excellent standard of Hong Kong cinema and the movie climaxes in a tragic ending.As is typical for this movie a path is created that leads to only one ending. The path is followed by the choices that the characters make and once one makes the choice the end is inevitable. A tragedy of a high standard is when one sees these choices and knows the implications. If we treat this as realistic then the choices that are made have a much greater impact. The two tragic choices occur when Kitten decides to take revenge on her stepmother's lover and when she reveals herself to the cop. These decisions send her down a path from which she can never return. Though choices exist they are not ones that she is willing to make.I must say that this is a brilliant movie though the one that I watched was the unedited version. I do not know what the Chinatown Video version is like but the movie is still one that is phenomenally brilliant.".

Mainly due to the fact that this movie seems to rely more on the sexiness of the actresses then the actual action scenes.  However what seperates this film from Charlie's Angels is that it is more violent and more sexy without havng to show gratuitess nudity.  Again I have seen the cut version.  And when the action scenes come they are extremly stylised and and almost fantasylike.  Again unlike Charlie's Angels it appears that the action choreagraphers either resisted the ich to use wirestunts or they were far more clever about hiding them.  That ius not to say that the action scenes incredably spectacular in fact they seem like pale imatations of John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping as well as their being more flips and twirls then actual kicks and punches.  What almost saves the action scenes though is the demented violent acts committed by the characters.  What also helps is that the actresses are always carressing each other and such in between the action scenes.note as mentioned before this review is for the cut version.  That being said there are certain scenes that appear to be cut short like 10 minutes had to be cut to get it down to an Rrating so one has to wonder what was done in the movie.  the good thing about this Rrated version is that you can get it for a relatively cheap price 15 bucks under the HK classic series along with jackie Chan's CIty hunter and Hong Kong 1941 with Chow Yun Fat.  However I would reccopmend you try and get the uncut copy becuase the Rrated copy just makes you want to purchase the uncut version.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember having this movie on VHS way back in the early 90's and remembered the movie to be fairly alright so I got it on DVD here in 2012 many years after having thrown out the VHS version. But of course I have always been a fan of Hong Kong cinema so it was just a matter of time before it would end up in the movie collection again.The story in Naked Killer is about the young attractive and flirtatious Kitty played by Chingmy Yau who end up in training at Sister Cindy played by Wai Yiu to become a professional killer using her looks and sexual appeal to get close to the targets and then eliminate the target. However Kitty falls in love with police man Tinam played by Simon Yam and is torn between loyalty towards her mentor and the love for Tinam.Naked Killer takes your average Hong Kong action movie from the 1990's and spices it up with a healthy dose of sexual flavor like that seen in La Femme Nikita and Basic Instict. The story itself despite being fairly shallow is entertaining enough. And it is helped along by the action and gun fights which of course is a given trademark for the Hong Kong movies from that particular period. But of course it is no secret that the movie her really plays on the sexual appeal and makes heavy use of semisexual contents which can be discussed whether or not it was really all that necessary. And oddly enough there wasn't actually much killing going on in the movie despite many of the characters were professional contract killers  kind of anticlimatic in a way.Those familiar with Hong Kong cinema will of course be familiar with this at the time of its release very controversial movie. And it was of course also the movie that put Chingmy Yau on the map. And you have Simon Yam of course though his character was a bit too much as a police man who accidentally having shot his own brother and now vomits every time he just holds a gun  it was just a bit too unrealistic but still he is a familiar face in Hong Kong cinema. And it should also be said that Carrie Ng playing Princess actually did a great job in this movie as well.Naked Killer is well worth checking out especially if you have an interest in the 90's wave of Hong Kong action movies. Chingmy Yau is the female equivalent to femme action movie as Chow Yun Fat was to the male action movies to come from Hong Kong in the 90's.I enjoyed the movie back in the early 90's and I enjoyed it still here in 2012. I would have give the movie a 610 rating but settled on a 510 rating because in my opinion there was just a little bit too much focus on the sex scenes and the usage of sexual situations. Hong Kong Legends have a fabulous digitally restored and remastered version out of DVD that is well worth checking out and it comes with some good extra material as well.".

There was a big poster about 40' x 20' on building walls hanging everywhere around town with sexy rear end of Chingmy Yau in leather shorts with a gun in her hand. I heard that she was Wong Jing's girlfriend at the time Wong Jing was also married and I could see why he liked her so much. At the time I'd say Chingmy had the cutest rear end in all of Hong Kong. Okay that sets the tone for this movie. It's sex and violence and all sorts of kink thrown in. Cinematography is beautiful and camera angles superb showcasing all of the beauty of Chingmy and Carrie Ng. Plot is pretty good as it's written by the talented Wong Jing himself. This is one of the best if not the best erotic fantasy  action movie Hong Kong has ever produced and features again three of the best Hong Kong talents Yau Yam Ng in one of their most intriguing roles.Chingmy Yau despite her sex symbol status was a fairly conservative working woman. She worked steadily in her careers and now has a nice family. In one of the interviews when she was asked what would she like to be if she was reborn her answer was A spiritual aspirant showing that her value is not all glitz and glamor.".

Carrie Ng normally cast in sympathetic roles plays Hong Kong's most virulent man hater Princess a hard core lesbian and stone cold killer who hires out as an assassin but you get the feeling she would off guys for grins. And the creatively nasty ways in which she carries out her assignments represent one of the film's biggest attractions. I won't spoil the fun but OUCH!! Simon Yam takes a break from his usual rollingeyed psycho types to play a straightforward cop on the trail of Princess and producer Wong Jing cast his thenmistress Chimgmy Yau as a rookie assassin who becomes an object of fascination for Princess but who then spurns the killer's offer of girlgirl love. Bad move. The second half of the the movie involves Princess stalking her intended and their former mentor Sister Cindy eventually getting into a brutal throwdown with Yau that may be nastiest girlfight in the history of Hong Kong cinema and this is saying something. Not for anyone looking for a gayfriendly subtle or even fully coherent cinema experience. For the rest enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "SpoilerFinally! Having come tantalizingly close to watching this alltime classic which has been presented almost perennially in the Hong Kong International Film Festival I spotted a VCD at the Broadway Cinematheque grabbed it in a split second and watched it the same evening.  Can't believe that it was made 25 years ago. But then wasn't The Wizard of Oz made 65 years ago?.Among the work of the new wave' directors returning to Hong Kong armed with western' education and training The Butterfly Murders from Tsui Hak is considered a classic among classics and hence the place afford to it by the HKIFF. Deservedly so.Watching the butterfly attacks I can't help my free association to Hitchcock's Birds. However while there are visual and physical similarities unlike Birds in which the attack is unexplained The Butterfly Murders has an exceptionally well constructed plot that ties up what started out as random loose ends with neat satisfying explanations. In that regard it is very much like a movie made with an Aagtha Christy mystery. The narrator and also one of the main characters Fong could very well be a Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot. There are a large number of characters skillfully stratified according to their importance in the movie on the one hand and according to their martial art abilities on the other. Yes there are some good martial art sequences but they come only halfway through. These sequences in turn are reminiscent of Japanese movies in this genre particularly the ninjas.The camera work is fantastic with dexterity that's second to none even compared to today's work. The cast is good but basically unknown to me as I wasn't around town at the time and most of the people in the movie apparently didn't carry on in the film industry. It's an absolute delight though to see a VERY young Mai Shut whom I've seen much more on theatre stage and TV screen. Another one is Ko Hung who has all these years been active on TV and movie screens most recently seen in PTU albeit a very brief appearance.Must admit that I started watching The Butterfly Murders with considerable skepticism but after 90 minutes I was completely sold. This is indeed a vintage classic.".

	onyx:emotionText "SpoilerFinally! Having come tantalizingly close to watching this alltime classic which has been presented almost perennially in the Hong Kong International Film Festival I spotted a VCD at the Broadway Cinematheque grabbed it in a split second and watched it the same evening.  Can't believe that it was made 25 years ago. But then wasn't The Wizard of Oz made 65 years ago?.Among the work of the new wave' directors returning to Hong Kong armed with western' education and training The Butterfly Murders from Tsui Hak is considered a classic among classics and hence the place afford to it by the HKIFF. Deservedly so.Watching the butterfly attacks I can't help my free association to Hitchcock's Birds. However while there are visual and physical similarities unlike Birds in which the attack is unexplained The Butterfly Murders has an exceptionally well constructed plot that ties up what started out as random loose ends with neat satisfying explanations. In that regard it is very much like a movie made with an Aagtha Christy mystery. The narrator and also one of the main characters Fong could very well be a Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot. There are a large number of characters skillfully stratified according to their importance in the movie on the one hand and according to their martial art abilities on the other.

In the meantime the owner of Shum Castle invited the people of Tien Clan and Fong Hung Yip a chronicler of jiang hu history to stay in their castle telling them about the butterfly murders that has been going on there. But before Fong and Tien had found out why the butterflies are out killing people the owner of Shum was murdered by those butterflies. As a result 3 more Jiang Hu leaders were called to the Shum Castle and the mystery of the butterfly murders gradually unfolded.The story was filled with twists and turns and the middle of the movie was like a detective story as Fong and the Green Shadow an unexpected guest at the Shum Castle were investigating the murders. An extremely interesting and entertaining plot. The set decoration was done exquisitely especially the labyrinthlike underground tunnel and the place where butterfly specimens were displayed. Unlike other movies in the same genre the weapons used by the characters no swords involved and their costume were all creatively designed. So there is a certain degree of novelty in the movie even though it was shot in 1979. In fact to some extent a lot of the recent Hong Kong jiang hu movies had copied the art designs of this movie.The butterfly invading the Shum castle scene as well as the butterfly killing people scenes were beautifully shot and reminds me a lot of Hitchcock's The Birds the difference between the two movie is that this film explains towards the end why the butterflies are killing people.This film was said to have opened the new page for the Hong Kong New Wave movement in movies. It also proves that Tsui Hark is quite an expert with jiang hu movies. In fact this one is better than some of his later works like the Blade.This is an extremely worthwhile movie for the Jiang Hu martial arts fans to watch especially those who like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.".

In turn they appear allied to the TIEN clan leader who has also been invited to the SHUM castle.The castle becomes another character  its exterior grim and barren when the main characters arrive rather those in AGATHA CHRISTIE's Ten little Indians. And when they are subjected to the first of many relentless attacks by butterflies they find refuge underground.The underground is a maze with mysterious rooms suddenly appearing and concealing the butterflies themselves arsenals of elaborate weapons and so forth.I wonder if we were not intended to be as confused as all those invited to the castle to their deaths as the film plays out to know is to die to quote Darius Jedburgh Edge of darkness 1986.This is one of the few HK films that I have seen that has thrown me re its plot and its characters it took me a long time to really identify the actors and their characters. That said I was very impressed with the staging of the action which is plentiful and varied intrigued with the villain and his suit of body armour it seemed something out of a Mario Bava slasher film and quietly applauded the cynical ending but was upset that once again the filmmakers should use so much Jerry Goldsmith Planet of the apes and Ennio Morricone Moses in the soundtrack.An entertaining debut by Tsui Hark!".

The basic story concerns the investigation of a series of death said to have been caused by deadly butterflies. It's a investigated by a journalist who enlists the aid of a couple of monks who then journey to a monastery to see what's going on. There's more to it than that a clash of clans and a newly discovered manuscript of an important writer also figure into the mix. As a mystery this is quite good. The idea of killer butterflies is more than enough to intrigue even the most jaded mystery lover heck it hooked me. The film also boasts some very good martial arts sequences especially a villain in a unique suit of armor. The problem is that the two halves don't really mesh. There are times when both the mystery and the martial arts seem out of place. It's as if Hark didn't know which way to turn and put in a fight or a plot twist because he had to move things along. The seeming uncertainty makes the pace of the film uneven with moments where it moves along a good clip and others where you look at your watch wondering when its next going to move forward. Still it's a good movie. Certainly worth a look if you want to see a mystery with a unique twist or a martial arts film that's not your typical run of the mill.".

There's some further intrigue and back story about past conspiracies but essentially what you see is what you get with this one.THE BUTTERFLY MURDERS is a weird film indeed and one that's not entirely successful although I give Hark credit for making something so unlike any other film I can mention. The stonefaced heroes seem as brutal and unforgiving as the villain of the piece while at times the bloody fights are shoehorned into the plot to give the viewer an action kick. On a visual sense this film works very well and the villain looks fantastic the effects of the butterflies work well too and as others have noted bring back a frisson of excitement from THE BIRDS.

	schema:headline " More of a sketch comedy than a movie but it's okay";
	schema:reviewBody "CIS Chaoten im Sondereinsatz is a German television film from 2010 and these 85 minutes are among the most known works by director Erik Haffner as well as his three writers. If you come from Germany and take a look at the cast here then you will certainly see many many names from the German television landscape that are more known than the people who made this film. But many of them aren't necessarily actors also if you look at the key players like singer Sasha comedian Martina Hill or entertainer Dieter Thomas Heck. This is also why the result barely resembles a movie. To me it really felt more like a sketch comedy packed with plays on words and honestly some of the jokes weren't that bad actually many even. Of course some stuff did not turn out as funny as they wanted it to but that's also subjective of course and was made up by the fact that the film absolutely never took itself seriously. This also cost the film a bit though when it comes to the romance and crime aspects in here and I would say the focus is so much on comedy that I wouldn't even say any other genre is accurate for the film. I see the film was not received very well apparently looking at the rating but I somewhat liked it especially in the first half. I guess those who disliked it are the same that believe cast members Hill and Schubert are actually good on the garbage Heute Show. Back to this film here It was only weak and disappointing when it tried to move forward with the crime plot. It's maybe a slightly weaker version of the famous Wixxer films starring Kalkofe and Pastewka. Oh yeah finally it needs to be said that this is really just for Germanspeaking audiences as a great deal of the comedy would definitely be lost in translation. And it also helps if you are familiar with German television because otherwise the references about Rach Kallwass etc. will not make any impact at all. But if these two factors apply to you then I suggest watching these slightly under 1.5 hours. I give them a thumbsup.".

The songs are quite fun too. I especially liked 'Kahin pe Nigahen' and the lyrics are awesome as through these lyrics Waheeda's character narrates the escape route to Dev Anand. The turns and twists were skillfully handled and director Raj Khosla presents them very well. No time is wasted in meaningless subplots in this fastpaced thriller. Cinematography is top notch.

	schema:reviewBody "Though much better than the decadeold running TV series on Indian TV by the same name sorry couldn't resist the namesake comparison Raj Khosla's CID was a very simple and straightforward whodunit. In the mould of Hollywood filmnoir CID was gripping and entertaining.CID officer Shekhar Dev Anand is investigating the murder of a newspaper editor but somehow gets falsely implicated for the murder of the editor's murderer Mehmood. A mysterious woman Kamini Waheeda Rehman helps Shekhar reach the real murderer.Unlike most multilayered modern murder mysteries CID was very onedimensional without any subplots. While the simplicity added to the appeal of the thriller in the 50s it kind of looks too undemanding in present times. In the sense that the identity of the killer is revealed to the viewer very early in the film which could easily have been kept a mystery and been a highpoint of the suspense drama. The motive of the editor's murder was never explained. Director Raj Khosla went on to make the same mistakes in future in Kala Pani.Waheeda Rehman's character was too halfbaked with no background account to her. While she made an impressive debut in a character with grey shades her abrupt change of heart towards Shekhar the hero isn't justified. Thankfully the story doesn't get into a love triangle with the beautiful Shakila playing the only love interest of Dev Anand in the film.Otherwise CID was a decent entertainer and had to its credit a superlative soundtrack. Each and every track in the film from Yeh Hai Bombay Meri Jaan Aankhon Hi Aankhon Mein Ishaara Ho Gaya Kahin Pe Nigahen Kahin Pe Nishana to Bujh Mera Kya Naam Re Nadi Kinare Gaav Re was a chartbuster and is in common knowledge even today. Wonderful melodies by O P Nayyar! Performances were quite good. Dev Anand was convincing both as an efficient investigating officer and a victimized fugitive. Shakila looked beautiful. Producer Guru Dutt had spotted Waheeda Rehman in a Telugu film Rojulu Marayi and cast her as the supporting actress with grey shades in her first Hindi film. The rest as they say is history. Mehmood who later went on to become one of the most popular Bollywood comedians ever played a negative role in the film. His sister Minoo Mumtaz was also in the film. Johnny Walker offered some genuine light moments in the otherwise earnest film.Interesting Trivia Oscar winner Bhanu Athaiya then known as Bhanumati debuted as a costume designer with this film. Javed Akhtar's father Jan Nisar Akhtar wrote the lyrics of 'Aankhon Hi Aankhon Mein Ishaara Ho Gaya'. Tinu Anand's father Inder Raj Anand wrote the script. Popular senior actress Zohra Sehgal known to play grandmotherly roles today choreographed the songs.Watch it as a modern film of the 50s and you might like CID.Gaurav Malani".

	schema:reviewBody "Shamshaad Begum passed away on 23.04.2013 leaving a golden chapter of the book of Bollywood music to glitter forever in her mesmerizing voice and unique style of singing. As my tribute to Shamshaad Begum I am presenting the review of an old movie  C.I.D. 1956 which was made by Guru Dutt and directed by Raj Khosla starring Guru Dutt and Shakila in lead roles. The highlight of this movie is the immortal music composed by O.P. Nayyar containing certain classic songs in the voice of Shamshaad Begum which we the music lovers are fond of listening to again and again and again.C.I.D. the acronym for the crime investigating department starts with the killing of a newspaper editor who was on the trail of a rich businessman  Dharamdaas Bir Sakhuja who was supposed to be having underworld links. The case is assigned to C.I.D. inspector Shekhar Dev Anand who alongwith his love life with Rekha Shakila moves forward in the direction of unravelling the mystery of the editor's murder and reaching the real culprit. However the real culprit is smarter than him and he weaves a web of lies deceit and conspiracy around him and traps himself only in the murder of the murderer Mehmood. How he proves his own innocence and catches the guilty is the remaining part of the story in which the characters of Kaamini Waheeda Rehman and Master Johnny Walker also play significant roles.This is the debut movie of its director  Raj Khosla who is credited to bring about neonoir style in the Indian cinema. C.I.D. was one of the pioneer movies in the tradition of Hollywood style crimethrillers in India. Raj Khosla had learnt directorial skills by assisting the producer of this movie  Guru Dutt the legend of the Indian cinema but he did not copy his guru and instead developed his own style of narration. This debut movie of himself is a showcase of his abundant talent which despite some plot holes keeps the viewer hooked for two and a half hours. He has not allowed the narrative to go lax despite melodious songs and the romance of the lead pair intervening and presented a taut thriller. He has focused on thrill and not on mystery else given the script he could have easily made a whodunit also.The young director has been able to draw praiseworthy performances from the actors. Dev Anand was fast evolving himself into the Indian Gregory Pack and in C.I.D. also he is able to fling lightning on the hearts of the young females with his handsome personality and enchanting mannerisms. Shakila was very beautiful and her pair with Dev Anand appears quite charming. This is the debut movie of one of the greatest actresses of the Indian screen  Waheeda Rehman who was barely 1819 years old then. Guru Dutt gave her the break in Bollywood through a negative role in this movie and lo ! The actress playing a vamp in her debut movie went on to register her name in one of the most happening and the most popular Bollywood heroines during the sixties. Both these ladies have done well. The complete supporting cast has also done justice to the assigned roles.Guru Dutt's movies are incomplete without Johnny Walker. The immensely popular song  Aye Dil Hai Mushkil Jeena Yahaan Zara Hatke Zara Bachke Yeh Hai Bombay Meri Jaan has been picturized on him only and none can forget his performance on this song. This legendary comedian has provided sufficient no. of relief moments in this movie belong to the genre of noir cinema. Just like Guru Dutt and Johnny Walker Dev Anand and Johnny Walker also made a great male pair of the Indian screen complimenting each other very well and entertaining the audience in huge quantum.As asserted earlier the biggest plus point of this movie is the immortal music composed by O.P. Nayyar. Most of the lyrics have been written by Majrooh Sultaanpuri. Aankhon Hi Aankhon Mein Ishaara Ho Gaya has been penned by the great Shaayar  Janaab Jaanisaar Akhtar the father of Jaaved Akhtar and Jaane Tamanna Kya Kar Daala has been penned by S.H. Bihari. Geeta Dutt has sung Aaye Dil Hai Mushkil Jeena Yahaan and Aankhon Hi Aankhon Mein Ishaara Ho Gaya with Mohammed Rafi whereas Jaata Kahaan Hai Diwane is her solo. Jaane Tamanna Kya Kar Daala is the duet sung by Asha Bhosle and Mahendra Kapoor.And Shamshaad Begum has given her voice to the great songs like Kahin Pe Nigaahen Kahin Pe Nishaana picturized on Waheeda Rehman and the immensely popular  Leke Pehla Pehla Pyar picturized on Sheela Waaz and Shyam Kapoor in the company of Asha Bhosle and Mohammed Rafi. My favourite song of Shamshaad Begum from this album in particular as well as in general is  Boojh Mera Kya Naam Re Nadi Kinare Gaaon Re which has been picturized on Meenu Mumtaaz. The low profile actresses like Sheela Waaz and Meenu Mumtaaz also got their share of popularity by performing on Shamshaad's enchanting voice in these songs. The lyricists have dropped gems in the form of words for the lyrics of these songs.With my tribute to the great female singer whose voice was not fine like Lata's and somewhat hoarse nevertheless enchanting for the music lovers I unconditionally recommend this interesting crimethriller from the black and white era to the movie buffs. The evergreen songs render immense repeat value to this classic black and white movie.".

The lyricists have dropped gems in the form of words for the lyrics of these songs.With my tribute to the great female singer whose voice was not fine like Lata's and somewhat hoarse nevertheless enchanting for the music lovers I unconditionally recommend this interesting crimethriller from the black and white era to the movie buffs. The evergreen songs render immense repeat value to this classic black and white movie.";

	schema:headline " Interesting Period Piece";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a highly underrated piece of Cosby's work. Although now the concept of a private ambulance service that is primarily interested in money seems rather quaint it was almost the norm in the midseventies when this movie was made. Although most people don't realize it the largest ambulance provider in the US is still privately operated for profit so maybe not all that has changed.Cosby is brilliant as Mother a sort of archetype character that melds together all the clichs of what ambulance drivers were in an era when many ambulance services were still run by funeral homes  I recall pushing a 1970 Miller Meteor Cadillace ambulance which was basically a converted hearse up and down hills at 35 MPH it's 500 cubic inch engine floored straining and just barely able to make it up the hill. This is not EMS it is you call we haul. Cosby brings out the nitty gritty of a profession that was mostly populated by caring people who ran up against the ethos of profit in medicine and owners who were just out to make a buck. You start out really caring but run head on into the reality that aiding the sick and injured is not the end just the means to the end. You learn this working very long hours under horrible conditions for very little money.Rachel Welch portrayed the emerging role of women in emergency services very well. The hoops she had to jump through just to get on a rig were exaggerations of what really was happening in the industry at the time. Similarly Welch's reaction when faced with the reality of emergency medicine is right on point. There is a great deal of difference between what you learn in textbooks and real life. And real life isn't always that pleasant. But as Mother says Jugs has the dedication of a jungle missionary. She would have to just to get where she was and stay there.Harvey Kietel was just starting out when he played Speed and his performance in the role foreshadowed the brilliant career that followed. I thought the Speed reference was a little cryptic. I thought for a long time it referred his desire to drive fast. However the Speed character gives a different point of view  that of an outsider  to the hijinks of the staff of FB Ambulance Service. He shows us how absurd some of things that happen are.The rest of the characters seemed to all be lifted directly from the real world. Harry and Naomi Fishbine seemed to be modeled after a husband and wife team that ran a not too different private ambulance company that I worked for on the west coast in the seventies  right down to the lecture about how much each patient was worth. Larry Hagman's character portrayed a type of worker in the industry that was always on the margins  you weren't sure why he is doing what he was doing but you couldn't see him doing anything else.The events portrayed in the movie where very similar to the urban legends about what supposedly happened at private ambulance companies in the sixties and seventies. As most legends are some of them are based on loose interpretations of fact. I have in fact had difficulty taking very obese patients down flights of stairs. Some of the places we went to on calls had rodents large enough to cause grave concern. There were always rumors of people who smoked pot or drank on the job. During my entire career whenever there were two private ambulance companies in competition jumping calls and competing for patients did happen  sometimes on a daily basis. The owners of one of the ambulances services I worked for in the eighties ordered their employees to attend city government meetings when the company was being discussed this was long after the everyone who worked in the industry had becomes professionals. And yes I have been the victim of layoffs from private ambulance companies when they lost their government contracts. I have also been held up at gunpoint for drugs stabbed and shot at. The reality of the movie made it all that much funny and more real.Mother Jugs and Speed is an interesting and amusing look back at a time when EMS was just starting to become a reality. The acting was top notch. The events portrayed were close enough to real or to urban legends as to make them seem likely. The writing could have been better  some of the dialog was very marginal. Overall as a lay person and a retired EMS professional who worked in the ambulance industry at the time this film was made I found the movie to be very enjoyable and suggest others watch it  with tongue firmly in cheek of course.".

This film has an edge not unlike Mean Streets or even Repo Man and it addresses social issues while maintaining a satirical tack.

This movie is a jewel of acting on his part.  I love the scene where he makes the local burger joint put peanut butter on his cheeseburger. Bill Cosby gives a performance that it both funny in the beginning and then heart touching as his character deals with the death of his partner great stuff from Bill My only complaint about this film is that once it looses it comedic steam and turns serious it never regains it humor again. I would have like to seen the humor continue all the way through the movie but it just doesn't.this movie would not be made today because of all of the racial humor and the rape scene with Larry Hagman.that just wouldn't be allowed in one of today's films.I still recommend this movie to anyone who wants to stroll down memory lane and remember the 1970's ...... it all there the disco style music the big hair the clothes and I even saw a Ford Mustang II traveling on the highway in one of the scenes and I said to myself Oh my god I used to drive one of those cars admit it...when was the last time you saw a Mustang II out on the highway.its been a while hasn't it  although I had never seen this movie before it still brought back lots of 1970's memories".

Harvey Keitel as the naive good new guy was as compelling as ever Raquel Welch was THE BABE she was good in KANSAS CITY BOMBER and Allen Garfield as owner of the quirky ambulance outfit is always perfectly cast.A 5 out of 10.

This movie deals with a lot of issues in the business racial sexual economical etc. Most of it was pretty tame. Despite the N word and the finger expression which Jugs gave to her superior. I liked the way the ambulance was made for the movie. This movie wasn't made for kids if Richard Pryor was the star this would be an Rrated movie. This is made for mature audiences.

Now these days you don't think of Bill Cosby when you think of smartass but this was almost thirty years ago.

Such a thing wouldn't even bat an eye now but was an issue back then. But 'Mother' is also amusing. Some of the comedy is obvious  one extremely obese black woman is too heavy to carry and her gurney slips from their grip taking a joyride down a hilly street. But a lot of it is surprisingly sharp thanks mostly to Cosby's excellent timing and deadpan delivery. Mother has a oneliner for every situation and surprise most of them are really funny.While the rest of the cast is fine  Keitel portrays a slightly nicer version of the cool collected guy he often plays Welch is pleasant but her character isn't particularly deep and Garfield is good as a sort of protoLouie DePalma  the movie is really Cosby's show. From bribing the cops to drinking beer on the job from buzzing' the nuns with his siren to eating his hamburgers with peanut butter onions and mayonnaise on them Mother is a real character in every good sense of the word. While the film does not always excel and in some places falls sort of flat Cosby is always spot on here and it's worth sitting through some of the slower stretches for him alone.I was thinking as I was watching this film that it would be prime fodder for a remake. Bernie Mac would ace the Cosby role you could find any number of women to play Jugs I suggest Heather Graham and it would be almost painfully easy to update the 70sisms into modern day slangevents. You could even be topical and switch Bliss from metrosexual to fullout gay which is implied but never said in the film anyway. In looking up this film on the IMDB however I discovered someone already did try to make this into a TV show so apparently I wasn't the first one who thought this had potential though TV is the wrong venue much of the film's humor is ribald and you sure as hell couldn't call any woman on TV Jugs'. 'Mother' is an enjoyable film not much more than your average summer filler but still able to elicit several good chuckles almost thirty years later. It's certainly worth it to see Cosby play the bad boy with aplomb.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mother Jugs  Speed is one of the more interesting films of the 1970s that this viewer has seen and it deserves to be seen by a larger audience. It's mostly a dark comedy with some moments that are very very serious about private ambulance services engaging in cutthroat competition and the quirky characters that work for the financially strapped F  B Ambulance Company run by cranky crook Harry Fishbine Allen Garfield. Bill Cosby plays ace driver Mother Tucker Harvey Keitel is Tony  Speed an excop and new employee who'd been accused of selling drugs and Raquel Welch is the spirited Jennifer a.k.a. Jugs who's determined to prove herself capable of being more than a secretary. This is a lot of fun for a while with some choice lines of dialogue and energetic performances. The Cos walks away with all of his scenes but he does receive some hilarious competition in the form of Larry Hagman as sleazy horny employee Murdoch. The guy can't help himself but get together with an attractive patient in the back of an ambulance! Also appearing are people as diverse as L.Q. Jones Bruce Davison Dick Butkus Severn Darden Bill Henderson Toni Basil and an uncredited Tim Reid. Ultimately the movie can't quite maintain the same momentum all the way through and those sobering dramatic moments may throw some people for a bit of a loop. Still the premise makes for some great humour with one example being the instance in which two of the attendants have a hard time transporting a heavyset woman. Mother also figures in a priceless running gag where he threatens to mow down nuns who are crossing a street. It's fun to see the lengths to which these companies will go for the sake of reaching patients first and therefore getting the contract for their services. The movie does do a nice job of capturing the nature of the people in the profession and the nature of their business and is never less than entertaining. It's easy to want to follow the adventures of our main characters superbly played by The Cos as the seasoned veteran and wise guy the ever lovely Welch as the impassioned woman whose efforts to break through barriers is all too believable and whose education in the harsh reality of life is poignant and the nicely low key Keitel as the newcomer learning the ropes. They make viewing Mother Jugs  Speed quite the experience this film definitely comes recommended. Seven out of 10.".

Jugs who's determined to prove herself capable of being more than a secretary. This is a lot of fun for a while with some choice lines of dialogue and energetic performances. The Cos walks away with all of his scenes but he does receive some hilarious competition in the form of Larry Hagman as sleazy horny employee Murdoch. The guy can't help himself but get together with an attractive patient in the back of an ambulance! Also appearing are people as diverse as L.Q. Jones Bruce Davison Dick Butkus Severn Darden Bill Henderson Toni Basil and an uncredited Tim Reid. Ultimately the movie can't quite maintain the same momentum all the way through and those sobering dramatic moments may throw some people for a bit of a loop. Still the premise makes for some great humour with one example being the instance in which two of the attendants have a hard time transporting a heavyset woman. Mother also figures in a priceless running gag where he threatens to mow down nuns who are crossing a street. It's fun to see the lengths to which these companies will go for the sake of reaching patients first and therefore getting the contract for their services. The movie does do a nice job of capturing the nature of the people in the profession and the nature of their business and is never less than entertaining. It's easy to want to follow the adventures of our main characters superbly played by The Cos as the seasoned veteran and wise guy the ever lovely Welch as the impassioned woman whose efforts to break through barriers is all too believable and whose education in the harsh reality of life is poignant and the nicely low key Keitel as the newcomer learning the ropes. They make viewing Mother Jugs  Speed quite the experience this film definitely comes recommended. Seven out of 10.";

	schema:headline " Uneven comedydrama  needs Scorsese's touch";
	schema:reviewBody "This film seems unsure whether it is a silly romantic sex comedy or a serious insight into the highpressure life of the ambulance driver. While most of the film is devoted to lewd or slapstick humour and Peter 'Bullit'Yates' trademark road chases there are quite a few very uncomfortable scenes showing the moral degradation of those daily exposed to the dead and dying. An interesting film for sure with some good moments particularly from Cosby and Keitel but the same themes are treated with far greater sensitivity and in greater depth in Martin Scorsese's awesome Bringing Out the Dead. Where Scorsese deftly integrated humour into his serious plot as a counterpoint to the horrors of his characters daily grind these drivers seem quite happy with their work joking along merrily until they flip out and do something really messed up or something nasty happens quite out of the blue. Perhaps worth a watch but really only to compare with Scorsese's superior reworking.".

While most of the film is devoted to lewd or slapstick humour and Peter 'Bullit'Yates' trademark road chases there are quite a few very uncomfortable scenes showing the moral degradation of those daily exposed to the dead and dying.

I originally thought that it would be that when I heard the title of the movie. Instead of all that though you get this pretty memorable comedy starring Raquel Welch Bill Cosby and Harvey Keitel. The premise is very original being just a rivalry between two different ambulance companies that eventually sort things out. Most of the laughs directly come from Cosby his performance as Mother is pretty hysterical with his catchy 'Show Business' line. Of course you also have Raquel Welch as Jugs and Harvey Keitel as Speed so the cast is also well put together. Anyway this should definitely be worth checking out. In the words of Bill Cosby's character Mother Show Business!".

Zac feels somewhat disconnected to his brothers all of whom are different from each other. They include the bookworm Christian who is the eldest the dumb jock Antoine who is third and the youngest Yvan. But Zac has the most contempt for his second eldest brother the shiftless druggie Raymond. To his devout Catholic mother Zac is her miracle son both for being born the same day as Jesus Christ a fact which Zac has always hated and because a Tupperwareselling mystic once told her that he has the power to heal. Laurianne has always coddled Zac the two who have a special if unspoken bond. But Zac wants more to please his father who wants more than anything in his sons that they grow up to be man's men and not sissies. As Zac goes through his midteens to early twenties Zac isn't sure if he can live up to the ideals of either his mother or especially his father. A young man with...";

	schema:reviewBody "C.R.A.Z.Y. is simply one of the best movies of all time. It encapsulates a time and a place  Quebec in the sixties seventies and eighties and evokes the era with an amazing sound track and jawdropping acting. You're there in the moment with Gervais played by Michel Ct who is the macho factoryworking Dad. He's the proud father of five sons but gradually realizes that one of them is a 'sissy' and takes this on personally in the jock world he inhabits. The father is a fully rounded character not cast in the black and white mold so prevalent in other movies of this genre as his puzzled love for his fourth son Zac played by MarcAndr Grondin is palpable.The movie takes off in completely unexpected directions. Zac is totally uncomfortable with his sexuality and prays all the time for a 'cure'. He just wants to be like his brothers and earn the love and acceptance of his father. It is telling that for Gervais he can accept his druggie son but not the one he suspects of being a 'fairy'.There is a huge amount of humour in the movie one scene in the cathedral with the boys' choir singing Sympathy for the Devil brought a joyful laughter to the audience I was in. It is that kind of movie. Gervais sings Charles Aznevour's hits with predicable regularity and has a thing for Patsy Cline and her music.It is the era when everything was changing and insular Quebec like the rest of the world was being exposed to the outside world of David Bowie and Jefferson Airplane. Zac embraces all of these changes and struggles with his orientation.Nothing is ever graphically portrayed the plot is character driven all the way with incredible little sidelines and sidebars thrown in to add to the concoction. One scene of a drunken brawl played to a beautiful opera piece comes to mind. Danielle Proulx who portrays the mother does not have much dialogue typical of the era but when she does speak it packs a wallop. She has a wonderful scene with Gervais where they discuss anal sex and a couple of others where her psychic ties to her son Zac are evident but never discussed.The film just gets under your skin you are there in that microcosm of time when the world was changing so drastically and we just didn't know it. 9 out of 10. Take a bow JeanMarc Valle you have an absolutely amazing talent! Bravo to the entire cast and crew. Movies are a pleasure when they're this special and yes I would see it again.".

For example the main character a young boy who is deeply conflicted with his sexuality is told he has the ability to heal people just by thinking of them if they are hurt...something which is uniquely Quebecois old wives tale The movie spans 2 decades or so and the recreation of those decades from the house decor to the music is really well done. The sound track shows in equal weights great Quebec classics along side such rock legends of the time of Pink Floyd and David Bowie.The movie is great not because of a complicated twisty plot but rather really well acted and created characters. A very touching portrait of family life that can be appreciated not by just someone from that culture but supersedes cultural boundaries.".

	schema:headline " Best Quebec movie ever? I'd say so!";
	schema:reviewBody "To say it bluntly it is to my advice the best Quebec movie ever made and from a more global perspective a very good movie no matter what you choose to compare it to.It is a story about a young homosexual although it isn't clearly stated in the film and it probably would be closer to the truth to say he's bisexual born in the 60's. We see him evolving through the next three decades with all the difficulties one might see in having troubles with sexual orientation in theses years among which the perception of other people of his age questions about himself because of the taboo nature of the topic problems having it accepted by parents and so on.There's many things that make me to say it's the best Quebecmade movie ever. First of all it's actually quite different from anything else to come from Quebec as far as I can think of it. This is quite surprising since almost all the action takes place in this province. It's far more dramatic and emotional than anything else before maybe saved Sur le Seuil which was more tragic. Besides Quebec has always produced a lot of humororiented movies les Boys QuebecMontreal etc which do have some charm but also feel like they have all been made out of the same recipe Quebec humor being one of a kind. It's also successful in not falling into traditional clichs of Quebec society in a given period of time a thing that Sraphin for example failed to do but at the same time depicting quite accurately what life was like at the time. It's also successful in incorporating a very diversified soundtrack using both songs from Quebec and American cultures. That lacked in many films although in reality you actually get both pretty much equally. To be able to recognize this and deal with it is worth being recognized. The casting is also pretty strong in part because of the performances of the actors but also because there are some new faces in it. Another annoying tendency in movies made in Quebec is that often see the same faces over and over again.If you put it in a larger frame it is still a must see that I believe will get it's fair share of attention and prices outside the province. That's a thing that the Invasions Barbares did but other than that it's hard to think of much more. The song track besides being very good is also brilliantly used. For example the music Zac listens to is very representative of theses decades you get Pink Floyd David Bowie and evolves with the character and is also used to create some insides between the characters like Hier encore j'avais 20 ans that is sung every Christmas. The three main antagonists in the movie Zac his brother Raymond and his father have developed relationships with each other that are by no mean static and in fact no even always antagonistic. Even though the story is told from Zac's perspective he's far from flawless as all the other characters except maybe for the mother who's more than often the neutral moderated one in the many conflicts that arise. Some dialogs are actually quite funny like the one about sodomy between Zac's father and his wife in which Michel Ct shows he's a damn good actor.Finally I would say that the movie is also successful in not using easy clichs when it comes to homosexuality. Many movies got fucked up when it came to that topic but this one doesn't. As I said before Zac is supposedly homosexual although it's never clearly stated and he might also just be bisexual. You don't get any real dirty stuff. The conservatives point of view on the matter are mentioned by his fathers among others but aren't overwhelmingly present either. The movie is wellbalanced.".

If it does not wait for it on IFC Sundance or on DVD and see it then. Bravo to JeanMarc Valle and the cast and crew of this film...Outstanding work!";

Scheduled for wider distribution in Canada and the U.S. the film has already grossed six million dollars in Quebec since its summer release and is already Canada's nominee for Best Foreign Film at the 2005 Oscars. Although it cannot be considered entertainment for the whole family it will not offend anyone and just may become the first gaythemed film to attract a mainstream audience.The film is about an ongoing struggle between Zac the second youngest son in a family of five boys and his overbearing homophobic dad Michel Ct a bluecollar worker who collects Patsy Cline recordings. C.R.A.Z.Y. covers a period of thirty years in the life of a suburban Catholic family and has a remarkable feeling for the era. Born on Christmas Day 1960 Zachary Beaulieu is the second youngest of five sons. The adult Zac narrates the film and we see the world through his eyes. He tells us that the reason why he has always hated Christmas is because the holiday always overshadowed his birthday and because the presents he received were not those he really wanted. He recalls how he received a game of table hockey when all he wanted was a toy baby carriage.Zac at six Emile Valle is a quiet sensitive boy who loves his parents but does not get along with his brothers who are always teasing him. Zac's mother Danielle Proulx is very religious and believes that Zac has special healing powers partially derived from the fact that he is always able to quiet the youngest boy an infant who has colic just by holding him. When his special powers are reinforced by the Tupperware lady it becomes apparent that he will never be like everyone else. When his father Gervais catches him dressing in his mother's gown and pearls while watching baby Yvan the namecalling starts and their relationship is never the same. Zac prays every night that he doesn't turn out to be a fairy but with mixed results. The other boys are more acceptable to their father simply because they are more manly but we never really find out much about them other than the roles they played in Zac's life. The oldest brother Christian Maxime Tremblay has an active intelligence and reads a lot Antoine Sbastian Blouin is a sports nut and Raymond PierreLuc Brilliant is a rebellious teen who will eventually get into trouble with drugs more acceptable to dad than being gay. The brothers are stereotypes but the performances are so full of kinetic energy that it doesn't get in the way. When Zac reaches fifteen MarcAndr Grondin assumes the role and turns in a flawless performance allowing the audience to feel his pain and torment. Awkward in social situations he stays in his room listening to David Bowie whom his father calls that fag singer and Pink Floyd. When dad thinks he catches Zac making out with another boy he forces him to go to a shrink to be cured but the sessions are terminated when Zac tells him that the psychiatrist blames his father.Zac wants to please dad so much that he starts sleeping with his best friend Michelle Natasha Thompson. In fact Zac resists his orientation so much that he beats up a young gay pursuer to show how macho he really is. The film's third act shifts into the eighties where Zac is working as a DJ still crazy after all these years. When his father accuses him at his brother's wedding of preferring male companionship Zac leaves the country going to Jerusalem to try to discover his identity and to pursue his pleasure in a nonthreatening environment. Though there is a touch of nudity there is no overt sexuality shown and Valle seems careful not to disturb anyone and the film offers a somewhat pat yet moving conclusion. Disappointingly the view of gay life is very limited. Zac seems to have no interests outside of the pursuit of pleasure and no real relationships are shown either male of female. Yet C.R.A.Z.Y. is more about being different in a conformist society and the struggle for selfawareness rather than just about being gay. As Valle explains it the theme of the film is personal acceptance. It's about this struggle to express yourself and being honest in the moment Winner of the Best Canadian Feature Film Award at the recent Toronto Film Festival for its standout acting its incredible emotional resonance and extraordinary visual inventiveness C.R.A.Z.Y. is one the best films of 2005.".

As director JeanMarc Valle stresses the theme of the film is personal acceptance... about the struggle to express yourself and being honest in the moment and such softsoaping is probably one of the reasons it's cleaned up back home in Quebec.At the time of writing it's grossed over US5 million in a province of 6.5 million people as the producers remind us nearly everyone in Quebec has seen this movie. On the other hand their cousins across the border have all but ignored it and it's tempting to see in C.R.A.ZY. parallels between the two territories' relationship in the film's themes of 'otherness' and awkward isolationism.Emphasising Zac's 'otherness' his initial entry into the world on 25 December 1960 owes more to the horror genre with the emphasis on bloody birthing tables and foreboding incubators a beast is born and he will indeed end up slouching toward Bethlehem in the film's third act. Furthering the antiChrist imagery he's also comes furnished with a strange birthmark on his scalp which his mother Laurianne Proulx with whom he shares a strange psychic bond believes denotes the gift of healing  a blessing for good or ill.Almost immediately however he's dropped on his head by his resentful brothers the Three Morons heralding the movie's tragicomic tone and foreshadowing two decades of spills thrills and hard knocks. Most all these ensuing scenes will be filtered through family life or Zac's inner life we never see him in class or at work. If his brothers  sporty rebellious and eggheaded  share little in common with their sensitive sibling their bullish patriarch the Charles Aznavourcrooning Gervais Cote initially takes a shine to his youngest son taking him out on secret French fryguzzling expeditions and attempting to curb his doting wife's cooing indulgences.Gervais puts his foot down when she buys Zac a doll's pram determined his son won't grow up to be anything less than a man's man. I knew very well what a fairy was says Zac. I especially knew I didn't want to be one. Understandable really this is a man whose homophobia extends even to the gospels Sometimes I wonder why we pray to a longhaired guy who hangs out with a bunch of guys in robes grumps papa. Nevertheless Zac prays to Jesus every night to make him less soft.Predictably enough everything goes awry after Zac accidentally smashes his father's rare Patsy Cline import  and especially when he's caught trying on his mother's dresses and pearls. I can still remember the snow melting on his face I had just turned seven and had unwittingly declared war on my father. Zac is sent to a psychiatrist after Gervais spies him apparently making out with another boy and succumbing to parental peerpressure he beds his best friend Michelle Thompson. He also beats up a 'gay' stalker in a misplaced display of machismo. Offsetting the hardships temporary salvation comes in the form of David Bowie Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones. Trying to find himself Zac eventually winds up in Jerusalem where he takes a lover a man this time and nearly dies in the desert before returning home to make peace with his father prompted by his offering of a replacement Patsy Cline LP he's coincidentally found at an Israeli market stall.There's a lot to like about C.R.A.Z.Y. in its soapy way. The soundtrack for one thing during one glorious scene Zac imagines himself levitating above a church pulpit as the congregation sings joyously to 'Sympathy For The Devil'. It's like Todd Haynes meets Dennis Potter. But it's during these fantastical musical interludes that the film really soars.The hairstyles fashions dcor are what you'd expect from a 1970sset drama though interestingly nestling among the Bruce Lee posters and period LPs in Zachary's bedroom is Pink Floyd's 'Animals'  released two years after the scene is set in 1975. It could be an honest oversight of course but it's possible to ascribe a more timeless tale taking precedence over historical verisimilitude. As Morrissey once lamented this story is old but it goes on and C.R.A.Z.Y. featuring much Bowieworship intergenerational conflict and agonised selfdiscovery could be set pretty much anywhere at any time in the Western world during the past 30 years.Grondin as the teenage Zac ably conveys his anguished plight and though mostly ciphers the supporting cast also put in decent performances Ct and PierreLuc Brilliant elder brother Raymond in particular. However at two hoursplus C.R.A.Z.Y's in danger of overstaying its welcome while the ending is one of the few bum notes in an otherwise well plotted movie homophobia vanquished in one fell swoop by a Patsy Cline record? Oh the irony.".

As director JeanMarc Valle stresses the theme of the film is personal acceptance... about the struggle to express yourself and being honest in the moment and such softsoaping is probably one of the reasons it's cleaned up back home in Quebec.At the time of writing it's grossed over US5 million in a province of 6.5 million people as the producers remind us nearly everyone in Quebec has seen this movie. On the other hand their cousins across the border have all but ignored it and it's tempting to see in C.R.A.ZY. parallels between the two territories' relationship in the film's themes of 'otherness' and awkward isolationism.Emphasising Zac's 'otherness' his initial entry into the world on 25 December 1960 owes more to the horror genre with the emphasis on bloody birthing tables and foreboding incubators a beast is born and he will indeed end up slouching toward Bethlehem in the film's third act. Furthering the antiChrist imagery he's also comes furnished with a strange birthmark on his scalp which his mother Laurianne Proulx with whom he shares a strange psychic bond believes denotes the gift of healing  a blessing for good or ill.Almost immediately however he's dropped on his head by his resentful brothers the Three Morons heralding the movie's tragicomic tone and foreshadowing two decades of spills thrills and hard knocks. Most all these ensuing scenes will be filtered through family life or Zac's inner life we never see him in class or at work. If his brothers  sporty rebellious and eggheaded  share little in common with their sensitive sibling their bullish patriarch the Charles Aznavourcrooning Gervais Cote initially takes a shine to his youngest son taking him out on secret French fryguzzling expeditions and attempting to curb his doting wife's cooing indulgences.Gervais puts his foot down when she buys Zac a doll's pram determined his son won't grow up to be anything less than a man's man. I knew very well what a fairy was says Zac. I especially knew I didn't want to be one. Understandable really this is a man whose homophobia extends even to the gospels Sometimes I wonder why we pray to a longhaired guy who hangs out with a bunch of guys in robes grumps papa. Nevertheless Zac prays to Jesus every night to make him less soft.Predictably enough everything goes awry after Zac accidentally smashes his father's rare Patsy Cline import  and especially when he's caught trying on his mother's dresses and pearls. I can still remember the snow melting on his face I had just turned seven and had unwittingly declared war on my father. Zac is sent to a psychiatrist after Gervais spies him apparently making out with another boy and succumbing to parental peerpressure he beds his best friend Michelle Thompson. He also beats up a 'gay' stalker in a misplaced display of machismo. Offsetting the hardships temporary salvation comes in the form of David Bowie Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones. Trying to find himself Zac eventually winds up in Jerusalem where he takes a lover a man this time and nearly dies in the desert before returning home to make peace with his father prompted by his offering of a replacement Patsy Cline LP he's coincidentally found at an Israeli market stall.There's a lot to like about C.R.A.Z.Y. in its soapy way. The soundtrack for one thing during one glorious scene Zac imagines himself levitating above a church pulpit as the congregation sings joyously to 'Sympathy For The Devil'. It's like Todd Haynes meets Dennis Potter. But it's during these fantastical musical interludes that the film really soars.The hairstyles fashions dcor are what you'd expect from a 1970sset drama though interestingly nestling among the Bruce Lee posters and period LPs in Zachary's bedroom is Pink Floyd's 'Animals'  released two years after the scene is set in 1975. It could be an honest oversight of course but it's possible to ascribe a more timeless tale taking precedence over historical verisimilitude. As Morrissey once lamented this story is old but it goes on and C.R.A.Z.Y. featuring much Bowieworship intergenerational conflict and agonised selfdiscovery could be set pretty much anywhere at any time in the Western world during the past 30 years.Grondin as the teenage Zac ably conveys his anguished plight and though mostly ciphers the supporting cast also put in decent performances Ct and PierreLuc Brilliant elder brother Raymond in particular. However at two hoursplus C.R.A.Z.Y's in danger of overstaying its welcome while the ending is one of the few bum notes in an otherwise well plotted movie homophobia vanquished in one fell swoop by a Patsy Cline record? Oh the irony.";

The two of them are more alike than any other 2 family members shown in this film. Sadly how many wasted years and how much heartache til they found that out and eventually owned up to it. Repeating here I believe a lot of Dad's 'problem' was that he sometimes realized he was a great deal more like Zac or vice versa than he was comfortable with. That's when their relationship would 'cycle down'. Ah poor Zac how does one cope with that? Took him a very long time to figure out how to do so didn't it?Finally one thing truly stands out for me and that is how very difficult it has to be for an essentially firsttime theatrical film actor to let's face it carry a 2 hour movie.........this being Grondin's firstever theatrical release film since reaching teenage. And as a final thought about MarcAndre why not admit it what an amazing kid even more what a great 'package'.......what a gorgeous ass!

I expected something like Dazed  Confused something that gives you a nostalgic 70's feeling and shows some young people smoking pot while listening to Led Zeppelin. C.R.A.Z.Y. is so much more than that. The people in it listen to Pink Floyd! Just kidding this movie really is something special. As it's telling the story of the main characters it takes us through three different decades a little like Forrest Gump does showing how fashion and the whole lifestyle changed over the years. The main focus however is on a boy called Zach his coming of age his ambivalent relationship to his family and the trouble with him and his father accepting that Zach is gay. The story is told so realistically and with so much heart that you really fall in love with those characters although we don't get to know too much about any of them except for Zach and his parents. His brothers and the girl next door are always just there without any explanation why they are the way they are. That doesn't really matter though. One of this movie's big advantages is that it never ever points out more than necessary.Somehow directorcoauthor JeanMarc Valle knows how to make every scene special. He really gets to the core of his characters. The cast of course is awesome too without an exception. Both actors that play Zach Zach's father and mother his oldest brother... they all turn in great performances.Some said that C.R.A.Z.Y. is a little too long. I agree that it seems long and epic but for once it didn't bother me at all. Not in the way that Pirates Of The Caribbean 2 or SpiderMan 2 or The Matrix Reloaded or any damn action sequel of the past 5 years were much too long. Once I was lost in C.R.A.Z.Y. I didn't want to leave its world anymore so I'm glad the makers took their time. I even thought the movie ended a bit too quickly.So I can only say it again. This is a real gem. A real important movie and  just on a sidenote  maybe the one movie next to Brokeback Mountain that shows homosexuality as something completely normal that's still very hard to deal with for everybody involved. C.R.A.Z.Y. isn't just about someone coming to terms with his sexual orientation though. It's mainly about family. About love understanding and acceptance. It's probably the best coming of age movie I've ever seen.".

	schema:headline " A new favourite!";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this DVD twice within a few days I loved it so much. C.R.A.Z.Y. JeanMarc Valle is at once a comingofage story family drama coming out story and religious fable. It centers around Zachary born on Christmas Day in Montreal in 1960. He is the fourth of five sons and he is special in many ways including that he is a sort of favourite of the father Michel Ct and is believed to have the gift of healing.This film follows Zachary from a child into his teenage years and then into his early twenties. He develops a passion for music like his father Gervais has this greatly pleases him and results in proud comments as well as an odd assortment of musical instruments as gifts. While his father's pride is developing however it is also being tested by Zachary's sometimes strange behavior Zachary is the sensitive one and is the only son out of five who does not develop typically into male behavior such as sports motorcycles and a slew of girlfriends. An early desire to have a baby carriage as a gift is quickly dealt with. This perceived conflict confounds and frustrates Gervais and Zachary both.C.R.A.Z.Y. is a film about a man's love for his sons and one of the son's undying love for his father. Zachary loves his father so much and wants so badly to make him proud that he buries his true self deep inside even to a breaking point. Zachary was incredibly portrayed by both mile Valle as a child he is actually the cowriterdirector's son and MarcAndr Grondin as the teenageryoung adult. We see his childlike wonder and innocence slowly transform into an adolescent identity that is based on fear confusion and a strong desire to please his father. Gervais played by Michel Ct is man who truly cherishes his family but has a sometimes rough exterior. He struggles with the idea that his children's happiness may result from things that he can't control despite how badly he may want to. It is amazing to watch both characters grow into men who are mature enough able to let go of themselves and of each other. Valle does an incredible job of keeping some of the characters at arm's length mainly the mother and the other brothers while maintaining their believability and importance to Zachary and Gervais.A standout characteristic of C.R.A.Z.Y. is its use of music. Valle allegedly took a major pay cut in order to secure the licensing rights to the music of the period both French and English. The use of original recordings by Patsy Cline David Bowie The Rolling Stones Charles Aznavour Jefferson Airplane Pink Floyd and others not only authenticates the period but also communicates how passionate the characters were about music. Some of the sequences gave me goosebumps. Being a music lover myself I can relate to how certain songs literally define specific periods of my life. It's amazing how the careful selection of music and how it is subsequently worked into a film can have so much impact.This film is truly a gem and was Canada's submission to the Foreign Language Film category at the 2005 Oscars. I picked up on a lot more with the second viewing but I was totally sold after the first. C.R.A.Z.Y. is definitely one of my new favourite films.".

This is a wonderful story about a boy who is a little confused with his identity and unappreciated in the family frame save for his mother who only wants the best for him. Although the basis for the friction between father and son is the lad's homosexuality the situation and emotions are entirely transposable and many sons can identify with Zac. You wish with all your might that the dad comes to his senses even at the earliest of ages and loves his son without any reservations. There is very little wrong with this movie except that a scene or two may have been stretched out longer than needed but who am I to criticize the artistic intentions of the filmmakers. This is a great addition to the recent phenomenal Quebec works Les invasions barbares The Barbarians Invasion and La grande sduction Seducing Doctor Lewis. I sincerely hope this movie will be nominated at the Genies Cannes Golden Globes and Oscars and any other worthy event.".

Vincent Gardenia as Peci's overbearing father is a role not unlike the one he played in Fire Sale. The Super is sort of a cross between Fire Sale and Mel Brooks Life Stinks. The movie definitely is re watchable and most likely will seem even funnier on repeat viewings. Highly recommended especially for those who appreciate dark comedy.  MERK".

He meets a council woman from court Osbourne who checks in on him to see if he's doing what he supposed to do and tries hitting on her. He befriends Marlon Blades who tries getting him to play basketball and such. Soon Louis realizes he can't be like his selfish father and must be his own man.

My comment will be rather positive and I have nothing to do with the production of the movie.I've read an article on a newspaper about CH7 it was free to download so I gave it a try. I liked it and today after seeing it for the third time I still had fun.Of course CH7 has a lot of technical problems the footage goes from acceptable to very poor there are for example night scenes that are clearly shot on daylight and then retouched. The color in general is sometimes bright and of good quality but other times it seems very washed out and shot with low res cams.I liked the cut of the movie it's a bit weird sometimes but this is OK for the story that is presented. The music is also very poor but not disturbing. There is only a Mission Impossible similar tune that is maybe used too many times.Speech sound is a bit worse in some scenes it's difficult to understand some lines because they are to low and there are speeches where the question is with a good volume but the answer is impossible to hear.The acting is sometimes very amateur but the main part of the time it's acceptable and its supports the story.And now to the important part which makes this movie interesting the story. The plot is very linear with some very funny moments I really enjoyed it and the main idea of the medias that manipulates the news the girl group that can't sing and the main characters that wants to fight this problems is very well presented in a pleasant ironical way.CH7 can't compete whit a real movie here I must agree with the negative comment. But it's an effort of a group of young people to create something with their own hands and the result is an enjoyable film compared to a real movie it is technically very poor but it still has something to tell and I thanks the CH7 staff for giving me a nice story that proves that a movie can also be made with low budget.I'm waiting for their next projects.".

The footage of CSNY is wonderfulthe elusive Crosby the clumsy but still vital Stills the optimist Nash the rabblerousing Young. The footage from Iraq is shocking. But the most troubling in the film is the Atlanta segment. After nearly eight years of an absolute failure of an administration one which invaded a nation that never attacked us how many 911 terrorists were from Iraq again??? I find it shocking that so many people back this President and Vice President No Questions Asked. Neil Young directs the film under a pseudonym and includes footage of Atlanta fans angered by the political direction of the concert demonstrating their disdain towards CSNY in colorful ways finger gestures and many four letter words. My question to them is WHY would they even see the concert in the first place? Did they ever bother to listen to the lyrics of Ohio For What it's Worth and Carry On? Young could have easily excised that footage out but he includes it which leads me to ask if Toby Keith made a documentary and had opposing views were captured on film would he include that in the final product? My guess is nothe right pointofview is the RIGHT pointofview and no matter how many lies and cover ups are exposed in the Bush administration these people will stick with them like Hitler and Goebbels in the bunker. But I digressthis film like No End in Sight Why We Fight and The Dixie Chicks Shut Up and Sing before it is vital viewing for any real American patriot. Thomas Jefferson said that the first act of a true patriot is to question its leaders.

	schema:reviewBody "In 2006 rock 'n roll icons Crosby Stills Nash and Young played a Freedom of Speech tour to protest the war in Iraq. The band that wrote Ohio one of the most famous protest songs of the Vietnam era decided that the country needed a wakeup call some of the same spirit of protest and activism that once shook national policy and changed our nation forever. CSNY Dj Vu is a documentary based on this tour.Being a rock star must be the ideal profession because you get all the girls when you're young and somehow you're never too old. David Crosby Stephen Stills Graham Nash and Neil Young were an average of 62 years of age on the tour but still audiences gave them license to get down on the stage and generally applauded wildly with love and admiration. But don't expect the typical fawning fans of a concert movie. This is all about the tour about why they hit the road what they believe and how fans concertgoers and the American public reacted.Writer and ringleader Neil Young deserves tremendous credit for being candid and revealing. He quotes the glowing press reports of course but also the negative ones and even the stinging mockery. He also shows both sides of the audience reaction with the most antagonistic occurring in the southern red states where many fans walked out of the concerts in disgust coming for the music without realizing they were in for incessant politicizing including a song entitled Let's Impeach the President. And he even shows Stephen Stills falling off the stage looking every bit like the fat old man that he has become. Only Graham Nash really looks good. David Crosby looks like your uncle. And Neil Young just looks a little craggy until he takes his hat off. Then he looks like his age as well. It is fun and nostalgic to see the old footage interspersed and to follow the band as they meet people and introduce those that affected or were affected by the experience. CSNY Deja Vu is not a great movie by any means. There's not enough music to make it a concert film and not enough action to pick up the slack. But there is nevertheless something admirable even touching about their breed of 60's style activism their belief that people are dying needlessly and their genuine heartfelt desire to make a difference. As they repeatedly demonstrated they have profound respect for the servicemen overseas but don't see continuing the war as the best answer. Agree or not it strikes me as the sincerest form of patriotism.Sundance Moment Someone in the QA said that he had lost a brother in Iraq and told Neil Young that you have no idea what you're talking about. It was a tense moment in the very liberal Sundance crowd. I'm guessing that Young has dealt with this kind of thing dozens of times on the tour and he chose to handle it by essentially backing down. I think you're right he said. We're just trying to get people to talk about it. Well that might be an easy answer but I'm not sure it's honest. A song like Let's Impeach the President is something more than an invitation for dialogue it's a political statement of the strongest kind. I respect the band's sincerity but was disappointed they were something less than forthright when challenged.".

It's horrible to hear the same pathetic ignorant war mongers rant about an illegal invasion making them safe. Stephen Stills helped so much with the last elections. I hope the film does the same this election. After seeing bush win the last two elections I have little hope but I will vote. When the DVD comes out it will make a great addition for those who collect concert films. I went to France a couple days after the war broke out. Paul McCartney had an entire audience there singing All We Are Saying Is Give Peace a Chance. So I expect the film to do really well in France also. They can't take away free speech even if they can listen to our phone calls! So what listen all away. This is a great movie and we do not want this war.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie could almost be the movie accompaniment to Neil Young's then new album the strongly antiIraq war Living With War. To take his message out to the people he corralled the musical support of his sometime bandmates Crosby Stills and Nash and the documentarymaking support of veteran war reporter Mike Cierre. Although the majority of the documentary interviewees are in the CSNY antiwar camp a fair representation is given to the prowar supporters opposite point of view.That in fact is one of the key things I got from the film just how polarised the debate is Stateside with almost noone in the middle ground. When the two factions clash as at a gig in Southern Alabama sparks fly as prowar members of the audience who have paid good money for their tickets walkout enmasse when Neil provocatively cranks out his new song Let's Impeach The President complete with sympathetic supporting bigscreen video technology conveniently spelling out the controversial lyric. The movie follows the group around the country interviewing band members particularly about the group's history of speaking out against war and for peace down the years. With a setlist concentrating on their message songs often as in Ohio Find The Cost Of Freedom and For What It's Worth the music segments are strong although there are probably too many Living With War tracks causing some overkill on the message.The voxpop interviews with Vietnam veterans the wives and mothers of deceased combatants and recentlyserved Iraq and Afghanistan tourofduty soldiers are interesting and as I said earlier kept reasonably balanced and fair. There's also a plug for Young's Living With War website part of which highlights new music on the antiwar theme and through which he showcases a young American musician now writing and performing after serving a tour of duty in Iraq.The four famous band members all very much show their ages Stills apparently joining Crosby's walrus colony while Nash and Young are slimmer but their faces are definitely marked by the lines of age. The once pristine harmonies are also more ragged but somehow that fits with the message they're putting across here. As artists I admire them for eschewing a greatest hits nostalgia package for this thoughtprovoking politically slanted show although in so doing they really become Young Crosby Stills and Nash. This movie directed by Young at times uneasily tries to marry the main antiwar message with the conventions of a rock concert movie but it was always going to be an awkward fit and I commend Young and his fellow musicians for at least sticking their heads above the parapet like this.".

	schema:reviewBody "CSNYDeja Vu 2008  12 out of 4 Documentary covering Crosby Stills Nash and Young's 2006 Freedom of Speech tour which had them going back out with a purpose. According to what we're told here Young got the idea to protest the war in Iraq so they headed off on tour to see how many people they could reach. This documentary has reporter Mike Cerre going with the band from one city to the next where they face many diehard fans willing to put up with the protest but at some concerts such as the Atlanta one they come under fire with boos and walk outs. I got my first taste of the legends at the 92 concert in Noblesville Indiana and I still remember how strange a show it was. At times people were up cheering dancing and having a good time but the next song people would be cussing fighting and throwing things. I personally felt that the concert had many great touches but at times it was just too political for its own good. I'm not one against protest songs seeing as how my favorite artist is Bob Dylan but one needs the songs to be good in order for them to work. It's funny but this documentary covers the Atlanta reaction to Impeach the President which was full of cussing threats and walks out and this is probably the reaction the song had at a lot of places. You either cheered or left. For me the song was just so silly and badly written that I felt it was a disgrace to great songs like Ohio. The documentary is certainly onesided in its politics but I think fans and nonfans can have a good time with it because it's simply fun. If you're a fan of the classic songs then they're here to be heard and the guys sound great. The music is topnotch even on the weaker new songs and Young was just mind blowing in his playing. He was amazing to see live that night and many memories came back to me while watching this documentary. I thought the film was at its best when we see the guys before the show and tour when they were nervous about how the reaction would be. Seeing them after the show was great as well. Even if one doesn't buy into their politics and even if one has no politics this documentary is worth seeing just for the classic music and of course as a backstage pass to what was going on behind the scenes.".

There's no doubt that Neil Young is sincere is his efforts to protest the Iraq War and he's got plenty of company. Unfortunately turning a CSNY concert into a protest rally wasn't what a lot of fans expected when they bought their tickets. To be fair Young makes sure that the sour reactions of many fans are caught on film along with the rest of the festivities. He also plays up the notion that he has the utmost respect for our fighting men and women. Whether any of our service personnel would buy into this type of concert however is another matter. Since Young is a Canadian and was never subjected to the Selective Service Draft in the 1960's he's been free to voice his opinion without any repercussions. It would've been far more courageous for this band and Young to play this material in front of our troops than an accommodating audience. As far as the music here it's a pretty good performance if you can stomach the leftist nonsense. The boys can still harmonize even if a few of the high notes are missing. So far the movie hasn't made an impact at the box office. That will happen when you alienate half of the viewing public from the start. For a onesided favorable review of this film one can always turn on MSNBC and Keith Olbermann. Since the film has made less than 100000 nationally Young and company need all the help they can get. To paraphrase Shakespeare these fellows doth protest too much.".

The onstage video clips and other staging devices detailing the costs of the war in blood and treasure were terrific in their depressing way.The quality of the music was utterly stunning. I've heard bits of CSNCSNY live before and wasn't expecting much. Tight playing good arrangements GUITARS IN TUNE ! and wonderful singing. Also TREMENDOUS variety of material from the group's and its members' solo careers. As advertised the show featured every song from Young's thennew album Living With War. The album itself was marred by a grotesquely awkward combination of hard rock instrumentation with CHOIR vocals. This production was so bad that I couldn't tell if the songs were any good!HOWEVER the point here is that the Living With War songs were absolutely fantastic when adapted for performance by CSNY. The supporting musicians were all Neil Young veterans and I had the distinct impression that he was serving as ringleader of the entire operation. However all four of C S N and Y were featured equally to great effect.I love Neil I love the guts they showed in really busting chops about the war back in 2006 before it was quite so clear what a fantastic blunder this has been and I'm ready for whatever political content appears in the film.Let's just hope the incredible music is not underrepresented.I'm bound and determined to see this thing hopefully in a theatre and ultimately I'll own a copy on DVD.".

The man that descends from the vehicle is an exterminator supposedly but of course he is someone impersonating a bug man. He gets rid of some secretaries and begins to arrange the place changing into a business suit. He is Solal a well connected member of a mafia family operating in France. He had set an appointment with Lardier a man that knows his identity and knows he was set up. Solal is murdered on the spot.Solal's family swears to avenge his death. His brother nicknamed Cash enters the story at this point. He and his family have devised a plan for getting the murderer and for a caper that involves the stealing of valuable diamonds that a rich man will be bringing to a resort hotel in the Riviera.There is an ambitious police investigator Julia Molina who is into Cash's activities. She wants to infiltrate the operation because she has a plan in mind that might be flawless. For that she must become irresistible to another group that is being put together to help with the caper. She is in for a big surprise! Cah is a French thriller by Eric Besnard who also wrote the script for the film. One thing for sure Mr. Besnard has a keen eye in which to set the action. The director takes us on a tour of the world that only a few privileged people get to know and play. Mr. Bernard has written a lot for the movies. Giles Henry the cinematographer clearly understood what the man in charge wanted giving the film what it needed to go along with the action.Jean Dujardin plays Cash with playful style. Valeria Golino a good Italian actress usually seen in American films is on hand to play Julia Molina. Jean Reno an actor that has done a lot of action films doesn't have much to do in here. Alice Taglioni Francois Berland Cieran Hands and the rest of the supporting cast make a good contribution to the picture.".

Thanks TF1 et al for a fun and entertaining movie! I'm recommending this one to friends for light entertainment. I feel it is well cast has some fine contemporary actorsactresses and I believe they play their characters well. I feel an easygoing style fun lighthearted portrayal to the characters that plays well in the overall style of story. This is after all lighthearted pure entertainment. I can imagine the characters fun to portray and this film fun to make. The scenery and setting are bright and upscale. Nothing is dreary or drab adding to the overall lighthearted and delightful feel. I feel the reveals are well paced and will not give away too much or too little at least for me right up to the end. The pace seems right to me. It felt quick but not rushed. It kept moving and left me little time to ponder deeply something I feel appropriate for this type of movie. There is virtually no action in this movie it is all comedic drama with what I feel is wellpaced tension and relief. Some dialog is in English some in French. I've not been able to figure that one out since all the characters speaking English are supposedly French. The English dialog has some Anglicisms recognizable to me e.g. a fiver but may not be to some in the US and the English accents British or Canadian. The English I'm not a francophone subtitles for the French dialog seem very natural with the characters and what little French I know although I can't speak for the total accuracy of the translation. This is one of the easiest subtitled movies to watch I've seen and I tend to browse the foreign film sections of video stores and rentals more than any other section. I think all but the most naive viewers will start realizing what is really happening very close to the end but not too soon to spoil the ending. I think the writers director and cast have all made viewers' reveal timing nicely elastic and not brittle.Partial Spoiler Alert.... One reviewer felt that no group would do anything this elaborate just to leave  out in the Mediterranean in a boat out of gas and found that too far outside the realm of suspended disbelief for comfort. I believe that review completely misses the strongly implied impending mortal revenge about to take place off camera and just past the movie's time line. But I may be willing to suspend disbelief for this form of entertainment a little more than that reviewer. As with all movies of this type the intricacy of the scheme hatched is far beyond what anyone would sensibly rely on in real life. End Partial Spoiler...".

The plot is basically irrelevant  suffice to say that small time conman Cash Jean Dujardin pits his wits against Mr. Big Maxime  Dubreuil Jean Reno. It seems that Cash's endeavors are doomed to fail as Maxime not only has power but wealth and guile as well. Cash teams up with enthusiastic police officer Julia Valeria Golino whose understanding of the difference between right and wrong appears tenuous at best and together they set about trying to place a sting on Maxime. The action comes to a climax at a luxury seaside hotel with the protagonists fighting to secure an attach case full of expensive and unregistered diamonds.Also involved in the gallimaufry are Ciarn Hinds and Joe Sheridan as a pair of native English speakers involved with the French police force their grasp of both languages is highly competent  far more so than their professional abilities.The effect of watching CSH is rather like playing with a series of Chinese boxes nothing is quite what it seems. The 'good' characters turn out to be corrupt' the 'bad' characters are not quite as blackhearted as we might first assume. But director ric Besnard isn't much interested in morality he invites us to admire the ingenuity of the various cons instituted by the various characters. This is a world where only the fittest  and the most astute  survive.A highly enjoyable film with a series of ingenious shotstructures especially the use of splitscreen techniques recalling those days of the Swinging Sixties when everyone seemed so much more carefree than they do today.".

He's a hoot as a criminal dedicated to tracking down every cent of his stolen cash bringing plenty of his trademark deadpan humour to the part. Bean exerts an air of authority of quiet menace like few other actors and his presence here is second to none. His character is a guy who rarely has to resort to violence instead controlling people through his personality alone. He's fantastic the best I've seen him in years.The rest of the film is okay but the director can't hide the fact that most of the budget was spent on getting Bean and the rest of it feels rather cheap and lacklustre. It's amusing to see Chris Hemsworth preTHOR fame appearing here and giving a rather weak performance in contrast to Bean. And the ending is one of the lamest copouts I've seen in a good while. Thank God Bean is here to distract us from these shortcomings.".

	schema:headline " Cah Breaks Hollywood Rules";
	schema:reviewBody "In this day of cookiecutter thrillers and Hollywood formula flicks writerdirector Stephen Milburn Anderson and producer Naveen Chathappuram bring us a film that shatters genre rules. It's a story about the power of money and how it manipulates human behavior. In a movie manufactured by Hollywood groupthink this film would have been about two innocent victims Sam and Leslie who struggle to make their mortgage payments and one day during a police chase a briefcase bursting with cash lands on their old car they decide to keep the money and the bad guy comes looking for it. It would be the naive couple's story.But Cah isn't that simple. The story starts with Pyke Kubic Sean Bean a Brit flying into Chicago to help out his twin brother Reese Sean Bean whose cashladen briefcase collided with lawabiding Sam's car. So Cah is a brother loyalty story. Besides the brothers make a business deal Pyke will recover Reese's cash and they'll split it 5050.The line blurs between the traditional antagonist and protagonist especially as the story progresses. Pyke's unexpected accommodating manner and willingness to help Sam and Leslie collect the cash they stowed and recover the rest they spent paint him as a likable character not an evil antagonist. But Pyke has powers of persuasion both intellectual and physical and Pyke won't stop until he gets what he wants. So he moves in with Sam and Leslie until every last penny of the cash is back in the briefcase.Pyke is a savant with numbers.

	onyx:emotionText "In this day of cookiecutter thrillers and Hollywood formula flicks writerdirector Stephen Milburn Anderson and producer Naveen Chathappuram bring us a film that shatters genre rules. It's a story about the power of money and how it manipulates human behavior. In a movie manufactured by Hollywood groupthink this film would have been about two innocent victims Sam and Leslie who struggle to make their mortgage payments and one day during a police chase a briefcase bursting with cash lands on their old car they decide to keep the money and the bad guy comes looking for it. It would be the naive couple's story.But Cah isn't that simple. The story starts with Pyke Kubic Sean Bean a Brit flying into Chicago to help out his twin brother Reese Sean Bean whose cashladen briefcase collided with lawabiding Sam's car. So Cah is a brother loyalty story. Besides the brothers make a business deal Pyke will recover Reese's cash and they'll split it 5050.The line blurs between the traditional antagonist and protagonist especially as the story progresses. Pyke's unexpected accommodating manner and willingness to help Sam and Leslie collect the cash they stowed and recover the rest they spent paint him as a likable character not an evil antagonist. But Pyke has powers of persuasion both intellectual and physical and Pyke won't stop until he gets what he wants. So he moves in with Sam and Leslie until every last penny of the cash is back in the briefcase.Pyke is a savant with numbers. When he learns from Leslie the exact tally of cash that was in the briefcase he keeps a running tab in his mind of missing cash until every cent is replaced. There is a dark gleefulness in many of the scenes. Pyke escorts the couple to Leslie's mum's house where they've left a large sum of the cash for safekeeping. They discover that Mum has borrowed 600 and Pyke says When it comes to cash nobody can be trusted. When Pyke takes the couple to the banker who was foreclosing on their mortgage until Sam showed up with 7000 in cash from the briefcase of destiny Pyke negotiates a brilliant deal with the bank to loan the couple 11000.Sean Bean's Lord of the Rings Flight Plan Patriot Games National Treasure performance as Pyke is natural and intense.

It just happens that it falls on the roof of the car of Sam Chris Hemsworth a poor don on his luck guy. Along with his wife Leslie Victoria Profeta they automatically blow a lot of the money. It is then Pyke asks them to give them back the money they still have  pay him back the money they spent. That could be them trading in a car or even robbing convenient stores. It's a good premise made into a fun movie but it doesn't offer anything besides entertainment. There was already a movie like this called No Country For Old Men so there's nothing original and it's not really brave but it's certainly entertaining. Bean Profeta and Hemsworth are all good although Bean being the great actor that he is outshines both of the lesser actors. Cah does veer off into some unnecessary places but it keeps the audience fully engaged most of the time and Cah provides nice thrills and a decent social satire. The soundtrack by Jim Bianco is also excellent and adds a lot to the film. So overall I highly recommend this film for a matine.".

Bean owns this movie from the moment he appears and he is the reason that this film works. he is menacing without showing it and Obessessed with money which is clearly shown from the number of times he easily deducts sums of money in his head.But where Bean succeeds the the other two stars fail miserably. Hemsworth starts out really good but by the beginning of the third act he's annoying and it feels like he is copying his lines. Bean asks him to do do something Hemsworth says no menacing look from Bean so on and so on.Halfway through the film in my opinion Leslies character should have been killed as she is the most annoying on of all not knowing which side to bat for and embarrassingly enjoying the robberies.So for the first half of the film it's a superb satire on the media bending stories about money and obsession.The rest lets it down but well worth seeing for Bean.".

Bean owns this movie from the moment he appears and he is the reason that this film works. he is menacing without showing it and Obessessed with money which is clearly shown from the number of times he easily deducts sums of money in his head.But where Bean succeeds the the other two stars fail miserably. Hemsworth starts out really good but by the beginning of the third act he's annoying and it feels like he is copying his lines. Bean asks him to do do something Hemsworth says no menacing look from Bean so on and so on.Halfway through the film in my opinion Leslies character should have been killed as she is the most annoying on of all not knowing which side to bat for and embarrassingly enjoying the robberies.So for the first half of the film it's a superb satire on the media bending stories about money and obsession.The rest lets it down but well worth seeing for Bean.";

	schema:headline " More Bean for Your Buck";
	schema:reviewBody "The first thing you notice about Cash is that there is more Bean. More Bean on screen than any other time in my memory. And that my friends is a very good thing. Stephen Milburn Anderson chose wisely with his star for his quirky psychological thriller Cash opening next Friday April 9th. Sean Bean plays Pyke Kubic a quiet urbane mannerly man who knows what he wants and knows how to get it. He's been wronged or rather his brother has been wronged and he sets out to find who took the money to get back what he sees as rightfully his. Taking a cue from today's headlines Sam and Leslie Phelan are in debt and underemployed failing to pay their mortgage for the last several months. On his way home Sam Chris Hemsworth of Star Trek and the upcoming Thor drives under an overpass where a briefcase falls onto the hood of his car. Pulling over his discovers it's full of cash. A lot of cash. With no witnesses he takes it home to his wife Victoria Profeta and they feel they have discovered the answer to their prayers and go on a spending spree. Meanwhile Pyke arrives from London to visit his brother Reece in jail who tells his brother that he threw the stolen money away to destroy the evidence of the heist. Before being stopped by police he saw the case land on the hood of an old station wagon driven by a white guy. Pyke a clever calculating man doesn't take long in finding Sam and Leslie and sets out to take back what's his.Sean gets to play the juicy role of twins in Cash. I don't understand why no other director has ever thought of before given Bean's considerable range. In fact the scenes you see of him opposite himself are some of the most interesting in the film. The slight nuances that Bean is so damn good at. They're there and it's fun to spot them as you watch one slightly more Americanized twin speak with the more established Brit version. Once Bean is in control the scene is set into motion and the audience sees Sean do what he does best. We've all known that Bean plays a great villain bristling with rage in films like Patriot Games or smiling in smug superiority in Goldeneye or cleverly conspiring in National Treasure and just as easily he can put a turn in as the tragic but flawed hero Boromir in Lord of the Rings. With Cash it's his attention to detail his impeccable manner of dress his flawless manners and his charming demeanor that are... unsettling. He's a nice guy this Pyke Kubic. That is unless you don't do as he asks. And why wouldn't you do as he asks? If you're Sam and Leslie Phelan you're the ones who are in the wrong here. And so begins the task of giving back Pyke the money they stole from him. Every single cent down to the last penny. At one point Sam and Leslie say Can't you give us a break on the rest? We don't have it. And Pyke answers Are you asking me to assume your debt? No I won't. Hard to argue that.Stephen Milburn Anderson puts Stanley Milgram's experiment into action Pyke makes them steal they're too afraid to refuse the more Sam and Leslie start to steal the easier it starts to become which leads to something darker. No consequences he warns until after a decision has been made. It becomes clear in Cash that no one acts without having made a clear decision to do so first. This is where Cash makes you think. We are all where every decision has brought us to in life. Is it really possible to keep blaming everyone else for all your mistakes? There is also something completely unexpected in Cash a subtle use of comedy at which Sean excels. Deadpan humor laid with an undertone of seriousness that gives you a feeling that he has been waiting to play a part like this with judicious freedom for a long time. Go see Cash have a great time with Bean on screen for almost 90 minutes and ponder all the possibilities.".

Having spent my life working in and around Chicago it was also cool to play spot the landmark or neighborhood in this movie glad to see lots of movies being filmed in big Chicago. Going back to the movie... I never saw the trailer or even a TV commercial ad for this which probably could have helped push this one out more yet I chose to go see this. Filmwise the action lagged in some spots but overall the intensity and uncertainty of what Sean Bean was going to inflict upon those who stole his Cash was enough to keep this movie a thriller. I'd recommend going to see this otherwise it should be out on DVD soon enough.".

Going back to the movie... I never saw the trailer or even a TV commercial ad for this which probably could have helped push this one out more yet I chose to go see this. Filmwise the action lagged in some spots but overall the intensity and uncertainty of what Sean Bean was going to inflict upon those who stole his Cash was enough to keep this movie a thriller. I'd recommend going to see this otherwise it should be out on DVD soon enough.";

It also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by Barker.Especially fun is the performance by Cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the Nightbreed.  As happens in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters' castle with torches and pitchforks.  Only this time the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with guns and bombs.  And this time the sympathy you felt when you saw Frankenstein's monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the movie.This isn't a masterpiece and even Barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling work.

He raises the locals on an all out assault on Midian like a holy war in gods name led by the devil.Barkers themes of misunderstood monsters may come from his experiences as a homosexual male but they are always strong and honest. Nightbreed turns the genre on it's head. The monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone but man is hunting them.A 20 minute longer cut was originally submitted by Barker but the studio chopped it into this fractured masterpiece. Barker is hard at work trying to locate the missing footage for a directors cut release. Until then this version will have to do.".

There is such a wealth of imagination here that one can hardly take time out to think about the flaws. I was so amazed by the knockout apocalyptic finale that I could barely think about how silly the context is a bunch of redneck Canadians blowtorching a cemetary.he film's biggest flaw is it's sheer magnitude there are SO many characters plots subtexts overlays and so on that no really coherent or involving center emerges.  It can be interpreted as a story about how love conquers the supernatural a la Dead Again a Silenceofthelambslike psychodrama about a serial killer a dreamy horror flick reminiscent of Nightmare on Elm Street and especially Little Monsters  a Gilliaminspired fantasy the teeming underworld city is strongly reminiscent of Brazil and the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness in Time Bandits while other parts are reminiscent of The Adventures of Baron Munchausen a symbolic tale of racial tolerance and on and on.  So much happens so many characters are involved so many subtexts present themselves its hard to know what is going on at all.Still one really does have to see the film to believe it.  The underworld city is stunning its atmosphere created perfectly by both the production design and a series of bizarre tableaux of its residents.  It is a mark of Barker's screenwriting talent so often evident in his other films if you can look beneath the shlock that all the characters even monsters seen only briefly ring true in some strange way.  The many stories are actually touching.  Also the ending is cleverly conceived it doesnt go out of its way to leave the door open for a sequel rather the open door is integral to the plot.  I would love to see a followup just to know how Barker carries through the mythical aspects he introduces in this film's last part.Perhaps the film could have been more focused with fewer subsidiary characters perhaps the completely inappropriate but obviously intentional humor could have been dropped perhaps the entire serialkiller subplot could have been excised completely.

An amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. For the horror genre it has quite a few of subtle symbolics and references.

Unfortunately as is apparent most of Barker's budget was blown on the monsters which are excellent movie monsters with insufficient funds remaining for factors like cast. The actor who played the allimportant role of Boone was not up to it at all.  He conveyed almost nothing of the depth of Boone's torment which exists on a number of levels.  A talent should have been sought instead of a hunk. This is symptomatic of the film's weakness in general.

It's strange and at times lingers on stupidity but it's just such a good looking nice sounding and original movie it never fails except maybe during the over long climax. Nightbreed is a must see for horror fans or for fans of monster movie makeup.Boone Craig Sheffer has been having dreams of a town called Midian full of mutant creatures. In therapy his psychiatrist Dr. Decker horror director David Cronenberg has come to the conclusion that Boone is a murderer and gives him hallucinogenic pills and tells him to turn himself in. After almost getting killed Boone ends up at the hospital where he runs into a mental patient who also knows about Midian and tells Boone where to go. Midian located in a graveyard is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that don't let Boone in. After escaping with only a nasty bite Boone is shot dead by the police who were lead to his location by Dr. Decker. But Boone isn't dead. The bite causes him to live and he goes off to Midian. Meanwhile Boone's girlfriend Lori Anne Bobby tries to find Boone and get to the bottom of this. When Dr. Decker also finds out about this place chaos ensues.The plot seems long and complicated but it really isn't hard to understand. The plot among other things makes this movie really interesting. The makeup effects are astounding. The creatures look unique and amazing and make this a very appealing film. To add to more senses appeal we have a musical score by Danny Elfman that is both lush and bouncy and fits the film like a glove. The shots in the movie are also set up beautifully. The cinematography is lovely and the movie sets up an atmosphere that is never broken. Even the acting is good with the biggest surprise being director David Cronenberg giving a great menacing performance as the man who for one reason or another wants to see Boone dead. It's odd for a horror film to be this well done.The problems with the movie...well there are a few but the positives outweigh the negatives. The script features the occasional lame jokes to try and add some humor but almost every one falls flat. The mutant creatures look great and for the most part are well acted but sometimes it feels like they are just posing their awesome makeup for the camera. The worst part of the film would have to be the climax. It takes so long and is just constant chaos. It's the portion of the film that moves from individual characters and nice tight knit shots to fiery explosions from each direction and violence happening to characters we don't know or care about.Overall this movie is amazing to look at. It's a well done horror film but even with that said it has the occasional failure in character's lines and a messy climax. Nonetheless this is one to check out.My rating  out of . 101 mins. R for strong violence and language.".

Also Sheffer is lousy in his role and the ending was just horrible. I caught it in a theatre back in 1990. It WAS confusing and a mess but there was and is a lot of good material there to see what MIGHT have been.The story lacked a real strong back story about the Nightbreed I attribute this to the editing but you understand enough to get the plot. The makeup and sound effects are excellent and Danny Elfman provides a GREAT score to the movie. Also there's impressive set designsespecially with Deeker's lair and the Nightbreed's home. Also the movie makes you feel for the Nightbreed at the end and puts the audience firmly on their sideNOT an easy thing to do. Sheffer aside the acting is great by everybody. The actors playing the Nightbreed seem to be having a whale of a time even though they have tons of makeup on. Also Bobby has nothing to do but whine and search for Aaronbut she pulls it off. Also look for Doug Bradley Pinhead from the Hellraiser films horror authors John Skipp and Craig Spector and genre great John Agar in small roles.Hopefully we'll see a directors cut one daybut it's been 20 years so I don't think so.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Clive Barker and based on his 1988 novella Cabal this movie was a commercial and critical failure. Barker has always claimed that the producers tried to sell the film as a run of the mill slasher when it is anything but. In 2014 he finally was able to release a director's cut that fixed many of his issues.Aaron Boone Craig Sheffer Fire in the Sky dreams of a place called Midian where monsters are accepted. His girlfriend Lori has convinced him to start seeing a psychotherapist named Dr. Phillip Decker who is ably played by David Cronenberg of all people. All along Decker has been setting Boone up for the murders that he's been committing giving his LSD instead of lithium and filling his head with details of the murders.Decker urges Boone to turn himself in but he's hit by a truck and sent to the hospital where he meets Narcisse another man who knows about Midian. He explains to Boone how to get to the hidden story while he cuts off his own face.Boone makes his way to Midian where he meets the creatures who make it their home like Kinski Nicholas Vince the Chattering Cenobite from Hellraiser and Peloquin a demonic creature who smells Boone's innocence letting him know that there's no way that the murders could have been his doing.

	onyx:emotionText "Directed by Clive Barker and based on his 1988 novella Cabal this movie was a commercial and critical failure. Barker has always claimed that the producers tried to sell the film as a run of the mill slasher when it is anything but. In 2014 he finally was able to release a director's cut that fixed many of his issues.Aaron Boone Craig Sheffer Fire in the Sky dreams of a place called Midian where monsters are accepted. His girlfriend Lori has convinced him to start seeing a psychotherapist named Dr. Phillip Decker who is ably played by David Cronenberg of all people. All along Decker has been setting Boone up for the murders that he's been committing giving his LSD instead of lithium and filling his head with details of the murders.Decker urges Boone to turn himself in but he's hit by a truck and sent to the hospital where he meets Narcisse another man who knows about Midian. He explains to Boone how to get to the hidden story while he cuts off his own face.Boone makes his way to Midian where he meets the creatures who make it their home like Kinski Nicholas Vince the Chattering Cenobite from Hellraiser and Peloquin a demonic creature who smells Boone's innocence letting him know that there's no way that the murders could have been his doing. He bites Boone who runs into a police trap led by Decker and is shot and killed.He'd be dead if it wasn't for Peloquin's bite. Soon he returns to life in the morgue while his girlfriend decides to come looking for Midian herself. Boone becomes part of the Nightbreed thanks to their leader Dirk Lylesburg Doug Bradley Pinhead himself and from the touch of their god Baphomet.What follows is a battle between the police and clergy versus the Nightbreed ending with Boone rallying the supernatural creatures and destroying their home to stop the attacks.

With exception of from today's perspective outdated special effects this movie is perfect fantasyhorror action. Twenty years ago when I first read the book and saw the movie I was amazed. Now after watching it again I'm giving it strong eight. Role of main villain is played by David Cronenberg and some fantasy and horror writers including Neil Gaiman also have brief appearances. Unlike the book that is genius the film does not have a particular depth or characterization but it has a phenomenal atmosphere and very interesting and original monsters as well as great music.

	schema:reviewBody "Clive Barker's lost classic Nightbreed has had new life breathed into it after finally receiving a proper director's cut some twenty five years later while the theatrical cut is still a fine film the director's cut is far more cohesive in terms of content. The plot follows Aaron Boone a man who has been tormented by dreams of a serial killer and of a mysterious town called Midian only to find out that his dreams are becoming reality and the crimes are being pinned on him. In Midian he uncovers an underground city beneath the cemetery that houses a plethora of misfit monsters.A potent blend of fantasy and horror as Clive Barker is oft noted for Nightbreed is a deserved cult classic that has withstood the test of time in spite of its marginal shortcomings. The film is not exceptionally acted or even exceptionally edited and that goes for both cuts but the film exceeds in thematic content sympathetic characters and astounding special effects. The creatures are appropriately grotesque yet still human enough that they stand relatable and the painstaking amount of work that went into the prosthetics and effects department in general is impressive to say the least.Thematically Nightbreed is unusual in that it as Barker proclaims shows the monsters as sympathetic characters it refuses to uphold any sense of the status quo. It is a parable for misfits of virtually all minorities though the film has a very strong undercurrent in regard to the gay community and as a social parable wrapped in the embellishments of a fantasy horror epic it is incredible. The cast holds their weight despite some moments of unbelievability but as a gem of its time the prospect of Oscarworthy performances is not expected. Overall Nightbreed is a great film for those who specifically enjoy fantasy horror it is not a frightening film in any sense of the word and while it is marginally thrilling at times the greatest attraction here is the audience's immersion into the film's world it creates. It stands as Barker's greatest directorial achievement second to Hellraiser in my opinion. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nightbreed boiled down to its essence is a horrorfantasy about a group of monsters and mutants who take refuge under an isolated cemetery. There they are threatened by a mass murderer David Cronenberg who wants to see them all destroyed. There's a love story of course but its promptly overshadowed by the garish monster effects.Now by no means is Nightbreed a conventionally good film. While the makeup setdesigns and effects are very good the mood and the overall story pushes a lot of boundaries and makes for some intriguing social commentary. We are meant to feel sympathy for the nightbreed despite their outward appearance and seemingly satanic customs. Indeed the quasireligious imagery and constant grossout horror makes the finished product indigestible to mainstream audiences.The subtext itself is even more subversive when you consider the homosexual undercurrents. Homosexuality as a theme is cloaked under the auspice of uncontrollable bloodlust. Therefore the monsters themselves are metaphors seen as perverse and evil when in reality they are only trying to chisel out a living on the outskits of society.Now its not quite clear but it seems the nightbreed have a psychic link to those with violent fantasies like the lead Boone Craig Sheffer and later Ashberry Malcolm Smith. Those who cannot be nightbreed such as Boone's lover Ann Bobby and the old man at the service station have no violent tendencies whatsoever despite their desire to join the nightbreed i.e. to not be sexually repressed.The relationship shared by Cronenberg's character Decker and Boone is the most intriguing contextually speaking. They are meant to show unrealized sexual tension and selfloathing on the part of Decker who is also Boone's psychiatrist. While Boone becomes aware of his bloodlust by fighting on behalf of the nightbreed i.e. constructive political violence Decker cloaks his under a mask lying to himself and the world. Only when his mask is on can he indulge in his most unsavory fantasies.I could be grasping at straws here. After all such themes could be a guise for xenophobia racism or any social fear of the other. And while those are arguments to be made its worthwhile to note that Clive Barker came out during the early nineties and his novels and short stories almost always have strong sexual themes. Nightbreed could then be considered almost as a coming out party.Ultimately I'd recommend this film not only for its challenging social commentary and audacious set and makeup design but also because so many horror films nowadays lack such ambitions. And even if those ambitions aren't cranked up to eleven as they should be you have to admit Nightbreed is a gay ol' time.".

	schema:headline " Monster Nation";
	schema:reviewBody "Clive Barker is one of my favorite authors because of how he mixes both horror and fantasy and really creates an elaborate world or mythos to them. Out of a lot of the live action adaptations of his work this one believe it or not is my favorite one and it's also one of my favorite films of all time.I really like the story which is a wild but cool idea in a way the story is kinda an XMen tale only instead of mutants endangered by racism and prejudice it's monsters ok it's kinda the same difference. I like how these monsters are not portrayed as mindless two dimensional brutes but actually as living people. We see that these are a species that have always lived amongst us in secret and aren't looking for trouble but unfortunately trouble found them.The music is excellent as it's by one of my favorite composers Danny Elfman whom in the 90's was really on a hot streak at that time I love the theme which is one of my favorite themes of all time. The make up work is just fantastic this is probably the finest practical make up work I've ever seen in any movie and a prime example showing that old fashioned is still the best way to go. The Nightbreed are all colorful and unique they all have different features about them. I even like the underground world Midan they've constructed from all the passages and everything and the culture that exists it really made me wish to know more about it.There is even some action mainly the final battle at the end which is one of my favorite battles of all time. It's not exactly wall to wall but that's because it's kinda realistic as we are betting on the monsters to survive and overcome the supremacists that are trying to destroy them. I like how each of the monsters beat their opponents in unique ways one favorite kill of mine is a I dare say a sexy female Nightbreed woman forgot her name sorry whom is kinda a humanoid porcupine as she produces quills which then stab one of the supremacists in multiple places I thought that was cool.The characters are really solid if not the deepest. Arron BooneCabal Craig Sheffer is a decentsolid protagonist his character is sympathetic because he's on the run from a crime he didn't commit but worst of all has no memory of his origins. Once he discovers them he it makes him struggle all the more as he is finding balance with both his human and monster identity.Dr. Philip K. Decker played surprising well by David Cronenberg whom is one of my favorite movie directors and turns out to be a capable actor I can't help but wonder what this film could of been if he directed it. Anyway he's a solid antagonist as he is a psycho that is highly intelligent and uses that as his guise for his insanity which makes sense with most serial killers. He's really creepy he's armed with giant knives and has that really creepy mask almost as creepy as the Michael Myers mask. But also we see he want to hunt and kill the Nightbreed not out of racial prejudice but out of jealousy and envy because this is a human monster that desires to be a monster which I'll admit is something different.It's true there is a lot of them and we don't know them in great depth but each of them have a particular personality which gives you a good feel for them and even makes them all the more sympathetic. Which is part of why I love this film because usually in a horror film we are sympathetic toward the human protagonist that is being hunted and chased by the monster. Here it's the other way around as we see it's the monsters that are being hunted and chased.I really like how this film deals with the issue of racism and prejudice. We see that the real monsters are the supremacists that hunt them which makes sense because Supremisists are the greatest human monsters in history from the Nazis to the Ku Klux Klan whose sole desire is to wipe out any living creature that is different by their false and corrupt standards pretty much putting up more tombstones for humanity and their own conscious.Overall this is a great horror film that any fan of Clive Barker and horror should check out. Real monsters aren't always hidden in the dark but are in plan sight where you least see them.Rating 4 stars".

	onyx:emotionText "Clive Barker is one of my favorite authors because of how he mixes both horror and fantasy and really creates an elaborate world or mythos to them. Out of a lot of the live action adaptations of his work this one believe it or not is my favorite one and it's also one of my favorite films of all time.I really like the story which is a wild but cool idea in a way the story is kinda an XMen tale only instead of mutants endangered by racism and prejudice it's monsters ok it's kinda the same difference. I like how these monsters are not portrayed as mindless two dimensional brutes but actually as living people. We see that these are a species that have always lived amongst us in secret and aren't looking for trouble but unfortunately trouble found them.The music is excellent as it's by one of my favorite composers Danny Elfman whom in the 90's was really on a hot streak at that time I love the theme which is one of my favorite themes of all time. The make up work is just fantastic this is probably the finest practical make up work I've ever seen in any movie and a prime example showing that old fashioned is still the best way to go. The Nightbreed are all colorful and unique they all have different features about them. I even like the underground world Midan they've constructed from all the passages and everything and the culture that exists it really made me wish to know more about it.There is even some action mainly the final battle at the end which is one of my favorite battles of all time. It's not exactly wall to wall but that's because it's kinda realistic as we are betting on the monsters to survive and overcome the supremacists that are trying to destroy them. I like how each of the monsters beat their opponents in unique ways one favorite kill of mine is a I dare say a sexy female Nightbreed woman forgot her name sorry whom is kinda a humanoid porcupine as she produces quills which then stab one of the supremacists in multiple places I thought that was cool.The characters are really solid if not the deepest. Arron BooneCabal Craig Sheffer is a decentsolid protagonist his character is sympathetic because he's on the run from a crime he didn't commit but worst of all has no memory of his origins. Once he discovers them he it makes him struggle all the more as he is finding balance with both his human and monster identity.Dr. Philip K. Decker played surprising well by David Cronenberg whom is one of my favorite movie directors and turns out to be a capable actor I can't help but wonder what this film could of been if he directed it. Anyway he's a solid antagonist as he is a psycho that is highly intelligent and uses that as his guise for his insanity which makes sense with most serial killers. He's really creepy he's armed with giant knives and has that really creepy mask almost as creepy as the Michael Myers mask. But also we see he want to hunt and kill the Nightbreed not out of racial prejudice but out of jealousy and envy because this is a human monster that desires to be a monster which I'll admit is something different.It's true there is a lot of them and we don't know them in great depth but each of them have a particular personality which gives you a good feel for them and even makes them all the more sympathetic. Which is part of why I love this film because usually in a horror film we are sympathetic toward the human protagonist that is being hunted and chased by the monster.

While it would have been even nicer to get to know our characters a little better before the darkness falls the film succeeds on a visceral and visual level. The look is something special and the theme is resonant. The end result comes about through intolerance hatred and xenophobia and one cannot help but root for the monsters. Unfortunately the producers at Morgan Creek did not see eye to eye with Barker and compromised his vision. They didn't think it possible for monsters to be sympathetic or to be heroes.Craig Sheffer stars as Aaron Boone a young man unsure of whether or not he is committing murders. His psychiatrist Philip Decker a well cast David Cronenberg is not really any help. Unfortunately the police are convinced that Boone's a killer and track him down to the gates of a mysterious community named Midian. There he is pumped full of bullets. However what Boone had wanted was to become a part of this community believing that it's a place where sin can be forgiven. The monsters soon accept him as one of their own.Sheffer is okay but is easily out acted by Cronenberg who creates a memorable creep indeed. Anne Bobby is very appealing as Lori Boones' lover who embarks on a journey into this other world in search of answers. Charles Haid is excellent as a gung ho antagonist police captain Eigerman. The very fine supporting cast also includes Hugh Quarshie Doug Bradley Catherine Chevalier Nicholas Vince and Simon Bamford. It's a treat to see screen veteran John Agar in a small role.The varied and vivid makeup effects work on all of the characters is most impressive. Hats off to Bob Keen and his company Image Animation for all of their efforts.In addition to an engaging romance at the centre of things Barker is able to create a fierce dynamic apocalyptic climax that should have its viewers' full attention.A creature feature with a sensitivity towards its creatures Nightbreed is definitely worth a look or another one for fans of the genre.Eight out of 10.".

Nightbeed on the other hand is a unique horror Genre as it has a feel of realism that i've seen in very few other horror films.This films story on how a man gets murdered and ends up living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreaming Nightmare as its a very unique and original storyline. Most horror films i've seen are all quite fake but because Nightbreed was so incredibly sophisticated and geniously directed with superb acting especially by Craig sheffer Aaron Boone amazing special effects great lighting and fantastic dialogue I found this film to have a sense of depth and maturity with no silly fake horror parody whatsoever that many other horror films have. Nightbreed as well as being horror has elements of thriller romance and action all rapped in one. If you haven't seen this film I recommend you watch it as I rate it a 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a bit difficult to believe that this came from the same director that gave us HELLRAISER. Where's the style the foreboding and the charm? I mean HELLRAISER is not a great horror film but at least it had something. NIGHTBREED is like a large ball of bad ideas poorly executed. From the opening there is a problem with subtlety the monsters are shown in the first shot! The opening dream sequence shows too much for too long. Our hero doesn't display professional acting skills but no one expected that from this bastard genre. There are killings that one wishes were more interesting. Then we have David Cronenberg. The man was never really meant to be an actor. He fills the role of the creepy psychiatrist adequately but what he should have done was step behind the camera and save this disaster. Then we come to Midian a creepy fake graveyard with an overcreepy fake gate. This thing is not a huge improvement over the cemetery in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. It gets worse when we meet the creatures in it. There is nothing really wrong with the character design and makeup effects here well... except for the guy with no scalp the guy with a pointy chin and forehead and the fat guy with dark circles around his eyes the problem is the way they act and the terrible dialogue that is given them. Barker's photography of the subterranean city is tired and this part of the story could have been made much better. Some might call what follows SPOILERS. After our hero dies and becomes nightbreed we wait around to see what he'll turn into there's talk of things that fly and werewolves but when the time comes for him to change they appearantly thought their hero too pretty to give a decent creature design. With the turn in Cronenberg's character the story just gets less interesting until the battle of freaks vs. norms which is just bad. Barker's mythology failed him here. There is no genius and little originality behind any of NIGHTBREED. The picture could have used a larger budget a serious script and character design that doesn't leave you saying oh...oh how lame. What a waste. Not scary not cool not even very dark just weak.".

This is a classic example of an underdeveloped script  the answers to these questions may be obvious to the screenwriteradaptor but they leave the audience totally puzzled .

Well apart from this being a bad premise for a horror film I was confused as to how the humans can be uniformily   bad  ? Yes they attack the monsters lair but this is because they believe they've been behind the murder of humans along with Boone . There's absolutely no idication any human knows Decker was responsible . In other words they're guilty of nothing more than wanting to protect their community from more hideous murders . Is there anything wrong with this concept ? In my opinion  NO ! And the attack on Midian is way over the top. NIGHTBREED is set in Canada but the rednecks here are equipped with assault rifles  flame throwers and rocket launchers  since when have Canadian citizens been allowed to own these ? Despite these serious flaws I'm sad to see that Clive Barker seems to have retired from making films because I was hoping he'd become a big name in the British film industry .

I mean you had Peter Jackson the director of Lord of the Rings saying in the trailer this is one of best horror movie he's ever seen. Now if I did not go in with such huge expectations I could had enjoyed it for what it was. I really started enjoying Cabin Fever once it started playing on cable. Every time it comes on I watch it and I begin to love this film a lot more.Cabin Fever is directed by up and comer Eli Roth. He's a guy that loves horror films and mentioned in several articles this movie pay homage to his favorites like Evil Dead.Cabin Fever is about 5 college kids who had just finish test finals and are enjoying some relaxation and fun in a cabin in the woods but the fun is cut short when they learn a flesh eating bacteria disease is around. The main character Paul is played by Boy Meets World actor Rider Strong. Rider was surprisingly good in this movie and Paul is the character you root for the most to not get the disease.The movie is funny. The funniest movie ever? Hell no! This movie is scary. The scariest movie ever? Hell no! This movie is bloody. The bloodiest? Hell no! So I'm finally enjoying the movie for what it's worth and it is and has a potential to end up being a horror movie classic. There are tons of films that people hated when it first came out and then come to love it semi years later. Cabin Fever I believe is one of them.".

Eli Roth has captured very well the essence of of being a teenager in this very cynical society.The actions the characters take are in context very believable. Ask yourself if you were in a situation where you had to deal with the very likely possibility of becoming infected with a horrible flesheating disease would you be the first to lend a helping hand to the infected? Another thing that has been trashed by many reviews is the strange sense of humor the film has. The pancakes scene in particular. The humor in the film is the strange sort you would more likely find in a Troma film not the sextoilet variety thoughWhile it's not for everyone the sense of fun the movie has about itself is more suited to hardcore Bmovie fans than mainstream audiences. Eli Roth hearkens back to a time when movies weren't always about psychological thrillsbad twist endings and pretentious artistic meanings when they were about fun. It's a great movie to sit around with some friends and watch. So please don't judge it so harshly just because it's a movie to be taken straight with no shocking hidden meanings or twists. Hopefully this film will find it's audience with the cult movie crowd. Highly recommended to anyone with a love of BMovie cinema.".

There's bad actingpoor goreboobs 80'sunintentional hilarity eg bloody pom poms there's faux b grade indie low budget homage to the classics horror eg. Undead peter jacksons first movie. There's genuine comedygore shaun of the dead dawn of the dead then there's trying to be indie using the actor from Boy Meets World bad script writing poor direction indecisive drivel. that's Cabin FeverI don't know I should have known from the DVD cover of the 'forest scenelook closer and it's a spooky scull!! OooOOoO' that it was going to be rubbish. First off the hackneyed teen group is established don't forget the horny couple Neither the actors or the script give you any reason to get attached to the characters so prepare to not give a crap when they get infected with the mystery 'suddenly I'm projectile vomiting blood' virusWhat you can count on is dozens of unnecessary characters. Watch as they pointlessly drift in and out of the movie like so many dead fish in a pond or a RESERVIOUR?! Oops hope I didn't spoil anything original and clever. Groan. As a side note on that please note the dramatic music every time there is a shot of a glass of water cup of tea empty glass someone sipping from a glass etc just in case we didn't get it when we saw the dead body rotting in the river and the extended scene of the pipes going from said river to the cabin where our teens are staying and enjoying glasses of tap water. The mistake this movie made was trying to be horror quirky and actual horror and failing miserably at both. Even the gore was overdone and uninspired. The quirk just wasn't happening as it came in odd spots through the movie usually in places where you were baffled by some random 'crazy local' character or script anomaly. Note a random guy in a bunny suit isn't quirky. It serves only to suggest someone going mad which opens up all these 'maybe its all just some psychological hallucination' questions. But no its just some stupid goddamn guy in a bunny suit put there because they thought it would be CLEVER.So after trudging through an hour or so of infection spreading and vicious dog attacks blurry and in the background it looks more like a dog licking food off a mannequin you're treated with the main character going on a random killing spree? For no apparent reason? Someone then forcibly swallows a harmonica which is I guess..supposed to be funny. Except that its not too obvious he was playing a harmonica in the first place or why he was still playing it minutes after being approached by a blood soaked Rider Strong plus harmonica swallowing seems to involve a spray of mouth blood a'la the viruses projectile blood vomiting so it's all a little confusing. But it doesn't matter by this time you're just praying it ends soon.In heated conclusion this movie is horrendous! Do yourself a favour and stay away ignore anyone who says its 'kool d00d' Its not even so bad it's good. And if you didn't feel homicidal tendencies toward that Boy Meets World prat before seeing Cabin Fever you certainly will now.".

	schema:reviewBody "Five friends finish their exams at college and decide to relax by taking a break in the woods. They arrive at their rented cabin and begin to party  a party that is broken by a sick man who stumbles into their midst. They try to fend him off but accidentally kill him. With their car wrecked and their mobile phones not working they try to get help but their plans dramatically change when one of their number starts to show signs of having the same flesh eating virus that the stranger appeared to have.I remembered this film getting reasonable reviews when it came out so I decided to give it a try on DVD to see for myself. The film opens with a group of teenagers going to a cabin where they encounter 'something' and then slowly turn on one another as the tension mounts up. So far so genre.However the film does well to overcome the fact that we can't see or fight the assailant and still manages to mount up the tension pretty well for the majority of the film. It is in the last 30 minutes where it goes to pot  where the film opens up the sheer apocalyptic potential the virus has it chooses to focus on mad deer crashing through windscreen etc and starts to get quite silly. The lack of emotional involvement between the characters means that it is not quite as gripping as it should be  instead they turn on each other really quickly and only once do you feel for them.The movie borrows heavily from other films Evil Dead teen movies Night Of The Living Dead Dawn Of The Dead and in some ways it is not a problem but in others it is a weakness  for example the climax of the action is obvious because it is clear what it is referencing. Roth does OK as director and generally manages to keep the tension up regardless of the slightly daffy script. Like I say  he loses it a bit in the final 30 minutes and I have mixed feelings about his final scene. He throws in a quite funny joke about perceptions but also tries to mix it with the horror of an impending outbreak around the US. Generally it isn't that great a film but it is one of the better of the 'teen slasher' genre that I think it more or less fits into.The teen cast are too basic and they are only average  par for the course if you will. DeBello is OK Strong is quite enjoyable even if Kern got on my nerves bit. The two female leads are not as well used and a more cynical reviewer may suggest that the film makes lazy use of their naked bodies  again another genre clich. The support cast are pretty country and do what is expected of them  none of them really do that well and the blame for that should be shared between the cast and the script which doesn't give them more than clich to really work with.Overall I thought this was an OK film. Compared to the genre it is better than some of the other teen horrors that have been around recently although it isn't really that good. The first hour is pretty solid but the final half hour doesn't quite deliver on the potential that had been suggested up till this point. An enjoyable genre picture  nothing more nothing less.".

	schema:headline " An unfairly criticised debut it really is not that bad";
	schema:reviewBody "Eli Roth's debut Cabin Fever seems to be hated by the majority on IMDb and many other critics. I however found this to be a rather enjoyable little film that just falls short of being great. To sum up this movie take a bit of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre a bit of The Evil Dead a couple of elements from The Thing and Last House on the Left and you have Cabin Fever. A horror movie about five teenagers going to holiday in a cabin in the woods after college where the nearest town is filled with hicks and everything is slowly getting infected by an unknown virus which starts to turn everyone against each other. Roth blends horror with a small amount of comedy which suits this type of movie. The five teens are a mixed bunch the dumb guy the horny couple and the innocent couple. Most of them swear drink have wild sex and smoke drugs and because of this may seem annoying and clichd on the contrary Roth has captured the attitude of what teenagers were and still are like. We do all that they do well not so much drugs.. and to me that makes them more realistic. The locals aren't so realistic and seem to be their for comic relief and body count which isn't a bad thing. There is plenty of gore and plenty of scenes to make you squirm in disgust.The reason I don't give this a really high score is because the pacing seemed jumbled to me. For me the running time was really short and there were not enough scares throughout. This movie had potential to be more than the final product but I respect what Roth has done and considering it was his first movie it is remarkably good and for that I give it810".

	onyx:emotionText "Eli Roth's debut Cabin Fever seems to be hated by the majority on IMDb and many other critics. I however found this to be a rather enjoyable little film that just falls short of being great. To sum up this movie take a bit of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre a bit of The Evil Dead a couple of elements from The Thing and Last House on the Left and you have Cabin Fever.

Well take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine. Do that and you'll have a general idea of what Eli Roth's Cabin Fever is all about.I never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that Uwe Boll cranks out as the worst film ever made. But in all honesty I have to say Cabin Fever comes very close. This is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release. For somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as Eli Roth does he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie I think I have ever seen in my entire life. How do you screw up a story like this? Think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters without the bad writing and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy. A movie dealing with a grotesque flesheating virus could and should have been so much better than what Roth dished out for us here. This script failed on so many levels with me. And while I do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses I do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre.To say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words. A generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects can't even save it and that is one element I normally go for. There really was nothing about Cabin Fever that I could easily recommend to anybody. When three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through you know the movie is sinking fast. My best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing. One viewing was more than enough for me to know that I will most likely never bother with it again.".

For the most part the movie was a well made horror film that tells the story of five college friends on vacation at a remote mountain cabin when one of them contacts a flesheating virus. The movie is a somewhat realistic look at how people would react to such a situation. The movie stars Rider Strong from Boy Meets World Jordan Ladd Broken Lizard Club Dread Cierina Vincent whose spolier featured in two steamy sex scenes one of which is good and another is okay at first then it gets weird. For those of you who have seen it. You know what I mean James DeBello from Detriot Rock City Joey Kern and the rest of the cast of unknowns are believable in their roles. I didn't really like the ending which could've been better and the dialogue wasn't the greatest at times but overall Cabin Fever is an effective horror thriller better than others that have come out recently from writerdirector Eli Roth the man behind Hostel and Hostel Part 2 which at least to me weren't as good as this one. So if you're in the mood for a decent horror thriller you can go wrong with Cabin Fever. It for the most part delivers on whats expected from these kind of movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't really know whether Cabin Fever is supposed to be a joke or a film... But as far as I know it's much closer to being a joke than anything else. A few years ago the community of horror film makers decided to take a new step and make fun of the genre thus giving birth to the Scream series. A list was given in Scream of all the stupid things horror film characters will do that are predictable and the characters in Scream ended up doing exactly the same things which added a lot of humor and irony to this analysis of the genre and led to hope that horror films from now on would show a bit different either full of irony towards the genre selfderision towards the film itself or at least different in their dramatic process than all the old films that responded to the same tired criteria. In seeing Cabin Fever alas many will see how unoriginal serious pretentious boring and even not scary some supposedly scary films are now even a few years later. First of all this film lacks originality in a way few others do. It has been said several times how little imagination horror directors have today remaking remakes of foreign sequels but setting the film in a cabin in the woods just doesn't seem to be an hommage to anything it seems to be simply a ripoff. Whoever wishes to be surprised by other factors of the film's story won't be once again we are dealing with a film whose characters are all in their early twenties who won't think rationally when placed in front of a problem will rather argue for hours and pick up fights than try to think and do something about it. Not much excitement there either. For the umpteenth time in a horror film they are tempted to kiss make love and just basically have fun all sorts of things that don't really make them any different than any other horror film victims seen previously. Secondly this film is unimaginatively serious. Every situation the characters are in every dialog every situation in the film is treated with such seriousness that any viewer with a little sense of derision will be relieved when some characters finally end up dying. Nothing in the way the film is directed written or acted shows any sign of humor or sarcasm which is quite amazing considering the film is about an invisibleneverheardofbeforeflesheatingvirus no laughs please. I won't even bring up the acting since there are no actors in this film. The cast was most certainly hired for being friends or neighbors with the director. Thirdly and this will strike whoever has seen a good horror film before the screenplay is absolutely empty. Nothing really happens some actions are repeated several times let's try to get help! nothing makes sense either in the facts the psychology of the characters or even the hilariously lame last sequence of the film which is probably supposed to be funny according to the director and screenwriters. In the end I will only remark that a horror film is supposed to have something scary in it. Gallons of fake blood whether they are being vomited squirted from severed limbs or simply dripping from wounds never were enough to scare an audience. Such major features as screenplay ideas and even cruelty are requested for whoever claims to have shot something scary. If I wasn't considering it to be a total failure I would agree to reckon that the film has one talent it is filthy disgusting to watch. Yet being grossedout and being scared are two very different feelings let it be known.I would like to encourage anyone a tad curious or interested in seeing this film to check older major horror films first why not from the 60s the 70s the 80s films made by Wes Craven Dario Argento Sam Raimi Stanley Kubrick David Lynch Roger Corman William Lustig John Carpenter... it might not only give a good definition of what is scary or selfderisory horror but also convince viewers that new isn't necessarily better. A good example related to the film is the few tracks composer Angelo Badalamenti provided for this film even although they are unmistakably close to his previous compositions they are below anything he has ever done before.".

There is so much wrong with the film you can't help but be amazed at how bad it really is.  This movie had so much potential to be good but ultimately made nothing of it.  The characters were as dumb as one can be for the entire movie you're just asking yourself why would you do that? or what's your point in doing this?...this is how illogical and stupid the characters are.  We get NO background into them so naturally you really don't give a rats as about their fate...you could only laugh at their stupidity.  The 'slut' Marcy for instance... was she that horny that she had to sleep with Paul Rider Strong?  There was no point in that....its almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so voila!  UGH. Would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin WITHOUT looking at it first?Why didn't Bert just shoot the sick guy from the start?  Movie would've been over that way....besides they ended up killing him anyway.Why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin even if they had to walk?  'No I'll just wait until 2 of my friends are infected one a blink away from death to finally opt to walk outta there.What was exactly the reasoning behind Paul's attempt to fish out the body of the Hermit only to fall in the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus?  Pure STUPIDITY!I swear common sense was not a friend much less an aquaintance to these idiots.  I don't think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie.  In the beginning the kids ask the hick store cashier what the rifle was for and he replied that 'its for the niggers'.  In the end of the film 3 young Blacks dressed in baggy clothes one of them in a durag no less go into the store....come to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting.  THEN he proceeds to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if they're his homeboys.Okay WHAT THE HELL WAS THE POINT OF THAT?!?!?!?  How tasteless can one be what were the filmmakers THINKING putting that in the movie?  I as a Black man was of course offended by the initial 'Nigger' comment.  It was a tasteless pointless remark.  My question to the filmmakers what was the point of the ending with the Black kids?  Was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier?  To smooth things over with Black viewers by making a joke out of it?  Well I for one did NOT find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit.  The whole movie was a joke....a PATHETIC attempt at filmmaking that shouldn't be given the time of day.  Peter Jackson really thought this film was that good?  What film was HE looking at?  ZERO  out of  stars....if I could give it a lower rating I would. Please fellow IMDb'ers don't waste 1 12 hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a 'movie'.

I think I can do a collective huh? for everyone who watched it.I decided to move on with my life but at a party with my closest friends we saw it was coming on and some of us having seen it already decided we could laugh our way through it both of us proclaiming this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. It wasn't scary Ill give it to Roth who I think is a young hack characters do change throughout the film ala Cube.HOWEVER despite your typical rats in a cage scenario who will turn on who etc. it was pretty average horror.A few points 1. What was with that kid? I'm not even talking about him being weird and biting people. I'm talking about the whole slow motion karate kicking what was that? 2. Okay I know Rider's character liked Jordan Ladd's but as a young woman I was appalled that he just went ahead and molested her in her sleep. Uh thats illegal.3. Roth was in the movie just so Roth could be in the movie. Talk about pointlessly writing yourself in! 4. What was with the deputy? 5. So she was just instantly pulled apart by the dog? And there was little to no blood left? Just a scrap of her jeans? Anyway we were LAUGHING our asses off and I love laughing during horror movies Return of the Living Dead 2 Evil Dead but I don't know if we were supposed to be laughing here...".

	onyx:emotionText "Okay I had heard little about this film so when it came on the movie channels on TV I wanted to watch it being a horror aficionado. I think I can do a collective huh? for everyone who watched it.I decided to move on with my life but at a party with my closest friends we saw it was coming on and some of us having seen it already decided we could laugh our way through it both of us proclaiming this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. It wasn't scary Ill give it to Roth who I think is a young hack characters do change throughout the film ala Cube.HOWEVER despite your typical rats in a cage scenario who will turn on who etc. it was pretty average horror.A few points 1. What was with that kid? I'm not even talking about him being weird and biting people. I'm talking about the whole slow motion karate kicking what was that? 2. Okay I know Rider's character liked Jordan Ladd's but as a young woman I was appalled that he just went ahead and molested her in her sleep. Uh thats illegal.3. Roth was in the movie just so Roth could be in the movie. Talk about pointlessly writing yourself in! 4. What was with the deputy? 5. So she was just instantly pulled apart by the dog? And there was little to no blood left? Just a scrap of her jeans? Anyway we were LAUGHING our asses off and I love laughing during horror movies Return of the Living Dead 2 Evil Dead but I don't know if we were supposed to be laughing here...";

It fails at being either scary or coherent and only really qualifies as a film because it's bordered by titles.The DVD makes the experience even more maddening because you actually can see the selfsatisfied and talentdeprived director at work.Note to director If you're making a film about monsters make a film about monsters. But if you populate your film with humans it might help if you did a little research into how human beings behave they have these things called feelings and unless your entire cast are sociopaths audiences like to relate to one of them.

	schema:reviewBody "Something i've noticed over the past decade or more and these days most of allis the horror film maker's attempt to include too many elements of the action and comedy genres in an attempt to appeal to a bigger audience.  If I want a comedy I'll go see a comedy.  I don't mind a little comic relief and I love dark humor when it is done in a subtle and meaningful manner.  I like a horror film that just beats the living hell outta me.  I want to come out of the theater truly shaken and effected.  Cabin Fever is played too much for laughs and the jokes just aren't that funny.  Just kinda stupid and pointless.  I found myself too often annoyed at characters like Party Cop Grim and The Karate Kid who just had nothing to do with anything.  I've not seen as pointless a character as Grim since a real turd of a movie called Scared Stiff.  He's there to supply a crazy dog and a dead body to stumble over at the end of the movie.  I keep hearing that horror audiences want the humor these days and it is fairly apparent that this is true but if this is what they want then aren't they missing the point of a horror movie?  I dunno.  I give this thing good marks for it's excellent and effective gore makeup and the little bit of tension that it did have but too many things about it made no sense and didn't need to be there.  I've never walked out on a movie in my life.  No matter how bad it was.  But I came damn close with this one.  The last 10 or 15 minutes were pretty hard to sit through. Just got more and more ridiculous.  I find myself wondering about the rabbit suit guy in the hospital.  Was this a clumsy attempt at a metaphor for the guy in the beginning of the movie who was apparently hunting rabbits?  Was his dog supposed to have gotten the virus from eating an infected rabbit? Wasn't really made clear so the rabbit suit guy seemed rather pointless. Just got another huh? outta me.  Maybe the rabbit escaped from an animal research lab upriver from the cabin huh?  There.  I'll just fill in all the holes with my own story.  Then maybe this film won't hurt so much. Matter of fact watching this thing actually gave me a headache that lasted 6 hours. Only 2 aleve got rid of this movies residue.  So...to sum up...too many stupid jokes.  Not scary enough.  And just bad film making in general. There.  I feel better.And please this is not a forum for opinions of opinions. Reviews are nothing but someones opinion.  That's from you and me on up to Mr. Ebert. One man's trash is another man's treasure.  It's all subjective guys.  No need to take it personally if someone doesn't like the movie you liked.  I hated this movie but why would I sit here and put someone else down for liking it?  Let's try to grow up and be nice to fellow humans.".

The acting is surprisingly good for a bunch of nobodies the story is very well developed even a few really funny jokes always good in horror and the gore is INCREDIBLE! For those of you that miss the extreme gore of the 70s and early 80s you will not want to miss this film. If you like absurd black humor you might also enjoy it a lot. And if you want a change from the standard slasher in the woods as the villain definitely check this out. I'm predicting this will be the best horror movie of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cabin Fever offers some intense and scary moments but its really just the same except not very memorable. As a last hurrah after college friends Jeff Karen Paul Marcy and Bert embark on a vacation deep into the mountains. They drive to a remote cabin to enjoy their last days of decadence before entering the working world. Then their friend Karen gets sick and to avoid catching her virus they lock her in a shed. They look at one another and realize that any one of them could also have it. What soon began as a struggle against the disease turns into a battle against friends as the fear of contagion drives them to turn on each other. The kids confront the terror of having to kill anyone who comes near them even if it's their closest friend. The plot sure does sound scary and they did a decent job of executing it. I had heard that this film was really scary and I guess I did have high expectations. I should have lowered them as this was a slightly above average horror flick and nothing more. The story was decent with some clever twists and then it also had some old annoying clichs. The acting was alright with the best being Rider Strong. His performance was nothing special but he stood out from everyone else. The rest of the kids are played by Jordan Ladd James DeBello Joey Kern and Cerina Vincent. They all play their roles well but don't really have a big impact on the viewer which is okay since this is just a teenage horror flick. Eli Roth did an okay job of directing but he isn't that great at building suspense. I thought the film got really stupid at times like the kid who liked pancakes. I guess the director was making a reference to some film but it wasn't really needed. There were a lot of plot holes as well like who was the pancake kid? The film is pretty gory not over the top but enough to satisfy people. Cabin Fever pays homage to older horror classics which is nice but I didn't really think that helped the quality of the picture. In the end this is a decent horror flick that's worth checking out. Rating 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 2003 Cabin Fever was Eli Roth's film debut he would go on to make the 2005 horror hit Hostel. Cabin Fever has become somewhat of a modern cult film due to its eccentricities and Roth's later notoriety.THE PLOT Five college youths  3 guys and 2 girls  take a cabin vacation in the sticks of NC where they are threatened by a serious disease where those infected spit out blood while their skin wastes away. They soon discover that the local reservoir is contaminated. Can they make it out alive?This is a heavy 'R' picture Roth was tired of what he called the watered down PG13 horror films of the studios and refused to compromise on the violence nudity and cussing insisting they were essential ingredients to an '80sstyle horror film. Essential ingredients maybe but such things can't make up for overall ineffectiveness. I just don't get what's so great about Cabin Fever. The plot is good as are other items but the film leaves a lot to be desired unless of course you're not looking for much intelligence or authentic horror and just want a fun quasihorror experience. Or maybe you have to be a true horror aficionado to appreciate it whatever that is.WHAT WORKSI was interested in Cabin Fever mainly due to the beautiful Cerina Vincent. She was only 21 when the film was made and it shows. As good as she looks in Cabin Fever she's far more gorgeous in later films like 2006's Sasquatch Mountain and 2005's It Waits where she's more curvy with a fuller mane.  The picture's eccentricities are enjoyable such as the weirdo partydude deputy the inbred karate boy who looks like a girl and especially the part where we're led to believe an old shopkeeper is prejudiced against blacks until we discover the truth at the end that was a good one!  I like the early Fall backwoods North Carolina cinematography.WHAT DOESN'T WORKThe biggest problem with Cabin Fever is that it doesn't take itself seriously enough. Isn't this supposed to be a horror film? Well how can the viewer be horrified when the filmmakers keep telegraphing that it's all a joke? If we can't take the story seriously we can't take the horror seriously either. Suffice to say the story could have been horrifying but it's not. What we're left with is a somewhat amusing flick with horror trappings and gruesome elements but no real horror. By contrast the remake of Dawn of the Dead was successfully horrifying because the film and filmmakers took the subject seriously.  Some say the five protagonists are unlikable but this isn't really true. They act like typical college youths trying to have a good time on vacation. What is a turnoff however is their overthetop cussing. Don't get me wrong here because I actually prefer realistic cussing in film in other words I prefer that the characters talk like people in real life. As such it's very rare that I complain about cussing in a movie almost never. But here it's just total overkill. Now someone may defend it on the grounds that people would likely cuss a lot in such a horrific situation and I would agree but the characters overdo it well BEFORE anything horrific happens. Maybe the cussing overkill is part of Roth's joke Let's go ultra Rrated and overdo everything that's watereddown in a PG13 film. Regardless this approach makes his protagonists sound like morons who have no right to step foot into an elementary school English class let alone be college graduates.BOTTOM LINE While Cabin Fever has some positive elements  Cerina Vincent the NC backwoods cinematography a couple of amusing parts and the endcredits song  it's not horrifying at all because it's pretty much a big joke. But it is sometimes gruesome if that's your thang. Furthermore the overkill cussing of the protagonists gets old real quick. It's a trashy ignoble movie and I don't get the hype.The unrated version runs 98 minutes and the film was shot mainly in North Carolina with some parts in Dundas Ontario and the Los Angeles area.GRADE D".

Me and my friend found that talking about how fat and bitchy our one classmate was to be far more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie. We did manage to make it all the way to the end while screaming bullst because this film will make you do that.and i'm still confused by the random slow motion karate moves of the one random kid and how apparently everybody out in the country is completely retarded and hickish. And again why did this dog attack the girl? why did the kid the hicks were trying to kill sit in a chair waiting for them to kill him? that was part of the two of their's plan? wow. best plan ever. i cannot believe this movie got a theatrical release. i could barely stomach the DVD let alone have to sit in a theater not moving for an hour and a half. It wasn't scary or funny or cool or anything. it's just a waste of 90 minutes that you could be using to...i don't know plant a tree or something. it's more productive than this piece of garbage. The acting special effects and script are a joke. don't ever pick this up.Cabin fever gets one nasty leg shaving scene out of 10".

Unfortunately the good Doctor has a tendency to repeat every worthwhile point he makes at least five times and is totally blind to the wonderful qualities of those films with the end result that he robs the viewing experience of all joy discovery wonderment and spontaneity. He also fails to point out the qualities and positive aspects of each production and is totally unreliable when it comes to identifying wonderful performers and performances who will otherwise remain eternally nameless undocumented and unpraised. The harm done is less pronounced on the Cabin in the Sky DVD where his debunking and killjoy duties are somewhat mitigated by the presence of his colleague Prof. Drew Casper who is at least knowledgeable about the films of Minnelli and relatives of Eddie Rochester Anderson who do a good job describing the human side of the real star of the film.

He picked the RIGHT Black Actors to portray the various characters that had the ability to get the points across effectively.Considering this MovieMusical was being shown to an audience in 1943 America WHICH WAS STILL VERY RACIST Director Minelli seemed to make the connection without any problem at all.Of course the cast was an All Star All Black cast which was good for the ActorsActresses because it gave them much needed work. I could relate to the part of Petunia played by Ethel Waters. She reminded me of a really nice Woman who currently attends my Church.Eddie Rochester Anderson Rex Ingram Lena Horne Louis Armstrong  a host of others came together to make this Movie one of the Great Ones in my opinion.

Besides Waters Lucifer's team steals the show and of course today one wishes that Louis Armstrong could have been given a chance to demonstrate his unique vocal style. But this is nitpicking.

	schema:reviewBody "Cabin in the Sky marks the debut of director Vincente Minnelli one of cinema's greatest and most prolific directors of musicals. Already an experienced stage director pianist and perhaps most importantly of all a painter Minnelli came to Hollywood as the protg of lyricistturned producer Arthur Freed  one of the most significant names in the development of the screen musical.Although this is one of his cheaper productions as evidenced by the simplicity of the sets and the use of borrowed footage Cabin in the Sky is no exception to the typical Freed pattern of assembling a wide variety of musical talent. Here we get to enjoy virtually all the biggest names in black entertainment of the day  the gorgeous singing voice of Ethel Waters the musicianship of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong the dancing of Bill Bailey and John William Sublett to name just a few. With this lineup Cabin in the Sky was bound to be a great show but it was also likely to fall into the same trap as many of the Freed musicals  that you might have a great variety show but not a unified coherent musical.This is somewhat the case here especially as the story is rather flimsy and clichd. What saves it is Freed's firm belief in the integrated musical every song woven into the plot and Minnelli's inventive direction. Freed more or less gave Minnelli free rein over the staging of the musical numbers. Whereas in many of the earlier musicals there is a very conscious break in style whenever a song begins in Cabin in the Sky each number flows seamlessly into the action. For example in Happiness Is a Thing Called Joe Ethel Waters' singing begins with no prior cues to the audience that a song is about to start. The narrative then leaps ahead to her hanging out the washing while the song continues. The number finishes with Rex Ingram and his Buddy appearing from behind a sheet leading us into the next scene. The narrative has not taken a break for the song  it has continued alongside it.Also in evidence is Minnelli's graceful visual style. Minnelli with his painter's eye delicately frames his subjects with doorways and overhanging branches. You can also see his developing talent for movement flowing in and out of the frame particularly in the Li'l Black Sheep number in the church. Perhaps the most typical Minnelli moment is in the large group shot that he puts together for the title song the camera pulling out to reveal the whole crowd as the singing reaches a crescendo. For all its beauty though it does seem to be a rather strained effort and in his later pictures he would stage sequences that were far more complex and yet looked far more effortless.A quick word about the actors. While most of the cast were hired more for their ability to sing or dance than anything else those of them taken on purely as actors are nevertheless a joy to watch. Rex Ingram gets to do what he does best in an extravagant performance as Lucifer Jr. and is almost as scenestealing as he was as the genie in Thief of Bagdad. And Butterfly McQueen's role may be small but at least she really gets to act here rather than appearing as a comic relief funny voice.The songs too are wonderful. The ArlenHarburg numbers which were written especially for the film version are not as good as anything they did for Wizard of Oz but then what is? The real highlights though are the original Vernon DukeJohn La Touche songs especially the sublime Taking a Chance on Love and it's a shame these two barely made a splash in musicals.In spite of all this Cabin in the Sky is still best enjoyed as a series of performances. It is wonderful to watch not least because it is a showcase for the talents of a whole group of entertainers who made far too few screen appearances but it doesn't stand up as a musical in its own right.".

She sings and you understand every word and in this movie you even can see her do a little shimmy for which she was renowned for early in her career. A great cast. Lena is superb as always and Bubbles from the vaudevillian team buck and bubbles along with earl snake hip tucker. These are Harlem legends that ruled 133rd street the real swing street in their day. My mother never tires of this movie as she was a devout Ethel fan all her life she was born in 1923 so she grew up listening to this legend. Get this bit of American history".

Are they kidding? Even by the standards of today the movie is extremely sympathetic and affectionate toward its subjects. Compare this with the Chris Rock movie Head of State and then try to judge how much genuine progress has been made since 1943. Many films from the first half of the 20th century were vastly more racist in tone and attitude than this one. Birth of a Nation this ain't. So the people in the movie gamble and fight and screw around? Who doesn't? I watched Dead End last week and the thuggish white kids in that were portrayed in a much less appealing manner than the cast here.Some gripe that the script is a little rudimentary and the acting uneven and unnuanced. It's a little heavy on sentimentality and slow in spots. But it's a musical. You could say the same of any of the Andy Hardy movies or even many Astaire and Rogers pictures.On the plus side the cast is utterly stupendous. It's only a shame that Minelli couldn't shoehorn in a few more spotlight moments for all the talent that was on hand. Unlike one of the other commenters I very much enjoyed the performances of Waters and Anderson neither of whom I was especially familiar with previously. Bubbles of Buck and Bubbles was riveting for his few minutes on screen. Horne is cute as hell. Would have loved to see more of Ellington and Armstrong.I did get the impression that Waters was holding back at times for the sake of a screen performance. She begins to let loose vocally during the dance scene in the kitchen and Anderson humorously reins her in seemingly making a joke of the fact that they've been told to make their performances a bit more staid for the benefit of conservative audiences in the hinterlands.Worth seeing as just plain old entertainment never mind the historical interest. If you can't see its good points it may have more to do with being unfamiliar with the idioms and conventions of the era than with any major intrinsic deficits in what's on offer.".

Sadly when you watch and see Kenneth Spencer in the film you think of what a loss it was that Hollywood never gave him much of a chance and that he died so younghe had an absolutely beautiful voice.The film's plot is highly unusual. It's a religious allegory about the soul of one particular shiftless fool Eddie Rochester Anderson. Anderson is given one last chance by God and the angels try to steer him towards good while the devils try to lead him down the path of destruction. And even more unusual is that the film is a singing and dancing musical. Some of the more hilarious performances are by Lucifer Jr.'s imps. Sure they are walking stereotypes but seeing Louis Armstrong Mantan Moreland and Willie Best acting is very entertainingthe dialog is very funny and original.Overall the film is very entertaining and a wonderful showcase for some of the best Black entertainers of the day.

Sure they are walking stereotypes but seeing Louis Armstrong Mantan Moreland and Willie Best acting is very entertainingthe dialog is very funny and original.Overall the film is very entertaining and a wonderful showcase for some of the best Black entertainers of the day. Well made and certainly not a movie you'll soon forget.";

	schema:reviewBody "Just a delightful and still fresh film after sixty plus years with an all black cast that does a great job with the material. I remember the principal players from TV variety shows of the later 1950's and who can forget Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson from the Jack Benny Program? I'd only seen Anderson in minor movie roles before 1938's You Can't Take It With You and 1939's You Can't Get Away With Murder so to see him in the lead here with Ethel Waters was a nice treat. It was also cool to see him display an all around talent with his singing and dancing something you rarely got during his association with Benny. Still the scene where he and Waters sang the title song left me wondering whether he might have been dubbed as it didn't feature his unique gravelly voice although his rendition of 'Consequences' later in the story and the duet with Lena Horne surely did.And Lena Horne  modern day viewers might compare her to Halle Berry in the looks department but if truth be told Ms. Horne had it all over Berry in terms of talent. I did more than one double take as well when her character Georgia Brown appeared almost topless from the back and with midriff exposed upon securing that sexy halter top. Then when she got a leg up on Little Joe Anderson I had to wonder how he contained himself.As a musical the picture really got into high gear during the second half with virtually number after number showcasing a variety of talent not the least of which was the legendary Ethel Waters. As the 'terrific prayin' wife of Little Joe Ms. Waters was a standout in every one of her scenes. Throw Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong into the mix and you have a veritable lock on virtually all the black talent in Hollywood at the time.As for the comedic interludes it was great to see some of my all time favorite black actors of the era as part of the Lucifer Jr. bunch  Mantan Morelan and Wille Best a duo that appeared somewhat regularly in the Monogram run of Charlie Chan films during the late Forties. As Lucifer Jr. Rex Ingram had one of the picture's most telling lines when he remarked that he was stuck with a bunch of 'B' idea men because all of his 'A' men were over in Europe. Released in 1943 during the height of World War II that reference presumably related to Satan's cultivation of future citizens of Hell namely Hitler and Mussollini. Considering that type of company there was just no way that Little Joe Jackson would ever fall victim to any trap set for him by the devil's minions.".

It centers on the lives of little Joe Jackson Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson and his wife Petunia Ethel Waters. They are poor and live somewhere in America.  A reflection of the times their world and heaven is all black.Little Joe doesn't deserve to have a loving devoted wife like Petunia. She's God fearing and wants him to repent and stop his gambling habits besides that its no secret he's had an affair with town beauty Georgia Brown Lena Horne.One day Petunia convinces Little Joe to go to Church.  While in Church his gambling buddies Lucius Rex Ingram and Jim Henry Ernest Whitman get him  to sneak out and play a game of dice with Domino Johnson John William Sublett. Little Joe is  seriously wounded when Domino attacks him for cheating.  Little Joe is taken home in a coma and even the doctor is unsure if he'll pull through. Petunia prays for Little Joe's salvation. It's during this time that the Lord's Army led by The General Kenneth Spencer and Devil's from Hell led by the Devil's son Lucius Jr. fight for Little Joe's soul.  Because of Petunia's 'powerful prayers'  he's given another chance by God six more months to live. There's a catch during that time he must be good in order to get into heaven otherwise he's anxiously awaited in Hell. When Little Joe awakes he has no memory of what happened.  His wife Petunia takes care of him faithfully. Their love is highlighted by musical numbers like 'Cabin in the Sky' and 'Happiness is a Thing called Joe.'Once Joe's able to go back to work Georgia Brown starts having designs on him again.  The Devils plot to let Little Joe win the lottery is hatched. At first it looks like its going fail.  Little Joe can't read the telegram informing him about his windfall and throws it away. But Lucifer Jr. blows it in the path of sexy Georgia Brown who promptly delivers it to Little Joe at his home.  Petunia's not home and Little Joe is relaxing in a hammock.  Georgia Brown tries hard to tempt Little Joe to make love and a kiss is interupted when Joe's conscious catches up with him thanks to the prodding of The General who's watching over him for his six month reprieve.  It's then that Georgia Brown reads the telegram and tells him that he's won the lottery.  Little Joe is happy and tells Georgia Brown that he's going to buy her things like a fur coat as thanks. That's when Petunia comes back and overhears. Petunia is so enraged at Georgia Brown's presence that she kicks them both out.  She is tearful and heartbroken that the man she loves has been unfaithful to her. Cut to six month's from the day of Little Joe's injury.  The great band Leader Duke Ellington and his band are playing at Jim Henry's Club thanks to Litte Joe's bankroll.  Little Joe shows up in his chauffeur driven car with Georgia Brown.  He's in a tuxedo complete with top hat tails and a fancy cane.  Georgia Brown is in a fancy dress that one patron says 'will still be in style one hundred years from now'. Showing her morals she exposed her fancy and expensive underwear for all to see. Domino Johnson shows up at the Club to celebrate his release from jailfor injuring  Little Joe.  In a complete change of character  Petunia shows up at the Club all dolled up in fancy clothes. Petunia makes it clear to Little Joe that he's  going to pay for them.  Little Joe is so fascinated at  Petunia's beauty saying ' he didn't know'. Petunia also tells him that he's going to hear from her lawyer to get her share of the money. Petunia even drinks liquor ordering a 'double King Kong'.There's a showdown between Georgia Brown and Petunia for Little Joe's affection.  Georgia Brown tells Little Joe to watch what he says to his wife. Petunia fires back saying that She is still his wife and has the inside track! The showdown gets even more interesting when Petunia thanks Domino for almost killing her husband and then dances him.  She dances and kicks her leg up high showing that big women can be sexy too. Petunia's conscious and God fearing nature catches up to her when Domino starts making advances on her caressing and hugging her. Jealousy and the urge to protect Petunia overtake Little Joe and he fights once again with Domino.Petunia calls for the Lord's intervention who sends a tornado emptying and destroying the Club but in the process both Petunia and Little Joe are fatally wounded.  At the gates of Heaven  The General tells them that only Petunia can go to heaven but Petunia once again pleads for Joe to go as well.  She points out that it was her behavior that caused the disaster.  Petunia is forgiven by Little Joe is not.It looks like he won't be entering heaven until we hear that Georgia Brown has repented and gave everything she owned including most of Little Joe's money to the church. In the end they both are allowed into heaven.  Its during the climb of the stairway to heaven that Little Joe awakes out of his coma. Turns out the past six months have all be a horrible dream.Little Joe swears off gambling forever and asks for his dice and lottery ticket to be destroyed.  Viewers are left feeling that Petunia and Little Joe lived happily ever after.The film was directed by legendary Director Vincent Minnelli.  It's also a rare chance to see the talents of black entertainers of the time. One can only imagine the competition for roles in this film.  It's too bad that Hollywood didn't make more black movies in its early years. It was a time when the only roles for Blacks in Hollywood were idiots maids and butlers and hired hands.  Overall on talent Cabin in the Sky makes us long for more. On story the film is one with a message that transcends time and race.".

Ethel Waters is quite astonishing as Joe's good wife Petunia what a performer! And Lena Horne sizzles how often in the 40's did we get to see the back of a woman's bra? OK it's hardly a big deal now but I can't recall seeing anything like it in a 40's movie as bad girl Georgia who could lead Joe into sin. Curious to see the DVD comes with a disclaimer that apologies for the racist attitudes prevalent in the time and apparently evident in the film. Well I do not question the prevailing attitudes of the age but where are they present in this movie? I actually saw this film as a great celebration of AfricanAmerican talent not as a way of demeaning them or anything. Racist would be replacing the talented cast with white performers...and they didn't. I thought every cast member was portrayed with intelligence even if the plot was simplistic.".

Curious to see the DVD comes with a disclaimer that apologies for the racist attitudes prevalent in the time and apparently evident in the film. Well I do not question the prevailing attitudes of the age but where are they present in this movie? I actually saw this film as a great celebration of AfricanAmerican talent not as a way of demeaning them or anything. Racist would be replacing the talented cast with white performers...and they didn't. I thought every cast member was portrayed with intelligence even if the plot was simplistic.";

	schema:reviewBody "Let's call it a deserved 10 but with a sense of trouble for one's conscience.In 1943 it was nearly impossible to consider any film with a predominantly AfricanAmerican cast as serious by most Americans of Caucasian or nonAfricanAmerican backgrounds. Typical fare from Hollywood was a series of stereotypes usually for comic purposes. However there had been a few films that even with the stereotypes suggested more was there. King Vidor's HALLELUJAH in 1929 dealt with AfricanAmerican revivalism. Two Broadway hits O'Neill's THE EMPEROR JONES with star Paul Robeson recreating the role of Brutus Jones and THE GREEN PASTURES had been done with mostly AfricanAmerican casts Dudley Digges did play a critically important role in THE EMPEROR JONES but he was an exception. The 1929 and 1936 versions of SHOW BOAT did deal with the Jim Crow south and the issue of racially mixed marriages. The film of Fanny Hurst's novel IMITATION OF LIFE 1933 dealt with a young woman trying to pass for white and breaking her mother's heart as a result. GONE WITH THE WIND passed on the myths of how happy the slaves were in the South but Hattie McDaniel's performance of Mammy was vivid and strong and won the first Oscar for an AfricanAmerican performer. Finally in 1942 John Huston's film IN THIS OUR LIFE dared to suggest that a young AfricanAmerican man could try to study law to enter the legal profession.When Vincent Minelli was assigned to do the MGM musical version of CABIN IN THE SKY most insiders thought that it would be a flop. Minelli had never directed a film before and was an unknown quantity in Hollywood's talent market. Actually he was a good choice  he was a veteran of Broadway musical productions and was just the right person to work on a film based on a Broadway musical. It was his first film and proved to be a great success.It think it is due in part to his determination to show what he could bring out of the musical and also the equal determination of the cast led by Ethel Waters who played the lead Petunia on Broadway Eddie Anderson Joe Lena Horne as temptress Georgia Brown John Bubbles Domino Johnson Kenneth Spencer The General Rev. Greene and Rex Ingram Lucifer Jr.. Other familiar faces crop up like Willie Best Mantan Morland Oscar Polk Butterfly McQueen Louis Armstrong oddly wasted in a mostly comic speaking role and Duke Ellington and his orchestra. It's hard to imagine this but this film effort had the cream of Hollywood's available AfricanAmerican performers in it. And they wanted to show what they could do.The story is about the devotion of Petunia to her husband Little Joe who is weak and constantly gambling. But he hopes to win a fortune to give Petunia the things she always wanted. Unfortunately he is also infatuated with Georgia a sexy singer at the gambling housenight club he heads for. One night while supposedly seeking forgiveness for his sins at church Joe is lured to the nightclub into a dice game and is shot by Domino. He is treated at home and the film goes from this point to it's conclusion with a battle between God's messenger the General always wearing white uniforms and Lucifer Jr. and his minions. Due to a technicality Joe is not to die but is given six months more to show his wife's devotion is strong enough to put him permanently on the good and narrow path. Lucifer Jr. and his associates including Morland Armstrong and Best are determined to show Joe cannot change.The cast shows what they could do. Waters in particular has two songs that became standards Happiness is a Guy named Joe by Harold Arlin and Y.I.P. Harburg and Taking a Chance On Love by Vernon Duke from the original score. But Horne is allowed to sing as well though one number was cut here but transposed elsewhere. Bubbles does his great dance and song act in the latter part of the film in the number Shine. Even Anderson best recalled for being Jack Benny's foil as Rochester demonstrates singing in a duet with Horne and dance in a number with Waters.I suppose my favorite though is Ingram. He's now the forgotten man in AfricanAmerican film history because he never had the degree of public attention that Paul Robeson received. But he appeared in the lead as De Lawd in the movie version of THE GREEN PASTURES as Lucifer Jr. here as the genie in the Alexander Korda epic THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD 1941 and graced other films as well as the gentle valet to Ronald Colman in THE TALK OF THE TOWN where he starts crying at his boss's insistence at shaving off his distinguished goatee. Ingram I feel could play any kind of part. Given the paucity of good lead parts in his day that he got three of them shows Hollywood and British producers thought well of him. Here he does not sing I suspect he did not have the voice but he is enjoying his wickedness throughout. He also has one of the best lines in the film  complaining of the lack of good ideas in getting Joe's soul he says that it's because the best idea men in Hell are currently in Europe this being the fourth year of World War II. The film is actually quite entertaining to this day  although the stereotypes of crap shooting AfricanAmericans is unsettling. But think of this point this is the first film I know of from Hollywood where a black professional is shown who is not a minister! When Eddie Anderson is treated for his gunshot wound the physician is black and is not a stereotype.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cabin in the Sky 1943 out of 4 Landmark MGM Musical has sinner 'Little Joe' Jackson Eddie 'Rochester Anderson getting killed inside a gambling house but his wife Petunia Ethel Waters says a prayer which causes a fuss in Heaven. Lucifer Jr. Rex Ingram wants to take Jackson to Hell but the good guys are able to make a deal where he gets six more months on Earth to prove himself good. Jackson starts off well but soon Lucifer puts Georgia Brown Lena Horne on the case. This allblack cast Musical has one of the better reputations out there for a race picture and it's certainly one of the best. There's no question that MGM took a fairly simple story and filled it with some great performances nice songs wonderful direction and in the end we're left with a pretty important picture. Considering one scene in this movie cost more than ten other race movies of this era it's refreshing to see what a black cast could do when given the chance. Considering how well this film turned out it's a shame more movies like this didn't follow but what we have here is still quite special. For me the highlights of this film are the performances with the three leads fitting into their roles so well that you really forget that you're watching a movie. The spiritual and fiery nature of Waters makes for a brilliant performance as she really digs into this role and makes it her own. She's funny sweet and very touching in her scenes of prayer and one can't help but feel as if she really is the perfect wife the screenplay makes her out to be. Anderson and that wonderful voice is perfect for that notsobright character who tries well but often finds himself in even more trouble. Ingram is a lot of fun as Lucifer Jr. and Kenneth Spencer and his wonderful voice is a pleasure as well. We even get Louis Armstong Willie Best Mantan Moreland and Leon James Poke doing fine work. Just look at the type of performances Moreland and Best get to give here in comparison to the typical roles and performance they had to give in other Hollywood productions. With all of that said it's Horne who steals the show as the devilish Peach. I know a scene involving Horne in a bath later to appear in the short STUDIO VISIT was cut but I was still surprised to see how sexual the production code allowed here. From her taking her shirt off to her sexual walks to her shirt being tied up. The sexual fire Horne brings to the role makes her beauty really jump off the screen but we also get that great voice. The story itself isn't the strongest but I think it does the job as we care for Anderson enough to the point that we want to see him stay out of trouble and make it to Heaven. The songs are all pretty good the direction topnotch and in the end we're given a rare chance to see what black actors could do when given a shot. It's a shame we didn't get more productions like this one.".

Sure it's long and it's got one of those convuluted plotlines typical of the period and historically it's crap but the sets and costumes have to be seen to be believed! The scale of things is just fantastic with giant temples and houses all sorts of huge rooms and decoration all over anything and hundreds and hundreds of extras with fabulous costumes all done in pastiche of styles that range from Egyptian to Babylonian to this whole weird Indian look although it's all set in North Africa. Then there's the melodramatic acting which really can't be judged by today's standards as there are few subtitles of dialogue only very grand and wordy intertitles summarzing the plot and offering odes to gods and goddesses. This movie is a mustsee if you're studying the history of epic films early fulllength movie Griffith etc. and even if you're not it's a hoot at least until halfway through at which point you may decide you've had enough of the plot and can guess the rest.".

While it was widely known in its time and apparently was once given full credit for its influence on other filmmakers it has been largely forgotten today for no good reason. The story is involved and ambitious the settings and scale are lavish and creative and the historical scenario comes from the fascinating if today littleknown period of the Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage. It's all very good in its own right and it's even more of a success when you consider the new ground they had to break in bringing it all together so well.The story blends together several fictional and several historical characters centering on the adventures and misfortunes of the girl Cabiria. As in any melodrama there are some implausible developments yet it rarely seems overly forced. The historical setting is used creatively both to drive the action and to provide interesting settings and characters. While it is clearly fiction it takes fewer liberties with history than do many other movies with historical settings since it is designed for entertainment rather than to promote a particular viewpoint.And as entertainment it delivers handsomely. This is well worth the trouble to find for anyone who enjoys watching silent movies. It is also worth seeing if you have even a passing interest in the development of cinema because few movies have ever been so creative in using and improving upon the means available in their own era.".

She might as well be buried treasure. And yet she is the center of the movie and sometimes we are reminded of her because the camera seems to forget her. Take the garden scene when it is not at all clear what happens to her and then we don't know for a good long time she does not appear again literally for ten years and then when she does reappear it is with a different name and we are not told it is her.

This epic depicts the kidnapping of a Sicilian girl following an eruption of Mt. Etna her sale into slavery in Carthage and a Roman nobleman's quest to rescue her. It's like nothing that you've ever seen before.The movie has drawn controversy due to its depiction of the Romans as pure and the Carthaginians as monstrous thereby glorifying the idea of Italian supremacy.

Maciste got his own series of movies. The ones immediately after Cabiria starred Bartolomeo Pagano and then there was a new series in the 1960s.Anyway really cool!".

The Temple of Moloch is a good example being able to accommodate large crowds and plenty of action.  Watch Batto's house another towering set collapse on the hapless people inside.  See Mount Etna erupt very realistically ultimately bringing down Batto's home.  This plus the other special effects are brilliant. Even the props notably the pottery are designed and made very creatively. The acting however is a bit overdone but that was the norm in film and on stage in 19131914.  It doesn't detract from the film at all.  Sophonisba is about the worst offender but I still love her! The direction of the picture with crowds and all types of terrain and sets is extremely good.

	onyx:emotionText "This film must have taken a big pile of lire to produce.  Check out those huge sets with people walking on them and within them. The Temple of Moloch is a good example being able to accommodate large crowds and plenty of action.  Watch Batto's house another towering set collapse on the hapless people inside.  See Mount Etna erupt very realistically ultimately bringing down Batto's home.  This plus the other special effects are brilliant. Even the props notably the pottery are designed and made very creatively. The acting however is a bit overdone but that was the norm in film and on stage in 19131914.  It doesn't detract from the film at all.  Sophonisba is about the worst offender but I still love her! The direction of the picture with crowds and all types of terrain and sets is extremely good.  The story is very well paced.  I highly recommend this remarkable achievement.  It is a guarantee that you will enjoy it.";

Filmmakers such as Fritz Lang D.W. Griffith who were also all pioneers by themselves. They were obviously inspired by some of the sequences its scale sets and compositions since this movie in some of its sequences show some definite similarities to some sequences in movies such as Metropolis and Intolerance Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages. Only in that regard you can already call this movie an innovative and important movie. Its sets compositions and just overall way of storytelling were all quite new and innovating for its time. It's also the first ever movie to use a dollytrack system which provides the movie with a couple of nice moments as well.The movie its story is very epic since it's set at many different locations with also many different characters. It features historical well known figures such as Hannibal Hasdrubal Scipio Archimede Massinissa which makes the movie real interesting but is also one of its weaker points since it makes the movie and its storytelling a bit disjointed at parts.It perhaps also makes the movie feel overlong in parts even though the movie is only about 2 hours long well depending on which version you'll watch which is actually quite short for an epic movie especially for one that got made early in the 20th century. 4 hour epics from the same time period are no rarity. The movie just goes on for a bit too long with some of its sequences. After a while you get the point but the scene will just go on and on. It doesn't always makes this an easy but pleasant movie to watch.But overall the movie of course is pleasant as well as impressive not only because of its visuals but also because of its story that is actually quite adventurous as long as it knows to focus on the movie its key players. It's adventurous in the same way as a movie like BenHur for instance.Also especially when you realize that this is an 1914 movie it's a real excellent innovative and interesting fun movie to watch.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The film begins with her miraculous survival from a very realistic eruption of a volcano and takes her on a boat ride to CarthageRome's archrival during the years of the Republic. Here she is sold into slavery and is slated to be sacrificed to the evil god Moloch. The scene of Moloch's temple and the babyeating idol is truly amazing and horrifying. It must have cost a small fortune to construct. Cabiria is rescued by a Roman spy. However while she is not killed she remained a slave for a decade. Eventually when Rome gained the upper hand in the Punic Wars with Carthage Cabiria was saved and everyone lived happily ever after.Now as to why the movie was made in Italy at that particular time this film came just after Italy successfully attacked North Africa and seized colonies. This film then is a sort of justification for this actionas it paints the Carthaginians as babysacrificing and evil. Only after the good Romans conquer them is peace and justice restored! This means that this film was one of the earlier propaganda pieces ever put on film and it came out just before the First World War.When you watch CABIRIA you need to understand the context of when it was made to truly appreciate the film. While the acting might seem overthetop at times for 1914 it was a truly amazing film. Never before had a film been so dramatic or had sets to equal this. In fact the spectacular nature of this Italian film had a strong impact on the films of D. W. Griffith as it wasn't until 1915 that his huge epic BIRTH OF A NATION and 1916 when INTOLERANCE were releasedand they were obviously strongly inspired by CABIRIA. While INTOLERANCE is quite similar to CABIRIA in spots INTOLERANCE has even grander sets and special effects though the story itself was neither as involving nor as interestingbeing muddled quite a bit by having four stories overlapping and the overthetop moralizing Griffith was known for in many of his films. Instead CABIRIA is much more straightforward and interesting storytelling and compares very well to later epicseven some of the sound epics. Sure by later standards it might seem hokey in spots but for 1914 it was a huge leap forward in entertainment and is a mustsee for all serious film historians.By the way this review is based on the recent Kino Video restoration. Shorter versions do exist and the Kino version is apparently the closest to the original you can find.".

	schema:reviewBody "This one caught me off guard.  I stayed up past midnight to watch Cabiria on TCM mainly because of my interest in film history figuring I'd watch it out of academic interest but never expected to be so completely engrossed by a film 90 years old.    Yes the plot is jerky the coincidences a big stretch for a modern audience and for Americans hard to follow if you don't know the history of the Punic Wars but set those issues aside and just simply enjoy the feast.  I was truly caught up in the story.  Not to offer a spoiler here but the Temple of Moloch sequence blew me away.  Its actually rather frightful and creepy.  I wonder how many of the little kid actors who were being offered up as sacrifices and hard to believe that if alive today they'd all be near a hundred years old wound up in therapy afterwards!   There's even shades of Indiana Jones here with the rescue and I found myself cheering the heroes on.  The siege the special effects even the closing scene are a treat and stand up amazingly well to modern eyes.  An interesting social history point.  The actress who played the evil princess undoubtedly was the definition of feminine beauty in 1914. . .things have indeed changed for the better in my opinion!One serious question and if there is a reader who is a historian with an answer let me know.   There's a powerful scene in the Temple of Moloch where large golden hands appear above the priests looking very much like the Hitlerian salute.   Very similiar to the hand atop the helmet of one of the Tuetonic Nights in Alexander Nevsky.   Is there just possibily a connection to the adoption of the salute twenty years later?  I never knew about the actor Maciste.  I realized that here is the prototype for all the Italian Hercules of the 1950s that I use to love at the Saturday matinees of my childhood.  The actor is truly dynamic an Arnold Schwarznegger presence of the silent screen and in my opinion stole the entire movie.  From the film history side you can see so many influences on all that would come afterwards.   While watching its hard to believe that you are looking at images filmed before World War I and all involved are long since gone. You see as well the promise of a new born art form that has become such a central part of our lives.".

It had a direct influence on D.W. Griffith's production of Intolerance. According to Griffith biographer Richard SchickelGriffith insisted on including large elephant statues in the courtyard setting even though his researchers could find no evidence that pachyderms were ever a significant part of Babylonian iconography because Pastrone used them in Cabiria.The film begins with grandeur the explosion of Etna is the most impressive sequence in the film.

The performances are overacted and histrioniceven Pagano who would become something of a star from his performance here. I can see why he's muscular and it's somewhat interesting to watch him do various acrobatics. Italia AlmiranteManzini who plays Sophonisba is the hammiest of all. Besides the sets and special effects by Eugenio Bava and Sergundo de Chomn there is some nice nighttime tinting and Pastrone's dolly shots help pass some of the time. Nevertheless the film lacks much cinematic innovation and remains largely theatrical there is only one closeup a pointofview shot of a ring.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are a great many silent films that deserve to be seen today not only for their historical importance or curiosity but for their qualities as a well made film. Released in Italy in 1914 this first great epic film surely inspired D.W. Griffith to expand his vision scope and sets for 'Intolerance' 1916 and influenced other film makers including Ernst Lubitch for his 'Das Weib des Pharao' 'The Wife of Pharoah' 1922 as well as prepared audiences for other American films like 'Ben Hur' 1922 and 'The 10 Commandments' 1923. It's a spectacular epic feast of costumes sets and film making techniques.But as a well made film it also has action and a good story though for those who've forgotten their World History and the Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage I only encountered them in my high school third year Latin class it may be boring because it is awfully long. This may be why 43 of IMDb votes were a 1 but you really have to give this film its due. The story moves along the sacrifice of children to Moloch is just one of many amazing sets scenes and 'action packed thrills.' Allowing for the fact that sound was not yet a part of film making the director had the actors convey a lot of 'dialog' through mimed gestures with some acting drawing too much from the staginess of Italian opera. But we get Bartolemo Pagani in his initial portrayal of Maciste a role he played in 25 films! Looks like he was wearing blackface to look African and it turns out he was. He steals most of his scenes.This is clearly a landmark film of the teen years and must be seen. I give it an 8.".

	schema:reviewBody "Giovanni Pastrone's grandscale storytelling of a lost princess her journey from being kidnapped to almost being offered as a child sacrifice and then ending up as a slave 'Cabiria' is cinema's first true epic. Pastrone made several films and the scope and spectacle of his films inspired directors like Griffith and Fellini but 'Cabiria' is the only one which has stood the test of time. And since the story is set almost 2000 years ago the aged quality of this 100yearold film only adds to the feel of the time.Like Griffith's 'Birth of a Nation' 'Cabiria' too was shrouded in controversy for its biased depiction of races places and cultures. Like 'Birth of a Nation' propagated Ku Klux Klan's nobility and agenda 'Cabiria' tried to legitimize Italy's distant past and tried to promote and inspire themes like 'wars of conquest' Roman salute racial nobility and virtue etc. I mean all the nonRoman characters in the film are depicted in negative light.Whatever the controversial history the movie might have if one is ready to ignore those aspects and try to acknowledge the feat it tries to achieve in the medium of filmmaking it's an enjoyable journey. The movie offers many fascinating sequences like the child offerings at Temple of Moloch Princess Sophonisba's pet leopard and even her spectacular arrival for her almost wedding soldiers and elephants crossing the Alps the pyramid formed by soldiers and shields in one continuous shot and few others.The original version is said to have been three hours long. I saw the truncated 1993 restoration which is two hours long. In this itself the number of characters and events seem too many a few of them almost unnecessary I wonder what the extra 60 minutes had in store. Better editing I mean even shorter than two hours could have made the story tighter more interesting and compelling.Overall it's an interesting story and a wellmade film and personally I liked it much more than the overrated 'BenHur'.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a confusing yet highly important one to watch. I have to say that I haven't watched a silent film in a long time so adjusting to the many many differences was a struggle. I found the captions to be really lacking in clarity. I appreciate the beauty of their writing but I'm not really trying to decode poetry when watching a silent epic you know? It's not even that really it was the constant introduction of new names without describing who they were or what the hell their problem was. I was under the impression that the captions would describe what was about to happen but really they just introduced it which meant that I understood a bit of what was happening before their mouths kept moving and their arms started flailing and fights started happening and I was lost again. I definitely wish I had a historian in my room just quietly explaining where these ancient cities were and why everyone was so upset all the time. I could Google it while watching but I have a strict rule against touching my phone while a movie is on. Try to read up on the context surrounding the story before watching if you can.Anyway the sets were grand even by today's standards and that impressed me a lot. Even the special effects they utilized were outstanding because at that time in cinema they weren't special effects as much as they were visual tricks that the filmmakers had to figure out and pioneer on their own essentially. I really liked the Maciste character and I wasn't surprised to find that he was extremely popular when this movie came out too. The naked children everywhere and live birds flying around a set that is actively crumbling and in flames was bananas! It made me wonder how many peopleanimals died on sets back before there were regulations. The story had many complexities to it and that was cool. It definitely deserves it's title as an epic. It is not an easy watch but it is a worthwhile one. No doubt it was piloted by a strong plot. I agree with the many others who have said that this is a mustsee for people who truly love film. I definitely recommend it and am happy to have it in my movie collection.".

Griffith and Cecil B DeMille. At the dawn of the medium people were interested in showing antiquity but the thought was not born in Hollywood but where it actually has its historical roots the Mediterranean. Yes this time all roads lead to Italy. Apart from the greatest masterpieces of art throughout the centuries it is also Italy that gave birth to the most stupendous elaborate stunning visuals that have awed the imagination of viewers for the last century.CABIRIA by Giovanni Pastrone with the restored music piano score by Jacques Gauthiers was made at a very significant point of history Italy had been victorious after the Lybian War and similarly to the role greatest epics of Hollywood served the film with the setting of its story appeared to be a manifestation of power centered again after all these in Rome not the Imperial Rome but the Rome the Republic at a very interesting period the Punic Wars in the 3rd century before Christ. The story of Cabiria is nicely incorporated into the motives of a marvelous visual display of powerful nature and army. Its mixture of attraction and repulsion mighty volcanoes and delicate doves well built giants and delicious women cruel army leaders and clever inventors lead to all hallmarks of an epicdrama. It's all in CABIRIA starting with hatred destined to be conquered and concluding with love always destined to be the conqueror. AMOR VINCIT OMNIA But let me highlight a few points about the visuals now.It is important to keep in mind that CABIRIA is heavily influenced by operatic feeling. All this grandeur is the pure essence of what we find in opera. Its strength lies in visuals. Naturally however we treat them absolutely differently from today's standpoint. It seems that only a very indepth eye may capture certain details. The film is divided into 5 episodes which a little bit distract the holistic viewing of the story. Nevertheless each one has something to offer if not the costumes then the great sets marvelous for the time and still awe inspiring after a century. The eruption of Etna Hannibal crossing the Italian Alps the huge temple of Moloch sequence the war with Carthage the assault on Syracuse in Sicily consider the mention of the 'sea of Aretusa' the interiors of palaces and outstanding costumes. It is significant that the story begins in Sicily the source of food in ancient Rome and at the same time the island that has for ages frightened people with Europe's biggest volcano. While the beginning of the movie is a pure spectacle of nature it slowly turns to the spectacle of army in order to reach a rather poetic conclusion. American showmen used to say and still many keep saying It's all BIG! We might say the roar of crater turns into roar of war and jealousy. And the characters? The title Cabiria Lidia Quaranta is rather shadowed by other characters who either help her keeping in mind the motto Help you give Help you will receive or do not seem to have much in common with her but serve as emotional resonance of historical period. Although they are not much developed and seen as if through the curtain of spectacle we get quite a variety Croessa Gina Maragnoni Cabiria's nurse Fulvius the Roman Umberto Mozzato who may draw parallels to plenty of noble Roman characters in various epics Maciste Bartolomeo Pagano who bears resemblance with Hellenic Hercules Sienkiewicz Ursus and biblical Samson queen Sophonisba Italia AlmiranteManzini who reveals certain features of ancient femme fatale Poppaealike character with a pet leopard not only Patricia Laffan echoes the image in 1951 QUO VADIS but also Claudette Colbert in 1932 THE SIGN OF THE CROSS but appears to redeem herself ostentatiously operatically and dramatically at the end the elderly Carthaginian architect Archimede Enrico Gernelli who creates a terrific machine of war the funny Bodastoret the innkeeper the villainous Massinissa Vitale Di Stefano the Numidian impostor of the throne Syphax Alessandro Bernard the old powerful man who marries a beauty as his loveless political toy the High Priest Karthalo Dante Testa a devilincarnate who demands human sacrifices to a god consider the clever representation of a beliefreligion that may be of some help but may also resort to most disgusting systematic cruelty. All of the characters contribute to the various strong points of CABIRIA.Almost half a century later Federico Fellini made a parallel to the character' name Cabiria in his 1957 Oscar winning achievement. Strangely I had a feeling that if the people of yore the people of ancient times would have any link with modern times CABIRIA would be one of those films which would occur to capture the gist within the recreation of antiquity. Perhaps it is because of the test of time it has undeniably stood. No matter what emotions feelings imagination it evokes this silent gem should be more known today. It might serve modern epic as an old tutor full of novelty what to change what to get rid of in order to come back to the roots again. Surely worth seeking out! HAPPY CENTENARY CABIRIA!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's amazing how fast cinema progressedonly about twenty years ago films were new and consisted of no plot at allnot only this they were only about a minute long each! Now here in 1914 we're witnessing a 2hour spectacle by the Italian filmmaker Giovanni Pastrone that is so sophisticated that at times it gets rather confusing. There are a couple special effects here and there as well as great sets and cool costumes and put together we've got a pretty fascinating film that met with great success.Despite the title however Cabiria is certainly not the main focus here in fact we don't even see her for half the film. There are all these different story lines that merge into one as the film continues. While very watchable today some viewers will find it confusing and a bit dullbut that's only because most people can't sit through two hours of silent film. Probably the film's main issue in terms of storytelling is that it is a little hard to follow. We switch locations constantly and here and there they throw in pieces of history. Closeups are included but many of the shots are medium length. What really makes it groundbreaking is its use of panning shots. Panning such as this was rarely used even by 1914 and at times we seem to be approaching the characters which is something I believe I've never seen before in the silent era.Cabiria the young girl of the title and her nurse Croessa are quite happy when a volcanic eruption of Mt Etna occurs which forces the village to retreat. Pirates discover them they are sent to become sacrifices for Moloche. But by the help of two Roman spies Cabiria is savedand after this little is heard of her. As for the rest of the movie we've got all these other story lines and then they eventually build up to the finale.Like I said a tad confusing at times but amazing for 1914 and you can see what they mean when they say Griffith turned The Mother and the Law into Intolerance. A real step forward in filmmaking.".

Now here in 1914 we're witnessing a 2hour spectacle by the Italian filmmaker Giovanni Pastrone that is so sophisticated that at times it gets rather confusing.

Skillful use is made throughout of double exposures to make the action and the locations look even grander in scale than they already are such as Hannibal crossing the Alps. And there is an additional bonus in the form of an extraordinary dream sequence that anticipates by ten years Walter Ruttmann's 'Falkentraum' sequence in Lang's 'Die Nibelungen'.".

Now I prefer to think of the moving camera as a German invention but I would be more than happy to grant Pastrone the epic.The film also marked the debut of the Maciste character who went on to have a long career in Italian sword and sandal films. This is actually one of the most impressive cultural achievements because the character Maciste became really has very little to do with this film. Whole studies could be done on how Maciste evolved.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's something magical and alluring about Cabiria that goes above and beyond the sum of its hitandmiss elements. Beautifully sprawling sets depicting ancient times with stunning detail and imagination serve as the backdrop to characters that jump out from the screen in a way that had yet been achieved anywhere else. In more ways than one Cabiria strikes many a resemblance to Dante's Inferno from a few years prior but tops said film on just about every count. Perhaps the most vivid comparison between the two lies in its special effects. While Inferno's imagery strived for biblical grandeur Cabiria instead delivers something that's more artistic and frail. Sure there are scenes which focus mostly on disaster and action but it's the movie's dabbling in dreamlike effects and romantic imagery that gives it the upper hand. By no means is everything perfect however. It has to be said that moments of banality and obtuse incomprehensible plotting occur more frequently in between moments that either awe you with spectacle or woo you with charm. Nevertheless the film still manages to make its mark well standing out vividly from its early cinematic siblings thanks to its more straightforward subplots which more often than not cease any yawns beginning to surface. Perhaps most staggering of all is the film's scope not just in ambition and bravado but in its ability to strike genuine pathos. Whether it's moments of comic relief tragic despair or sheer thrill Cabiria gripped me from time to time in ways that earlier features failed to do. Definitely worth at least one watch for curious cinephiles and in my opinion is the first truly worthwhile entry in cinema's awkward infancy years.".
