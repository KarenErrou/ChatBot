In the historical context the movie is one of the most interesting documents we have in the movie history of central Europe. It shows that people had an idea what there future would like to be. The most interesting part is the vision of a Vienna without an important minority. It seems like a vary of stereotypes but its a fact that some visions turned into real.The locations are partly showing buildings and interiors of the 20's and were later identified as typical Jewish. Like the sanatorium Purkersdorf  or the jugenstil interior.The movie is a great puzzle of statements of the early 20's in an community before the big economic crises and the Holocaust.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the Republic of Utopia because of the bad economic crisis ailing the nation the Jews are made the scapegoats for the economic and social ills affecting the population therefore the government decides to expel them.Herr Leo Strakosch is among the exiled. He is engaged to Counsellor's Linder's daughter. He gets into the Republic in a clandestine way to show to the society the wrongness of their antiSemitic prejudice.This Austrian production is very surprising because of its foresight. It is directed by Herr H. K. Beslauer who did well handling the very delicate matter of anti Semitism as a tragic comedy. It is important to take into account the fact that we are talking about a 192324 Austrian production which seems to foresee the sad events that happened to the Jewish community in Austria and Germany only ten years later. Hugo Bettauer who was Jewish wrote the book that the film was based on. A year after the film's premiere he was murdered by a young Nazi.This is an excellent restoration by the hairy youngsters from the Austrian film library. Thanks to it the magnificent photography can be shown with its original tints. This film is noteworthy for more that its artistic qualities being a very interesting document of the Austrian society during the very difficult 20's. It is one of those very rare occasions that the European cinema particularly the Austrian has faced so directly even though it is managed through a very subtle comedy the antiSemitism brought about by the economic and political crisis during the first half of the XX century. It has nothing to do with the German propagandistic and racist productions from the end of the 20's and through all the 30's.Taking into account that references to this film are very scarce this Herr Von does not know any information about Herr Hans Karl Breslauer or his other work. This film is a very good example for its historic value of cinematic archaeology and one is grateful for it.The original novel from the writer Bettauer had been and still is very popular in his country due to its cynical and sarcastic humour. The antiSemitic comments are presented in a deadpan manner The Jews are guilty of our miseries Even through the centuries of oppression the Jews they have managed to position themselves into the primary seats of the world thanks to their intelligence or They sit into the most powerful banks of the world or this incredible comment They control the economy and write theatre plays.  MEIN GOTT . In the film one of the Parliamentarians when they are debating whether or not they will expel the Jews says We do write theatre plays! and the Speaker says It is true however the big difference is that ours do not get premiered. There are many funny situations and an ingenious mocking of stereotypes.There is also beautiful photography by Herr Hugo Eywo whose excellent work can be seen at its best thanks to the very well made restoration The production design by Herr Julius Von Borsody is also meticulously done.Even though this Herr Graf will not qualify this film in its totality as an Expressionist some influences from this great cinematographic movement can be found in the movie especially when Counsellor Bernart is secluded in a psychiatric hospital room where the decoration and the scene remind us in an obvious way of Das Kabinett Des Doctor Caligari 1920 by Robert Wiene. The actors' performances are convincing and unpretentious though they are mostly playing deliberate stereotypes and certainly silent film fans are thankful to have this rarity a black comedy that is prophetic of the antiSemitism that only ten years later will take hold of the same community.And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count has to take a stroll around the Tyrol.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com".

Anyway the idea for the film and the novel on which it is based is important and reflective of popular antisemitism that pervaded Europe and elsewhere at the time. But the bowdlerization of the book by having the whole story shown to be a harmless dream in the end destroys the impact of the social commentary. Beyond this the direction and handling of the good cast is very uninspired. The only sequence showing cinematic imagination is the madhouse scene and this is thanks to the art direction not Breslauer. Admittedly the 115 minute version I recently viewed is incomplete but what I saw was devoid of any compelling handling of camera position staging closeups or shot editing.".

The story seems very farfetched and yet  in light of what actually happened to the Jews in Europe only a few years after this film was made   this farfetched story is less extreme than the bizarre reality of the Holocaust. This film goes a long way towards making the Holocaust look dull and boring.The film takes place in the farfuture world of 1976 in the faraway city of Vientria. The good burghers of Vientria have just passed a new law expelling all the Jews from their city. Leo Strakosch a local Jew is betrothed to the fair Lotte a Gentile. Reluctantly complying with the law Leo prepares to leave Vientria but he confidently tells Lotte that he will return for her soon.A few years pass. Without the contributions of its former Jewish citizens the city of Vientria has now plunged into economic depression and artistic stagnation. Unfortunately this fits the antiSemitic stereotype that Jews secretly control the economy. With the entire city in decline the burghers are starting to consider rescinding the law and allowing the Jews to return.One Jew has already returned to Vientria Leo Strakosch wearing a ridiculous black moustache which is apparently meant to disguise him as a Gentile but which only makes him look more Jewish. Posing as a nonJew Strakosch now gets involved in local politics and stands for office hoping to get elected to the city's council so that he can rescind the law against the Jews.Die Stadt ohne Juden features dull acting ponderous photography and very little of genuine interest. A title card at the beginning of the film identifies the year as 1976 but everything looks like 1924. This film is preaching to the choir. In 1924 a few people were already aware of the growing trend of European antiSemitism and its danger to everyone. But most adults in 1924 either didn't give a damn about European Jews or actively supported the politicians who advocated relocation of unwanted Jewish citizens.I'll give this film high marks for good intentions but very low marks for actual execution one point out of 10.".

It is precisely for this reason that everyone strives to keep it alive at any cost.There might be fights differences ego problems or whatever you might call. The essential thing to remember is that when the family members join hands there is always a feeling of togetherness. Now for a bit of history lesson or nostalgia of the pastcall it whatever you might.In the 1980s numerous astounding films focusing on the daily lives of common people were made in the socialist nation of Hungary. Csok Anyu aka Love Mother directed by Rozsa Janos is one such unforgettable motion picture which has a dysfunctional family as its focal point. The center of attention is a small kid left alone to fend for himself. Spying on his neighbours using binoculars remains his favorite past time. As far as the parents are concerned the less said the better. The famous Hungarian cinaste Koltai Robert plays the businessman dad more interested in his pretty young secretary. Talented Hungarian superstar Udvaros Dorottya plays the tourist guide mother of the house. The only complaint that can be made about her is that she wants to earn more money by conducting more tours for German tourists. All this has some very obnoxious bearing on the young teenage daughter.She decides to take matter in her own hands by taking her life. Things are so pretty bad for this family as no one has time to speak to anyone.In the end all the acrimony is driven resulting in a new found happiness for all and sundry. Watching this feelI am sure that you will feel that these days such films are rarely made and there are hardly any television networks worldwide who would be willing to show such meaningful films. I saw this film in 1990 on the only Indian television network of the time called Doordarshan. It showed marvellous world cinema classics as part of its Late Night Screenings.For serious cinema enthusiasts apart from this filmI would like to strongly recommend a similar forgotten classic of Hungarian cinema called A Hungarian fairy tale by Gazdag Gyula.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arthur Miller's knockout play The Crucible was published in 1952 so it always struck me as odd that we didn't get a film version until 1996 after the Cold War ended. It's been a decade since I saw the 1996 adaptation and I wasn't impressed by it. I don't totally remember why but I thought it was a mistake to actually show the girls engaged in witchcraftlike activities and thought the ending was a bit abrupt cutting off Proctor's prayer on the gallows. But as it turns out it actually wasn't the original film version. The first was a French movie from 1957 The Crucible or The Witches of Salem.I did like this version better. Although it too shows the girls engaged in witchlike activities indeed in this version Abigail appears to be a bona fide witch it seems slightly more restrained. All of the subject matter involving the supernatural and the political made this movie intriguing and compelling to me. After watching 15 minutes or so I knew I wanted more. The 1957 film definitely borrows from Miller's play but in a way it is its own take on the Salem witch trials of 1692. It manages to get its point across adequately. It does strike me as odd that the French and Germans would take interest in a witch case from America when Europe had many brutal witch hunts of its own but setting the story in Salem is true to Miller's story which is the obvious inspiration.".

But as it turns out it actually wasn't the original film version. The first was a French movie from 1957 The Crucible or The Witches of Salem.I did like this version better. Although it too shows the girls engaged in witchlike activities indeed in this version Abigail appears to be a bona fide witch it seems slightly more restrained. All of the subject matter involving the supernatural and the political made this movie intriguing and compelling to me. After watching 15 minutes or so I knew I wanted more. The 1957 film definitely borrows from Miller's play but in a way it is its own take on the Salem witch trials of 1692. It manages to get its point across adequately. It does strike me as odd that the French and Germans would take interest in a witch case from America when Europe had many brutal witch hunts of its own but setting the story in Salem is true to Miller's story which is the obvious inspiration.";

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe Diminished Capacity isn't all that and a bag of chips as a friend of mine is fond of saying. But I'll tell you what it's pretty funny. I think I heard more laughing than anything I've seen at Sundance since Napoleon Dynamite and Little Miss Sunshine. That bodes well for the box office prospects of this film.Alan Alda gives a terrific performance as Rollie Zerb a smalltown Missouri oldtimer with Alzheimer's who lives with his sister and some hilarious but unidentified guy named Wendell in a trailer by the house. They are visited by Cooper Matthew Broderick who arrives at his mother's request to help talk Uncle Rollie into a nursing home. Cooper has mental problems of his own due to a recent concussion. While back in town he runs into Charlotte Virginia Madsen his high school sweetheart who is recently divorced from the town mayor. And somehow Rollie Cooper Charlotte and her son wind up heading to Chicago where they are going to try to sell Uncle Rollie's rare baseball card of Frank Schulte from the 1908 Chicago Cubs the last Cubbies team to win the World Series!.Broderick is solid in his awkward understated way. Madsen is the straight woman. But Alan Alda makes the movie as Uncle Rollie and dominates the screen in almost every scene. And yes if you squint you'll see shades of Hawkeye Pierce but his Rollie character is a complete departure from anything he has done in the past and probably his best comedic performance since MASH.The script is very wellwritten if a bit awkward at parts and under the direction of veteran actor Terry Kinney the action moves along briskly. There is probably more tension than there needs to be which doesn't really fit. But when you're not wincing you're generally laughing. There are some hilarious lines and a plenty of feelgood vibe. Everyone will like this movie.Sundance Moment Broderick was much better on stage than I would have expected. He was there with his wife Sarah Jessica Parker whose movie Smart People had premiered at Sundance the night before. Alan Alda was charming as well. Bobby Canavale was in two movies playing at Sundance this year the other being The Merry Gentleman.".

The problem with the movie is a story that misses its potential. I acknowledge that I haven't read the book. Maybe this worked better on paper but on screen this was lacking.Broderick played Cooper an editor for a Chicago newspaper who suffers a head injury and then is called away himself to help care for his uncle Alan Alda who's in the early stages of dementia. Madsen is some type of old flame for Cooper with whom he reconnects in his hometown. All three were fine in their roles but this movie had basically two directions in which it could have gone did a little bit of both and ultimately because it had no focus on either was a disappointment.This could have been successful as a lighthearted comedy a humorous look at dealing with the problems of dementia. Alda captured that well he was believable as a dementia victim and there were things like his fishwriting obsession that could have made this touchingly funny but those moments were few and far between. Or this could have gone the route of emotional drama as we watch Alda's character of Rollie and those around him deal with his decline but again those moments were few and far between. There was a moment when I thought the movie had made a choice  the very powerful scene when Rollie is missing and Cooper finds him in anguish in the bathroom at the card show lost confused and embarrassed at what's happened. But that moment also gets lost. Instead of that the story focuses for some reason on the old baseball card  a 1909 Cubs card that Rollie's grandfather gave him as a keepsake and that he now wants to sell. Even that could have been touching enough but the card ends up being used primarily as a prop for staging slapstick humour especially the ridiculous fight scene at the end of the movie.Also burdened with unnecessary characters especially Donny but even Madsen's Charlotte to an extent this was really a disappointment. 310".

Indeed some of the best and most memorable dramas stay true to this aesthetic and succeed purely on the merits on how well written and layered their characters are developed to be. Coming from a creative force that up until now has stayed mostly within the shadows of Hollywood director Terry Kinney known more for his acting gigs and writer Sherwood Kiraly who wrote an episode of ER twentyfive years agonot to be confused with acclaimed medical drama ER Diminished Capacity at its heart is exactly that kind of film. It's quiet unassuming and enriched with a few compelling personalities that help move the film past the screen and into your heart and yet direction Terry Kinney too often shifts the focusfrustratingly soagainst those aspects and onto more caricature plotting devices and flat sources of conflict for the more interesting characters. The result is a movie that for the most part provides a heartwarming and softlysentimental character drama with dashes of romance and comedy for good measurebut also one that too often stoops to tired writing and uninspired segments built to speed things up.And yet Diminished Capacity is a feature that works more when overt plotting is negated to the sidelines and mundane sources of conflict in the form of irritatingly flat antagonists are ignored. At the center of its tale are the characters of Cooper Matthew Broderick and his uncle Rollie Alan Alda both of whom share disabilities relating to memory despite being several decades apart in age. Under pressure from the bill collectors to meet ends meet Rollie invests in his nephew to take him to Chicago in order to sell off an extremely rare and valuable baseball card that was passed down to him from his granddad. What follows is a story that delves in and out of the relationship between Rollie and Cooper to mixed effect there are moments when the bond that both share resonates off screen and then there are others where there's just so much farce and obtuse chaseshenanigans going on one of these involving the film's dunderhead irritant in the form of hick Donny Prine that all nuances and subtlety that makes the couple so interesting is lost. The film's source of comedy works in exactly the same way there are small moments when laughter is least expected that come of nowhere to amuse and then there's those other sections that are far too obvious and facile to come anywhere close.Nevertheless with such a character drama a high amount of attention is brought upon the actors to successfully establish the traits present between the characters on the script and for the most part the ensemble do well in this area. Perhaps the strongest and most compelling aspect of Diminished Capacity in fact comes in the form of Alan Alda who plays old forgetful Rollie with just enough comical edge and sweet nonchalant resolve to really get his character across. With many other actors it would be easy to slip into a derivative cutout of the wacky old coot who doesn't know what's going on but Alda invests enough humanity in his position to give the film its only real source of heft within all the levity. Broderick who has spent the past ten years in between lackluster blockbusters and lending his voice to animated children's movies isn't quite as engaging as his costar but nevertheless fills the role suitably in all that the script asks for. It's a performance that is easily overlooked in favour of Alda's more attentive qualities but Broderick serves as a fine counterpoint nevertheless.For all the good that Alda and crew do however there still remain major faults within the woodwork of Diminished Capacity's frame that only belittle the more serious and tangible aspects of its design. Aside from the hokey antagonists and somewhat banal scenes focusing directly on the hobby of baseball card collecting there exists a romantic subplot lurking in the background of Kiraly's story that is never developed or capitalized on enough to fully resonate. Of course to most viewers this shortfused inclusion will be a mere perfunctory mishap but given the amount of focus put on Cooper and his love interest Charlotte Virginia Madsen there is nevertheless an empty sense of disappointment left in the wake of such potential untapped. In the end however that is essentially what the entire experience of Diminished Capacity boils down to unfulfilled promise. With a terrific cast and some nice characters Kinney's feature here can be charming and inviting but only in small doses the rest isn't quite as sharp and in the end spoils what is an otherwise decent character comedy.As a minor sidenote to this review I would like to raise the question of why this film was rated as a 15. The BBFC describes the film as containing strong language and yet the uses are infrequent and mild. Aside from thisthere is virtually nothing to suggest anything close to a 15 age rating. Indeed when a film like Wolverine can get a 12A rating how does one rightly justify a feature like Diminished Capacity receiving anything more severe? It's sheer lunacy.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoy all the actors in this so when I first saw this in the remainder bin I grabbed it. I hadn't heard of this release at all so looked forward to breaking the cellophane.The actors  Matthew Broderick Virginia Madsen and Alan Alda  struggle mightily with a rather awkward wandering script and a movie that can't seem to make up its mind in which direction and what genre it is embracing. Bathos pathos slapstick romance and too many pathetic fight scenes get thrown into the mix and take from a slender story that could have been wonderful. Broderick plays Cooper an editor for a Chicago newspaper who is called by his mother to sort out an uncle Alan Alda who is displaying bizarre symptoms of dementia. Thing is Broderick also has suffered a brain injury another fight scene and is having serious mental issues himself.This could have been fully explored in a blind helping the blind scenario but unfortunately it isn't.

I hadn't heard of this release at all so looked forward to breaking the cellophane.The actors  Matthew Broderick Virginia Madsen and Alan Alda  struggle mightily with a rather awkward wandering script and a movie that can't seem to make up its mind in which direction and what genre it is embracing. Bathos pathos slapstick romance and too many pathetic fight scenes get thrown into the mix and take from a slender story that could have been wonderful. Broderick plays Cooper an editor for a Chicago newspaper who is called by his mother to sort out an uncle Alan Alda who is displaying bizarre symptoms of dementia. Thing is Broderick also has suffered a brain injury another fight scene and is having serious mental issues himself.This could have been fully explored in a blind helping the blind scenario but unfortunately it isn't.

The story of country folks trying to survive in the big city of Chicago was a nice touch. I loved the real Cubs footage and could feel the pain of some of the fans portrayed in the film. I once loved baseball and I would imagine any true fan would get a kick out of the real baseball references throughout the film. Overall a satisfying surprise".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit when I rented this movie it was largely because of its cast. I always liked Matthew Broderick and Virginia Madsen. The talents of Alan Alda go without saying ... Hawkeye as part of MASH was legendary to say the least.I quickly found I was deeply interested in this movie as it began playing maybe because of what we went through with my own uncle who developed a form of dementia that accompanied his Parkinson's Disease I don't know but I was hooked.The antics at times were funny and like other movies very serious at other times. Broderick's character is also suffering from his own memory problems due to a severe concussion and can at least understand some of what his uncle is going through. Though unlike his uncle his neurologist states he should get better ...Alda as the uncle is excellent in this movie funny at times but very poignant and serious at other times  as he looks into the mirror his reflection that appears back is haunting and vacant. But he tries to deal with it though at times certainly gets things muddled.Madsen also is very good in this movie as the now divorced old flame but is very strong as her relationship with Broderick's character rekindles itself. Her scenes with her son are also very touching as she tries to deal with his problems. Her character certainly though is not one dimensional as her own potential career as an artist are developed in the movie as well. Her paintings in fact were the reason for her visit to Chicago in the first place but her roots clearly are in their hometown. Madsen in this film is radiant as she has ever been. If she was stunning in the 80s she is radiant now and has only improved her craft and skills.Overall a good movie well acted and well written. If you like movies with substance and something to them with family themes behind it this is the movie for you. Well worth the watch.".

The paper has moved him to a job proofreading the comic strips it carries but even at that his mind is not what it once was. When Cooper's mother Belle calls asking to help her with an uncle that appears to be getting incapable of living alone he decides to go see what is really going on.What Cooper finds is his uncle Rollie who is definitely not all there. Yet the old man has moments of lucidity. Rollie an independent minded soul is aging with all the problems the declining process carries. Rollie is sort of a dreamer he has several passions like fishing writing poetry but ideas become jumbled in his head. Cooper gets to know that someone is trying to steal a valuable baseball card in pristine condition that was given to Rollie by his own grandfather. Belle thinks that selling the card will bring some badly needed cash that Rollie does not have.In going back to the small place where he was born Cooper reacquaints himself with his former girlfriend Charlotte now a divorced lady with a young son. Charlotte a painter must go to Chicago for a presentation of her painting to a restaurant chain. Cooper thinks he can interest Rollie in selling his valuable card at a baseball convention. Unfortunately Rollie is about to be swindled into accepting not even a small fraction of the value. Terry Kinney better known as an actor and director with Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater is at the helm of this pleasant if light comedy. Based on a book by Sherwood Kiraly the film has a thin plot but it is engaging while one is watching it. The folks we meet are people one could relate to. The indignities of growing old and having to depend on others weighs heavily in the story. It also deals with loss of memory as seems to be a metaphor for those things one tends to forget with the passing of time.Matthew Broderick plays Cooper with his usual boyish charm. The wonderful Virginia Madsen adds a touch of class with her Charlotte. The great Alan Alda makes a case for his Rollie a man who sees everything suddenly out of his control. Bobby Cannavale and Dylan Baker two excellent character actors are seen as a bad and a good guy in the baseball card business. Legendary Ernie Banks has a cameo role.Diminished Capacity will resonate with viewers looking for an enjoyable and peaceful time with the company of regular people something that sometimes is forgotten by Hollywood.".

	schema:headline " Very honest very important very good";
	schema:reviewBody "I just read the critical comment on Rhythm is it and simply had the need to say that this guy didn't understand neither the movie's intention nor the message. Obviously he is a big Stravinsky fan so maybe this kept his focus on the musical part. The choreographer on the other hand was as he pointed out to the worried teacher more interested in education than in art. This is not a Stravinsky musical it's about working with frustrated young people giving them more self confidence a feeling for the need of discipline and hard work a feeling of what real fun is about making them feel comfortable with their body with themselves and so with other people. I'm a primary school teacher for music and I found so many of my thoughts in this movie. That Norwegian guy is obviously more interested in art than in education so he watched many touching and honest moments of this film with pure cynicism. It's all fake! I don't think so. The children didn't change at all. Not true either. You can literally watch the spots on the girl's face disappear through the movie because she begins to feel better about herself and so begins to look more healthy on the outside. Martin who never liked touching anyone and didn't feel at home inside his body now wants to become a dancer or an acrobat. And the black boy was not a clich in any way. I never had the feeling that anybody told him anything of what he said. It was just his hard way of life that brought him his wisdom and his need for more learning. It's not his fault that he is a contrast to many German children who don't like to learn and work hard anymore sad but true trust me. And I think he is perfectly right when he says that most Germans Europeans don't care about their culture. And if he wants to stay in contact to his roots by dancing with a friend what's so wrong about that?! All in all it's a great movie with a very important message Find out what you want and work hard for it. Believe in yourself and never be satisfied with what you already achieved you can always learn more. Just when you feel good with yourself you can have good relationships with other people.

	onyx:emotionText "I just read the critical comment on Rhythm is it and simply had the need to say that this guy didn't understand neither the movie's intention nor the message. Obviously he is a big Stravinsky fan so maybe this kept his focus on the musical part. The choreographer on the other hand was as he pointed out to the worried teacher more interested in education than in art. This is not a Stravinsky musical it's about working with frustrated young people giving them more self confidence a feeling for the need of discipline and hard work a feeling of what real fun is about making them feel comfortable with their body with themselves and so with other people. I'm a primary school teacher for music and I found so many of my thoughts in this movie. That Norwegian guy is obviously more interested in art than in education so he watched many touching and honest moments of this film with pure cynicism. It's all fake! I don't think so. The children didn't change at all. Not true either. You can literally watch the spots on the girl's face disappear through the movie because she begins to feel better about herself and so begins to look more healthy on the outside. Martin who never liked touching anyone and didn't feel at home inside his body now wants to become a dancer or an acrobat. And the black boy was not a clich in any way. I never had the feeling that anybody told him anything of what he said. It was just his hard way of life that brought him his wisdom and his need for more learning. It's not his fault that he is a contrast to many German children who don't like to learn and work hard anymore sad but true trust me. And I think he is perfectly right when he says that most Germans Europeans don't care about their culture. And if he wants to stay in contact to his roots by dancing with a friend what's so wrong about that?! All in all it's a great movie with a very important message Find out what you want and work hard for it. Believe in yourself and never be satisfied with what you already achieved you can always learn more. Just when you feel good with yourself you can have good relationships with other people. And people who laugh at you while you are learning are probably not your friends.";

The original subtitle is Tragedy of a Strange House which is much more accurate to the film in the version I own.While there is very little to go on storywise the set design and imagery is fantastic! While of course the sets look like painted cardboard because they are one must ignore that fact and look at the pure artistry put into the set design. There are some truly disturbing images such as a skeleton with a clock for a head. And while actual camera movement is absent this is an early example of a film that allows some action to occur at the fringes of the lens instead of dead center like you are watching a play. This allows for some interesting and startling entrances from Genuine herself.Speaking of startling there is a scene in a slave market that features two women in a gauzelike material. You can see their breasts clearly one of the earliest examples of nudity in a mainstream film. The nudity isn't highlighted and isn't used for eroticism but I was surprised to see nipples so clearly in a movie from 1920.I also must mention the brilliant score. While it is repetitive it isn't annoying. It seems a perfect fit for such a strange little film. I found the score to be quite complementary to the imagery and very beautiful as well.This may not be Caligari but it shouldn't be dismissed as it seems to have been by others on this forum. And in its full formif we ever get to see itit may just be another Caligari. Short on plot but a hallucinogenic dreamlike and fascinating trip into a strange world. Try it!".

Third the story is itself far too bizarre and convoluted for a casual viewer to find any interest in CALIGARI's is relatively straightforward in comparison. If you want a preNOSFERATU take on vampires track down the DVD of LES VAMPIRES instead...";

Their effort with Genuine however seems quite forgettable to me. The vampire did look scary I must admit and we have to give them thumbsup because this was actually done before Nosferatu bit still the action story and acting were just not too interesting. There are 2 versions out there a long one that runs for almost 90 minutes and a 44minute version the one I watched. Actually I only found the short version.

Every man who has ever been disappointed in his father should watch the old post stroke Kirk Douglas telling his son I never kicked you in the ass and I'm proud of that. My father beat me and I didn't beat you and that was a great thing. Maybe the definition of growing up is learning that your parents were children once and they were hurt and disappointed and did not get enough from their parents and that we are just all in this together trying to find love. Maybe I am not a grown up until I have cried for the pain and disappointments my own mother and father have had in their lives even though they also disappointed me.It is just lovely to know that even in a movie I never heard of that never really made it I can find such moments of genuine humanity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm willing to bet that Kirk Douglas liked this project so much he decided to do it again with his own son and grandson. Diamonds is a story that finds Kirk in pursuit of some diamonds he hid away in the house of an old hoodlum friend in Reno Nevada. Back in the day Douglas was a boxer by trade and this was a payoff for throwing a big fight back in the Fifties. To make his pursuit more interesting he takes along one of his two sons Dan Ackroyd and Ackroyd's son Corbin Allred. So three generations of the Agensky family go in pursuit of some diamonds.Of course the trip is a bonding experience for all concerned. Ackroyd just went through a bitter divorce with Allred's mother and he's been estranged from Douglas for several years.I found Diamonds to be a pleasant film entertaining and in a few instances quite touching. The Agensky family outing also included a visit to a bordello run by Madam Lauren Bacall.Before she married Humphrey Bogart Bacall was an acting student in New York with Kirk Douglas and she persuaded him to come to Hollywood. Back in 1951 they costarred in Young Man With a Horn so 48 years later they're back together on the screen. They're scenes are precious.With Diamonds I think Kirk was trying to send a message that all stroke victims aren't helpless. His scene with fellow former boxer Val Bisoglio as the two old ring enemies meet are a delight and later how he obtains his quest proves that while his speech is impaired he hasn't lost one single marble.Later on Kirk Douglas did It Runs In the Family with son Michael and grandson Cameron. But I kind of like this one better.".

Yes but the contradictory factor is simply Sir Kirk. His presence his strength to carry a film or his brilliance as an actor haven't diminished one bit since his stroke. Neither have his courage and his fighting spirit. Most actors his age would have given up being bereft of their most important tool  speech. Kirk Douglas thought otherwise and proved in Diamonds that he is still there and going strong.

Anyway I'm not sure when this opens but go see it.Oh! Also Corbin Allred the young kid is very hot  a great actor. I'm not just fixated on older people!".

	schema:reviewBody "While watching Diamonds you'll probably feel a bittersweet combination of sadness and pride but you won't be alone. Everyone will feel that way when watching an 83yearold Kirk Douglas play in a movie where he used to be active and agile and now takes speech therapy lessons to stay sharp after a stroke. Now that we've gotten the sadness out of the way let's get to the movie.Using footage from an earlier Kirk Douglas movie Champion the audience is shown that Kirk's character used to be a successful boxer. He tells his son that after winning a fight years ago he was paid in diamonds and the jewels are still hidden in Las Vegas. Together Kirk his son Dan Aykroyd and his grandson Corbin Allred go on a road trip to find the diamonds. Rather than just a strict buddycomedy the film has an additional dramatic element to the story Kirk and Dan have a bad fatherson relationship and despite his best efforts history has repeated itself with Dan and Corbin. So in between the jokes there's some family drama to be worked out in the movie.All in all this is actually a pretty cute film and if you feel you're up to watching a very old Kirk Douglas I recommend you rent it and watch it with your dad or whichever male family member you're on the outs with. And to the ladies out there old Kirk's still got it! Just ask Lauren Bacall who reunites with her costar after they acted together in 1950!".

	schema:reviewBody "Kirk Douglas is one of the all time great leading men in the last century. At 83 and having suffered a stroke I'm sure no one ever thought he would be acting again.  Think again.  Douglas is back and although he is hampered somewhat by the effects of the stroke he is as feisty energetic and dramatically potent as ever.Douglas plays Harry the patriarch of a threegeneration family in this bittersweet comedy exploring the relationships between a father his son and his grandson.  Harry is seen early in the film doing exercises to recover his speech and strengthen his facial muscles after a stroke.  A former welterweight champion Harry tells his son Dan Akroyd and grandson Corbin Allred that when he was younger he had a friend hold 13 diamonds for him and if he could find the friend he could recover the diamonds.  So the three men set out on a mission to find the booty.The story is bittersweet character study of the three men their relationships and misadventures.  It is a bit overly nostalgic and the dialogue often meanders.  However the good points outweigh the bad.  There is some great vintage bw footage of Kirk Douglas who played a prizefighter in the movie Champion' 1949.  Douglas gives a plucky performance as the aging patriarch.  This is his film and he dominates every scene.  His would have been an excellent dramatic performance for anyone regardless of age and health.  When those facts are considered it makes the performance truly inspirational.  It speaks volumes about Douglas' indomitable character.  It is obvious that he worked very hard to overcome his disability and he was determined not to let it get the best of him.Lauren Bacall was also delightful and the scenes that she and Douglas played together were touching and wonderful.  Bacall is still lovely poised and confident and her portrayal was sensitive and powerful.  Seeing the two of them together was like watching two masters at work.I enjoyed this film even though the story and characters were somewhat unoriginal.  I rated it a 710.  It brought back two screen legends and more than a few magical moments in watching them perform.".

Along with his grandson Corhin Allred the three head to Nevada to collect some diamonds owed the old man after throwing a fight fifty years earlier. This road picture really doesn't contain anything we haven't seen countless times before but this film is very special in the fact that it was made a few years after Douglas suffered his stroke in real life. I was expecting a rather bland performance made memorable by the bravery of the actor trying to act again but I was really floored because Douglas still contains all that energy and fight that we saw from him throughout his career. Clips from his film Champion are shown here to show Douglas as the young fighter and it's rather amazing that his performance here perfectly captures that mood and spirit of that young man. He's given a couple very big emotional scenes and he pulls them off remarkably well and that intense energy is still there after all these years. Both Aykroyd and Allred also deliver fine performances as does Jenny McCarthy as a prostitute. Lauren Bacall has a small role as a whorehouse owner but her scenes with Douglas is priceless. I'm really shocked to see some major critics rip this film to shreds because it's a damn good little film that seems to have a small little following behind it. It's certainly worth watching for Douglas fans. Towards the end of the film there's a twentyminute sequence in the whorehouse which got me worried where the film was trying to go but it perfectly captures everything we've been led up to.".

And I didn't believe my eyes The characters and the language are typically Viennese but in spite of this the film is suitable for international success! Camera work and editing are professional there are emotions in the film which is also rare in Austria still it's not sentimental and the cast was so perfectly selected that the unrealistic use of some actors from Germany who were presented as Austrians is not too disturbing. Josef Hader found his star role in the laconic former policeman Brenner who works in one of two competing rescue services in Vienna. Nina Proll and Barbara Rudnik are wonderful but not excessive actresses and Karl Markovics is absolutely present in every single of the few scenes he appears in.I saw the movie with a friend who only said Well it's just a crime film. Of course you can't expect any deepnesses the movie is only cool entertaining humorous gripping my hands were sweating towards the end and likeable also for its local colour.Wolfgang Murnberger who is known for rather depressing background descriptions Ich gelobe could have made a mess out of the material but he took it seriously and so he succeeded. I suppose it was a good idea to let Hader and Haas cowrite the script.".

Nina Proll and Barbara Rudnik are wonderful but not excessive actresses and Karl Markovics is absolutely present in every single of the few scenes he appears in.I saw the movie with a friend who only said Well it's just a crime film. Of course you can't expect any deepnesses the movie is only cool entertaining humorous gripping my hands were sweating towards the end and likeable also for its local colour.Wolfgang Murnberger who is known for rather depressing background descriptions Ich gelobe could have made a mess out of the material but he took it seriously and so he succeeded. I suppose it was a good idea to let Hader and Haas cowrite the script.";

This one is even darker than Kommssser Tod translates something like Come sweet death J.S.

	schema:reviewBody "In the vein of the excellent Swiss cop basher Strhl 2004 this dark Austrian comedy relies on a cartoonish depiction of a sympathetic loser trying to survive in an intrinsically hostile milieu  life. What Zurich's drug scene does for the former Vienna's underbelly provides for the latter with a cast of lowlife eccentrics firing off relentless salves of hysterical dialogues and folkloric swearing most of it mumbled in thick local lingo. Renowned cabaret artist and actor Josef Hader is Simon Brenner a failed cop but successful dopesmoker and alcoholic who now works as a paramedic for a private rescue service waging a ruthless war for patients against a rival business. Things fall off the stretcher when Brenner suspects his German colleague of a double shooting whereupon he halfheartedly investigates the crime and a few corpses later unravels a murky ploy roughly to do with State subsidies. Komm ser Tod based on the awardwinning novel by Wolf Haas is yet more proof that unlike their German counterparts Austrians have humour. Though subtitles might spoil some of the fun for nonGermanic viewers I'd take a gamble that the satirical overtone of this weirdo will not elude you provided you have a heart for grassroots extravaganza and occasional bad taste. But more than that director Wolfgang Murnberger deserves credit for resisting the temptation of indulging in his offbeat characters and always resuming his main plot line keeping the interest for the intrigue alive at all times. The filming and editing are fastpaced nicely counterbalancing the Viennese languish Schmh that pervades all things living with the notable exception of the German commonly abused as Piefke the Austrian equivalent for Kraut perfidiously played by regular Tatort detective Bernd Michael Lade. And although the resolve culminating in a classic pursuit and showdown is far too predictable and Tatortstyle anticlimactic the film manages to return to its basic premises in the epilogue elegantly rounding off a fullblown comic hammer that'll drive your dopamine levels up.".

It was the beginning of the collaboration between Murnberger Haas and Hader that went on till this date as the fourth and most recent crime movie about Detective Brenner has come out not too long ago. I think except the new one I have seen all these films and I must say I really loved Der Knochenmann. But about this 100minute beginning here I cannot say I am impressed. Not at all. The characters were not half as colorful as they were in the later installments of this franchise the dark humour still is not even close to its best and the crime story is also not too compelling to watch maybe because the antagonists are not half as interesting as Bierbichler's for example.I must say I am a bit surprised that I ended up disliking this film here. But maybe it is the case like a fine wine and it needed to grow a bit older to become really good. And it's something nice for a change too I suppose as usually the first films are the best when it comes to longrunning franchises but here it is the other way around apparently. The title for my review here is also only partially true as Brenner is already out of his job in here so we do not find out that much about his time with the force or at least I could say we only find out about it from people telling us about it. Simon Schwarz the major supporting player is in this film already too but he also does not add as much as he does in the later films. Sometimes it also seems that they or the writer weren't sure already about how big the character was supposed to become next to Hader. Overall I give this one a thumbs down and I don't recommend it. It is also not necessary to watch in terms of understanding the later film so my suggestion is to skip this one and watch one of these newer movies instead maybe the one I mentioned by name.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mnnerpension is a 90minute movie from 1996 so this one has its 20th anniversary this year. It is a German production and also in the German language. The director and also the writer is Detlev Buck one of Germany's most established filmmakers already at that point back then I guess. Here he worked with Eckhard Theophil who is also not an entire nobody. Theophil also plays a small role but Buck himself plays even one of the main characters here. He sure is a prolific actor as well and he may even give the best performance in the film. There is no need for him to hide behind the likes of Schweiger Bumer or Makatsch. On the contrary. I would say that he is easily better than Bumer and she never impressed me as an actress. This film here does not change my perception. As for Makatsch she has okay performances but she is also not really good in here just better than Bumer. Schweiger is okay and has solid chemistry with Buck but the fact that his character was trying to get together with the really bland Bumer's character took away a lot from the appeal. The story between Makatsch's and Buck's character was probably more interesting. But the whole thing admittedly felt as if it sacrificed all kinds of realism and authenticity for comedic purposes. Sometimes it worked out and the movie does have fun moments at times but it's far from enough to let me ignore the major criticism I just mentioned. As with Buck it is always mostly comedy with occasional dramatic moments. There is even a character that gets killed in here which is serious but still it does not take away from the overall lightness. The romance is also one of the film's biggest weaknesses. I am sad that I have to say that it is sometimes as bad as schmaltzy cheesy television films and the superior comedy cannot make up for that. I like Buck as a filmmaker and as an actor and quite enjoyed some of the stuff he has done but this one here from early in his career may be him still a while away from his best years. I give it a thumbs down. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "All in all I would say that Perl oder Pica is a decent movie. The settings and the costumes are the best things in it they recapture the image of the European 1960s which were still quite gloomy and postwar influenced but which had some elements of modernity slowly creeping in. The story is OK as well although I was expecting something more dramatic. I was waiting for a lifealtering event to take place in Norbi's life but there is not much happening there it is just a selection of episodes picturing boyhood experiences. The movie could also be defined as a series of vignetteslike illustrations of an European country that still had trouble coping with the memories of WWII and entering in the age of modernity seen through the eyes of a preadolescent boy. The acting was alright there were some exaggerations here and there but they might have been intentional. Finally I would say that it is a good movie which could have been better if it had tackled more critical issues and concentrated more on the context rather than the boy's life which in the end was just as any other kid's life in the '60s and to some extent even nowadays I am thinking of authoritative parents and teachers school bullying learning the 'facts of life'.... I have to mention though that the movie is set in my hometown of EschAlzette and it was quite thrilling to see sights I know very well projected on the silver screen!".

	onyx:emotionText "All in all I would say that Perl oder Pica is a decent movie. The settings and the costumes are the best things in it they recapture the image of the European 1960s which were still quite gloomy and postwar influenced but which had some elements of modernity slowly creeping in. The story is OK as well although I was expecting something more dramatic. I was waiting for a lifealtering event to take place in Norbi's life but there is not much happening there it is just a selection of episodes picturing boyhood experiences. The movie could also be defined as a series of vignetteslike illustrations of an European country that still had trouble coping with the memories of WWII and entering in the age of modernity seen through the eyes of a preadolescent boy. The acting was alright there were some exaggerations here and there but they might have been intentional. Finally I would say that it is a good movie which could have been better if it had tackled more critical issues and concentrated more on the context rather than the boy's life which in the end was just as any other kid's life in the '60s and to some extent even nowadays I am thinking of authoritative parents and teachers school bullying learning the 'facts of life'.... I have to mention though that the movie is set in my hometown of EschAlzette and it was quite thrilling to see sights I know very well projected on the silver screen!";

	schema:reviewBody "This is the last big Luxembourgian movie and as always when featuring a local production everyone gotta see it. Most people were disappointed after Andy Bausch's Deep Frozen but on the other hand quite delighted after watching Perl oder Pica. It's a quite interesting movie commenting on general Luxembourgian issues. It is not crucial to have some basic knowledge on our history but on some points somehow useful. I had quite the impression that Pol Cruchten took care on keeping the film accessible to strangers without losing the insider character. The strong point of this film is the exposure of Luxembourgian life which he watches in a very subtle ways and takes care not to cosmeticize it nor to make fun of it. It offers a good insight in the life how it used to be in the sixties which he draws probably from his own experience. Nevertheless the film got some flaws. Mainly the absence of any strand confuses the audience. The movie tells so many different stories without sticking to one real idea. For me he main idea of the film is handled in one or two sentences and that's it. It just lacks of clarity which Pol Cruchten might not be the only one to blame it's mainly because of an only average script which makes this an average movie. I would say that everyone interested in Luxembourg or Luxembourgian history should watch this movie as it offers an amusing not boring insight on their culture or shows your culture from a different point of view but I would not see the point for anyone else watching that movie. There are surely equally good movies in your language whether it is Hebrew or French. Voil!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film about people searching for their own sexual identity. It raises many questions and it is a good basis for all sorts of discussions about sex SM and above all the loneliness we experience on our search for identity.It is not a bad movie... but it is not a very good one either. However it could have been so much better....I was incredibly excited when I heard that there would be a film about SM which is neither porn nor transporting typical clichs or stereotypes. Indeed one of the things I liked best about this film is the fact that it is so incredibly well investigated. These filmmakers who claim not to be into SM at all did a brilliant job portraying why some people are into SM and what exactly they are yearning for.I also liked the SM scenes shown  strangely beautiful and extremely well done. The religious scenes are not for the faint hearted Christian but I loved them and they made sense to me. Besides I really liked the soundtrack too.All in all a decent film if you are NOT into SM and want to know what it is about. It is OK if you are into SM because you feel like finally a filmmaker understood what people like about it and managed to use this knowledge in the film. BUT No matter how much I liked the whole idea there were some major flaws. I expected a film like secretary  I loved its lightness its humor and the fact that it was not preachy at all. However you can't say that about this film....First of allSome actors were incredibly BAD  but that might be because some of them were no actors at all. Some of them were good because they were just playing themselves just like that old man. He was incredible  but that was him he wasn't acting! Because of the overall bad acting most of the dialogs sounded odd and fairly artificialthey in fact were artificial which brings me to my next point...What really ruined this movie for me were the dialogs They were highly artificial andor had a very strong moralizing undertone which really annoyed me. It was almost as if they were were so concerned they could fail to bring their message across that everything had to be oververbalized. I personally like to think for myself and I love to read between the lines. This was not possible in this film. Everything was said. Every point was made way too clear in my opinion. Even though I perfectly agree with what was said I just wish they would have used the film and its storyline to convey their message and not just the sociological sermons of the dominatrix. That was too much for me.Maybe this is is a good film for people who don't have a clue about SM or those that have just begun their journey but it definitely isn't if you've already been on that road. In the end what did soothe me to some extend was the fact that even this talkative dominatrix has no answer whatsoever when it comes to the longing and the loneliness inside each and every human being.PS Months later....speaking of good films about the search for sexual identity  better go and watch Shortbus instead.".

We have tons of movies talking about greed envy family success and love but there are still very few examples for religious or sexual themes  and even less which combine these two. There is a reason for that. Sexuality is considered as dirty Religion is considered as very private. It takes some wit to ignore both and go deep down the rabbit hole to find some answers.The passion of life is an independent production which tries to shed a sophisticated light at this topic. And unlike many other they manage to do so without using sexuality as an eye catcher but as the very key to the main theme.Indeed this movie is NOT about BDSM it is no blockbuster and it is not trying to be. It is a movie with a strong connection to theatre and to philosophy. If you look for a kinky SM flick look somewhere else. If you ever wondered if there is a deeper reason for sex than just breeding look here.For me the most interesting part of this movie were the deep and intense discussions about lust and sin which were far from being the typical blackwhite stereotype. And all the actors were quite charming in their struggle to fill their life with some sense  like we all are trying to do. Especially Marina Anna Eich as Eva convinced me as young pretty successful woman who is experiencing her new life with an amazement like Alice in Wonderland.Don't expect an easy movie here. But in my opinion there is little chance that you ever will get such a deep look at sexuality in a cinema again any time soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "So you've been told 247 The Passion of Life is a good movie about BDSM? Well there are reasons to be happy about this film and that's because it does NOT make a couple of popular BDSMrelated mistakes. That's good. However it makes a lot of other mistakes. And that's very bad.This movie is two very different women getting to know each other by coincidence. Maria a professional dominatrix and Eva daughter of a wealthy hotel owner destined to take over the family business. Growing curious then fascinated of Marias bizarre yet somehow attracting world of erotic subjection AND freedom Eva begins a journey of sexual selfdiscovery.That doesn't sound so bad does it? Also people who are into BDSM are NOT portrayed as perverts or potential criminals. They don't need to be prosecuted healed locked away... they're fine!Unfortunately if a movie is not bad in one way that still doesn't make it good. It also needs good acting good dialogues moody pictures a powerful soundtrack. 247 The Passion of Life doesn't have any of these at least not enough for a good film. Some actors are pretty convincing many aren't the dialogues change from trivial to lecturelike and back  There's no in between no subtlety. Whenever Maria starts lecturing about religion or sexual freedom I can't quite shake of the feeling that this should have made a better essay instead of a movie. Even though none of her thoughts are really new to the rather welleducated viewer. The soundtrack mostly fits the religious background theme although I think it's much of an overegged pudding every now and then as my GermanEnglish translation website tells me to put it.... Especially Mozart's Lacrimosa whose intensity has been used up quite a bit by other movie directors already. A little more subtlety might have done some good here too.Also the religious thing It seems to be much about throwing the ingredients of sadomasochism and Religion together. I didn't really see a dynamic evolving from this mixture. But maybe I didn't get it as I'm neither religious nor a fan of ample symbolism as much as the makers of this movie seem to be  so I tend to tune that out. Anyhow just combining two different elements doesn' make a movie  or art in general  interesting at all. That is unless something new evolves. Like a chemical reaction. No chemistry here at least none that I'm aware of.This movie isn't all bad. It's almost okay. But the sad thing is it could have actually been very good as the plot is promising and so is the seemingly odd combination of religion and sadomasochism.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem of this movie is that its makers could not make up their minds whether they would produce porn or a feature film about sex religion and individuality. The result is a sort of a documentary about parts of the Munich sex scene and about a set of ideas that may be widespread in that part of the scene. True enough there is a plot about a young attractive blonde exploring her sexual identity in the swinger and femdomBDSM scenes. This plot also goes beyond the shallow framework common to most porn productions in that it includes the relationships between the main character and its father and the relationships between several actors in the BDSM studio. However the character and plot development and the dialogs are at best foreseeable mostly shallow often tedious. Many of the utterings of the oh so intelligent doctoral student turned dominatrix are freestanding lectures that she could have better read to the audience directly from Michel Foucault's works. Much of the acting would have been done better by the members of a theater workshop at a local high school. Another thing you would not normally find in porn are elaborate theaterlike sessions in the BDSMstudio which contain no intercourse but are essentially dramatizations of religious pseudoreligious and outright blasphemic concepts about domination submission and worship. It may be that some may consider this art. To me it looked more like people afraid of their BDSM orientation trying to mask their sexual phantasies as artsy anti religious pseudorebellious gestures. Also the sex scenes are not classically pornographic in that they would contain closeups of genitals and the like. Still there is a quite a lot of sexual intercourse and BDSMplay in the movie which is depicted quite freely and over long stretches of time.All in all the film is too wouldbe artsy to be good porn and too shallow and too badly produced to be a bearable feature or even artistic film. What it is unwillingly perhaps is a good documentary about the mindset of its producers and of some parts of the semicommercial sex scene in Bavaria a catholic dominated region of Germany.Large parts of the film play in real existing Munich sex locations the Bizarradies and the La Boum swinger club. Even the true address of the Bizarradies is shown in the movie. If the film had been devised and financed by the owners of these locations as a commercial it could not have been done better. Also a part of the actors are into BDSM and the swinger scene in real life. So in a way the film offers the opportunity to see some pretty realistic femdom BDSM play and some actual scenes form a real swinger club. Unfortunately such play is often more exciting to play than to watch and so it is here. Admittedly the BDSM scenes are remote form many of the paraphernalia and kitsch often attributed to BDSM. In THIS sense the movie represents a good opportunity to watch some rather realistic sadomsochistic rituals and forms of expression. So for its documentary qualities this may be a film worth watching for those curious about femdom BDSM and the swinger scene in a catholic social context as long as the watcher is aware that this is a subset of a subset of a plethora of possible sexual and BDSM lifestyles.".

Of course the overall theme is different even though both movies will be about domination and sexuality. One thing the Grey movie will have is better actors overall. One of the sins no pun intended you have to put upon this movie.The movie itself with its theme will either entice you or appall you. The fact that dialog is spoken without emotion but a great part of the non actors cast in the movie is bringing the movie down. There are themes here that are interesting to explore depending on your sexuality more or less but the movie won't entirely allow that.Having said all that the movie tries something almost honorable. It does check the character name box symblism that is and might leave a few questioning themselves and their lives. Unfortunately that again is undercut by very weak normal people who don't seem to be able to respond to the depravity they are confronted with. It would be more interesting and enticing especially with a better script and actors.".

	schema:reviewBody "247 The Passion of Life is a German movie from 2005 so this one is already over a decade old and don't be fooled by the English title as it is exclusively in the German language. The director is Roland Reber and he also wrote the script together with his wife and lead actress Mira Gittner. It is one of their most known works for sure and Gittner also starred in the more recent Engel mit schmutzigen Flgeln. But back to this one here. It runs for 110 minutes at least the version I watched and it turned out to be almost as horrible as the other film I just mentioned. After seeing these two works by Reber and Gittner I fail to see any artistic talent in the filmmaker. Given his age he is probably also a lost cause in terms of improvement in the future. One major reason why this is such a disastrous work is Gittner. I have rarely seen an actress who is so untalented when it comes to line delivery and honestly I don't really think there was a single line from her where I felt that I was watching a character say it and not an actress who learned it beforehand. Her blonde colead is hardly any better to be honest maybe slightly.The most cringeworthy moment is probably when when the makers want us to believe that Gittner's character is to be seen as some kind of deity almost despite her hideous looks and how bland and boring her character is and that her slaves are on their knees praying to her. Yep her slaves. This includes an old man who is dressed like a female housekeeper and almost naked at the same time. The other slave is a guy who is constantly wearing a pig mask as he is obviously turned on by it. Just like the one I mentioned previously. Of course there are people with sexual preferences like that but then make it a documentary about these. Don't make it a movie with a cast where not a single member can't act worth a dime. Painful stuff really. Other very weak moments are of course towards the end when they included a religious theme to it and tried to make this a relevant watch combining nasty stuff like a woman being gangbanged the slaves I already mentioned and some strip scenes with an almost biblical context. Of course due to the lack of talent of the director and his cowriter it all goes wrong there as well. As a whole the film is an overlong collection of failures and a perfect example of a filmmaker trying to make a difference and making an interesting and controversial movie while not having the slightest bit of talent to deliver in any of these areas. The good thing here is that if Reber and Gittner can make it famous despite how limited they are then everybody can these days so it is somewhat motivational to aspiring filmmakers. But do yourself a favor and say as far away from this film as you can. A contender for 2005's worst a winner probably if we are only talking about German films. Highly highly not recommended.".

I don't mind that it's sexist juvenile or offensive  a lot of teenage sex comedies are like that and as long as it's amusing I'm OK with that. No I mind that this is a utterly unfunny insult to anyone's taste humor and intelligence. When superb actor Axel Milberg is degraded into a drivelling joke I felt sick. But when a 99yearold woman starts cleaning a toilet she previously and very acustically made dirty with a metallic dildo I knew that German comedy has reached a new all time low. Do I have to mention that the brown stuff flies into her face afterwards? Well you get the point. This is not daring humor it's just utter crap.Any redeeming things? No. Rebecca Mosselman is really cute but I felt sorry for her being in that movie. And Axel Stein delivers his dialogue rather naturally compared to the other highly artificially speaking actors and has most of the 3 or 4 funny scenes in the movie. Most of them happen during his adventures with the female hockey team. He dressed up as a woman to join them. You might think this is a stupid old joke. Well it's telling that in this film it's the funniest thing that happens...Bottom line Avoid this by all means. If a lot of people go and see this I might have to watch another sequel. I'd not survive that!!Rating 110".

The writer and director is Granz Henman and he was also the writer of the very first. And while his effort there was at least occasionally bearable this one here isn't at all. It seems that Rothemund the director of the first understood that a sequel may be a bad idea and abandoned the project. On an equally sad note this movie here is slightly longer than the first. Tobias Schenke and Axel Stein return but Schenke's character's best friend  love interest from the first film has equally disappeared just like Mina Tander's character as well. Instead his new woman of choice is played by Diana Amft. If you have seen Amft in Mdchen Mdchen or anything you will know that she is not a talented actress at all yet next to Schenke she really shines despite being very mediocre again too. And Axel Stein who is dressed in drag for almost the entire movie is a true revelation next to the unbearably bad Rebecca Mosselmann. No surprise nobody heard from her again after this film. But maybe I am also doing some of the actors injustice here because one of the main reasons next to their lack of talent is the horrible script.At least you could say about the first film that luckily it never took itself serious but this one here does with Schenke's character constantly talking about his true love while he almost gets raped by nymphomaniac nurses and aunts all of them pretty hot which of course was intended to lighten up the situation. Oh yeah his talking dick is back again as well and adds nothing to the film once again. This is one of the few aspects that did not get considerably worse here because it already really sucked in the original movie. On a more positive note I can see somehow why Stein was a big breakthrough artist back then at that point as he occasionally managed the impossible namely making Henman's script funny on 2 or 3 occasions. I also liked how it is not revealed eventually that he was his sister in drag. Oh well these girls were really retarded to not see it but yeah.. Besides that the film uses more stereotypes and embarrassingly bad sex jokes melted ice cream on pants for example than Mario Barth. And the production values are very weak too in general. We hear that the protagonist should take care of a 99yearold woman and she looks no day older than 65 and the actress who played her was still much younger. We get cameos by Axel Milberg Bully Herbig and Christine Neubauer who for a rare occasions is not the one ruining a movie. This one does it all by itself. There should never have been made a second film and probably there should not have been made a first film either. Impressive how they managed to make this one even worse looking at how weak the original already was. Stay far far away.".

Not of much help is his even hornier buddy aptly nicknamed Red Bull who devises the most devious tricks to get it on with girls things that only help get Florian into trouble. The situations are truly comical and it's just one funny outrageous moment after another. There's a lot of bathroom humor some of which is perhaps too much. But unlike American movies not all bodily fluids are used. The movie as a whole has an American feel to it in it's competent direction but it doesn't lose its original German touch and heart. This is not like American comedies filmed in Europe. The acting is excellent even the extras in the background are all doing their best. There are a lot of gorgeous women here but not much nudity unfortunately. The movie itself is really a soft Rrated movie despite the Xtheme. The German DVD includes deleted scenes which include some more nudity that would have made this movie more of a harder R. There are a lot of extras on the DVD. Despite covering familiar ground this is a very funny and fresh comedy. Don't miss it.".

	schema:headline " Heinrich George and Zarah Leander";
	schema:reviewBody "When we consider many of the novel adaptations made at Ufa in the 1930s when actually the Nazi propaganda saw its heyday it is hard to capture the traces of their literary sources. Considerable exaggeration in fear of any immorality explicitly displayed resulted in altered distorted content. And that travesty seems to be very noticeable in Carl Froehlich's movie the title of which HEIMAT Homeland is one of these titles that could be labeled misleading and meaningful alike.From the very start with the credits we are led to the atmosphere of the times and Zarah Leander the close up of the face of studio queen a sort of the Garbo of the Ufa Studio. Soon we hear her singing Drei Sternen three stars with her deep voice something that carried so much charm and magic at the time that even the propaganda leaders could not resist it. Most of that charm however has not stood a test of time and after all these years we are led to capture just the glimpse of who this woman was and what she managed to evoke in her roles in a short career span.In HEIMAT the movie made by the director the legendary actress most collaborated with she handles the portrayal of a woman who leads us all to a conclusion that is not so widespread these days success and career do not necessarily go with inner peace and happiness. Maddalena becomes the sole master of herself a personality whose life blends art and reality blissful illusion and bitter consequences that life sets forth. Comedy blends with drama something very realistic. This aspect of both femme fatale and a woman being emancipated is echoed in many of her later films particularly DER WEG INS FREIE where an artist copes with the unexpected 'surprises' that conventions and gray everyday offer. All the aura so to say around her evokes and intensifies these feelings quite convincingly in spite of highly dated acting style. The first aspect in that 'aura' is the place where the action is set  a small German town in 1885 where the prefabricated conventions take over all feelings of genuine self. She comes to her hometown as a very famous opera singer as Maddalena dall'Orto and is going to sing something meaningful something that may at least call our attention to her inner torments Bach's PASSION ACCORDING TO ST MATTHEW. But as it usually happens in such pretentious movies art occurs to disguise the past. How will she deal with the bitter secret she carries in her heart and is yet to be revealed in the most unpredictable circumstances? The secret of the life in Berlin and one Bankdirektor von Keller Franz Schaftheitlin...Another aspect in that aura are the visuals. Everything seems to evoke her mental and psychological states. Thanks to heavy influence of the German Expressionism's tradition and some elements of Stanislavskian method the viewer is memorably led to the world of changeable moods that the protagonist goes through. In one of the most unforgettable scenes of the movie Maddalena enters a Gothic church where the shadows the organ music the architecture that in a racket like fashion seems to take a 'mental and visual' flight the aesthetic mannerism and extreme emotions subvert our senses. In another scene she enters her home after 8 years and touches the objects clearly evoking the emotional ties to the things and memories. Mind you the wonderful use of ostentatious elaborate sets with the dazzling closeups of Ms Leander's face.Finally a significant aspect is her singing which contributes highly to the merits of the movie supplying it with desirable resonance of the drama. She sings like Ms Dietrich as far as magnetism is concerned and unlike Ms Dietrich when we consider dramatizing. Meanwhile her songs provide us with a unique artistic experience. The song about three stars as well as the more 'emancipated' song 'Die Liebe' Love work on a creative level of communication even with the viewers of today. Note for instance the moment she sings at the harp or the musical and emotional crescendo of the finale.But after seeing the film I had such a feeling that it would be a great exaggeration to say that this is purely a Zarah Leander movie that it is worthwhile seeing merely thanks to her. As a matter of fact she may occur too dramatic too pretentious in her style to many people among modern audiences. Such a portrayal of a woman an artist and a mother seems to occur one of the reasons why the film may be considered dated. There is however one performance that will actually never allow us to analyze it as old fashioned and barely convincing. It is Heinrich George's portrayal of the father. The actor who was highly underrated in his time achieves something special. His role is not an easy one he depicts a man deep in his own worldview an authoritative but affectionate parent he has his own premonitions  consider his memorable line he utters to his daughter You have retained a good heart but there is something in your eyes I don't like. He is a loyal citizen but above all a humorous fellow. Drama and comedy find best balance in him. This role recalls heavily his portrayal in DER POSTMEISTER where he did not play with Ms Leander but Hilde Krahl. That is why I consider HEIMAT a great Zarah Leander and Heinrich George's achievement. Highly worth seeking out.".

	schema:headline " One more Zarah";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching Zarah's movie thankfully the good print and subtitled versions are available of course with some minor errors  for example when Leo Magda's paternal mentor calls Poldi by the sobriquet Undine he meant 'Angel'. But over all the subtitles at the warfilms had been good. Most of the reviewers here has called it as the Propaganda movie. That is some interesting term. It would look so from western angle but if one gets neutral neither with Axis or Allies leaning then probably almost all the movies in Hollywood were propaganda movies at that time  even supposed to be musical romcoms. What you call of the 'Last Time I saw Paris' in 'Lady Be Good' ? Isn't that a blatant propaganda ? If this is a propaganda movie so was Gone With the Wind or any one on that matter. So I won't go here on Propaganda aspect in fact I really don't find that aspect here. Asking one to come back to roots is propaganda ? Really ? Secondly the other two aspects had been quite interestingly missing whether deliberately . Antisemitic  easily the villain Keller could have been a Jew after all he was a corrupt banker or the antiallies angles. There is an interesting episode when Zarah is asked of the American cultures and she said there are negroes diswashers and fraudsters. But the manner she said it it was more of taunting the presumptive man than stating fact. I don't know what the SS would have intended but definitely not this. It looks so sad that Zarah was virtually blacklisted as Nazi sympathizer. In fact one of the reviewer even calls of the 'Morality imposed by Goebel's ministry. I would say it was exactly opposite. Heroine had a child outof wedlock she keeps the child hidden has a sort of guilt complex but not too much. His american's including her entourage of German people know of the existence. She doesn't want the townsfolk to know for natural reason. They have too outdated morality concept which had been even semiridiculed by the movie. To compound that she refused to marry the father of the child even when pressed to do so by the seducer as well as her own father. And there I would say it is a morality preaching but not the morality of the 'Society' but the morality of a human. How could she be asked to marry a person like that and expect to be happily ever after like countless holly movies expect to Love in the Afternoon style which is one of the most common Holly themes including in Gone With the Wind where for similar behaviour Clark is exonerated but not Vivian .In this aspect I find Zarah's or Garbo's movies to be forerunner of the feminism. Not in a feminist way but in humanist way. If the genders are equal they are so not by denigrating the other gender but rising up and matching the shoulders. This is a simple story of a provincial girl rebelling against the father to follow her heart a career in music leaving family and silent adorer behind. The downfall the seduction by the philandering villain having a baby and then further struggles probably including Cabaret performances till she rose up in her station hadn't been covered in detail just hinted. At last the leading star of NY's Metropolitan Opera she comes back to her provincial hometown for a performance but really to visit her family once more and there she is subjected to the slanderers and manipulators through evil or emotional blackmail. The end was too much of coincidence to be of my liking I would have rather had the factor removed through the involvement of the Prince who was not only her great fan but also had several times offered his help whenever she requires. The same end would have been achieved through him removing this coincidence factor. But anyway it is easy to think of things from my chair that director missed from his and not appreciate what he didn't miss and I would have. This didn't take away the enjoyment coefficient by introducing a jar which many movies do.".

	onyx:emotionText "Watching Zarah's movie thankfully the good print and subtitled versions are available of course with some minor errors  for example when Leo Magda's paternal mentor calls Poldi by the sobriquet Undine he meant 'Angel'. But over all the subtitles at the warfilms had been good. Most of the reviewers here has called it as the Propaganda movie. That is some interesting term. It would look so from western angle but if one gets neutral neither with Axis or Allies leaning then probably almost all the movies in Hollywood were propaganda movies at that time  even supposed to be musical romcoms. What you call of the 'Last Time I saw Paris' in 'Lady Be Good' ? Isn't that a blatant propaganda ? If this is a propaganda movie so was Gone With the Wind or any one on that matter. So I won't go here on Propaganda aspect in fact I really don't find that aspect here. Asking one to come back to roots is propaganda ? Really ? Secondly the other two aspects had been quite interestingly missing whether deliberately . Antisemitic  easily the villain Keller could have been a Jew after all he was a corrupt banker or the antiallies angles. There is an interesting episode when Zarah is asked of the American cultures and she said there are negroes diswashers and fraudsters. But the manner she said it it was more of taunting the presumptive man than stating fact. I don't know what the SS would have intended but definitely not this. It looks so sad that Zarah was virtually blacklisted as Nazi sympathizer. In fact one of the reviewer even calls of the 'Morality imposed by Goebel's ministry. I would say it was exactly opposite. Heroine had a child outof wedlock she keeps the child hidden has a sort of guilt complex but not too much. His american's including her entourage of German people know of the existence. She doesn't want the townsfolk to know for natural reason. They have too outdated morality concept which had been even semiridiculed by the movie. To compound that she refused to marry the father of the child even when pressed to do so by the seducer as well as her own father. And there I would say it is a morality preaching but not the morality of the 'Society' but the morality of a human. How could she be asked to marry a person like that and expect to be happily ever after like countless holly movies expect to Love in the Afternoon style which is one of the most common Holly themes including in Gone With the Wind where for similar behaviour Clark is exonerated but not Vivian .In this aspect I find Zarah's or Garbo's movies to be forerunner of the feminism. Not in a feminist way but in humanist way. If the genders are equal they are so not by denigrating the other gender but rising up and matching the shoulders. This is a simple story of a provincial girl rebelling against the father to follow her heart a career in music leaving family and silent adorer behind. The downfall the seduction by the philandering villain having a baby and then further struggles probably including Cabaret performances till she rose up in her station hadn't been covered in detail just hinted. At last the leading star of NY's Metropolitan Opera she comes back to her provincial hometown for a performance but really to visit her family once more and there she is subjected to the slanderers and manipulators through evil or emotional blackmail. The end was too much of coincidence to be of my liking I would have rather had the factor removed through the involvement of the Prince who was not only her great fan but also had several times offered his help whenever she requires. The same end would have been achieved through him removing this coincidence factor. But anyway it is easy to think of things from my chair that director missed from his and not appreciate what he didn't miss and I would have. This didn't take away the enjoyment coefficient by introducing a jar which many movies do.";

	schema:headline " One of the most powerful antiwar movies ever made!";
	schema:reviewBody "A group of G.I. soldiers in the jungles of the Vietnam War meet a native young girl. They are raping and torturing it brutally and finally kill it. One soldier is disgusted by this inhuman behavior and reports this crime to his officers who try to turn him down. Finally his former mates are sentenced to military jail or have to leave the army.This whole story really happened in Vietnam in 1967. It was the turn of German independent film maker Michael Verhoeven make a film about it in 1970 in real underground style with bw steady cams and German actors down in the forests of Bavaria. There is no jungle but just European forests. The actors are speaking with Bavarian German accents and wear groovy seventies' style haircuts. It wasn't Verhoeven's idea to make a real Vietnam war movie but rather a reflection of the war brutality on the human soul.The brutal rape sequences are shown in full and long details which appears rather like a mondo cane documentary or snuff movie. There is no space left here for any kind of humanity in this scene  all of the soldiers are turning to animals are torturing the girl in most disgusting ways. Only G.I. Eriksson played by director Verhoeven himself tries to withdraw from the scene but is forced by his mates to rape the girl as well. Another soldier who becomes eye witness to the scene is shot.The real touch of this movie is sometimes really unbearable and although it was filmed in Bavaria with a low budget it has more impact on the spectator than many Hollywood Vietnam movies like Joel Schumacher's visually similar Tigerland. The pain cruelty and inhumanity of the soldiers can be felt in every second of this movie with its harmless title and at its peak OK reaches such a high level of emotions than another great German antiwarmovie Bernhard Wicki's Die Bruecke The Bridge 1959.There can be seen some popular German actors in this film such as Rolf Zacher and Friedrich von Thurn as soldiers Eva Mattes as the girl and Gustl Bayrhammer Pumuckel as an army officer. At the beginning of the film the actors are all introducing themselves with their real names ages and marital status. In the end Verhoeven probably seemed to calm down the high emotional story by showing the whole cast and crew behind the scenes and finally the main actors going out to a pub after filming. There is also a very strange moog synthesizer score repeating an electronic loop every few minutes again.The story of his first performances was nearly as thrilling as the plot itself. During his debut at the Berlin Film Festival in 1970 the movie became a big scandal and many critics left the first screening in disgust  the whole festival was closed down just after this first screening. There's been a big media hype with lots of negative reviews and later on OK was shown again at a San Francisco film festival where it became a big hit and a minor cult movie for the antiwar movement.Today this early Michael Verhoeven direction is a rather forgotten German movie diamond but its power and impact can still be felt after more than 30 years. In Germany it was shown on TV for the first time in 2001. In 1990 it was Brian de Palma's turn to do a remake with Michael J. Fox entitled Casualities of War based on the same real incident in a lonely Vietnam jungle in the late sixties.".

	schema:reviewBody "O.K. is a West German blackandwhite film from 1970 so this one is quickly approaching its 50th anniversary these days. It is a relatively early career effort by writer and director Michael Verhoeven and while I like some of his later stuff I can hardly say anything positive about this one here. The material is sufficient for a 25minute film actually if we just include a brief introduction the rape the murder and finally the attempt to bring justice. But it is not enough for a film that runs for roughly 75 minutes without credits. That's one problem. Another is that I can really see why it caused such a scandal and in my opinion it is scandalous for the sake of it. Does it protest against the Vietnam War? Yes. Is it based on real events? Yes. So far so good. But you also have to deliver something other than sheer revolting scenes and a scream that injustice has happened. The beginning is the best example. Verhoeven never succeeds with really keeping the soldiers apart from each other with just giving them individual depth. There are the offenders as one unit and there is the protester as a second unit as their opposition even if he is just an individual.The cast includes several known names here in Germany like Bayrhammer mostly known for Pumuckl these days still and I can't believe he really scored a German Film Award nomination for his portrayal here. Add to that Senta Berger the filmmaker's wife back then already and she added nothing Eva Mattes whose praise mostly resulted from her being physically ready to play the part Zacher Becker von Thun Verhoeven himself and others. I am a fan of some of Verhoeven's later works related to Nazi Germany but not at all about this one here. It is propaganda for the sake of it really and a pretty empty statement eventually as she writing was so shallow. The simple mind thinks after watching that American soldiers raped their way through Vietnam and that makes this film fairly dangerous too so lets hope they don't get to see this one. These days it is really not easy to find a copy. Must have been a really bad year for German Film if this wins a screenplay award and is submitted probably as nothing but a provocation to the Oscars where it obviously did not manage a nomination. The title is also a lie in reference to one character's words at the very end as afterward we are shown that not everything is okay with the prison sentences following the incident. Okay that is all I have to say about this movie. I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

The two women live in the same house in East Berlin. Nike's apartment has a balcony. There they sit in the evenings and chat discuss life and drink. They drink a lot actually. Sometimes Katrin gets back to her own apartment only when her son Max has to leave for school in the morning. Their regular sittings come to a temporary stop when Nike picks up Ronald a dimwitted trucker who moves in with her. He is not a man of words but obviously does an okay job in bed. For Katrin his presence is a nuisance. One evening after she had an argument with Nike she drinks just the bit too much and ends up in Hospital  having to finally recognize that one of her problems if not her major problem is alcohol. Life goes on. And on. Sommer vorm Balkon is about ordinary people who lead ordinary lives and do ordinary things and yet it is special. The gentleness and love with which director Andreas Dresen portrays his heroines really makes one care for them. The characters though going through some unpleasant experiences never lose their grace. On the contrary you really come to admire these brave women. The depiction of the social milieu they live in is meticulous with special attention to all the little absurdities and droll details of daily life. Especially the scenes where Nike visits her elderly customers are hilarious and touching at the same time. Nadja Uhl as the saucy matteroffact Berlin girl with a striking preference for very tight clothes is fantastic. So is Inka Friedrich as the sometimes lonely and desperate jobless single mother. Congratulations to the director for these terrific leads! Sommer vorm Balkon is surely not a movie for everybody there is pretty much no action and as part of the humor comes from the thick Berlin accents maybe only Germans will be able to fully appreciate it. I loved it and to everybody with a taste for movies that make you laugh and cry and think about your own life I highly recommend it.".

Well duh or you wouldn't be reading this. With just three reviews in nearly ten years this film seems to be greatly overlooked as well as underappreciated. Which is a pity as it conveys so much in such an understated way.First of all several establishing shots of the town it's set in Berlin are not only beautiful but will also put a smile on the faces of everyone who like Marlene Dietrich loves the city.Next the film wonderfully shows average life  it does not pretend to have a blockbustertype script. There are no spies murderers or explosions. There are just normal folks with normal rather dreary lives with quite average problems jobs and so forth. The way in which Nadja Uhl's job homecare of senior citizens is depicted is respectful and loving. Like so many aspects of this movie this depiction closely resembles real life. And the romance she ensues makes you scream at the screen stop that he's bad for you a lot like what happens a lot in real life as well  regardless of gender.Also realistic is the way the movie conveys the desperation of Inka Friedrich a single mom who has trouble finding any sort of reliable job and too little money to adequately take care of her son. Again many people from all the seven continents will be able to empathize with or recognize her situation.Then there's the great use of music to establish the location namely Germany many typical 'schlager' songs are featured and the use of Nana Mouskouri's 'Guten Morgen Sonnenschein' is not only very clever but also ensures that particular very catchy song to be stuck in your head for days to come.To save the best for last Nadja Uhl. This great actress also known for her roles in De Tweeling Dschungelkind Die Stille nach dem Schu and Der Baader Meinhof Komplex might be the prettiest woman and one of the very best actresses ever to have been 'Made in Germany'. Unfortunately both her looks and skills have been criminally undervalued internationally. Luckily there are films like Sommer vorm Balkon in which we get to see her shine like only few actresses can.While the film might have its faults much like nearly every other film does the combination of its honest script great use of music Berlinesque setting and great acting as said in particular Mrs. Uhl make it very worthwhile.".

	schema:reviewBody "SUMMER in Berlin Vor dem Balkon. Viewed at San Sebastian 2005 image1.jpeg Director Andreas Dresen. Featuring actress Nadla Uhl. My personal favorite in competition here was Summer in Berlin Sommer vorm Balkon which is an extremely funny social drama set in the run down Prenzlauer Berg district of East Berlin. Andreas Desen who is steadily building up a filmography of highly regarded independent films is arguably the most talented and innovative director currently at work in Germany and has already picked up many prizes in a relatively short career. In Summer before the balcony literal translation of the German title two woman one an extremely sexy and generally appealing blonde Nadja Uhl about 30 and a 39 year old still attractive but highly neurotic brunette Inka Frierich are neighbors in the same tenement and such close friends that there is a borderline erotic bond between them. Uhl the dropdead attractive blonde altho most of the time dressed in cheap jeans and over tight jerseys works as an attendant to pathetic helpless old people living alone which requires her to wipe up rectum juice and other unsavory tasks but she goes about it with a sunny good natured disposition.Meanwhile her unemployed divorced brunette buddy has among other things a heavy drinking problem a young daughter and a tendency to suicidal selfdestruction. Enter Andreas the bluntspoken tattooed slob of a truck driver who in spite of the fact that he looks like a geek seems to have a fatal attraction for all of the women who hang out in the drinking dive which is the meeting place for all the lowlife characters in the neighborhood. At first it seems impossible that such a beauty as Nadja could ever go for such geek but there is more to geek than meets the eye  such as a number of former wives and children scattered about the German map and a certain freewheeling disarming existentiality. Actor Andreas Schmidt is the kind of character who needs to do nothing more than walk across the screen to make the audience crack up.This picture is a slice of many lives people trying to keep afloat as best they can in a prosperous society that has passed them by. It's hard to explain why this is all so haha funny but it is and it all ends up on a somewhat promising upbeat note. I would give this picture all the Conchas  with a double Concha for Nadja Uhl  but alas I'm not on the jury and juries tend to have very strange minds of their own. By the way the script by Wolfgang Kohlhaase is so damn good that it looks like there wasn't any script at all and the actors were just making the story up as they went along with a little nudging from the director  and the music is a subtle underpinning of German hits from the seventies that never intrudes but sounds like it emanates from the hearts of the characters themselves. I'm still not sure whether it was just that Nadja totally blew my mind or that the picture really is this good. In any case this is one to watch for if it ever comes your way.".

Solid acting solid script solid camera but at no stage does this film become more than the sum of its parts. Its set in the trendy part of former east Berlin and revolves around the friendship between unemployed shop window decorator Katrin and the stereotyped blonde Nike an old people's nurse. At first glance they have nothing much in common apart from living in the same house both being single and both having taken an unhealthy liking towards vodka. The plot itself is rather trite we just fade in on their everyday problems and yup you've guessed it there are men involved. Then after the usual complications that come with love friendship and too much drink we fade out again. To give the whole thing a little more depth a kid is thrown in for good measure. Still after the credits rolled in I asked myself whats the point? Three days later I couldn't remember much of it anymore. True there are some good lines and a few mildly amusing scenarios but the story stays rather predictable all the way through. I reckon this film is supposed to depict life as it is but if life is that dull I don't really see any reason to make a film about it. My summers in Berlin are usually a bit more entertaining that much I know.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sommer vorm Balkon or Summer in Berlin is a German 105minute movie fro over 10 years ago. The writer is Wolfgang Kohlhaase and he has been working in the industry for a long time even if the name is probably not known to many. The director is Andreas Dresen and he is among Germany's most awarded filmmaker in recent history even if the name Dresen is probably not too known outside Germany. The lead actresses are Inka Friedrich and Nadja Uhl. Both scored a German Film Award nomination for their performances and so did supporting actor Andreas Schmidt. This film we have here is pretty much a perfect description of Dresen's approach to film. There is not really a lot happening in terms spectacular events but it is a realistic study of two women being best friends and living in apartments the same house. It is about love pain financial problems etc. stuff that maybe all of us can relate to somehow.The acting is fairly good from start to finish and even if moments of true emotion and greatness are missing in my opinion this was a very solid watch and it never dragged which is not to be taken for granted for a film over 100 minutes. I also couldn't say what Dresen could have done better because it worked very well. The characters are also pretty likable at least the two main characters and you feel for them. Dresen strikes through realism again and it's nice to see all the recognition he got for his work here. Thumbs up and I recommend Sommer vorm Balkon. Worth checking out and one of the best German films from 2005.".

	schema:reviewBody "And who might you ask is Clara Wieck? Well if she hadn't married Schumann she might have been much more famous than he. Her pianist abilities were thought to be equal to or greater than those of Franz Liszt. I had the privilege of seeing this film in New York City in a small theater subtitled. A friend of mine rented it and unlike one of the posters his film was dubbed in English. I am glad I got to see the German version.This is a beautiful film with a feminist bend to it being the story of a brilliantly talented young woman exploited by her father and Schumann who becomes her husband. Kinski is absolutely wonderful and beautiful. Also her piano fingerings are great.There is an interesting line at the end where Wieck says talking about her home with Schumann I hope there will be room for two pianos. Of course there weren't and she was forever known as Clara Schumann.The film doesn't go into the fact that Clara Schumann did have a career after marriage however and a good part of her relationship with her husband revolved around their mutual passion for music. She had 8 children but managed to compose and do concert tours often with her husband until he was institutionalized. After Schumann's death with the help of Brahms she continued to do concerts though plagued by various ailments.Try to see this film in German with subtitles if at all possible.".

It is a wonderful film with fine acting by the leads Herbert Gronemeyer and Natassia Kinksi who had been a model and would enjoy further success after this movie. The time is early 19th century 18301850during the Romantic Era craze in classical music. Beethoven opened the gates to the new wave of music which would be followed by Chopin and Franz Liszt all mentioned in this film. Robert Schumann is portrayed here as a struggling artist an idealist who lives from hand to mouth more along the lines of Mozart. He gets romantically involved with the more wealthier and polished Clara Wieck whose father opposes their love. Even like this Robert and Clara who had become lovers through working together as composers continue to defiantly engage in their relationship. Clara's father is brought to trial but in the end Clara and Robert are married. The film is accurate and not highly dramatized or romanticized far from the truth. Filmed in Germany Austria and France the film follows the career of Schumann quite truthfully  i.e the fact he was injured and his fingers were paralized and even as such played the piano quite well his publication of a music magazine under the pen names of Eusebius and Florestan. Eusebius is his practical balanced side while Florestan is passionate and freespirited. A beautiful film. Natassia Kinksi plays a fine Clara strong independent refined romantic soulful. The costumes and attention to detail are precise captivating us and hooking us into a new world of historical romance.My favorite scenes are those romantic moments between Clara and Robert the opening scene with Paganini playing a violin concerto with lightning speed all the chamber music scenes and recitals Clara has and the finale in which finally Clara and Robert have married and decide to open their own concert hall..Robert says I hope this institution is big enough for two instruments and I think he was referring to their marriage. The music is heaven. Conductor Wolgfang Sawallisch leads his orchestra in brilliant music by both Robert Schumann and Clara.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning minor spoiler of sortsSpring Symphony is the story of Robert Schumann and Clara Wieck.  Both were music entities.  Robert Schumann turns out to have been a second tier composer if that never rising to the heights of a Beethoven or Mozart. In contrast Clara Wieck was a master technician in the playing of the piano a composer probably not at Schumann's level and was a child prodigy. Clara is a young girl of eight or nine? when she first encounters Schumann who is a good ten years plus older than her.  Clara's father is her own personal piano teacher who also undertakes the task of training a promising Schumann in the ways of the piano.  Very early on Schumann develops problems with one of his hands that will restrict his ability to ever rise to the level of a successful piano concert player.  Fortunately Schumann has the makings of a composer of sorts.  Clara is enchanted by the older Schumann's compositions and makes it a point to play them while on tour with her father as constant companion and chaperon.  As Clara grows she eventually morphs into Nastassja Kinski and the stage is set for a struggle between her father and Schumann for her love loyalty and attention.  Schumann wants to marry her while her father considers him to be a third rate musician who wants to capitalize on Clara's piano skills to support him.  Of course her father is making a nice living with Clara's performances throughout Europe.  Clara is underage and needs her father's permission to marry Schumann.  This culminates in an actual lawsuit to free her from her father.  The movie ends with their marriage and Schumann's first symphony Spring Symphony.  The movie is historically accurate as far as it goes.Spring Symphony was a movie for Nastassja Kinski that was in between Cat People and Exposed  at least in terms of its release date.  With Nastassja in long hair it is possible that Spring Symphony was filmed either before or after Cat People.  The real life Clara Wieck was an attractive woman so that Nastassja in her role was not out of line.  The Spring Symphony DVD is in German with English subtitles.  The film is well paced and never seems to drag.  Nastassja appears to be more than competent at the keyboard and must have spent many hours practicing.  Perhaps this film is her tribute to Ingrid Bergman in Intermezzo.".

It isn't just that Schumann who looks a good 10 years older than Clara Wieck is the more unlikeable since he is always blaming his inability to compose on his poor financial position and his love of Clara doesn't stop him from regular infidelities. There's also the queasy incestuous behaviour between the Wiecks actor Herbert Gronemeyer who plays Schumann's facial resemblance to Nastassja Kinski's she plays Clara real life father Klaus and Schumann being a student of Mr Wieck so adopting a fatherson relationship. History tells us of the outcome but we also get the suggestion that Clara's marriage also means the subjugation of her identity to her husband's. We are told that she became the greatest exponent of Schumann's music but this sounds like a compromise for someone who could have been the greatest pianist of all time. Hirschmeier's screenplay is full of corny melodrama such as How will this all end? Just think how many great musicians have come before you If you want my life it is yours for the asking I want to melt in your music I was struck by a moonbeam and the inevitable classical music comparison spoken by Schumann   Bach has the heaviness Mozart the lightness Beethoven the warmth and Schubert the darkness. What do you have? The nothingness. I have the infinity of nothingness which is greater than all things together. There is also the odd use of house arrest described for what we know refer to as a child being grounded. Hirschmeier provides a montage of posters for Clara's concerts a cut from news of Schumann's inability to marry another female to Clara's performance triumph a scene where the blind touch Kinski's hands and a sound edit from orchestral musicians tapping to horses hooves of a moving carriage. Although this biopic may spare us the  Hollywoodised cliches of composer biopics where the music is an extension of the artist's life the treatment here is perhaps too reverential. As Wieck senior Rolf Hoppe makes someone that could have been played as a villian some nice touches with Hoppe and Kinski being a more dynamic team than Kinski and Gronemeyer. There is one scene where Kinski sits in Hoppe's lap and we watch the perverse testing of where she will allow his hands to go in spite of his own humiliation. Kinski captures the transformation of Clara from gawky teenager to emerging beauty and whilst there is one shot where we see her hands and body playing the piano otherwise there is no pretence made that she is performing Clara's pieces.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frhlingssinfonie or Spring Symphony is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1983. It was written and directed by Peter Schamoni and is among the filmmaker's most known works. The cast includes a couple big names too such as Nastassja Kinski Herbert Grnemeyer and Rolf Hoppe. This 105minute movie is one of the defining films of Kinski's daughter's career as she won her only German Film award for her portrayal of Clara Wieck here the partner of famous composer Robert Schumann played by Grnemeyer. The good thing I can say about Kinski's performance here is that it is possibly the best thing about the film and she is certainly much much better than the limited Grnemeyer. But as the film is nothing special neither is Kinski's performance and this film award honor may have been a bit too much. I also cannot say that this movie got me curious about Schumann or Wieck and what their lives were like. It felt like a very bleak sterile film and all the parts when Schamoni tried to make an emotional impact I must say didn't do a lot for me. So like I already wrote in the title of my review I felt that this became a pretty forgettable watch. Maybe you need to be a big lover of either classical music or of Schumann in particular to enjoy the watch here but I just could not take it seriously in the face of Grnemeyer extremely weak portrayal and choosing the path of music may have been the best thing he could have done. I do not recommend the watch. Thumbs down.".

The good thing I can say about Kinski's performance here is that it is possibly the best thing about the film and she is certainly much much better than the limited Grnemeyer. But as the film is nothing special neither is Kinski's performance and this film award honor may have been a bit too much. I also cannot say that this movie got me curious about Schumann or Wieck and what their lives were like. It felt like a very bleak sterile film and all the parts when Schamoni tried to make an emotional impact I must say didn't do a lot for me. So like I already wrote in the title of my review I felt that this became a pretty forgettable watch. Maybe you need to be a big lover of either classical music or of Schumann in particular to enjoy the watch here but I just could not take it seriously in the face of Grnemeyer extremely weak portrayal and choosing the path of music may have been the best thing he could have done. I do not recommend the watch. Thumbs down.";

Nina happens to meet Toni played by Sabine Timoteo a twentysomething woman who is a drifter. Nina wants to help her in any way she possibly can which is not much. In a parallel story line we get to know a French couple the wife of which seems a very troubled woman who is looking for a young lady whom she thinks is her longlost daughter. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments this movie is written and directed by Christian Petzold one of Europe's top directors in my humble opinion. Some of his other works include 2000's The State I'm In also starring Julia Hummer 2007's Yella and the excellent political thriller Barbara from 2012. I'll go see anything from this guy. Second even though Amazon lists this as a 2009 release it really was released in 2005. Third as already mentioned Julia Hummer reappears in a Petzold film. Here she is pushing her age limit she is 25 in real life playing a 16 or 17 yr old but it doesn't take away from the immense talent that she is. She would appear also in Petzold's Carlos TV miniseries. Fourth the movie does a great job setting up the various characters and is not afraid to let you wonder for quite some time as to how all the pieces fit together. A movie that challenges the mind what a concept! Iron Man 3 this ain't. At just 85 min. this movie flew by in no time and at the end of it I didn't want to say goodbye to these characters. What better compliment can you give a movie? Bottom line if you are in the mood for a topnotch foreign movie that challenges your mind and lets you do some of the mental work yourself you cannot go wrong with this. Ghosts is another great film from German director Christian Petzold that begs to be seen. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!".

Since then the mother keeps traveling to Berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches by aid of timedilated photography for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age. As we hear later in the movie the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter Marie. However this time when she meets Nina everything comes quite different.The movie does not bring solutions not even partsolutions and insofar it is rather disappointing. We are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not if her actual daughter is still alive or not. Most disappointing is the end. After what we have witnessed in the movie it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves Nina alone. The simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed can be a strong effect of dramaturgy f.ex. in Umberto D. but in Gespenster it is displaced.Since critics have been suggesting Freudian motives in this movie let me give my own attempt Why is it that similar persons do not know one another especially not the persons that another similar person knows? This is quite an insane question agreed from the standpoint of Aristotelian logic according to which the notion of the individual holds. The individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else. So the Aristotelian answer to my question is They do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change. Everybody who is not insane believes that. However what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change e.g. scarfs on their left under ankle or a heartshaped birthmark under their right shoulderblade? This is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made although I am not sure whether even the director has realized that. Despite our modern Aristotelian world the superstition conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality and that individuality therefore is not something erratic but rather diffusional so that the borders between persons are open such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrationalism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking  a source of Gespenster of the most interesting kind.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gespenster is a German movie from over 10 years ago written and directed by Christian Petzold one of Germany's most known filmmakers these days. Today he is mostly known for his collaborations with Nina Hoss but she does not appear in this one here. Benno Frmann however does and you could call him Petzold's muse back then as he also appeared in many of his works. Here however Frmann's role is fairly small which is fine for me as I am not the greatest fan of him as an actor. The screenplay is also by Petzold in collaboration with the late Harun Farocki an author Petzold worked with on many occasions. So there are some familiar factors in this work. This does not really apply though to the lead actresses I believe. Julia Hummer plays the main character and the colead is Sabine Timoteo. And their chemistry is pretty good which is one reason why I enjoyed the watch. But the main reason is Julia Hummer's quietly convincing turn as a young woman looking to be loved first by another girl then by a woman who appears to be her mother.And Hummer really does an outstanding job and she delivers all one can ask for in terms of how the character was written. Speaking about writing Petzold and Farocki did a good job here too. The characters all seem realistic in my opinion and their interactions make totally sense. One of Petzold's big strengths is always that his character have great shades. They are all flawed but do not tend to one side good or bad too much but still many director attempt that and succeed but then it seems just for the sake of it. However here it feels really raw and spoton and this makes me happy. The only aspect I did not like here was the plot twist at the very end which seemed slightly unrealistic to me. I wish they could have kept the approach they gave the film all the time before that. No need to go out on a shocking note. I do prefer realistic endings over happy endings if these happy endings seem nonsensical and forced but here an actual motherdaughter reunion would have been the best way to close it I think. This is maybe also the reason why I gave it only a  and not a . I was pretty close to the higher rating. But this does not change my overall recommendation for Ghosts. This was a good watch and Hummer's performance alone makes it truly worth the watch. It makes me kinda sad that she has faded pretty much completely out of the spotlight a decade later. But at least we have the greatness she left us here. Go watch it.".

I do prefer realistic endings over happy endings if these happy endings seem nonsensical and forced but here an actual motherdaughter reunion would have been the best way to close it I think. This is maybe also the reason why I gave it only a  and not a . I was pretty close to the higher rating. But this does not change my overall recommendation for Ghosts. This was a good watch and Hummer's performance alone makes it truly worth the watch. It makes me kinda sad that she has faded pretty much completely out of the spotlight a decade later. But at least we have the greatness she left us here. Go watch it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Bitchslap is a young unpretentious movie no big names no big budget. It has a story to tell which involves six lovely breasts and it tells its story with tightly focused exuberance excitement and a certain sense of wonder. There's none of that old Hollywood cynicism no gratuitous manipulation of the viewer no wandering no missteps. We're promised three lovely ladies who alternately fondle or beat the daylight out of each other and every passing male and we get that. In loving slow motion with dramatic explosions bullets and music gallons of water blood and gasoline and dialog that takes cinematic intellectualism out into the back yard and beats it to a pulp with a heavy shovel.You can watch any movie on many levels. Don't go into this one expecting a complex plot deep characterization or philosophical questions. It's a cartoon based around breasts that does not demean women.

	onyx:emotionText "Bitchslap is a young unpretentious movie no big names no big budget. It has a story to tell which involves six lovely breasts and it tells its story with tightly focused exuberance excitement and a certain sense of wonder. There's none of that old Hollywood cynicism no gratuitous manipulation of the viewer no wandering no missteps. We're promised three lovely ladies who alternately fondle or beat the daylight out of each other and every passing male and we get that. In loving slow motion with dramatic explosions bullets and music gallons of water blood and gasoline and dialog that takes cinematic intellectualism out into the back yard and beats it to a pulp with a heavy shovel.You can watch any movie on many levels. Don't go into this one expecting a complex plot deep characterization or philosophical questions. It's a cartoon based around breasts that does not demean women. This by itself should satisfy many of us. However it is an intellectual movie in some ways especially in its treatment of gender.The tight focus and almost perfect presentation makes me think the team behind this really enjoyed making the movie and will give us more of the same probably more sophisticated and ambitious in the future.";

	schema:headline " Russ Meyer inspired throwback is high on creative grindhouse style but falls short on earning cult status...";
	schema:reviewBody "Rick Jacobson's Bitch Slap is not for everyone. With it's offthewall violent action campy humor emphasis on Sexploitation and grindhouse styled look it seems to want to cater to the film schoolBMovie fanatics and Tarantino devotees but unfortunately with its loopy story and inyourface attitude may not win over an increasingly jaded audience already having already seen Sin City Crank and Smokin' Aces.Clearly Bitch Slap is Jacobson's tribute to Russ Meyer whose raunchy but fun trash cinema of the 60's and 70's films such as Beyond The Valley of the Dolls and Super Vixens inspired a generation of cult movie directors and films. Bitch Slap is a homage in particular to Meyer's cult classic Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! Kill! a personal favorite and even has scenes from Pussycat... in the fun opening visual montage which also references other sexploitation films and icons of the 60s and 70s like Betty Page Bonnie  Clyde They Call Her One Eye Pam Grier and others. It definitely sets the viewer up for what to expect  beautiful womensaucy dialog teasing sex and mindless fun.The story seems simple enough  three gorgeous buxom but desperate women attempt to retrieve a cache of stolen diamonds worth millions from a corrupt cop but soon find themselves involved with more they bargained for when they find out it now belongs to a legendary faceless and ruthless criminal mastermind known only as Pinky. The three lead characters have pretty interesting pasts to be sure Hel Erin Cummings is a classy con artist and thief who in actuality is Foxy 69 a secret agent in the style of James Bond or more appropriately Raquel Welch's Fathom Harvill from Fanthom her partners in crime are CamerroAmerica Olivio an outofcontrol badass blondie who becomes increasingly unhinged throughout the course of the film and sweetfaced Trixie the stunning Julia Voth who has a body to die for and whose naive and innocent personality seems too good to be true. As movie clichs go not only are these girls wellversed in guns and martial arts but they are also horny lesbians any male movie goers dream. Eric Gruendemann and Rick Jacobson's story borrows a lot from Bryan SingerChristopher McQuarrie's brilliant The Usual Suspects but unfortunately the Keyser Soze type reveal seems a bit too much and as the movie unfolds the details of the whole story told in annoying flashbacks the story becomes increasingly outlandish and unbelievable. Even the ending which goes for a M. Night Shyamalan Unbreakable shock seems contrived and forced.I must admit however that Jacobson's inventive stylish and hyperactive directive style is pretty enjoyable. Jacobson who TV fans may know from his work on such campy shows like Cleaopatra 2525 She Spies Xena Warrior Princess and Hercules The Legendary Journeys brings a very Japanese anime geek culture vibe to the film. It's nothing new considering all the legions of Tarantinowannabe directors trying to cash in on the MTV video method of movie making but it definitely works here. The dialog tries to replicate the edgy style of a Diablo Cody and Tarantino but also misses the mark.The three lead actresses are definitely hot and really entice the audience with their beauty. Erin Cummings is great as the cool and classy babe Hel AKA Foxy 69. She has a certain look similar to Desperate Housewive's Marsha Cross and her character is the most likable of the trio. America Olivio is a bit too overthetop as hellcat Camerro. As the name suggests she is just out of control with all engines going throughout the film. She's like Tura Satana in Pussycat... but a lot more prettier and much more sinister. Her fight scenes with Hel are utterly brutal and even in slow motion are very raw. Those expecting an atypical catfight will be pleasantly surprised by the manoamano no holds barred fight expertly choreographed by in demand stunt woman Zoe Bell.Julia Voth looks like a Victoria Secret's model and is absolutely ravishingly in the film. Unfortunately like similar beauty Megan Fox her acting leaves much to be desired and hopefully with more films she'll get better.The supporting cast does try their best to add to the mayhem with varying degrees of success. Michael Hurst Power Rangers Ninja Storm makes for an effective atypical AussieEnglish bad guy. Ron Melendez General Hospital is your standard nice guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. William Gregory Lee Dante's Cove is absolutely annoying as a crazed wacko gangster called Hot Wire. I liked cute Minae Noji General Hospital as sailorsuited Japanese Harajiku Girl assassin Nicki who seems like Kill Bill Vol. 1's GoGo Yubari and who wields a yoyo weapon in homage to the Japanese TV Drama Sukeban Deka. She could be a member of Japanese girl group AKB48 with her Akihaba inspired costume. Even Hercules star Kevin Sorbo makes an appearance as Hel's handler Mr. Phoenix.Bitch Slap is definitely a fun film and despite its many flaws is entertaining in a campy way. Some may find the frequent use of CGI backgrounds a bit distracting similar to Sin City and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow but I found it bearable. While I don't think it will be either a box office hit or a cult movie candidate in years to come it is still worth watching if you are a fan of Russ Meyer and the sexploitation films of the 70s. It may not be no better than a Vivid Porn release but I think its style is still pretty good.".

There's NO NUDITY in this film to speak of despite the fact that it's exactly what the box promises. Yes three hot vixens in an exploitation movie and none of them get naked. There are hotter sex scenes in the 10 pm network TV slot. How does a director fail this badly? And the unrated label was just another ploy to let the viewer think they're getting something edgy. Either that or the money man saw how bad the film is and wouldn't pony up a few grand more for an MPAA rating. If there was a filmmaker jail Jacobson would be on death row. Shameful.".

Rick Jacobsen fortunately understood that exploitation movies should LACK quality and abound in cheap tricks to score effect. Lots of directors have tried to give their version of the sobadit'sgood movie but it all depends on careful dosage to make it quality bad and fun without feeling artificial Mars Attacks is a rare example. Bitch Slap however strikes exactly the right tone.Just grab your checklists Beautiful babes with big breasts and lots of cleavage shot in slowmo? Check. Pretentiously artistic cinematography i.e. royal use of splitscreen and funky scene transitions? Double check. Cheesy dialog and superfluous profanity? Present! Bad acting? Yup at least I hope it was Julia Voth's best attempt at INTENTIONAL bad acting. But hey she did a voice on the Resident Evil Remake video game so she knows her material! Hilarious continuity errors? Oh yes. Gratuitous violence and excessive gore? Thank God yes! Bad special FX? Oh my it's like an Uwe Bolldirected Sin City in some scenes. There is lots of questionable stuff in this movie to go a long way but Jacobsen adds some extra layers of bad taste assuring this movie never runs out of fuel for the entire 109 minute run. There's a series of very obvious homages to Tarantino's magnum opus of cult Bmovies Asian school girl with lethal chain contraption Samurai sword need I say more?. Another is a flashback structure that keeps adding hilariously contrived and increasingly illogical plot twists to the story making excellent use of the audience's general inability to take a movie seriously after a surplus of twists. This movie isn't just Bad it is Bad on whole new levels of ingenuity!The low rating for this movie versus the relatively high number of positive reviews here on IMDb suggest that this movie has serious cult potential. I wouldn't be surprised if it finds its audience in the end just like Office Space and Showgirls once did.Yes this is a bad movie. 109 minutes of sheer enjoyment! And I wouldn't even call it guilty pleasure that's when someone makes something bad in the supposition that he was actually making something qualitatively good and we enjoy it for this obvious lack of selfconsciousness. The makers of Bitch Slap clearly used every bit of talent and every trick in the book to make something qualitatively bad but Bad in its most artistic way possible. Like a carpenter deliberately looking for flotsam and scrap wood in order to make a very kitschy cabinet that you would actually pay for since it is so deliberately ugly. A rare treat.".

The problem there is that while it is enjoyable enough it's not entirely satisfying. Yeah it does come across as a wish fulfilment fantasy for horny guys everywhere and is basically silly over the top attitude driven highly stylized perhaps TOO stylized violent leering exploitation fare meant to be an ode to the kind of tough movie gals whom we see in clips during the opening credits. But unfortunately it doesn't really go far enough it's likely not depraved enough or just not exploitative enough to suit some of its audience For one thing while there is sex there just ain't that much nudity folks.. The story such as it is features three stunning young ladies united in their scheme to get their hands on some jewels being held by an underworld figure. They often spend as much time fighting with each other as they do working towards their goal. The review written by one of my associates at this web site is right on the money when describing this movie as an almost 110 minute long cat fight. The ladies are also commendably enough shot from lots of fetishistic angles and it does indeed seem as if the filmmakers would rather focus exclusively on the breasts of the actresses instead of their faces. The dialogue is often hilarious yet has an obvious selfconscious air about it the writers are trying too hard to come up with what they clearly believe to be instantly quotable raunchy lines. It also takes a cue from Pulp Fiction as it constantly moves back and forth in time in order to create a series of events that the viewer has to put in the right order to understand just where all of these characters are coming from. The soundtrack is loud and so is the volume on a lot of the performers. One of the big twists in the end is probably something most people could figure out. The actors while not necessarily all good are fun. Erin Cummings is Hel the smart one  mastermind America Olivo chewing the scenery and then throwing it up again the pill popping wildcat Camero and Julia Voth is Trixie the nice one. Cameos include TV stars Kevin Sorbo Lucy Lawless Renee O'Connor and Michael Hurst as well as stunt coordinator Zoe Bell who'd shot to fame in Tarantino's Death Proof. At the least Bitch Slap does have enough crazy energy to keep it from ever getting what I would consider boring. It does have its moments. Six out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will rate this movie a two. One star given because the audio works and one allocated because the screen footage operates alright. Apart from that there really isn't much else to this movie. There is no clever plot I think the complete bad storyline of this movie must have been thought up within a whole 5 minutes. This movie is solid evidence that it doesn't take much to be a successful movie scriptwriter. There are no lovable or dynamic characters whom the viewer is able to connect with instead just boring airhead characters who provide little more than a mere chuckle. You can toss away any expectations of a deep and meaningful message as this movie lacks that completely. Any belief of strong female characters which appear in this movie is completely fictional.

Apart from that there really isn't much else to this movie. There is no clever plot I think the complete bad storyline of this movie must have been thought up within a whole 5 minutes. This movie is solid evidence that it doesn't take much to be a successful movie scriptwriter. There are no lovable or dynamic characters whom the viewer is able to connect with instead just boring airhead characters who provide little more than a mere chuckle. You can toss away any expectations of a deep and meaningful message as this movie lacks that completely. Any belief of strong female characters which appear in this movie is completely fictional.

It runs for slightly under 90 minutes and this already includes the credits so it is not a long film by any means. The title already gives away that this is a sequel to a pretty successful 2001 movie. However when I say successful I only mean audience numbers I guess because qualitywise this first film was a huge mess and sadly this one isn't much better if at all. Austrian writer and director Peter Gersina took over from Dennis Gansel and several actors also returned including two of the three leading ladies plus Riemelt for example even if he does not have that much screen time really. This film is once again about the romantic misadventures of the three female protagonists. What can I say. Amft proves once again what a limited actress she is. Herfurth is certainly better but she cannot turn water into wine either when it comes to the script and Gerat who took over for Woll is not lead actress material either and clearly hurt by the possibly worst story line of the entire film. Nice try implying that we know at around minute 60 who the real Sebastian is. Let me tell you guys that any nonretarded audience member already knew the first time he came on screen. The cast here makes it easy to understand why only Herfurth from these actresses is still having a strong career as of today actually even as a filmmaker now apparently even if her first full feature was not exactly a success either in terms of the quality but we talked about that one on another occasion. However as for the male cast in here it is certainly a bit baffling that there are names in it that have really worked their way up in German film not just Riemelt but also Fitz Verhoeven and von Thun. Good for them. You probably wouldn't expect it seeing the quality of this film we have here. So yeah all in all it is a ridiculously embarrassing film and that's especially disappointing because the search for the right apartment also referenced in the German alternate title is a subject that could have resulted in a much better film because it is still such a current subject. But they sure found a way to mess this one up and the quantity of writers is truly shocking because if not one of them saw all the flaws with this movie and tried to correct them then all hope is lost. But perhaps it is also the audiences who are really the ones to blame. I myself am not only glad that they did not make a third film but actually this second film if not the first was already one too many. Realism wit and even funny comedy are contents that you will not find in this duology. Stay far far away.".

The annoying teenage idiots in the movie make you want to hate them and cheer for the killer hunting them down near the end.The ending? In one word dumb. Why is it that every movie these days has to have some lame Sixth Sense shocker ending that makes little sense. It seems to be the trend these days and it's getting old.Conclusion I give it a 5 out of 10. This is worth a single viewing for fans of the genre.

This German slasher tries very hard to be stylish looking in a gallic way but seldom succeeds. The look is distinctly like a German TVmovie with harsh lighting in the night scenes and a rather flat look in the daytime scenes. The plot however is very giallo with twists and turns. The screenwriters really try to fool the viewer but since everything is telegraphed in advance in different ways I was rarely surprised and saw the outcome miles away in advance. Also hurtful is the way the characters are presented. We can feel no sympathy for these young spoiled brats as they meet their bloody ends. The awful dubbing on the DVD I saw was also a big drawback. At best it's amusing for the most part it's irritating. However everything is not bad. The scenery is awesome we get some nice killings with a sickle and Elke Sommer does a quite nice turn as the stern housekeeper it would have been nice if she had been the villain of this movie but alas... still looking quite good for her age.This movie also contains quite a few comedic scenes rarely found in American or Italian slashers. They mostly involve some bumbling cops and if you like that or not is a matter of taste. Quite a few scenes border on farce actually even a few bloody ones. Especially as they are accompanied by some really strange and inappropriate music.So Flashback is a decent time waster but I wouldn't pay too much to see it.".

Being in an mental house since that night her doctor convinces her she is cured and sends her up into the German mountains where she is to tutor three teenagers Leon Melissa Lissy in French. Still haunted by the murder of her parents Jeanette starts to believe that the murdered is after her when strange things start to happen... I won't ruin the ending or anything else.This entertaining thriller leaves you guessing what will happen till the end. It did for me and I actually thought that out of all the things that happened in the movie it wouldn't have turned out the way it did. One thing if you get scared easily do not watch this in the dark! I did. It's not so much the murder scenes but more or less the fact that the suspense and music got to me. Get sceneries effects plot cast and direction. All round 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "A woman spends 10 years in a mental institute after witnessing her parents' when she was a child being viciously murdered by a crazed man with a sickle and who's wearing a dress. After a whole lot of therapy her psychiatrist releases her and he gets her a job as a French tutor for some teenagers who are living in a lonely house in the Alps. Though things aren't that peaceful as she finds out the past might be coming back to haunt her? Germany's crack at the slasher market after the allpopular Scream which started up the trend isn't anything special but it was fairly well made and enjoyable viewing. The look of it is rather glossy and the atmosphere is very imposing. The story doesn't really make that much sense but it gives you what you expect from a slasher film. By sticking to the usual slasher formula with clichs aplenty high body count sex crazed teenagers and a very routine story. You can see the influences and homage's towards other slashers such as Halloween Scream Dress to kill I Know What You Did Last Summer and Black Christmas throughout the film. It's filled with rather explicit violence and a special warning to pet lovers as there are couple of graphic scenes towards dogs and a cat. Even the film gives us the usual opening death sequence to wet our appetite. You could say the two horny teenagers who got slashed to death on the train was rather pointless but what do you expect in a film like this.What made this film standout from the normal slashers was the morbid and incredibly gloomy atmosphere that was created. Very atmospheric during the night sequences with swirling mist and open grass fields. There was such an alienating feel because of the isolation of the surroundings. Eerie sound effects and visuals added to the uneasy element too. The elegantly lush scenery that surrounded the countryside estate was simply breathtaking and a tremendous sight to see. The setting is the real high point and you can add Elke Sommer's cameo too. The other performances were fair if overthetop but Elke Sommer's as a uptight housekeeper and Valerie Niehaus as the girl coming to grips with her past Jeanette Fielmann excel in their roles.The cinematography is crisp and rather slickly done. With inventive and well established camerawork. There's the usual killers POV and don't forget the heavy breathing to go along with it. There are some wellstaged death scenes with a lot of blood and spitefulness and some fairly creepy moments like figures lurking in the shadows. It totally goes for shocks and scenes that try to make you jump. The soundtrack was a real mixed bag from Goth to rock to real cheesy romantic music. The direction is rather standard and keeps a solid pace throughout.The tone and elements of the plot reminded me of Scream and a little of Halloween and Dress to kill.

	onyx:emotionText "A woman spends 10 years in a mental institute after witnessing her parents' when she was a child being viciously murdered by a crazed man with a sickle and who's wearing a dress. After a whole lot of therapy her psychiatrist releases her and he gets her a job as a French tutor for some teenagers who are living in a lonely house in the Alps. Though things aren't that peaceful as she finds out the past might be coming back to haunt her? Germany's crack at the slasher market after the allpopular Scream which started up the trend isn't anything special but it was fairly well made and enjoyable viewing. The look of it is rather glossy and the atmosphere is very imposing. The story doesn't really make that much sense but it gives you what you expect from a slasher film. By sticking to the usual slasher formula with clichs aplenty high body count sex crazed teenagers and a very routine story. You can see the influences and homage's towards other slashers such as Halloween Scream Dress to kill I Know What You Did Last Summer and Black Christmas throughout the film. It's filled with rather explicit violence and a special warning to pet lovers as there are couple of graphic scenes towards dogs and a cat. Even the film gives us the usual opening death sequence to wet our appetite. You could say the two horny teenagers who got slashed to death on the train was rather pointless but what do you expect in a film like this.What made this film standout from the normal slashers was the morbid and incredibly gloomy atmosphere that was created. Very atmospheric during the night sequences with swirling mist and open grass fields. There was such an alienating feel because of the isolation of the surroundings. Eerie sound effects and visuals added to the uneasy element too. The elegantly lush scenery that surrounded the countryside estate was simply breathtaking and a tremendous sight to see. The setting is the real high point and you can add Elke Sommer's cameo too. The other performances were fair if overthetop but Elke Sommer's as a uptight housekeeper and Valerie Niehaus as the girl coming to grips with her past Jeanette Fielmann excel in their roles.The cinematography is crisp and rather slickly done. With inventive and well established camerawork. There's the usual killers POV and don't forget the heavy breathing to go along with it. There are some wellstaged death scenes with a lot of blood and spitefulness and some fairly creepy moments like figures lurking in the shadows. It totally goes for shocks and scenes that try to make you jump. The soundtrack was a real mixed bag from Goth to rock to real cheesy romantic music. The direction is rather standard and keeps a solid pace throughout.The tone and elements of the plot reminded me of Scream and a little of Halloween and Dress to kill. The plot is filled with the usual hidden secrets rowdy teens and a party some added black humour a cheesy romance investigating strange occurrences some deaths lacking meaning moments of is she imagining or is it for real and a stunning revelation.

	schema:reviewBody "Flashback  Mrderische Ferien or Murderous Vacation or just Flashback is a German mostly Germanlanguage film from 2000 so not that long anymore until it has its 20th anniversary soon. For director Karen and writer Scharf it is a contender for most known work for sure and the cowriter is Jimmy Sangster and this film was a bit of a comeback for him and also his very final work.The cast includes many names and faces that German film buffs will recognize. Of course there is the soap opera category of attractive actresses like Hanselmann Deyle Niehaus Neldel and Harder probably more that I don't know in here sounds almost like a GZSZ recycling bin but also people like Buck Sommer who have worked on wellreceived films actually. The good thing about these 1.5 hours here is that the film never really takes itself seriously the bad thing is that a great deal of the comedy is not working at all and this especially refers to Neldel's sex references. She may not be a particularly great actress gentlyspeaking but it is a shame to what she is reduced to in here.Anyway here and there there is a good moment. I liked for example the plot twist who the killer was but then they also went badly over the top on some occasions like also at the very end with another twist involving Buck and especially Hanselmann's character. Yes this film has a great deal of Scream to it not just because of how the victims are killed but also for example the very first scene in the train and there are also moments in here that reminded me of the Scary Movie series. As a whole I would still say that the positive was less frequent than the weaknegative and the film's lows were certainly lower than the film's highs were high. Also with the exception of 34 scenes and moments perhaps like I wrote before the movie also lacks originality in my opinion. A bit of a shame as the potential was there. Not a failure by any means but also it is not on a level where I would recommend it. Thumbsdown overall. Don't watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first German try to make a commercial horror film was Anatomie. It was very successful at the cinemas over 2 million visitors I think... but at least this movie was a disappointment there was too much talk and less suspense in it. I always had the feeling that it was much more suited for television then for the big screen. Some months later they released Flashback and my expectations were not too high. I finally saw it on video and I must say that its better then his predecessor. Flashback is according much more to its American examples like Friday the 13th Scream or I know what you did last summer... its a simple slasher movie were the protagonists get killed in order of disappearance. The most positive aspect is that this film doesnt take itself too serious. The scene with the dead body in the cable car for example is a plain sideswipe against the yellow press. Otherwise Flashback contains more action and suspense then Anatomie because its not trying so hard to tell a difficult or demanding... story. The film goes straight forward and there are also many gory scenes so Im sure that all splatter fans will really like this one. The script author seems to have a sense for very dark humor because the body count is very high and there are also some innocent little pets dying ...what an animal lover like me naturally cant tolerate! Grrr..!!!. Fortunately the end is pretty surprising and macabre. Its like the one in Scream something you really wouldnt expect... Finally I left this film with the good feeling that the Germans are able to make good horror films yet. Watch out for the up coming The Experiment starring Moritz Bleibtreu which also got a lot of good reviews..! My IMDb rating for Flashback 8 out of 10 points.".

But this movie isnt one of those movies for teens from 12 to 16 years. You must be 18 to see this movie. Well its hard in Germany to get an 18 rating remember Sleepy Hollow was for children at the age of 12. The movie starts 15 years in the past. A little girl saw the deaths of her parents. A person in womenclothes killed her parents with a sickle. After that experience she went directly to a psycho medical care. Now in this summer she has to teach teenies french. The problem is the teens live in the mountains far from other neighbours and the killer with the sickle is right there. Looks like a normal slashermovie yeah and its like that but who cares ? There are some bloody scenes have you ever seen a sickle in a dick? and the atmosphere is very scary. The acting is sometimes silly but what are you expecting ? The actors are from local soapoperas... Finally I think you should watch the movie if you are into this genre. My girlfriend wasnt so happy about that movie but I enjoyed it. I think 8 of 10 but I like those silly slashermovies even Ive seen this hundred times before.".

And yes it plays its drama out amidst a seedy German underworldHowever what transpires amidst this spectacularly visualized tapestry full of rave parties torture chambers skin rooms and body modification cliques willing to sell the tattoos off their body for quick cash  is vastly different in tone and theme from Fincher's 'who done it and why' police procedural.  Here the characters are not shown as black and white but rather in shades of gray.  Their lives their dilemmas are the real story. Even the reasons for the killings are presented in such a way that makes you understand if not empathize with those that a standard Hollywood picture would casually demonize.  This element of moral ambiguity under the remarkably controlled direction of Schwentke creates a dark cold and subtly stylized world that surprisingly plays as very very real.It is encouraging to see a European film with the refined sensibility of European cinema combined so adeptly with a genre so intrinsically American. It is also hard to believe that this is Schwentke's directorial debut.  I for one will keep my eye on him.It's a remarkable film and I certainly hope it blows the doors open for other genre films shot in Germany and in Europe as a whole.  Not since viewing Spoorloos The Vanishing have I been so impressed.  If you have a chance don't hesitate to catch it on the big screen. It's gorgeous it's ballsy and it's worth it.".

August Diehl plays the young cop who is blackmailed into joining Christian Redl on the grittier side of police work. Diehl's first case is the murder of a young woman who was into selfmutilation and who died shortly after biting off a man's finger...and swallowing it. The beautiful Nadeshda Brennicke plays Maya Kroner whose secrets take the story in an exciting and unpredictable direction.While the subject of people being murdered for their tattoos is not new Roald Dahl's shortstory Skin covers the same ground the film's plot is gripping and effectively told.After viewing this film shortly after Antikrper and Kontroll it would appear that some of the best psychological horror films of the noughties are coming out of Europe.

It is a dark and disturbing little thriller that isn't particularly happy. Very well made and well acted the film is a bit too much form over substance at times with its dark brooding passages and very deliberate set design. Its not bad but it kind of lessons the thrills since the film seems at times more intent on looking good. It also doesn't help that the who of the who done it is a bit too clear.

The problem is that an audience familiar with the serial killer genre will likely find Tattoo very predictable and the script takes a few annoying shortcuts.  For instance it's painfully obvious very early in the film who is likely behind the murders but the police never even seem to consider this person a suspect in spite of the fact that she's an art dealer and knows a hell of a lot about tattoo art which is not the normal area of expertise for gallery owners.  If that's not suspicious enough she first turns up at the apartment of one of the victims shortly after the murder even though she claims not to have spoken to her former friend in years.  Amazingly the police never treat her as a suspect or even bother to check out her story about the death of a famous tattoo artist in New York until the very end of the film.  Tattoo borrows heavily from two much better serial killer moviesSeven and the Korean flick Tell Me Something which managed to not telegraph its surprise ending in the first twenty minutes and not make its protagonist cop look like a complete idiot for failing to figure out who the real murderer was. Still Tattoo is a watchable enough example of the genre if you're in the mood for a serial killer movie.  Just don't expect too much.".

August Diehl is brilliant as usual Christian Redl as the depressive detective Minks is absolutely convincing. The plot leaves some things unanswered which is quite irritating but not to consider as an actual flaw. Some characters remind me of some of Lynch's disturbing mysterious figures. Schwentke tries to give the film an extra layer via images with which he mostly succeeds. The film quotes Silence of the Lambs and Se7en but this does not subtract from it's originality.

	schema:reviewBody "Tattoo is the first feature film from writer and director Robert Schwentke. When it came out in 2002 August Diehl was huge rising star in Germany. I actually like him but as the film progressed I felt it was really much more about the actor in the center of the movie then about a good story. I did not like the path they took with the tattoos and the story behind the murders. I wish it would just have been one singleacting sociopath who turns out as a ritual murderer.Apart from that it has to be mentioned that Redl's and Diehl's character are almost equal at the beginning of the film but it all switches much more towards Diehl. the way Redl's character was written out of the film was particularly disappointing with how much focus was on him early on. All we find out about his family history was just means to have Diehl's character meet his daughter later on. He turned from a lead into a completely pointless character in roughly 90 minutes. I found myself thinking that Diehl could be the killer or that Redl could be the killer during the film. I was wrong both times. With Redl as the killer it may have been a mixture of Training Day and Collateral. Anyway things take a turn for the worse when that one guy kills himself with Diehl's weapon. That scene was maybe the most cringeworthy moment of the entire movie and I felt that they completely sacrificed a credible script for just random showy action scenes at this point. And the whole copwitness attraction between Diehl's and Krebitz' characters was too clich for my taste too. And finally the transformation from a weakling almost into a badass cop from Diehl's character did not feel really credible either.The first half of the film is solid the second half is considerably weaker. As a whole I would not recommend this film. I wish they would have kept both protagonists in the center of the story. I quite like August Diehl as an actor but that script was just too much centered around him. Also the film lost a bit credibility when almost everybody is suddenly tattooed like Krebitz' character or also Diehl at the very end.".

	schema:headline " Schwentke's business card for Hollywood";
	schema:reviewBody "A young and inexperienced cop in Berlin sheds his innocence when he is drawn into a series of bloody murders commissioned by a mysterious tattoo fetishist. While a rather untypical product of mainstream European cinema this first major effort by director Robert Schwentke is nonetheless a good indicator of where young German filmmakers are heading to. It would seem that most of the local filmschool hipsters have been molded by the same standard principles in story and production design that make for occasional good but alas also a majority of awful Hollywood flicks. This propensity may be best observed in the seminal TV crime series Tatort Scene of the Crime where aspiring cinematographers get a chance to work hands on  Schwentke for his part directed three episodes. Though the cinematic feel and level of professionality of these 90minute small screen pictures have certainly gone up in the past ten or so years you have to be alarmed at how interchangeable and arguably dull they have become. Tattoo is an ambitious Tatort. It is in a way very mature  scarily so. It's all neatly timed the story and plot are textbook the locations wellcasted most likely the only film set in Berlin that does without the usual tourist vistas the travellings elaborate the picture is crafty the soundtrack heavily suggestive etc. But as the French say the mayonnaise doesn't blend. In fact the director's intentions making a gritty Euro urban thriller are as subtle as ripping someone's skin off to get his tattoo. By the way the idea is by no means new  the 1968 French comedy Le Tatou with Jean Gabin and Louis de Funs treated this subject in a far more refined way. Unlike his famous US predecessors Tattoo never hits the right tone and worst of all lacks genuinely creepy moments and an overall tension. They say a person's house is a mirror to his soul... See that's the sort of dialogue along with some fluffy art talk about 17thcentury Japanese tattoo masters that'll strangle any movie to a pathological death. This general impression extends to the actors who desperately try to come to terms with their storyboard characters. Germany's shooting star August Diehl as an unlikely specimen of a new generation of technodancing big city cops delivers a wholly unconvincing performance. Christian Redl is your cynical old school detective with a chip on his shoulder and lacks depth. Nadeshda Brennicke does her best to play a Kraut version of the femme fatale which is obviously far from enough. Well she is half redeemed once she's dropped her skirt. And while all this is still more or less acceptable for a late Saturday night telly flick the end clearly isn't. What happened there? Where was the teacher to get Schwentke to revise his homework? But apart from that glitch let there be no doubt that this German model pupil is off for a great Hollywood career shooting commissioned box office busters by the dozen. Good riddance if you ask me.".

	onyx:emotionText "A young and inexperienced cop in Berlin sheds his innocence when he is drawn into a series of bloody murders commissioned by a mysterious tattoo fetishist. While a rather untypical product of mainstream European cinema this first major effort by director Robert Schwentke is nonetheless a good indicator of where young German filmmakers are heading to. It would seem that most of the local filmschool hipsters have been molded by the same standard principles in story and production design that make for occasional good but alas also a majority of awful Hollywood flicks. This propensity may be best observed in the seminal TV crime series Tatort Scene of the Crime where aspiring cinematographers get a chance to work hands on  Schwentke for his part directed three episodes. Though the cinematic feel and level of professionality of these 90minute small screen pictures have certainly gone up in the past ten or so years you have to be alarmed at how interchangeable and arguably dull they have become. Tattoo is an ambitious Tatort. It is in a way very mature  scarily so. It's all neatly timed the story and plot are textbook the locations wellcasted most likely the only film set in Berlin that does without the usual tourist vistas the travellings elaborate the picture is crafty the soundtrack heavily suggestive etc. But as the French say the mayonnaise doesn't blend. In fact the director's intentions making a gritty Euro urban thriller are as subtle as ripping someone's skin off to get his tattoo. By the way the idea is by no means new  the 1968 French comedy Le Tatou with Jean Gabin and Louis de Funs treated this subject in a far more refined way. Unlike his famous US predecessors Tattoo never hits the right tone and worst of all lacks genuinely creepy moments and an overall tension. They say a person's house is a mirror to his soul... See that's the sort of dialogue along with some fluffy art talk about 17thcentury Japanese tattoo masters that'll strangle any movie to a pathological death. This general impression extends to the actors who desperately try to come to terms with their storyboard characters. Germany's shooting star August Diehl as an unlikely specimen of a new generation of technodancing big city cops delivers a wholly unconvincing performance. Christian Redl is your cynical old school detective with a chip on his shoulder and lacks depth. Nadeshda Brennicke does her best to play a Kraut version of the femme fatale which is obviously far from enough. Well she is half redeemed once she's dropped her skirt. And while all this is still more or less acceptable for a late Saturday night telly flick the end clearly isn't. What happened there? Where was the teacher to get Schwentke to revise his homework? But apart from that glitch let there be no doubt that this German model pupil is off for a great Hollywood career shooting commissioned box office busters by the dozen. Good riddance if you ask me.";

There may be some minor flaws in the storyline including the fact that one can guess quite early who the real antagonist is. But these are well compensated by a dense storyline credible characters and a nice amount of gore  . So much potential. And then... THIS ENDING ?! Did Schwentke run out of money? Brain? Or both?

This might be the reason why this one is often compared to David Fincher's Seven which also has two officers investigating mysterious and bizarre serial killer. Fairly impressive cast of Tattoo cannot cache rather implausible  heavy constructed story. August Diehl has never looked so lost on the big screen as in the second half of Tattoo probably he noticed what he was into it  and it was too late to get out. Dull and likely socially disturbed dialogs with some witty humor about the skin German die Pelle plus the unnatural lightning definitely kills the aesthetic effort of the filmmakers which is merely noticeable. This movie is rated to high in my opinion because there is no explicit cruelty in it which is a plus! its just mostly boredom.The plot tries to display a bizarre scene of Tattoofetishists Tattoo collectors who kill people for their skin. The Tattoo art aspect comes short they only chat about it but the actual Tattoos used in this movie are not good or not displayed good enough.Our hero Diehl goes through a strange metamorphosis from a innocent and unprofessional policeapprentice which he masters very good till he becomes a superbadcop like Charles Bronson selfjustice etc. Diehl looks here a lot out of place.This movie had a notable success especially in the U.S. seems like a proper mix of some hype elements Tattoos sex  body modification marginal. But this movie has a significant lack in the story itself which is not plausible at all. Other problems are weak director's performance seems like Nadeshda Brennicke was casted only to take off the clothes and somehow inappropriate editing with no plausible reasoning. The good one about this movie are some supporting actors which are brilliant Ilknur Bahadir as the annoying cop and Monika Bleibtreu as policebossmom and some interesting architecture shots. The rest is awful great actors and expensive lihgtstyling are no guarantee for a good movie. Well not in Germany.ps. NiveaCreme is a very popular skin care product in Europe.".

	schema:reviewBody "Doris Day was among Hollywood's few truly bankable stars during the late 1950s and early 1960s particularly noted for her comic talents in such frothy farces as PILLOW TALK PLEASE DON'T EAT THE DAISIES and THAT TOUCH OF MINK. Unfortunately as the 1960s progressed her films did not and although her films remained popular they were seen as increasingly out of touch with the tone of the times. The situation was not helped by Day's husbandmanager Martin Melcher who developed the habit of signing Day to film projects Day herself found uninspired. Such was the case with the 1965 flyweight comedy DO NOT DISTURB.The play seems to be a grabbag of ideas from previous Day films the story of a pretty but slightly klutzy wife Day and a neglectful husband Rod Taylor who find themselves at romantic cross purposes courtesy of their landlady Vanessa Hermione Baddeley a sexy secretary Maura McGiveney and a handsome antiques dealerSergio Fantoni. The roles are onedimensional the plot turns are predictable and the dialogue trivial. Both Day and Taylor respond by overplaying sometimes to the point of shrillness. Even so they do manage to inject enough life into the film to make it mildly amusingand the supporting cast is quite charming. When all is said and done the film is most memorable for the sight of Doris Day in a brilliantly orange evening gown as she struggles on the dance floor to shake away an olive dropped down her back.The DVD includes several bonus features including an account of Day's early life and career a brief biography of Michael Romanoff who plays a cameo in the film and a brief biography of composer Mort Garson who is perhaps best remembered for the song Our Day Will Come. It offers a nice transfer and is present in its original widescreen format. Most Doris Day fans will find it amusing but even so most will admit that DO NOT DISTURB is hardly among the first tier of her films not bad but in no way memorable.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

What she needs is an interest which takes her outside of the marriage and the idea of the good dutiful wife.Day's comic timing is so masterful that it reinvigorates the otherwise tired clichd and stereotyped gags.

This is important to note because when Doris starts innocently dallying with a Frenchman there's nothing at stake for heror for her marriage. Some of Day's doubletakes are funny and the madcap finish is delightfully screwball but there's a huge chunk of movie in between these scenes that goes absolutely flat. The plot has an American couple moving to the English countryside and the portrayal of the Britishers is ridiculous and corny.

	schema:reviewBody "Warning This review may contain spoilers.The premise for DO NOT DISTURB sounds like a good one for a Doris Day romp. An AllAmerican newlywed couple in London experience trouble when he spends too much time at the office with his attractive secretary so she flirts with a Continental charmer. Through a series of merry misunderstandings and comical mishaps everything works out and the couple lives happily ever after. If DO NOT DISTURB had the smooth direction of Michael Gordon and the witty screenwriting of Stanley Shapirothe same team who worked on Miss Day's megahit PILLOW TALK DO NOT DISTURB would have been a classic.Instead DO NOT DISTURB receives direction from Ralph Levy who served primarily as a TV director of sitcoms such as I LOVE LUCY. Levy does what he can but ultimately he and the cast are let down by the script. DO NOT DISTURB starts out with a fun cartoon title sequence animated by DePatieFrelingTHE PINK PANTHER accompanied by a memorable title tune warbled by the film's leading lady. The film reasonably amuses for the 1st act but tends to sag during the midsection when Miss Day heads off to Parisand trouble with Sergio FantoniTHE PRIZE ESTHER AND THE KING. Things do pick up when Miss Day heads off to a wool manufacturers convention at a swanky Paris hotelthe set used for it looks suspiciously like Captain von Trapp's home in THE SOUND OF MUSIC which was made by 20th CenturyFox the same yearwhere she pretends to be her husband'sRod Taylor secretary. In the process she ends up impressing the hostLeon Askin by becoming the life of the party. This sequenceincluding the band abruptly alternating between mid1960s twisting and Viennese waltzes at the whim of the Austrian wool magnate is the funniest and most satisfying section of the film.DO NOT DISTURB is pleasant enough and Rod TaylorTHE BIRDS 36 HOURS makes a worthy leading man for Miss Day. Their chemistry is delightful. There is also terrific support from veteran character actors Hermione Baddeleywho was also in Miss Day's 1960 vehicle MIDNIGHT LACE that like DO NOT DISTURB deals with a young wife in London and Reginald Gardiner. Also Day fans will like the injokes where children ask her if she knows Cary Grant and Rock Hudson in reality her 2 most famous costars. But it's never as fun wellcrafted memorable or as inspired as some of her other vehicles such as MOVE OVER DARLING and TEACHER'S PET. She and Taylor would be better served by their next vehicle together comedy veteran Frank Tashlin's classic THE GLASS BOTTOM BOAT.Bottom line For diehard Day fans only. Rating 5 out of 10.".

In fact to describe Do Not Disturb as very mild fun would be to generously overpraise this rather pedestrian picture. Poor Doris Day is forced into shameless mugging to extract even a few halfchuckles out of this very dull script that was obviously derived from a thirdrate stage play. Indifferent direction doesn't help. Nor does inept photography. Hard to believe it's credited to Leon Shamroy with all that illusionshattering makeup so patently revealed in incompetent closeups.The movie was obviously filmed on the cheap too. And in addition to other shortcomings only two songs for Miss Day  and one of those over the credit titles. Totally uninspired songs too!All that can be said in the film's favor is that the players try very hard  though only one Maura McGiveney's nicely calculating secretary is worth mentioning. Fans had a right to feel shortchanged by this entertainmentstarved and technically below standard offering from TV director Ralph Levy. Miss Day herself describes it as a terrible script. She was right. Dead right! I should give it 5 but I don't have the heart!

	schema:reviewBody "Do Not Disturb is the first of two screen comedies that Doris Day made with Rod Taylor as her leading man. Sad to say it is the weaker of the two the other being The Glass Bottom Boat.Although shooting was confined to the back lot of 20th Century Fox the film is set in Great Britain with a trip to Paris as part of the plot. Doris and Rod play an American couple who have relocated across the pond because of Rod's job he's a textile buyer.Job requirements keep Rod at the office and pretty soon Doris begins suspecting that it isn't all work that's keeping him away from home. Maura McGivney is one pretty secretary plus the fact that Reginald Gardiner says that on this side of the pond infidelity is just expected.To which Doris responds by pretending to start something with antique dealer Sergio Fantoni who responds quite naturally like Doris's interest is for real.Since this is a Doris Day film of course it's only going to end in a certain way certain parameters are as inviolate as Doris's cinematic virtue. Still there are some funny moments in a comedy that is mostly quite contrived such as Doris getting plastered and later on waking up in bad with a panting Leon Askin who is one of the people Taylor is doing business. Askin by the way is definitely the funniest one in the film an unapologetic hedonist who mistakes Doris for being a party girl. Doris Day and General Burkhalter the vision of them sweating under the sheets is there's something to turn over in your mind.Do Not Disturb was the first in a series of films that Doris was forced to do because husband Marty Melcher had blown all their money with bad investments. They were not up to the standard she had set and probably forced her from big screen stardom. Still this one does have its moments and her fans will approve. And I do love her recording of the title song. to".

Maura McGivney is one pretty secretary plus the fact that Reginald Gardiner says that on this side of the pond infidelity is just expected.To which Doris responds by pretending to start something with antique dealer Sergio Fantoni who responds quite naturally like Doris's interest is for real.Since this is a Doris Day film of course it's only going to end in a certain way certain parameters are as inviolate as Doris's cinematic virtue. Still there are some funny moments in a comedy that is mostly quite contrived such as Doris getting plastered and later on waking up in bad with a panting Leon Askin who is one of the people Taylor is doing business. Askin by the way is definitely the funniest one in the film an unapologetic hedonist who mistakes Doris for being a party girl. Doris Day and General Burkhalter the vision of them sweating under the sheets is there's something to turn over in your mind.Do Not Disturb was the first in a series of films that Doris was forced to do because husband Marty Melcher had blown all their money with bad investments. They were not up to the standard she had set and probably forced her from big screen stardom. Still this one does have its moments and her fans will approve. And I do love her recording of the title song. to";

	schema:reviewBody "It seems to have been widespread knowledge that Doris Day's third husband Marty Melcher lost most of her sizable estate by bad management. And that as her manager in the mid1960s until his death he got her into some lousy films. Do Not Disturb surely supports that contention. Only a couple of her late films were very good and I think this one is the worst film that the wonderfully talented Day ever made. It's not because of her acting or even the plot. It was an OK idea for a story. The fault in this turkey lies with the script the direction and the editing. Who wants to see a film in which Doris Day is on screen for half an hour or more getting tipsy  bar hopping and going from one venue to another? She is supposed to flip out with two drinks but she goes on and on and on drinking champagne. I kept waiting for her to pass out. There is absolutely no humor here and it quickly becomes boring and aimless. The story seems pieced together and disconnected. There is very little chemistry between Day and costar Rod Taylor. Their spats and quick turnarounds don't come off as believable.Day plays Janet Harper in a role that is unusually flighty for her. Taylor is her husband Mike who doesn't quite seem to fit into his role as a hardnosed business manager hired to rescue an ailing British woolen company. The cast for most of the other roles seem wooden at times unconvincing at other times. Doris Day was one of the most versatile performers of the mid20th century. She had sung with big bands and had hit tunes on records and the radio. She could dance and act and was especially good in romantic comedies. She retired from show biz early  at just 51 years of age when her TV series The Doris Day Show went off the air after six years in 1973. Fans and movie buffs will cherish her best films for decades to come. She deserved much better products than this in her last years of performing.".

	schema:headline " Bored neglected Doris finds a way to bring excitement into her life in one of her lesser sitcoms.";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the lesser of Doris Day's last dozen years of Hollywood film making mostly nonmusical romantic sitcoms with various mostly high profile men. I mostly prefer her earlier musical romantic comedies mostly costarring high profile male singers such as Gordon McRae Howard Keel and Frank Sinatra perhaps peaking with Calamity Jane. Of her '60s films I most enjoyed Lover Come Back with Rock Hudson the musical romantic comedy Billie Rose's Jumbo with help from veterans Jimmy Durante and Martha Raye and 'The Ballad of Jose which as I see it is basically a nonmusical historically relevant remake of Calamity Jane which ends with the same basic take home message about the independent woman trying to make it in a traditional male role which by then was no longer politically correct.In this film she plays the dumb blond kept trophy wife of a wealthy American wool textiles company executiveRod Taylor as Mike Harper who has been assigned to move to England and figure out why their European market has been doing so poorly  and figure out how to fix it. Thus Doris is playing the ideal stayathome '50s wife she became at the end in Calamity Jane and The Ballad of Josie. The problem is that this is the mid60s world of women's lib political change. Doris has become bored with her very limited scope life and lack of children and feels her husband has been neglecting her and possible fatherhood in deference to promoting his career. She seems not too bright in adjusting to her new situation having much trouble figuring out the UK money system of the time and proving worthless in finding the way to the commuter train station to get her husband to work. She spends her time figuring out ways to spend her husband's money in often needless home improvement and decoration projects for their new rented mansion in taking in some rather unusual house petsred fox goat and chickens and ultimately being convinced by her busybody landlady Vanessa that her husband is having an affair with his new secretary Claire Hackett hence justifying her countering with an affair of her own. Her tongue lashing of the fox hunters and their hounds is hilarious. Vanessa arranges for romantic gifts to arrive for Doris who confesses to her husband what is going on. Vanessa also recommends to Doris a Paul Bellari as a good dealer in exquisite home furnishings. Paul a married man with several kids flies Doris to his shop in Paris. He takes her to lunch in a fun caf and she gets drunk on too much champagne. Can't fly home because of a heavy fog so they return to his shop get locked in from the metal store front shutter she passes out from more champagne and her husband arrives in the morning to punch Paul and leave.Her husband is also in Paris for a wool textiles exposition. No wives allowed is the rule of dominant textiles buyer Langsdorf. So Doris decides to pose as her husband's assistant Miss Hackett. In her stunning yelloworange sparking gown she is the hit of the evening party which includes many young female escorts. She dances with Langsdorf and other textiles buyers. Langsdorf wants her for his personal assistant and bed partner for the night but she politely declines. She makes up with her husband over the Bellari affair then dumps a fruit salad on him when Miss Hackett unexpectedly shows up presumably as his escort. A little later she overhears Miss Hackett talking to a handsome French buyer saying that she wants to become his assistant as Doris's husband doesn't seem much interested in her. Thus Doris wants to make up with her husband again but Miss Hackett gives her Langsdorf's room number instead. She puts on her minimal nightie and gets into bed with a sleeping man only to realize later it's Langsdorf. He chases her all over his large room until his wife shows up?. Doris runs into an adjacent room and hides under s sheet on the bed. Her husband arrives and they bounce around on the bed which collapses. The take home message is that husbands should not neglect romancing their wives sufficiently in deference to their career ambitions and other interests especially if their wife doesn't have sufficient other sources of meaningful activities and ego gratification.This film rests entirely on Doris's intrinsic likability. After the first segment most of the humor relates to several suspected cases of infidelity Doris's doings while drunk and her impersonation of Miss Hackett none of which are terribly sidespitting aside from the flying olive down the back of her dress caper and the terminal bedroom mixup farce. Aura McGiveney as Miss Hackett is hardly credible competition with Doris for her husband's romantic attention. We don't find out whether her husband achieved his goal of increasing European textile sales nor whether he learned his lesson long term relating to Doris. Doris as a kept woman and she and her husband being uptight about little infidelities was out of sync with the then women's lib and youth counterculture movements. As a young woman Hollywood actress Hedy Lamar was actually in the situation of being a kept trophy wife by a much older rich European. She rebelled against her cloistered life and escaped to the US.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roman Polanski again explores the depths of the human psyche in Bitter Moon a magnificent epic tale of obsessive lust and the ohsofamiliar winding course of a passionate romance gone sour.Bitter Moon centers around a familiar Polanski theme that we are capable of being both torturer and victim and usually both simultaneously.  For anyone who doubts the validity of much of the past century of French intellectual thought from the likes of Andre Gide Foucault and others see this movie. For anyone who has been in a painful twisted relationship see this movie. You will understand it.  Some of it might be hard to stomach but that is the nature of truly great filmmaking.A beautifully crafted movie almost lyrical at times Bitter moon is set in contemporary Paris but is told in a series of long complex flashbacks superbly narrated by Oscar a terrific Peter Coyote to Nigel Hugh Grant as the usual British prat both passengers on a  cruise ship to India.  Nigel and his wife Fiona played by Kirsten ScottThomas are on a holiday to enliven a stable but stale marriage.  The couples become embroiled through the lurid tale of Oscar and Mimi's Emmanuelle Seigner love affair. Emmanuelle Polanski's reallife wife is superb and her incredible performance takes her from sumptuous beauty to complete wreck a performance that deserves far more praise than was received.  The lack of attention to her performance in this movie is no doubt due to the notoriety in the puritanical American press of her husband.As a whole Bitter Moon may not be Polanski's best film but some periods of the movie represent his very best work.  Throughout limits are pushed to the brink of tastelessness but Polanski masterfully pulls back just in time. The direction is complex and highly sophisticated and the movie arouses a range of emotions from dread to empathy to disgust to hilarity.  The story line is far too complicated to synopsize appropriately in this review. Bitter moon is a great film one of this reviewer's top 10 for the 1990s. Another must see!  A word of caution however Bitter Moon is not a good date movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Roman Polanski again explores the depths of the human psyche in Bitter Moon a magnificent epic tale of obsessive lust and the ohsofamiliar winding course of a passionate romance gone sour.Bitter Moon centers around a familiar Polanski theme that we are capable of being both torturer and victim and usually both simultaneously.  For anyone who doubts the validity of much of the past century of French intellectual thought from the likes of Andre Gide Foucault and others see this movie. For anyone who has been in a painful twisted relationship see this movie. You will understand it.  Some of it might be hard to stomach but that is the nature of truly great filmmaking.A beautifully crafted movie almost lyrical at times Bitter moon is set in contemporary Paris but is told in a series of long complex flashbacks superbly narrated by Oscar a terrific Peter Coyote to Nigel Hugh Grant as the usual British prat both passengers on a  cruise ship to India.  Nigel and his wife Fiona played by Kirsten ScottThomas are on a holiday to enliven a stable but stale marriage.  The couples become embroiled through the lurid tale of Oscar and Mimi's Emmanuelle Seigner love affair. Emmanuelle Polanski's reallife wife is superb and her incredible performance takes her from sumptuous beauty to complete wreck a performance that deserves far more praise than was received.  The lack of attention to her performance in this movie is no doubt due to the notoriety in the puritanical American press of her husband.As a whole Bitter Moon may not be Polanski's best film but some periods of the movie represent his very best work.

	schema:reviewBody "Bitter Moon once again sees the master of the macabre Roman Polanski doing what he does best. With echoes of his earlier film 'Knife in the Water' Bitter Moon is a story of lust revenge betrayal dependency and most of all love wrapped tightly around a coil of taboos and sexual perversions. While not as good as some of Polanski's other works Bitter Moon still stands out as a highlight of his filmography and is certainly a lot better than many people have reputed it to be. The film follows two very different couples on a cruise ship An English couple Nigel and Fiona and an American cripple Oscar who is married to the French seductress Mimi. After meeting Mimi in the ship's bar Nigel becomes entranced by her and later meets her husband and proceeds to learn his and wife's story...and it's not exactly pretty. With this movie Polanski has obliterated the barriers of decency and sometimes even makes you the viewer uncomfortable due to the goings on. And that's the mark of someone that knows how to handle his audience! The acting in the movie really is first rate and there isn't a weak link there especially not within the four leads. I'm no fan of Hugh Grant in fact I hate the man but he's exactly the right casting choice for this movie and it's almost a shame that he went on to make lots of rubbish movies after it. The two women played by Kristin Scott Thomas and Emmanuelle Seigner are well done in terms of the characters and the acting but it is Peter Coyote who steals the show as the abominable Oscar. His character in this film is the sort that actors can really get their teeth into and Coyote bites down hard in this movie. Polanski's direction is excellent as usual and the gritty style mixed with the great director's edgy camerawork help to create a claustrophobic environment that allows Polanski to perfectly portray his characters' mindset. The themes on display are impressive and in spite of the fact that it oversteps the mark on several occasions Polanski's film always feels real and the lesson in the love that the film teaches is duly noted. Bitter Moon is a film that will get under your skin and stay there and not only that but there's enough happening to ensure that this is always a fun watch. Recommended viewing.".

It is totally at the border of normality meaning normality not necessarily what's good but what's common. The film also touches strongly the theme of hipocrisie probably wrong spelled this word. once more in the character of Hugh Grant who despite showing all the time disgut and repugnace for the story he is being told is always secretly desiring and wanting something equivalent to happen to him this hipocratic attitude may be the result of growing up in a world and a society where this kind of sexual liberties and practices are repressed and in here once more we are taken to atrong moral issues which take us to rethink the whole thing....Apart from this questions this film makes me also think about the relationships between men and women... Is there an everlasting love? or at least an everlasting relationship?... Suddendly I recalled Schopenhauer who claimed that no man could be happy with only one woman... maybe this film is showing that he was right... the pace of the relationship between Mimi and the writer was so high that they just emptied all there possibilities very soon but if we put that at the scale of a normal marriage aren't all the possibilities also tried at the end of 10 20 or 30 years? Can a marriage last happy for both till death tears them apart ?...Besides this few topics of discussion to which I could add some more if I just remembered them right now I found this film very well directed with some beautiful scenes... also some strongs scenes that stay with us... Excelent performances for the three leading roles... Kristin Scott Thomas is also good in here but not so as in other films also because her somewhat small part in this one didn't allow her to show more than she did. This film proves once more Roman Polansky as one of the greatest directors of our times since he shows he is totally in control of every detail of direction I enjoyed the increase of the speed together with the increase of intensity of the relationship among the couple. Good dialogues but specially excelent speeches of the writer whenever he becomes the narrator which is often... Also an excelent note for the soundtrack by Vangelis and other well known songs which appear along. A must see.".

Kristin Scott Thomas is also good in here but not so as in other films also because her somewhat small part in this one didn't allow her to show more than she did. This film proves once more Roman Polansky as one of the greatest directors of our times since he shows he is totally in control of every detail of direction I enjoyed the increase of the speed together with the increase of intensity of the relationship among the couple. Good dialogues but specially excelent speeches of the writer whenever he becomes the narrator which is often... Also an excelent note for the soundtrack by Vangelis and other well known songs which appear along. A must see.";

	schema:headline " An Unconventional Story About Relationship Moral Hypocrisy Behavior Love and Hate In Another Masterpiece of Roman Polanski";
	schema:reviewBody "The British Nigel Hugh Grant and his wife Fiona Kristin Scott Thomas are celebrating the seventh anniversary of their marriage in a cruise to Istanbul and Bombay. While in the trip the American cripple and frustrated writer Oscar Peter Coyote gets close to Nigel and invites him to listen to his unconventional love and hate story with his French wife Mimi Emmanuelle Seigner. Oscar tells how he met Mimi in Paris and all their relationship including details of their sexual life along the past years. Meanwhile Nigel feels a great attraction for the sexy and gorgeous Mimi in a story with tragic consequences.'Bitter Moon' has been released in Brazil on DVD this week and yesterday I watched it for the fifth or sixth time since it is one of my favorites movies ever. This story about relationship moral hypocrisy behavior love and hate fascinates me and shakes my emotions. I really believe that 'Bitter Moon' Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner have been not nominated to the Oscar because of the problems of Roman Polanski with the American Justice. Emmanuelle Seigner has her best role and performance in his career playing Mimi an adorable French woman very much in love with Oscar who poisons and destroys her. Their love increases reaches the top and crosses all the boundaries of a sexual relationship including those 'accepted by a moralist and hypocrite society' represented by Nigel questioning how long a love can last making Oscar bored of Mimi. The problem is that their relationship was supported by sex only without friendship and respect basic parameters for a longterm everyday life of a married couple. Hugh Grant is perfect in the role of a typical British man and symbol of a hypocrite society. And Kristin Scott Thomas has a minor but very important part in the plot playing a sexually repressed woman due to the behavior of her husband who released the chains of her repression. The wonderful music of Vangelis and a soundtrack of nice songs which includes a Brazilian pop song conclude this masterpiece. My vote is ten.Title Brazil 'Lua de Fel' 'Bitter Moon'".

	schema:reviewBody "Much has been well described ad nauseum about the plot music background character flaws etc. of Bitter Moon. Besides all of these truths there is something else that exists namely the powerful feminine impact that Mimi portrayed to the extent that it seemed far too real to be left encased in the fantasy realm of movie art. Her character part as well as her actual beauty dancing talent and sexuality is the exponent of femininity grace and desirability. Men remain tortured by their obsession with everything that Mimi portrayed in the film. Not unlike Jean Seberg in Lilith whose character mesmerized beguiled and commandeered most of those who ran across her path Mimi had that quality which likewise reaches out beyond the movie itself to ensnare the hearts of all men. Not everyone gets it but it is plain to see from galleries of fan mail to Emmanuelle Seigner this one movie part seems to have entrenched her immortality into many men's souls. This gutwrenching obsession with the magical combination of a certain actress coupled to a script and director brings forth restless insomnia for appreciative men as Seigner has done here. If Jean Seberg did not bring such an obsession then consider Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Or try Kim Novack in Bell Book and Candle. These are a few of the magical concoctions of film art where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Oscar's character even tries to elevate the beauty and desirability of the less stunning Fiona's character when he says But I find your own brand of beauty more subtle.....as that inimitably British quality......a kind of reticence that hints of untapped potentiality. Even Shakespeare much less Oscar cannot compensate with words for those who appear limited in physical beauty and sensuousness while Seigner's beauty portrays endless potential for being tapped you might say. And Polanski's product leads to a powerful representation of man's instinct and obsession for beauty sensuousness and the ideal everyman's woman. We see that Oscar when given this rare opportunity in the eyes of the average man totally blows it and ruins a most ideal relationship. Unfortunately knowing Polanski's historical tragedies I would think that he is telling us that we are probably no better than Oscar when it comes to successfully nurturing the ideal relationship.

	schema:headline " Dark mesmerizing masterpiece!";
	schema:reviewBody "First off this film is one of the more unique I have ever watched. It does not fit into any specific genre as it combines romance mystery drama comedy and yes horror into a strange film you cannot turn off. I have watched it multiple times and with each viewing find something new I did not catch before. There is nothing I would change about this film. Don't let the reviews that tout this as softcore porn or a movie about BDSM or twisted sex games gone wrong unduly influence you. The BDSM scenes are indeed integral to the story as the story is about excess extremes and coping. Yes there are some kinky sex scenes and descriptive narrations but at its root it is a story about power the power of love infatuation hate obsession cruelty revenge and how dangerous that power can be when employed by a selfish person and not tempered with compassion or empathy. How that power can be used to destroy a life even if seemingly unintentional. Oscar is a selfish older man obsessed with pursuing his sexual needs. He thinks he falls in love with a beautiful young woman Mimi only to grow bored with her after the infatuation stage is over. She is nave somewhat innocent open to debate and truly loves him. He is only interested in the wild sensual sex and how far he can ratchet up the sensations.Ironically it is the older Oscar who mistakes infatuationsex for true love while the younger Mimi merely uses it as an expression of her love. For those with a basic understanding of SM relationships Dom and sub we see that Mimi first plays the role of the Dom within the bedroom pleasing Oscar to his delight through various physical acts.When these roles are reversed however we find that Oscar is a terrible dominant  disregarding the nurturing aspect of Ds and taking it too far with emotional and psychological cruelty. Instead of using this role reversal to show love he instead uses it in an attempt to drive her away from him as he becomes completely indifferent to her. Basically he is a terrible selfish person and ultimately abandons her so he can purse random sex with other women. At this point Mimi is poisoned as Oscar's narrative references movie title. The once nave and innocent Mimi reenters his life after an accident only now she is cold hateful lost and seeking a type of revenge perhaps to show she is worthy of his love after all yeah it is screwed up. Oscar has basically ruined her life watch and you will see how in gruesome detail depriving her of any future normal relationship due to his extremes For this reason she becomes just as cruel if not more so than him  in a perverse effort to become like the man she loves. Even as she matures she still only exists to others as he defined her from their relationship  that of a sexual object. Oscar stays the same creepy narcissistic bastard to the bitter end it is really only Mimi whose personality evolves at all  even if it is in the wrong direction. There is MUCH more to the movie than be summarized here and for fear of spoilers I will not go into any detail. But is a film you cannot forget and will want to watch several times. It is dark brooding and tragic with complex psychological elements  definitely leaves an impression. Every guy needs to see this film if for no other reason than to see the horrors that such selfishness can produce. Sure not all every woman used and discarded will turn into Mimi but this movie makes you examine yourself and realize that damage is still being done even if not to such an extreme. Unless you are just simply not paying attention you cannot walk away the same person as the story does stick with you. Yes it is ultimately a love story Mimi's love story  not Oscar's but one unlike any you have ever seen before. The movie is deep thoughtprovoking and gruesome. I think you have to be 35 or emotionally mature to really appreciate or understand its dark beauty and savagery.".

	schema:headline " Bitter Moon knocks off the worldknown heavyweight XXX thriller champs in the first round";
	schema:reviewBody "The story unfolds in a rather pessimistic and suicidal manner similar to the other Polansky flicks. By the end of it the four leading characters are tied up in a highly erratic erotic and deadly knot. Personally I had underestimated this film considering it to be some shallow soft porn but now after watching it I consider it to be an amazing psychological drama that digs deep into man and woman. The story however tragic and frantic looks and feels very realistic. It is shown in vivid colours how a man can frustrate his life and how a woman can fade away under the influence of her partner's cruelty. That's for the story. Just an external layer to be more exact.As to the technical side of the production I would say that the colour scheme of the movie the shots of the ocean and the wandering ship the representation of the New Year party when the booze opens gates to all manner of deviations  with even a couple of karatekungfu moves which you never expected to come the choice of actors and their play are all quite impressive. No major changes in any aspect of this film are needed though it would have been a bit better without certain hot material in the middle of the film while as you can clearly perceive the UNSEEN sexual intercourse with the black male dancer IS the breaking point in the story though not the only one proving again that often it's what you don't see on screen disturbs the most. The Mimi character is as overwhelming as only a woman can be.Once I watched Basic Instinct many years ago and kind of liked it. Then there was Lolita. Also found it not bad. Eyes Wide Shut was next  found it interesting too. Dogville was next and really enjoyed its exploitation hysteria. But Bitter Moon touching upon similar topics simply kicks those four off to nonexistence being superior on all levels the story the drama the punch line the actors' play the camerawork and the decorations maybe on a par with Eyes Wide Shut in this department the music the choice of melodies for the different sets just hits the mark  it is as good as the choice of the music for Rockstar's Vice City if you know what I mean etc. Actually remember watching quite a number of adult thrillers and to me this one is the winner in the category. Being adult with XXX material meaning scenes of sex it is not an erotic showcase. It is a showcase of the popular modern way of leading a joyful life of pleasures.

	onyx:emotionText "The story unfolds in a rather pessimistic and suicidal manner similar to the other Polansky flicks. By the end of it the four leading characters are tied up in a highly erratic erotic and deadly knot. Personally I had underestimated this film considering it to be some shallow soft porn but now after watching it I consider it to be an amazing psychological drama that digs deep into man and woman. The story however tragic and frantic looks and feels very realistic. It is shown in vivid colours how a man can frustrate his life and how a woman can fade away under the influence of her partner's cruelty. That's for the story. Just an external layer to be more exact.As to the technical side of the production I would say that the colour scheme of the movie the shots of the ocean and the wandering ship the representation of the New Year party when the booze opens gates to all manner of deviations  with even a couple of karatekungfu moves which you never expected to come the choice of actors and their play are all quite impressive. No major changes in any aspect of this film are needed though it would have been a bit better without certain hot material in the middle of the film while as you can clearly perceive the UNSEEN sexual intercourse with the black male dancer IS the breaking point in the story though not the only one proving again that often it's what you don't see on screen disturbs the most. The Mimi character is as overwhelming as only a woman can be.Once I watched Basic Instinct many years ago and kind of liked it. Then there was Lolita. Also found it not bad. Eyes Wide Shut was next  found it interesting too. Dogville was next and really enjoyed its exploitation hysteria. But Bitter Moon touching upon similar topics simply kicks those four off to nonexistence being superior on all levels the story the drama the punch line the actors' play the camerawork and the decorations maybe on a par with Eyes Wide Shut in this department the music the choice of melodies for the different sets just hits the mark  it is as good as the choice of the music for Rockstar's Vice City if you know what I mean etc. Actually remember watching quite a number of adult thrillers and to me this one is the winner in the category. Being adult with XXX material meaning scenes of sex it is not an erotic showcase. It is a showcase of the popular modern way of leading a joyful life of pleasures. It is a showcase of ignorant souls ignorance is bliss and malfunctioning bodies A showcase of a dead end. To die young is glorious Sleep with and impregnate as many girls as possible Don't think about tomorrow  it's weakness We live only once and should taste it all. Are these mottoes correct?

I don't want to spoil too much but suffice it to say that this film is replete with irony so thick you can cut it with a knife.  It's not a happy movie it's not a movie designed to make you feel good about relationships.  It's about bitterness anguish and the strange way that life has of catching up to you in ways you never expected.  People who would enjoy this movie to is fullest potential would be Polanski fans women who have just left abusive relationships and recently single men trying hard not to face their own role in the demise of their recent relationship.  It will make you look harder at yourself and if you are in a relationship it might make you try harder to be a good person within that relationship's confines.Revenge is indeed a dish best served cold....and bitter.".

His love story turns into a pornchicBDSM relationship with so much details we can make an actual porn out of it. The most twisted it gets the better it is. And the more predictable too.And of course it turns Hugh Grant on even more. And what about his wife? That's it NOTHING about her character. Nothing more in fact about Grant's character either. And no real consistency in the main characters too.No psychology no depth no real scenario... FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS. The photography is not even good! And it got so tacky and old with that Vangelis music GOD!Maybe i would have been less strict if it wasn't from Polanski but this guy made Chinatown Repulsion Tess some of the best movies ever!

	schema:reviewBody "When I rented this film a few years ago after seeing clips from it on a cable TV show about unusual sex in movies I was expecting an intense and kinky adult love story. The fact that the tape was stopped half way through only suggested laziness on the part of the previous renter who hadn't bothered to rewind it. It wasn't until I had gotten to about that point in the movie that I realized the previous viewer must have quit watching in dismay and returned it without seeing the rest. Then I began to understand. SPOILERS AHEAD I felt a real point of cruelty had been reached when Oscar totally dismissed the Thanksgiving dinner that Mimi had gone to a lot of effort to make for him. You could see how hurt she was and from that point the movie became more and more difficult to watch. When she begged to be allowed to come back to him and was a total wreck emotionally I felt humiliated for her it seemed so real. After that things deteriorated so badly that it became almost impossible to watch. I might have felt there was a sort of karmic justice in seeing the arrogant selfcentered Oscar become totallydependent on the girlfriend he had virtually destroyed except that she became just as despicable and cruel as he had been. How I ever managed to get to the end of this movie I don't know except that I must have been like the Hugh Grant character who keeps coming back to hear more of Oscar's perverse stories even though he claims to be shocked by them. Some viewers claim to find a touch of redemptive grace or hope at the very conclusion but I don't find it worth the agony of sitting through an entire film of two people who supposedly love each other behaving in the most appallingly cruel ways imaginable. Why this movie was ever made and how anyone could possibly find it of value are beyond me. I have never seen such a despairingnihilistic vision of the utter hopelessness of male and female relationships. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone in good conscience. The fact that it is well made and uncomfortably believable make it worse than if it were a cheesy poorly made film. The pain and suffering in this film are worse than anything I've seen in Bunuel. Only for devoted fans of Roman Polanski.".

The haunting reality is that for so many the lack of depth in a relationship is frightening once the sexual desire diminishes.910  Filed with lush cinematography and romantic Parisian architecture the film's only flaw is its Hugh Grant subplot.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie despite what many reviewers seem to think is about the differences between men and women with respect to sex and love. Whether it is with Oscar and Mimi's intense wild no holds barred relationship or with boring bland Nigel and Fiona.Generally speaking men can have sex with any amount of women in any way or intensity. If she is up for it chances are we will be too. Women on the other hand require more of an emotional connection to the men they sleep with. The need to develop trust and comfort before completely letting go.Oscar is the ultimate poon hound and became instantly infatuated with Mimi. They start with a normal passionate relationship but ultimately the excitement wears off. This happens in any and every relationship. They hike up the intensity by getting into bondage SM etc. All the while Oscar is all to aware they are heading for the their peak and once it hits the top it is only down hill from there.The thing is for the man in this case it is only about the sexual passion. The woman is truly in love and the sex is the connection to her man. Even when the sexual excitement wears off Mimi is still in love.So enter the conflict. Oscar is done wants out. Mimi can't handle it and doesn't understand why he could possibly not love her the way she loves him. He tries to be compassionate and break up but she refuses to be let go ultimate agreeing to be his slave just to stay near him.This story is being told to a couple who have also been together for 7 years and are off to reignite their marriage. I believe that the same factors are in play with the stuffy British couple Nigel and Fiona but only in a far more repressed manner. He's bored because he and his wife are doing the normal thing. No wild kinky sex for them. But the emotion of love is there. If a couple is going to stay together forever they simply have to get over the fact that physical passion is fleeting and if the bond of love is strong on both sides they can make it work. Nigel isn't clear on this until the climactic ending.This commentary isn't so much on the details of the plot but what I believe the movie is trying to get across. Read the other posts for more details but to understand what the movie is saying understand that sex is sex for men and sex is love for women.".

Read the other posts for more details but to understand what the movie is saying understand that sex is sex for men and sex is love for women.";

	schema:reviewBody "If Polanski has made a worse film I haven't yet seen it and don't want to. The story is dull and fairly common. It's about the tempestuous relationship between two lovers Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner who meet in Paris. At first things are beautiful between them but over time the relationship deteriorates and becomes abusive. The story actually takes place quite a time after that when Coyote now paralyzed is telling their story to Hugh Grant on a cruise ship. Grant is madly attracted to Seigner which annoys his wife Kristin Scott Thomas. I think the worst thing about the film is the casting. Peter Coyote is fine in supporting roles but he's not a strong enough actor to carry this film. James Woods was originally cast and he would have been a lot better though I doubt he would have been able to make it a good movie. I absolutely despise Hugh Grant. Completely talentless and utterly unable to carry dramatic roles like this one. Emmanuelle Seigner Polanski's wife is sultry but not much of an actress. Only Kristin Scott Thomas among the four is reliable and she's given by far the least to do. Even Victor Bannerjee whom you may remember as the lead in Lean's A Pasage to India has more to do than her and may just give the best performance in the film with about five minutes of screen time. The film didn't offend me with its sheer terribleness or anything like that. It's just imminently forgettable.".

As the film evolves we realize that who they are sexually is not as important as who they are as human beings.

She's so selfconcerned she never allows Jo into her own body space. At the same time Jo becomes more and more despondent tragically aware of her mother's lack of love the acme when she throws away Peter's chocs in Blackpool and her bent shoulders speak out for her. She carries the weight of being unwanted. Then the dialogues never convey a proper explanation of things the characters never explain themselves clearly or are able to articulate a description crying out for their own feelings. The people in this film don't even know theirs they haven't got the means to express them and it's up to the watchers to understand everything. Probably that's why I felt so overwhelmed while watching it. I really felt the public was called to read through the lines of such a powerful representation of life.".

	schema:headline " Sensitive and Well Acted Kitchen Sink Drama";
	schema:reviewBody "During the late fifties and early sixties a feature of the British film industry was what have become known as kitchen sink films socialrealist pictures focusing on the lives of ordinary workingclass people. Tony Richardson was one of the key figures in this movement and A Taste of Honey is one of a number of such films directed by him others include Look Back in Anger from 1958 and The Loneliness of the LongDistance Runner from 1962. All of these films are based upon literary sources in the case of A Taste of Honey upon a play by Shelagh Delaney.The main character is Jo a workingclass Manchester teenager. The plot is a fairly simple one and charts Jo's relationships with her sluttish mother Helen her sailor boyfriend Jimmy Helen's cardealer lover and later husband Peter and Geoff the young man who befriends Jo after Jimmy disappears back to sea leaving her pregnant. There are a number of fine performances from Murray Melvin as the gentle sensitive Geoff Dora Bryan as the promiscuous Helen and from Robert Stephens as the relatively affluent but coarse and vulgar Peter. The best is probably from the nineteenyearold Rita Tushingham making her screen debut as the nave and vulnerable yet determined and strongwilled heroine. She was to become a wellknown figure in the British cinema of the sixties and seventies even though she was far from having classic film star looks.The film contains a number of elements which would have been highly controversial in the early sixties in particular its nonjudgemental attitude towards premarital sex and pregnancy and the mixedrace love affair between Jo and Jimmy. The British cinema was in some respects more liberal than its American counterpart at this period. I cannot imagine the Hollywood of 1961 making a film about a sexual relationship between a black man and a white woman. Still less can I imagine a Hollywood film about a sexual relationship between a black man and a white teenage girl a theme which would probably still be offlimits in 2008.There were however limits to British liberalism. A number of reviewers have assumed that Geoff is gay. Certainly Melvin plays him with what might be seen as stereotypically gay characteristics he is for example rather effeminate in his voice and gestures. He is also much more domesticated than Jo being better than her at cooking needlework and housekeeping. He is never however identified in the script as a homosexual there is no reference to his having sex with or being sexually attracted to other men. Indeed it is suggested that Geoff is romantically in love with Jo and he even proposes marriage.It should be remembered that at the time this film was being made homosexuality was still illegal in Britain and there had never been a British film with an explicitly gay theme the first such was Victim which opened in August 1961 only a month before A Taste of Honey. When The Trials of Oscar Wilde came out the previous year it refused to admit that Wilde actually was a homosexual but rather tried to give the impression that he was the victim of unfounded gossip of a deliberate conspiracy to blacken his name and of perjured evidence.Like a number of kitchen sink films it has a strong sense of place conjured up by its atmospheric blackandwhite photography of Manchester scenes especially the terraced houses of the workingclass districts. We see recognisable landmarks such as the city's Town Hall the Ship Canal and Blackpool Tower Like many workingclass Mancunians from this period Jo and Helen take their holidays in Blackpool.Another notable feature of the film is the presence of children. The film opens and closes to the accompaniment of the nursery rhyme The Big Ship Sailed on the AlleyAlleyO and in several scenes we see children playing outside. Among them apparently is the future Government minister Hazel Blears. Richardson's intention was presumably to contrast the innocence of childhood with the cares of adult life and to stress that Jo is little more than a child herself. Indeed when the film opens she is still a schoolgirl probably aged fifteen that being the age when most pupils left school in the early sixties unless they were intending to obtain formal educational qualifications such as Olevels. Delaney herself was only seventeen when she wrote the play on which the film is based.A Taste of Honey perhaps lacks the dramatic power of some of the socialrealist films of this period such as J. Lee Thompson's Tiger Bay or John Schlesinger's A Kind of Loving. It is however a sensitive wellacted and occasionally humorous look at human relationships and one of the better British films from this period. 810".

An at that time shocking affair with a a black sailor a scarcely less outrageous fraternal liaison with a homosexual boy it was still a criminal offence all added shock and spice to what was in it's day a groundbreaking little movie.It's beautifully acted by all concerned. The script is simple but entirely believable. All of the other technical issues are up to snuff. More a period comedy of manners now than a relevant commentary upon human life it still hits the spot in terms of sentiment and tragedy.

	schema:headline " One of the British classics of the time which still holds up brilliantly";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was a milestone in British cinema and also introduced the magical young Rita Tushingham to the screen for the first time. The film was directed by Tony Richardson and represented better than the two John Osborne plays which he had previously brought to the screen LOOK BACK IN ANGER 1959 and THE ENTERTAINER 1960 the spirit and essence of the 'Free Cinema' movement which Richardson Karel Reisz and the cinematographer Walter Lassally had originated with their 1950s documentaries such as WE ARE THE LAMBETH BOYS Reisz 1958 and MOMMA DON'T ALLOW Richardson and Reisz 1955. Lassally was the cinematographer for this film and he made many innovations which are of great historical importance. This was the first British film ever filmed entirely on location both the interiors and exteriors. For this production Lassally was also the first cinematographer to shoot on 400 ASA film instead of 100 ASA which enabled him to get moody shots in the dark which had never been achieved before in Britain with minimal or natural lighting. There is no doubt that Lassally was a cinematographic genius and the rerelease of this film on a British Film Institute DVD has amongst the extras a compelling audio narrative by Lassally as voiceover for key shots of the whole film. Anyone with a serious interest in the history of the cinema needs to hear that detailed analysis which he gives. One particularly amusing piece of information is that when Lassally wanted to get Rita's legs to show up in a long shot at 'the Arches' in the evening he threw white sand down behind her to make them visible by contrast. Rita's wideeyed innocent look which dominated probably her most famous later film GIRL WITH GREEN EYES 1964 is absent here. The eyes are wide yes but not with innocence. For in them she conveys instead the rage and frustration of her terrible circumstances in this gritty social drama of a lonely and unwanted pregnancy in grinding poverty and social isolation. The performance which wholly dominates the film however is not that of Rita but of Dora Bryan who died aged 91 only six months ago. This film was unquestionably the greatest triumph of her career indeed one of the great screen performances of the sixties. Not far behind her in a stunning display of acting talent the young Murray Melvin gives one of the most poignant and moving performances of that entire era of British cinema. This film is funny sad and deeply tragic all at once. You have to laugh you have to cry. It is a cinematic experience which no one should miss. The film is based on a play by Shelagh Delaney who collaborated with Richardson on the script. This film was the second feature film appearance by Robert Stephens who was to appear in 95 films by his death in 1995 and was knighted for his acting career. This film is set amongst the lowerclass poor in a grim decaying Northern city in Victorian streets which have all been demolished long ago. Life was unremittingly hard in those days of 'shilling in the meter' hot water if they were lucky enough to have any at all and desperate poverty. Dora Bryan plays Rita's mother a feckless selfabsorbed woman who finds it inconvenient having a daughter hanging around when she wants to look for a man for herself. And when she finds one he is an appalling snotty fellow played by Stephens who wants Rita out of the way. Rita's only two friends are a young black seaman who loves her but sails away unwittingly leaving her pregnant a deeply sympathetic performance by Paul Danquah and Melvin a desperately lonely young gay man who is on the verge of suicide from loneliness and has nowhere to sleep so he takes up with Rita. Their relationship is one of the most poignant between two lost souls ever shown on screen. The quiet desperation of all the characters who are silently screaming inside is heartbreaking and one thinks of the stories of Carson McCullers if one seeks American comparisons. The resigned melancholy of Melvin's character resembles that of the deaf John Singer so brilliantly portrayed by Alan Arkin in THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER 1968 a comparable American classic to match A TASTE OF HONEY. This film made an immense impact which lasted all through the sixties and no one who went regularly to the movies or took them seriously in London had failed to see it. Everyone kept talking about it for years. It got under everyone's skin and the taste lingered not really of honey alas but more of the bitterness of the vinegar and gall of hopeless loneliness. And as for the story the worst of it is that although life must go on the sadness goes on too. It tears at their guts so that they don't know whether they will make it to the next morning but somehow we know that they will survive to suffer some more if only to experience those flickering moments of happiness that occasionally flare up between times and give them those rare tastes of honey that sweeten their suffering as they walk along the sad road that leads on.".

I suppose light drama describes it best but I feel the movie would have had considerably more impact if it was played as a straight gritty drama. The material was there and taboo subjects were tackled in a mainly intelligent way. The Salford locations were spot on bringing home the working class struggle experienced by so many. The lead character Jo was difficult to like. She was clearly deeply affected by her mothers promiscuous behaviour and pushed away anybody who showed her affection. This was a lovely performance by the actress who was totally believable. Dora Bryan played her role the lightest although she looked way older than 40 her song in the pub was a delight. Geoffrey the gay friend was a sad character a shame he was portrayed in such a stereotypical way. I would have liked to have seen Jo's relationship with the sailor explored more and given more depth it was so crucial to the story. Overall this was a thought provoking realistic film which was successful as no attempt was made to glamorise the setting or situation.".

	schema:headline " Good to see this excellent film is now on a Criterion Collection BluRay disc.";
	schema:reviewBody "This reaches a level of realism rarely seen. The story revolves around Jo a lower class young girl in Manchester England in the early 1960s. In the beginning Jo lives with her alcoholic mother Helen in a rundown flat and when her mother takes up with a loser Jo gets a gut load and moves out on her own and finds a job in a shoe store. She becomes romantically involved with Jimmy a black ship's cook. She gets pregnant only to have Jimmy ship out and leave her to deal with the situation alone. Along the way Jo meets Geoffrey a young man who moves in with her. If this all sounds a bit too downbeat for you be aware that this film has a lot of qualities that make it worth seeing.Both Rita Tushingham as Jo and Murray Melvin as Geoffrey won best actor awards at Cannes in 1962. These were well deserved in my opinion. I was taken with Tushingham. She has an interesting face and in her first film roll here she is able to express a lot with facial expressions. Frequently filming her in close up is effective. The relationship between Jo and Geoffrey is played with some tenderness. I found Geoffrey's sexuality to be ambiguous. In one scene he tries to kiss Jo and offers to marry her. This she rejects. While Geoffrey does have some stereotypical behavior patterns associated with gays I found that there was only one scene that more than hints at Geoffrey's homosexuality and that is when Jo's mother's mate comes into Jo's flat sees that Jo is pregnant looks at Geoffrey and says Whose this the father? and after looking at Geoffrey says Oh dear no. Since homosexual acts were illegal in England until 1967 portraying overt homosexuality on screen in this movie would have been controversial.There is some sharp dialog especially between Jo and her mother. When Helen announces the she is going to get married Jo asks You're not getting married in a church are you? to which Helen answers Why? You coming to throw bricks at us? When Helen puts on a fur and asks Jo how do you like this? Jo responds Bet somebody's missing their cat.Walter Lassally's blackandwhite cinematography is to be savored he understands that art form. There are some scenes that are powerful in black and white that would be unremarkable in color. I am thinking in particular of one scene that has Jimmy walking across a bridge that has him in black against a bright background. This scene emphasizes the sadness of his leaving. Many scenes like the last scene with the sparklers are so well lighted that they last in memory. Lassally also knows how to get the most out of Tushingham's close ups. Director Richardson who was nominated for best director at Cannes for this movie was on a real roll at this time in his career. Consider Tom Jones 1962 The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner 1962 A Taste of Honey 1961 Sanctuary 1961 The Entertainer 1960 Look Back in Anger 1959. He also worked with some of the best actors of his generation like Lawrence Olivier Richard Burton and Albert Finney.Some of the themes treated like interracial relationships and hints at homosexuality were daring at the time. You would think that this would make the movie dated but it is not like those issues have been totally resolved some sixty years later.The one negative for me was the scoreit would be more appropriate for a lighthearted Cary Grant Kathryn Hepburn comedy. A Taste of Honey is a serious look at a time and place. It does have some humor but much of that comes from sarcastic dialog. There are vestiges of this having been a stage play particularly in the final scenes but the filming makes this a work of cinema especially by filming using outdoor locations.The Criterion Collection DVD contains interviews with Tushingham and Melvin filmed in 2016 and Lassally filmed in 1998. I usually find such interviews a bit of a bore where the actors praise everyone but these interviews I thought were interesting. Tushingham had things to say about working with Richardson. The interview with Melvin is fantastiche in one interesting dude. I liked his comments I was the start of gay pride of 1958. It's all down to me honey. It's on my shoulders and I'm very proud of it. The interview with Lassally shows that he was very concerned with film quality and how much he thought about the filming. Some of his work here was pioneering in the use of low light photography hand held cameras and different film stocks. He was so interested in getting contrasts right that in the scene with Jo and Geoffrey under the arch he actually put some sand in a field in the background so that he could get Jo in welldefined silhouette.".

	schema:headline " Tasting something daring";
	schema:reviewBody "A Taste Of Honey is primarily known for the debut of Rita Tushingham who became a star with this and has had a half century career. But for it's time it was a daring film exploring things we still didn't talk about in the USA. For instance there was that love that dared not speak its name.This film is set in working class Manchester and the cinematography was reflective of a very grimy environment that single mom Dora Bryan is raising her daughter Tushingham in. Bryan's pushing 40 but she likes to party still especially with her new boyfriend Robert Stephens. Rita is clearly in the way.Interracial love was something not talked of in the USA but it's here as young Rita drifts into losing her virginity and getting pregnant by a black sailor Peter Danaquah. He goes off on a long sea voyage without knowing what has happened.The British may be more frank in talking about it but interracial love and sex was quite the same as here back then. You can bet the rent money that A Taste Of Honey got no bookings in our Dixie states.But here next relationship is with Murray Melvin who is as my late British friend Jeff Barker would say was as 'gay as green shoes' which is apparently a British expression.

	onyx:emotionText "A Taste Of Honey is primarily known for the debut of Rita Tushingham who became a star with this and has had a half century career. But for it's time it was a daring film exploring things we still didn't talk about in the USA. For instance there was that love that dared not speak its name.This film is set in working class Manchester and the cinematography was reflective of a very grimy environment that single mom Dora Bryan is raising her daughter Tushingham in. Bryan's pushing 40 but she likes to party still especially with her new boyfriend Robert Stephens. Rita is clearly in the way.Interracial love was something not talked of in the USA but it's here as young Rita drifts into losing her virginity and getting pregnant by a black sailor Peter Danaquah. He goes off on a long sea voyage without knowing what has happened.The British may be more frank in talking about it but interracial love and sex was quite the same as here back then. You can bet the rent money that A Taste Of Honey got no bookings in our Dixie states.But here next relationship is with Murray Melvin who is as my late British friend Jeff Barker would say was as 'gay as green shoes' which is apparently a British expression. No closet for this man in 1961.

	schema:reviewBody "I think I counted one smile from poor unhappy Jo Tushingham for the entire movie. But then she doesn't have much to be happy about. Her neighborhood has all the trappings of an industrial blast furnace while Mom cruises airily from one guy to the next. So Jo's pretty much left to figure out life for herself and what she sees she doesn't much like including her own plain looks. So who can blame Jo for hooking up with the first guy Danquah who's nice to her. Too bad he doesn't stay even leaving her with one more mouth to feed. Good thing she meets nice guy Geoff Melvin even if he's more like an older sister than a boyfriend. At least he makes life a little less ugly. If only she had the good sense to stay with him and drop selfish Mom. How ironic that if Jo's not careful she'll end up just like her mother. But then what can be expected from life among such seedy surroundings.The film deserved every one of its many awards. Too bad Tushingham didn't get one. She's perfect as the benighted young woman. That hardeyed stare at the life unfolding before her is hard to forget. I can't believe Audrey Hepburn was actually considered for the role. She's a fine actress but her patrician good looks are all wrong for a part that cries out for plainness. But it's really Bryan who steals the show. Her aging mother alternates between flighty unconcern and genuine poignancy. Despite Mom's selfish attitude it's hard to dislike her thanks to Bryan's acting skill. And if I remember correctly Melvin's Geoff was the first clearly gay character I saw on screen. His social outcast manages to be both vulnerable and dignified even in difficult surroundings. All in all the cast amounts to a terrific threesome. Most importantly they make the audience care.Congrats to the Brits for making groundbreaking films at a time when Hollywood was specializing in teen fare like Beach Blanket Bingo 1965. TCM needs to revive this gritty 1962 production more often.".

Yes Ghai has made few stinkers Kisna but overhaul this man is an asset to the Indian Film Industry. Why this movie is rated so low? From what I surmise the main lead casting of Jackie Shroff was a mistake. Ideal casting would have been Bachchan or Rishi Kapoor. Shroff cannot reach the depth or range that this role calls for. Just because he has been acting for over 30 years has no bearing on his acting prowess. That said the movie is too long and the story too twisted. Here is a movie about family values fatherly love friendship and sentiments and they were all thrown down the drain in the very public Corporate Stockholders meeting. Who came up with that ending to a story? That scene was ugly. The endorsement for dot.com and cola was in poor taste. Great lyrics and good music. The songdance number at the Jaipur palace was one of the best aesthetically choreographed numbers in Hindi Films. Two or three of the dance numbers How many men in throes of a breakup resort to a wild dance? Hithik is a good actor specially the scene where is doing mime in front of the bill board. This move is for the majority of the Indian audience who like good familyvalue movies but the minority who have no taste or class will like Dabaang Tees Maar Khan and Three Idiots It's obvious this movie is not meant for them.".

I loved PARDES 3.54 and I appreciated parts of TAAL 34 so the expectations for his next film YAADEIN were naturally sky high. When TAAL released in the summer of 1999 one would have thought that Subhash Ghai would have taken the critics' reviews seriously. Overall the film was wellliked but it was in general agreement that the storyline of the film was poor and lacked originality. Therefore I thought that by now Ghai would be able to craft a perfect film as I heard the prebuzz about the film to be good. I thought the storyline of the film was interesting not as original as I had hoped. But the film had names attached to it that could not be ignored. Firstly Jackie Shroff has slowly become one of my favorite actors now that he had embraced his maturity and given up trashy roles watch MISSION KASHMIR 3.54 and tell me if I'm wrong. Secondly Hritik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor  enough said. And finally Anu Malik had claimed to have given the best score of the year. When the soundtrack released I found the flak it received quite unfair as I like the score but I definitely did not think it was great. A few songs are good many are average and only one is truly great  of course the well loved title track.Well none of the hype lived upto the film. The storyline goes something like this. Shroff is left with three young girls to raise and marry off when his wife suddenly is killed in a police chase. The girls find love through different ways but the last daughter Kareena Kapoor encounters the biggest problem when her lover Hritik Roshan is engaged conveniently by force to someone else. Wellcrafted film bites much more than it can chew leaving only moments of brilliance. Ghai's script though dialogue heavy is much too predictable and overlong concluding with a less than satisfying tieup. Roshan is excellent Shroff does very well with a poorly defined role. Look out for the blatantly disgusting Coca Cola and other brand name advertisements placed throughout the film it heavily cheapens the integrity of the film.OVERALL RATING  12 out of four poor passable".

I am yet to leave a movie in the middle but if there is one movie which could have broken my unblemished record yaadein has to be it. The movie is a story of a father trying to become a dost of his three grownup daughters who have been brought up in London. Now obviously the father is Indian to the core and there are enough dialogues in the movie about sanskriti etc.The fatherplayed by Jackie shroff wobbles between the two extreme views about mohabbatwhether it is good or bad and there are a lot of subplots none of which is allowed to develop. The romance between Hrithik and kareena is pathetic with all the usual fundas thrown inviz saving the heroine puppy love etc. Hrithik may have a great following but this is my personal opinion onlyhe has yet to show any subtelty in his acting. He tries very hard to show his love which translates to shouting and making faces a.l.a shahrukh instead of letting his eyes do the talking. There are twists like rich boypoor girl love is goodbad another girl a dead sweetheart always dressed in white sacrifice to show gratitude etc which are just ghai's attempts to borrow from the breed of directors who are adept at making lovestories. Ovreall a forgettable movie.".

Everyone has acted quite well when compared to the acting levels that one generally sees in Hindi cinema.3. The story is credible.4. The director is very well known.So why has this movie got such a low score?My personal belief is that Hindi movies get wild inconsistent ratings from fans who have not thought the matter sufficiently through. How else can one justify a rating of 9.210 for Dil Chahta Hai and just 6.010 for Asoka? Is Dil Chahta Hai a better movie than say  Shawshank Redemption which was rated 9.010?Dil Chata Hai is good. But 9.210? I don't think so. And does Asoka deserve the low rating of 6.010? I don't think so.It appears that very few people rate Hindi movies compared to the numbers of reviews that English movies get 45 people rated Yaadein 75837 people rates Shawshank Redemption. This causes distortion in the average especially when the swing as seen in the case of Yaddein is so large.I belive that Yaadein should be rated 6.010. It's a nice entertaining movie and not the sinking ship that it has been likened to.See it and decide for yourself.".

Isha is the same way her sisters' ruined marriages and her promise to her father isn't something to be taken lightly. She doesn't want to hurt her father who has lovingly raised her and always done what is best for her. Another thing many people don't seem to grasps is why the Puris aren't good enough. Yes they may have to great homes but that DOES NOT put them on the same social and economical standings as that Malhotras. And in Indian culture it is frowned upon to marry someone of lower social and monetary standings. But overall no matter how many times I watch Yaadein it still brings tears to my eyes because I UNDERSTAND what Subhash Ghai was trying to portray with this movie. For anyone especially someone looking for a movie that is more sentimental then violent this is an excellent movie to watch.".

Despite my best effort I could not get a ticket and had to return home. This was a first for me in my 22 years in America that I had  returned home without seeing a Bollywood movie on its opening night. I finally saw the movie on Sunday at the 5 p.m. show.It was a disappointment in the sense that I expected a lot more from Subhash Ghai. Subhash Ghai has certainly let down his fans and admirers. But to suggest that it is a failure at the boxoffice would be totally wrong. Kareena Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan are brilliant. Anu Malik's score despite poor lyrics by Anand Bakshi is one of his best in recent times. At least four songs  the title number and three others  are going to be big hits.Another asset of the movie is its outstanding photography by Kabir Lal.The movie has hit the top ten list in U.K. and is 19th in the US.Just in 3 days it has grossed approximately 645000 from 59 theatres giving it one of the highest per theatre average. This is no mean achievement. To the best of my knowledge no other movie from Bollywood has reached this level of business in the US.However from this Ghai should not conclude that his critics are wrong and he is right.In future he should shun those product placements. And he should never never write.Is it not enough that he is a great director? Why should he try to be a screenwriter and editor as well.This is arrogance of the worst kind and will prove to be his undoing if he persists in it. In Hollywood all great directors from Capra to Hitchcock to Spielberg have based their best work on solid scripts written by others. But I want to give Ghai example from India itself. Did Raj Kapoor ever write his scriptsIt was always K.A.Abbas or one of the other established writers? Did Guru Dutt ever write his scriptsIt was always Abrar Alvi Did the great MehboobIt was Ali Raza or Wajahat Mirza or Agha Jani Kashmiri. In the alltime classic MughalEAzam Asif used as many as four writers  Kamal Amrohi Wajahat MirzaAman and Ehsaan Rizvi.So there you are Mr. Ghai. To be a movie director is a great thing in itself. You don't need any other titles.Besides the Bombay film industry has great writers even today. SalimJaved may not be writing scripts any more but there is Javed Siddiqui who is equally good and with whom Mr.Ghai has collaborated very successfully in the past and can do so with greater success in the future.Finally as moviegoers we should all go to see Yaadein and enjoy the great performances of Kareena and Hrithik and the intoxicating music of Anu Malik.".

But this movie bombed critically and commercially BIG TIME I tell you why.......This movie. I have to say from the film cover looked pretty promising. I felt this movie will be golden and it starred Hrithik Roshan one of the best actors of Hindi Cinema and my favorite actor so I watched this movie and man was I disappointed. Fifteen minutes into this movie I felt forwarding it because it was such a slow movie. It was very boring and dull until the song title song Yaadien but pretty much after that it was downhill.I have to say this is one terrible written movie its stereotypical clichd.......you get the picture very typical. The direction was LAME i mean come on a man who directed Pardes and Taal directs this bore crap. This film's biggest flaw was its direction. Second acting unlike the screenplay and direction acting was better. Hrithik is a talented performer thats why he was a able to pull of this undeveloped character but he was unconsistent and offbeat because of the bland and lame screenplay and direction. Kareena Kapoor who back then was known to be a very over expressive actress did a wonderful job in this movie. Hrithik and Kareena's chemistry set the screen on fire. Jackie did an alright job. And as far of the rest of the cast they acted well according to their characters. I have to say the actors tried really hard and it shows What saves the movie from becoming a total disaster are the musical numbers. Watch it only if you are a Kareena or Hrithik fan DO NOT WATCH IT THINKING ITS A SUBASH GHAI MOVIE by the way after this movie Mr. Subash Ghai entered a career slump and pretty much his career was over.

Credit goes to the director the way he used Udit's voice to great effect in this piece and Hariharan's voice for the other one.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say that Hrithik Roshan is one 'beeeyootiful' man who knows it or maybe thats just the way he was directed. I just find the slow posed facial expressions very OTT when compared with all the other cast members who are just ever so slightly less contrived. But this is very much a common gripe I have about this particular genre and we can over rule this for the time being.The movie started off really slowly with the long winded wind up to the events that lead to Raj Puri's return to India this felt like it took hours. In the scene where his wife is dying her life support machines are switched off and she lifts her head flutters her eyelashes a bit and gives a speech about the daughters whereupon she dies. Oh how tragic. This scene seemed to go on for an awfully long time when compared with a later scene where Isha gets caught on Tuba Island and is chased by rabid crocodiles until she collapses in a heap in a tree and has to be rescued by the posing hero who just immediately locates a blow up boat goes to the precise location where she is stuck in an island on a tree and then flexing his muscles he swims a passed out  unconscious Isha across the sea back to mainland Malaysia.We are never told how or why she passed out in a tree and why she didn't wake up when being swum across the ocean. Was she bitten unconscious from a head trauma or abducted by aliens? I guess its up to the viewer to make up a story of sorts and hope it fits in with the thinner than water plot line.What I liked The music was beautiful specifically the song 'Aye Dil...Dil Ki Duniya Mein' which was very well done. I enjoyed the way that the movie seemed to be a montage of events which fitted well with the title Yaadein Memories Raj Puri had a lot more depth than most characters in this genre of movie and I found him very likable and very human in many ways. The message well I read the previous comment and I didn't get that message at all. I got the message that if children are traded like commodities then there is no hope of a better future for Indian people. I also found that the message about Love was very interesting that it is indeed all around us and sometimes arranged marriages work sometimes marrying for love doesn't work but ultimately love conquers all and that Love is the central theme for all of our happiest memories.".

	schema:headline " Awful disappointing film";
	schema:reviewBody "At the outset I must warn you that I am biased. About two months ago I bought a large number of Mukta Arts shares assuming that if Yaadein became a hit market sentiment would drive up the price and get me decent returns. As a result I was desperate to see the film on the first day of its release  but try as I may I could not get tickets not even scalper's tickets or black tickets as we call them.I finally managed to see the film the week after two days ago again I could not get tickets the regular way but eventually managed to get extras at Cine Planet the new swanky theatre complex at Sion. Despite the film having received bad reviews people are still queueing up to see the film possibly I suspect to see how bad the film really is.What was Subhash Ghai even thinking of! Pardes and Taal were tolerable the former because of Shahrukh and the latter because of the music and Anil Kapoor. Both also had crisp editing and lush looks. But Hrithik is no Shahrukh at least currently he does not have the ability to rise above the role. Kareena is still very raw. Jackie Shroff who surprisingly is the pivot around which the movie revolves just can't act. The editing is clumsy the rest of the supporting acts are average to worse the cinematography is at places terrible the dialogues make no sense the story is patchy the music is no great shakes...I could just go on.And what is the story? Jackie Shroff is a middleclass restauranteur with a swimming pool living in England a father of three daughters who loses his wife Rati Agnihotri probably the only saving grace of the movie in a shootout. They then move to India because the only thing he wants to do is to get his daughters married which he does pretty fast especially as far as his first two daughters forgettable faces are concerned. Hrithik is a foster son of his who eventually falls in love with Kareena. Due to a crazy set of circumstances they can't actually get together but eventually in a silly contrived ending they do.The audience reaction at Cine Planet was interesting. Everyone was just waiting for the next embarrassing moment wondering how much worse the film would actually get. The cringing feeling was similar to the one I had while watching Toofan and Jadugar wondering whether Amitabh had lost his brains. And the use of brand placement for advertising is a joke. Coke as cokemohabbat.com and PassPass a mouthfreshener are blatantly thrust upon the audience. I don't think I'll be having PassPass for some time to come considering that it will immediately remind me of Yaadein.Subhash Ghai has gone or record saying that his target market is the foreign market where people pay 710 for a ticket and he does not really care for the guy paying 10 rupees in a small town in Bihar. Which may make economic sense though I doubt it...but doesn't the movie still have to be good? Or is it that the desi crowd abroad is so filmstarved that it will lap up anything thrust upon it? I wonder...on Friday the Mukta Arts stock actually went up by 10 because of market news that the film is a hit abroad in the UK and US. If the desis abroad think this film is worth seeing they are welcome to it and if that helps me make up my current 30 loss in the stock all the better!".

They then move to India because the only thing he wants to do is to get his daughters married which he does pretty fast especially as far as his first two daughters forgettable faces are concerned. Hrithik is a foster son of his who eventually falls in love with Kareena. Due to a crazy set of circumstances they can't actually get together but eventually in a silly contrived ending they do.The audience reaction at Cine Planet was interesting. Everyone was just waiting for the next embarrassing moment wondering how much worse the film would actually get. The cringing feeling was similar to the one I had while watching Toofan and Jadugar wondering whether Amitabh had lost his brains. And the use of brand placement for advertising is a joke. Coke as cokemohabbat.com and PassPass a mouthfreshener are blatantly thrust upon the audience. I don't think I'll be having PassPass for some time to come considering that it will immediately remind me of Yaadein.Subhash Ghai has gone or record saying that his target market is the foreign market where people pay 710 for a ticket and he does not really care for the guy paying 10 rupees in a small town in Bihar. Which may make economic sense though I doubt it...but doesn't the movie still have to be good? Or is it that the desi crowd abroad is so filmstarved that it will lap up anything thrust upon it? I wonder...on Friday the Mukta Arts stock actually went up by 10 because of market news that the film is a hit abroad in the UK and US. If the desis abroad think this film is worth seeing they are welcome to it and if that helps me make up my current 30 loss in the stock all the better!";

The whole crimemystery elements of the movie are being handled quite well.So out of all the Dr. Mabuse movies this one really ain't among the worst although it obviously also doesn't come noway close to the first three Dr. Mabuse movies directing by Fritz Lang.The acting in the movie really varies.

He had appeared in 4 Dr. Mabuse movies before each time in a totally different role to which this movie also forms no exception. How confusing do you want things to be? Also Wolfgang Preiss reappears again in this movie as the villainous Dr. Mabuse again for the fifth and last time though only as the 'ghost' of Dr. Mabuse this time.It's a quite funky movie.

And there are more familiar faces such as Borsche Peters Windeck Preiss and Klaus Kinski of course. The components in this film are the usual. It is once again police vs Mabuse as the title already says. They can never be sure where he is or if he is even alive. Technology plays a role in here and Mabuse also manages to control people's minds again which is also a common occurrence in these crime films about him. As a whole I cannot say I enjoyed the watch very much. Then again I have never been the biggest fan of these Mabuse films and the absence of Froebe who I always like is not helping either.

It is indeed grim... and human. Like life and perhaps a reflection of these days not everything ends up happily ever after... we all are surviving each day in our own ways. This slice of family life in a small quarter of Barcelona is not glossed over and prettied up like most Hollywood films that we've slowly grown to despise I know I don't speak for everyone. This is not the film that you go to to escape from reality... it's reality facing right back at you. It paints a perspective on the lives of those living on the frayed edges of our society in every part of the world. For me I think it is a pity that none of the Big Six picked it up for wider distribution. And that's the sad note for today's American cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Inarritu's three previous filmsAmores Perros 21 Grams and Babelare classified together as the Death Trilogy as they each depict the exponential impact of fatal or nearfatal occurrences in the interconnected existence of separate lives. They are each epic punchpacking dramatic powerhouses. But now I see he still had much more to say on the literally infinite subject of death. And he says it with Biutiful a purely experiential film that pierces through the heart with the acuity of a stingray barb.The narrative here is a rail tunnel of raw sprawling intimacy set in an overpopulated decaying Barcelona ghetto. We follow Uxbal and we're not entirely sure what he does. Neither does anybody or him really. Much of the things he does are criminal mainly mitigating between corrupt police and illegal aliens with often catastrophic results. He is also a dedicated father to two young children whose mother his exwife is a wreck of alcohol bipolarity and promiscuity and worse knows her inability to control herself and is in a quicksand of bettering herself. Uxbal also has prostate cancer which is rapidly spreading. Also he is internally connected with the afterlife. He doesn't see visions he doesn't clutch shoulders and see the manner of one's impending death. He purely senses a recently deceased spirit in the room with him. He can do nothing about their situation. He just senses them.Uxbal's ability to feel the presence of departed souls is portrayed like a sort of capacity to hear noise at the volume at which say a dog could only be expected to hear it. The film's setting and happenings are a jerky spontaneous lateral rush of urban business like the sight sound and fury made by the living to distract themselves from the silence of death. Each scene seems to be a concordance of extroverted behavior and internal behavior both with equal fervor yet both on either side of some twoway mirror. Only those characters namely Uxbal whose conflicts and dilemmas are constantly internalized can hear that silence. Eventually his daughter does as well and becomes the closest to him in what one might go as far as to consider the film's climax a bearlike hug they both know is as fleeting as every other action in this desperate commotion of a life they lead.Irritu intends to drain us. Physically internally emotionally. And he cleans out his total cinematic armory to do so. And like death that is both a blessing and a curse. For however harrowing it is Biutiful exalts us with the chance to see soul bare through Javier Bardem's performance as Uxbal. Watching Bardem absorb involve and ultimately possess a manysided role like Uxbal's is a singular delicacy and a complete wonder. His eyes speak agonizing tomes. He hauls from an unfathomably mysterious spring of passion grief and who knows what else.One might be able to delineate that Bardem renders a tragic individual as a fading Barcelona forager who deals in illegal immigrants and connects with the deceased. But every now and then a story materializes conveyed in a way that is so sprawling so comprehensive that no one premise or implication can classify it. Attempting to definitely describe it limits something that offers the utmost magnitude of whatever an actor's a filmmaker's and viewer's understanding. That is what makes Biutiful so precious.".

Rage rage against the dying of the light  Dylan Thomas Nominated for an Oscar for both Best Foreign Film and Best Actor Javier Bardem Alejandro Inarritu's Biutiful is a story about those who live on the margins Sengalese immigrants Chinese sweatshop workers smalltime criminals and corrupt cops who feed at the trough. Set in the seedy back streets of Barcelona Spain Biutiful copying a child's spelling of the word is not only about fear and degradation but also about faith in the possibility of redemption. The film not only explores the pain caused by globalization and human trafficking but also delves into the mystery and contradictions of life in which beauty and misery can exist side by side. It is not always pleasant to watch but it is an honest and often poetic film in which there are no stock characters. Even the worst of them are threedimensional human beings caught in a tangled web of circumstances.Magnificently performed by Bardem Uxbal works as a middle man finding jobs on construction sites for undocumented aliens from China and Africa and supplying goods to illegal street vendors. He must deal not only with the illegal activities he has chosen to be a part of but with his own torments  a wife Maricel Alvarez who is a prostitute and suffers from bipolar disease his two small children Ana and Mateo Hanaa Bouchaib and Guillermo Estrella who long for stability and love and a diagnosis of cancer that gives him only a few months to live. Uxbal is a character of contradictions caught between his willingness to do what it takes to survive even if it means going outside the law and his love for his family and concern for the immigrants. These contradictions do not always make sense but lend his character a lifelike reality. He is also a spiritual medium who speaks with the dead or dying who are crossing over and provides comforting messages to those left behind characteristically for a fee.The film is shot by Rodrigo Prieto with a handheld camera that enhances a feeling of intimacy. In the opening scene Uxbal is seen in a snowy forest with his grandfather who left Spain for Mexico another connection between Uxbal and the spirit world. This scene takes on more meaning by the end of the film. Inarritu throws many people and many situations into the mix perhaps too many and the subplots do not always gel. There is Uxbal's brother Tito Eduard Fernandez who is involved with drugs and strip joints and sleeps with Uxbal's wife Marambra a Sengalese family Ekweme and Ige Cheijh Ndiave and Diaryatou Daff living in Spain illegally and the relationship of two gay Chinese criminals Hai and Liwei Cheng Tai Shen and Luo Jin.When the police arrest his friend Ekweme Uxbal promises to look after his wife Ige and their infant son Samuel and Ige takes on the role of his nanny much to the delight of the children. As Uxbal's health begins to fail his ties to the crime bosses come asunder and his relationship with his family reaches a breaking point he turns to the shaman Bea Ana Wagener to seek guidance ask for forgiveness and strengthen his connection to the other side. While Uxbal is not the reincarnation of St. Francis of Assisi and has contributed to human suffering he seeks redemption in the love that he provides for his children his patience with his wife's condition and his attempts to reach out and protect the exploited.As Inarritu has said Even if darkness seems to be everywhere Biutiful offers many touches of hope. I'd even say it's my most optimistic film. Uxbal's character is full of light. He puts a lot into organizing his life helping his children loving other people. To paraphrase Walt Whitman If you have patience and indulgence towards people reexamine all you have done dismiss what insults your very soul your flesh shall become a great poem. With whatever dignity he has left and after much resistance Uxbal comes to terms with his own mortality helping him to move beyond guilt and despair to confirm the beauty and preciousness of life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Biutiful is a sublime and intense epic  and possibly the best film of the year by a long way. Even though the setting is very different the film shares themes with American Beauty and it succeeds in creating something close to a modern myth. It tells the story of Uxbal who is a tough but loving single father of two young children separated from his selfdestructive bipolar wife Marambra. He scrapes a living in the backstreet black economy of Barcelona where he operates as a middleman for those who exploit illegal immigrant labor. In addition to his dubious worldly talents Uxbal possesses the psychic gift to convey messages from the recently deceased to their grieving relatives  and sometimes he compromises his principles by accepting payment for this service. Uxbal's discordant way of life reflects the essential human condition  trapped between the spiritual and material worlds  and when he learns that he is terminally ill with cancer it seems as if his body must be manifesting his inner conflict. After his doctor informs him of his imminent death Uxbal begins searching for a trustworthy person to raise his two children after he dies  and Biutiful tells of his struggle to put his affairs in order and accomplish this apparently impossible task while dark forces throw obstacles in his path. Those who have seen Inarritu's previous film Amores Perros will find themselves in familiar territory as Uxbal weaves his way through a labyrinth of mean streets and desperate people battling for survival. On the surface there is only the selfishness and brutality of a dogeatdog world alleviated by brief moments of tenderness and selfsacrifice  but hidden amongst the chaos one can perceive the ageold journey of the immortal hero towards liberation.".

	schema:headline " Biutiful 2010";
	schema:reviewBody "Biutiful is a rather complex and interesting film one that I have to admit is still sinking in as I'm still piecing together the dots of a rather sprawling storyline. Biutiful is a film that exists within the margins of society it's everywhere we don't want to live it's everyone we don't want to meet it's all the struggles we'd rather not face and then some. As a result the film is loud violent crazy shameful desperate dirty and all other manner of words that describe the run down storefronts and apartments of the worst lived areas. Intelligently and bravely the films central idea is lost in the crowd as obscured as the desires of its inhabitants it's a confusing and chaotic place to be but it works here where it wouldn't elsewhere. I would really like to watch this one again in hopes of better connecting the dots of a life lived on the fringe of society entrenched in wrong doing but not without its struggle with sensible moral. I think the idea behind Biutiful is that life no matter how destitute and forgotten can be beautiful it all depends on how you except and claim it.Biutiful is the story of Uxbal a shady man who's life is filled with turmoil from admissions of an uncared for terminal illness to unstable lovers to unruly children to spirits of which he can commune to the lives of the underpaid migrant workers that he pimps out to whoever will employ them. It's easy for Uxbal to look back on his forty year existence and measure it in disappointments. But Uxbal is also a sensitive and caring man who is able to make these admissions and in doing so take the steps to make his life it's own unique form of biutiful but with a city more a crumbling metropolis and people who bar his progress with any step can Uxbal truly bring some semblance of beauty to his life before it is painfully cut short or will the darkness and depravity of the world around him swallow him and his desires whole the answer is well worth discovering.So I just can't say a whole lot with one viewing but there are some things that stand out immediately. The film is several things sad funny scary creepy intense and as obvious as it seems beautiful. Definitely some of the nicest camera work this year yes it's sometimes shaky but you must consider the imagery it captures some scenes are purely blissful for a film fan to witness. The editing is so great here that even though you know where the film is going its still exciting to get there. Javier Bardem gives a brilliant performance here and it will take awhile for the viewer to except that Uxbal is an undesirable but once you allow yourself to slip into his shoes you begin to really get a sense of the man and his life. The seediness of the streets and the strife and struggle of the humans in them are written all over this man and Bardem really gives himself over to this character warts and all and gives us a brilliantly flawed person worthy of our attention. The rest of the cast is also well played their stories contain their own levels of thoughtfulness and intrigue that both separates and connects to and from our protagonist intelligently. The script feels very human there are no major verses of dialogue people talk feel and behave very naturally in this film despite all coming from abnormal situations. Virtually no exposition on why this film exists its meaning is wonderfully felt but not fully explained. The direction is so subtly smart that I was surprised to miss some of the most inventive and thought provoking foreshadowing I've seen in a film. Really just an all out creative and arresting affair I'm trying hard not to use the word beautiful but its fits every gritty frame of this film. The cinematography is awesome really blown away thinking back to the brilliance of some of these shots great work with the actors and the environments. My only complaint is that sound editing got a little to jarring I get it's supposed to be an ugly film but high pitched beeps and boops are annoying anyway you cut it the 2001 monolith can suck it thanks Kubrick it drives home the madness of the setting but I actually covered my ears at one point to muffle the noise. Other than that the film is wildly challenging and rewarding for the viewer I am blown away by the artistry here it took this film to great heights it made ugly pretty which is no easy feat. If you don't like your films themes to be cut and dried you're going to want to check out pick apart and decipher the themes and mysteries of Biutiful as it is more than deserving of such treatment.So yes I liked this film quite a bit but will hasten to rave until I've fully understood the motive of it. Thematically it's no straightforward story there's something deep underneath all the grime and I'm glad I dirtied my hands on it and can't wait to do so again. A film for those who love long walks on the wild side and never choose the easy way out a real decent thinking persons movie. A film in a class of it's own that breaks conventions in the best ways possible and definitely among the years best films that I've seen thus far. Recommended.".

My only complaint is that sound editing got a little to jarring I get it's supposed to be an ugly film but high pitched beeps and boops are annoying anyway you cut it the 2001 monolith can suck it thanks Kubrick it drives home the madness of the setting but I actually covered my ears at one point to muffle the noise. Other than that the film is wildly challenging and rewarding for the viewer I am blown away by the artistry here it took this film to great heights it made ugly pretty which is no easy feat. If you don't like your films themes to be cut and dried you're going to want to check out pick apart and decipher the themes and mysteries of Biutiful as it is more than deserving of such treatment.So yes I liked this film quite a bit but will hasten to rave until I've fully understood the motive of it. Thematically it's no straightforward story there's something deep underneath all the grime and I'm glad I dirtied my hands on it and can't wait to do so again. A film for those who love long walks on the wild side and never choose the easy way out a real decent thinking persons movie. A film in a class of it's own that breaks conventions in the best ways possible and definitely among the years best films that I've seen thus far. Recommended.";

	schema:headline " Magnificently grim but also slightly metaphysical picture that is able to reveal hope out of the depths of despair for its main character";
	schema:reviewBody "Uxbal is a protagonist of the highest dramatical calibre not unlike Hamlet or Oedipus. This ailing father of two children and spouse of an unstable woman suffering from borderline syndrome and drug addiction has departed on a calvary that seems to have no end. In ever more harsh and merciless ways Uxbal is undergoing every sort of torment and kickback thrown upon him by the demons of his gravely deseased Fortune. Indeed Uxbal finds out that he is suffering from a terminal form of prostate cancer. Even though in essence Uxbal is a good man  fate seems to have chosen quite a different direction for him as where we usually believe our chance and luck to be. However in this struggle from amidst the darkness of his daily existence in the messy streets of Barcelona Uxbal somehow is able to come to term with his fate without giving in to despair. In fact through a gradual process of material disattachment he rises to a level of wise and unprecedented reconciliation with destiny as well as with the people he cares about and loves. After a long and painful journey of cancerous ordeals and unwanted horrors at the end Uxbal is ready to make his last and necessary sacrifice before he can depart into the snowy landscape of his timetranscending visionary dream of a chanceful reunification with his grandfather killed by Franco's royalists during the Civil War. At the press conference in Cannes last May 2010 Alejandro Gonzlez Inrittu declared in his vehimently articulate manner Even if darkness seems to be everywhere Biutiful offers many touches of hope. I'd even say it's my most optimistic film. Uxbal's character is full of light. He puts a lot into organising his life helping his children loving other people. Biutiful is a truly emotional and even spiritual masterpiece of the most magnificent kind. For whomever is willing or able to follow the main characters throughout their dazzling daily struggles to survive on the shady side of life in Barcelona whilst persisting in their illusionary and mostly illegal follies that are the unfortunate demonstrations of their communal longing for some warmth and wealth and happiness he or she will be rewarded with a discovery that might be as liberating and emotional for Uxbal as it will be for the viewer following his endeavours from so nearby it hurts. What Inrittu has tried throughout his ruthless fastpaced extremely honest direct and intimate style of holding the camera as close to one's skin as possible is to make us sense and realize that in the end their might indeed be something like a human soul after all. A discovery not unlike the one pursued by his tormented characters from that other masterpiece of his 21 Grams. The viewer who is able to show sympathy for Uxbal will be able to witness a most remarkable moral recovery in the inner self of our slowly but steadily vanishing hero. In a very humble but all the more remarkable way Uxbal somehow managed to keep some ray of light awake amidst the darkness that is closing in on him from the realms of his grim unfortunate reality. In the end on the threshold of his toilet and bedroom and amidst the company of his daughter and a refugee he was so kind as to adopt in his house after her husband was deported back to Africa Uxbal is able to finally reach the surface of his dignity again. This happens while he is literally dying and physially collapsing. But spiritually his ascendance back upon the slippery slope of his generous but tested and tormented mind towards a state of peacefulness and grace is a tour de force indeed. It is magical. Mysterious. Hopeful. Just like the entire encadrement of Inarritu's latest masterpiece. And just like Javier Bardem's amazing achievement to make us weep and at the same time feel happy for the faith that he was able to sustain out of the cold and unjust misery that chased him all along his final destiny.".

Biutiful is a work of extraordinary vitality and humanity with figures of untarnished quality Uxbal's children and the Senegalese immigrant who'll raise them after his death.

Death would be a welcome relief. Javier Bardem plays his role extremely well though I felt his anguish over his children and the immigrants he managed. His story gets weighed down unfortunately by the number of tragedies he must endure and the tasks he must execute. The director could have eliminatededited a few of the offpoint character traits and side stories to streamline the story for impact which would have helped the film deliver more of a meaningful punch not less. In addition the summary of this movie says Uxbal must suffer a number of tragedies on the way to redemption. I'm not sure there is any redemption here. In Children of Men the protagonist endures a lot and struggles through his own character defects to protect an black female fugee whose pregnancy provides hope for the human race. We feel joyful at the end of CofM because he has accomplished his task despite the odds. The ending of Biutiful however lacks a clear meaning and we're unsure of everyone's fate except for Uxbal's. The experience was depressing. I gave the movie an 8 because it was beautifully produced and well acted the story was original an uncommon view of Barcelona and the immigrants who go there for work under terrible conditions. But I doubt if anyone would want to see this film more than once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Biutiful is a departure and a confirmation for Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu on the one hand it is another study of lives gone awry with no punches pulled in regards to the misery experienced by the characters on the other it's the first film he's made he parted ways with screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga who preferred to move on to other projects after Babel. Biutiful proves two things firstly Inarritu remains very good at constructing memorable images secondly these aren't worth quite as much without Arriaga's words.Set in Barcelona the film ditches the filmmaker's traditional fragmented multicharacter narrative focusing solely on one imposing figure Uxbal Javier Bardem a man who has to deal with his own imminent death from cancer a dire relationship with his family wife kids and brother his ties to local criminal activities and more generally the ugliness he sees every day walking down the streets. Surely the intentionally misspelled title must be ironic.Working on the script himself Inarritu goes for a simpler story but doesn't renounce his penchant for harrowing material. In fact Biutiful is undoubtedly the least cheerful film he's directed to this day and that's saying something. His depiction of a gray ugly Barcelona is faultless exposing the city's seedy underbelly and disease both physical and spiritual with genuine relentless storytelling passion. However this is also detrimental to the film's impact without Arriaga's more experienced take on the subject the director doesn't know when to stop throwing in one tragedy after another for the best part of the movie's 148 minutes with no pause for breathing. It's almost too bleak too tragic to fully convince as a drama.Does this mean all the praise Inarritu has received in the past was premature? Not really. Even his detractors usually acknowledge his talent with actors and in this case perhaps being aware of the script's shortcomings he has hit the jackpot from start to finish Bardem is a revelation justly awarded with the Best Actor prize in Cannes. Sure he's always been a gifted thespian and no stranger to difficult parts see The Sea Inside but here he's really in a class of his own. Communicating with his sad tired eyes rather than his broken voice he carries the whole picture with a stoic dignity that is always gripping and heartbreaking.While easy to mock and criticize Biutiful for all its flaws warrants at least one viewing on the grounds that it proves beyond doubt that sometimes a truly astounding performance can save an otherwise mediocre film.".

Some may feel Biutiful boring and depressing but it will be a transcendent experience of redemption for the rest. Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu has come up with a movie that could take you to deep trenches of despair and end up on the spiritual path with a glimpse of hope Biutiful is one of the best movies of the year if not the best.. on par with Irritu's Amores Peros. It is a meditation on the dark areas of urban life It is rich with a true sociopolitical image which some might consider as a bleak world view of Irritu by portraying the marginalized multi ethnic lives of Barcelona. Story is filled with bleak images of lives of Senegalese immigrants and Chinese sweatshop workers that will remain as unforgettable visuals in our minds.. Biutiful is the story of Uxbal a terminally ill man who lives on crimes. Uxbal played by Bardem itself is a bridge between our world and the eternal a man of contradictions.For example he has a supernatural gift of speaking with the dead but ends up being purely human by charging money for it. Uxbal's wife Marambra who has bipolar disorder is a gem of a characterization. The movie has a linear narrative unlike Irritu's previous works. But don't expect a spoon fed Hollywood drama. Movie is deliberately ambiguous at times and open to multiple interpretations. Good characterizations smart script and wonderful performances along with artfully dense scenic strength of the problematic city lives aided by great cinematography make Biutiful a brilliant experience. But the trump card of the movie is a stunning performance by Javier Bardem Watch it for an improved version of Irritu and masterful acting of Bardem".

	schema:reviewBody "Life is beautiful but misspelled... This is the premise a backwards world in the eyes of a good man with beautiful intentions yet too ignorant and too overwhelmed by the world he lives in to rearrange it all the way it is supposed to be At some point however the clever premise falls through and unfortunately a true lack of creative work gives way to a lackluster ending with drawnout scenes that bring no tension or intention and make one feel that there is nothing there to say in the first place. It was a shame at some level to have such a stale climax for such a confusing body of a story. It made the completely chaotic development within the movie that had a true purpose and that I comprehend and applaud a waste of time including the trite beginningending that could have very well been left in the cutting room floor apart from the haunting dead owl over the white snow. Iarritu visibly lost track of his movie giving halfassed importance to stories such as that of the gay Chinese couple or the fact that Bardem's character could speak with dead people while ignoring others such as the relationship with the spiritual guide or with his boy and wife during his final days which could have really given him the key to open the window of this enclosed room of a movie a possibility that at one point Bardem's spiritual guide enunciates without much subtlety at all mind you go fix things up keeping us expectant and eventually leading us to much disappointment when the movie fails to deliver. Yes life is a complete mess yet there is always that hint of hope the theme gets old and Iarritu at some point in his own mess finds himself in the need of resolving without finding the right leads to do so and is forced to simplify i.e. with the Senegalese woman not stealing after all or him passing on his ringstone to his daughter quite a lame example of a symbolic moment. There is something to this story but is it misspelled? In plain words it should have been better and when good things can be better many times they are only overly ambitious which is synonymous to mediocre.".

This is the premise a backwards world in the eyes of a good man with beautiful intentions yet too ignorant and too overwhelmed by the world he lives in to rearrange it all the way it is supposed to be At some point however the clever premise falls through and unfortunately a true lack of creative work gives way to a lackluster ending with drawnout scenes that bring no tension or intention and make one feel that there is nothing there to say in the first place. It was a shame at some level to have such a stale climax for such a confusing body of a story. It made the completely chaotic development within the movie that had a true purpose and that I comprehend and applaud a waste of time including the trite beginningending that could have very well been left in the cutting room floor apart from the haunting dead owl over the white snow. Iarritu visibly lost track of his movie giving halfassed importance to stories such as that of the gay Chinese couple or the fact that Bardem's character could speak with dead people while ignoring others such as the relationship with the spiritual guide or with his boy and wife during his final days which could have really given him the key to open the window of this enclosed room of a movie a possibility that at one point Bardem's spiritual guide enunciates without much subtlety at all mind you go fix things up keeping us expectant and eventually leading us to much disappointment when the movie fails to deliver. Yes life is a complete mess yet there is always that hint of hope the theme gets old and Iarritu at some point in his own mess finds himself in the need of resolving without finding the right leads to do so and is forced to simplify i.e. with the Senegalese woman not stealing after all or him passing on his ringstone to his daughter quite a lame example of a symbolic moment. There is something to this story but is it misspelled? In plain words it should have been better and when good things can be better many times they are only overly ambitious which is synonymous to mediocre.";

This film meanders aimlessly  a wallowing journey of despair misery and hopelessness. Don't waste 2.5 hours waiting and wanting this film to improve or deliver a worthy denouement. It is absolutely horrible.I am a patron of the arts and I believe in ars gratia artis however it is ostensibly lemming pretentiousness when people view a canvas on which an artist has vomited and call it good art. Yes it may be art but just because someone says it's art doesn't make it good. Beauty is definitely in the eye of the beholder and such is the case with this film.Regarding Javier Bardem's fine acting in this film His brooding persona appears the same as in the movie No Country For Old Men sans the dark psychologically twisted murderer ingredient. This role could've been played just as well by a number of different actors. Bardem's swarthy appearance and throaty voice lend more of a grittiness to the role but come onhe's perfectly typecast review his filmography. It's not too much of a stretch to see him in this role. In my opinion good acting is when an actoractress can become the character and I don't mean method acting so as to dissociate as much of their own self as possible from the performance that the character such as Marlon Brando in The Godfather Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump or Al Pacino in Scarface.For those supercilious reviewers who applaud this film's exceptional ability to depict the dismal characteristics of the grim and squalid parts of society exploitation meager existence futility juxtaposed with thinly veiled ephemeral moments of poignancy I'm appalled to see that so many people rate this film highly in comparison with other films and docudramas which express and portray these elements more effectively. It's not significantly difficult to create a depressing film and to evoke a catharsis with the audience. Seriously what do you find that is monumentally profound about this movie? Save yourself 2.5 hours of depression unless you like that type of tortureof and watch something else.".

The script of this new movie is a complete fiasco I still don't know what was the main idea of the movie. After the first 15 minutes I started to note that something was going wrong half an hour later I was still waiting for something with substance after an hour I gave up. The lack of focus on a central idea is the main feature of this story and the characters are plain and uninteresting. The dialogues by trying to follow the plot or the lack of are consequently vague and forgettable even ridiculous. I think Irritu had just an idea and he added up a context or a background but missed the real thing. It's like a collage of non credible situations and subplots disconnected from a central theme. This script is at amateur level. Any college student majoring in film could write a better movie. I really hope this great director don't follow the path of Shyamalan letting his ego to take control instead of getting advice from the millions of screenwriters around him that can help him out. Actually I hope both go back and start doing awesome movies again someday. The fact that this movie has been praised by many critics is an insult to the common sense.".

His third film Babel on the other hand was patchy by his standards.So naturally I couldn't wait to see his new film Biutiful. Javier Bardem is the lead an actor at the height of his powers and a personal favourite since I watched him in the outrageous 'Jamon Jamon'. Bardem is Uxbal a middleaged single father operating anonymously in Barcelona's underworld. Among many questionable practices he buys fake handbags and trinkets from a Chineserun sweatshop and supplies the items to illegal African immigrants to sell to unsuspecting tourists.Uxbal also has an unusual sideline earning money for his supernatural gift  talking to the recently departed so they can pass on to the afterlife peacefully.So far so little to like about Uxbal. But there is a real sensitivity to him. He is devoted to his two children and has custody of them due to his exwife played by Marciel Alvarez habitually wreaking havoc due to her bipolar condition.Then Uxbal is diagnosed with terminal cancer and given perhaps two months to live. He is forced to reflect on his life as he tries to make amends and prepare for his imminent death. But for all his efforts his already grim existence just gets worse.Biutiful certainly is gritty and you wouldn't believe this is the same Barcelona that Bardem recently acted in Woody Allen's exuberant 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona'. For Uxbal and everyone in this film Barcelona is a hollow depressing place to live. Sociopolitical comparisons can be drawn with Stephen Frears fine film 'Dirty Pretty Things' showing the side of London most filmgoers wouldn't imagine not least the abuse of illegal immigrants.Javier Bardem is flawless a deeply soulful frail performance that carries the movie from the moment he appears on screen. Marciel Alvarez also excels as Uxbal's exwife and stands out from a high quality cast. The ever dependable Gustavo Santaolalla's haunting music captures the essence of the film.Biutiful is at times manipulative and contrived and certainly overreaches by the end. Uxbal's last few days were too much to handle you actually wished for a quick death in order to relieve himself of the sheer number of problems and issues he has to deal with many of which i haven't mentioned in this review.Death has been a constant theme in all of Inarritu's films Biutiful is no exception. By far his most intricate film not least due to a mostly linear narrative compared to Inarritu's previous multilayered outings. As uncomfortable viewing as it is Biutiful is a rewarding film and Bardem's emotional range is astonishing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Biutiful 2010 12 out of 4 Depressing story about criminal Uxbal Javier Bardem who is told by his doctors that he has prostate cancer and only a few months to live. Uxbal works in the streets of Barcelona's ghetto where he sells Chinese people to sweatshops so that they have a place to work and tries to do the best he can in the situation. Before he faces death he tries to come to terms with the future of his young children and well as making sure he goes to the next life without any debts. BIUTIFUL is a rather interesting character study because we're given a sinful man who does a lot of bad things but at the same time the screenplay makes sure that we know that evil though he's bad deep down he is good. One of the most heartbreaking sections of the film deals with his relationship with one of the Chinese women and her young son. He sells them out for cheap labor because it's his job but at the same time this is putting money in their pockets. Uxbal wants to do something good for the Chinese folks so he goes to a store to buy them heaters so that they'll at least be a little more comfortable. The directions the screenplay takes this gesture is without question one of the most powerful and haunting images of any film this year. I found the screenplay to be extremely wellwritten and I really loved how they juggled this guys final few days on Earth. It certainly makes you think what you would do in the same situation and as the final moments get closer you can't help but be devastated because of everything that happens. Running 150minutes the film doesn't take any sort cuts and instead it allows our main character to deal with everyone in his life and I enjoyed the extended running time because it makes you feel as if you really get to know Uxbal and those around him. It seems Bardem's Oscarnomination really shocked people myself included but after you see the movie you'll see why he was honored and you'll also have a hard time coming up with a reason on why he shouldn't be one of the favorites to win. Bardem is in pretty much every second of this movie and it's impossible to take you eyes off of him. There are many times when you don't need words to tell you what's going on because the actor's face tells you everything. I'm really not sure how some actors use their eyes so well but the sadness and desperation that Bardem shows was rather amazing. He has quite a bit to do here as his relationships vary depending on who he is with. The way he deals with the children were incredibly touching. The Chinese people and their outcome. There's the stuff with the wife who is sleeping with his brother. There are a lot of situations that Bardem is put in but he handles all extremely well. As Roger Ebert pointed out in his review Bardem can be beautiful ugly evil or a saint and he can do all of this on their own or wrapped up in one. The supporting players are all equally strong as is the terrific music score by Gustavo Santaolalla. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is another visual beauty as it perfectly captures the ugliness and bleakness of the streets and the overall visual look reminded me of Scorsese's MEAN STREETS. You could also say the beauty of some of the lighter moments will remind some of the work by Bunuel. BIUTIFUL isn't an easy film to sit through as it's certainly depressing and at times many will probably be looking away from the screen. Technically it's perfect and Bardem's performance makes it something truly special and worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu directed three films before Biutiful and all three of them had essentially the same positives and negatives. On one hand the man really knows how to create a scene. From the intensity that surrounded Amores Perros to the unique riveting and eyeopening night club scene in Babel each of his films were filled with incredibly memorable moments. He also brings a lot of emotional heft to each work. Albeit sometimes in cheap manipulative ways the man has never failed at bringing some tears to my eyes in each of his pictures. Biutiful is no different in either of these aspects. However it also succeeds where Innaritu's previous films had failed. His other films are far too bogged down with these silly contrived stories of one event having a drastic impact on a slew of characters. Biutiful is his first film without Guillermo Arriaga writing the script and as a result there's none of those silly gimmicks that Arriaga flooded his previous pictures with. He keeps all of his strengths as a director and got rid of the flaws that hit his films from a screen writing standpoint.What we end up with is a powerful picture that centers on one character played phenomenally by Javier Bardem. Bardem's performance here is one of grace bravery and pure authenticity. It's rare for a portrayal to not have a single false note in it but this is one of those rarities in cinema. From the moment we are introduced to him Bardem feels absolutely real. The entire film truly feels as though we are just experiencing this man's life with him and while sometimes that can be slightly dull it never feels artificial. Along with this powerful driving performance at it's core the film has some of the most beautiful images of the year emotionally hitting relationships between Bardem's character and his two children and another stirring performance by nonactor Maricel Alvarez. Innaritu has created a film that is heartfelt and real keeping the power and grittiness of his previous pictures and erasing those things that dragged them down.".

The music is a weak point although the preclimax song Saasu ji tune merit radar na jani has become a cult classic. Kader Khan is at his best as subservient husband. Farukh Sheikh also restrained does well. Salman Khan in his debut is onedimensional but saved by his goodlooks. Surprisingly Rekha was not nominated for her role although she did win that year for Khoon Bhari Maang. Watch it for the electrifying chemistry of Rekha and Bindu  and the climax which makes the film special.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you like Bollywood comedies with people constantly shouting and jumping around you might like this movie. If not better avoid it. Apart from some decent acting and a few scenes that might make you smile Biwi No. 1 Wife no. 1 has very little to offer.The story is simple enough a happily married man Salman Khan suddenly falls in love with another woman Sushmita Sen and starts cheating on his wife Karisma Kapoor. On both women in fact because he convinces the beautiful Rupali that he is still a bachelor. Thus he takes her on a trip to Switzerland where they unexpectedly meet his best friend and his wife Anil Kapoor and Tabu. Obviously it won't take long before his own wife finds out...Not exactly an ambitious plot. At times it reminds of SheDevil. The difference is mostly this while SheDevil succeeds in telling you an amusing story in Biwi No. 1 the story just serves as a vehicle to show how funny the movie is. They might as well have added a laughing track to the background. In short it's the kind of movie that you might enjoy watching if you like a sitcom type of humour but that you can forget as soon as the movie is over.What attracted me to this movie was the number of awards it had received especially Sushmita Sen who in addition is one of my favourite Bollywood actresses. Well I agree she does a bangup job in this movie but if this role really earned her so many awards I can't help thinking it must have been a really bad year in Bollywood. Karisma Kapoor who plays the title role is acting decently and convincingly but again not a memorable performance either. Anil Kapoor an excellent actor is a comedian in this movie which he managed fairly well but again not exactly a milestone in film history either. About the main character played by Salman Khan... Well I suppose you need to like him. I find him particularly irritating in this movie. Other actors like Saif Ali Khan and Tabu play roles so minor that it is hard to say anything sensible about them.All in all the plot the storytelling the acting and the music all belong to the category Seen Worse. What Biwi No. 1 really lacks however is something really good something memorable. If you haven't seen it you haven't missed a thing.".

Sushmita was at her prettiest but personally I think Karishma and Anil Kapoor walk away with the honours. Anil Kapoor had me rolling on the floor with his witty dialogue delivery.What really got my goat was the portrayal of hindu wives in this movie. Even though Salman had left her for another woman karishma still keeps trying to get him back. I think it would have been more daring to show Karishma with a bit more personality and independence. Maybe even to marry Saif Ali or something. Anyway that's my 2 cents worth.Either way a great film with good songs and dance sequences  although Salman being shorter is a bit of a let down.....".

	schema:reviewBody "I totally enjoyed watching David Dhawan's Biwi No. 1 a funny and lighthearted comedy which is both interesting and entertaining. The movie deals with adultery but it never takes itself too seriously and that's probably what makes it most fun to watch. This is the story Prem and Pooja Mehra a wealthy and happily married couple who have two kids and a big house. Prem runs a successful advertising agency and Pooja is a contented housewife. Everything seems perfect until the moment Prem meets one drop dead gorgeous model named Rupali and the couple's domestic peace is in danger. Prem enthusiastically hires Rupali as an exclusive model for his agency and the two start an affair. The problems start when Pooja finds out about her husband's infidelity and the real war begins. At first she is unable to do anything but later she gets back to senses and with the help of a close family friend named Lakhan she assertively decides to fight for her family and get her husband back. What happens then is a laugh riot to behold.Where acting is concerned every actor understands the film's mood and acts accordingly. The film belongs to Karisma Kapoor and she is wonderful as the betrayed wife who is decisive enough to get her husband back but also teach him a lesson or two. Karisma delivers a performance that is both convincing and funny and she is gorgeous more towards the latter portions of the film. Salman Khan is very good with his natural sense of humour. Two actors can be given the title of show stealer and they are Anil Kapoor and Sushmita Sen. Kapoor is absolutely hilarious as the kindhearted Lakhan who supports Pooja throughout the movie. Sushmita is way too hot to handle but more than anything her acting is excellent. She is one underrated actress who sadly never got her due. It's also sad to see a talent like Tabu in a minuscule role of zero importance but one must note the film's last scene in which she totally shines. Himani Shivpuri is awesome as Prem's mother who like Lakhan is there to help her daughter inlaw in everything and the kids do well.Biwi No. 1 shows the power of family and what a simple unassuming wife can do in order to recuperate her family but everything is done in a light and funny way with a lot of comedy involved. You just have to see the scene in which Karisma finds out about Prem and Rupali's affair. In a regular Hindi fare it would be a really huge dramatic moment but here it's incredibly amusing. The film does have serious moments of drama and they are dealt with well but they are few. I liked the ending very much although it was quite easy to predict it. I wouldn't call Biwi No. 1 a great film or something but it is an allround entertainer and I can always watch it with family and friends. I recommend this movie to lovers of Hindi cinema and to fans of David Dhawan comedies in particular.".

Though serious and commercial action films was his initial plan he moved to full fledged comedy after his Blockbuster Anakhen from 1993 and flop Aandaz from around that time. David Dhawan usually directs Sanjay Dutt Govinda Salman Khan and even Anil Kapoor with selected heroines. His lastest films are mostly craps but during the 90s he rules and even in the mid 20s he gave hits. Biwi No 1 was one of DD's earlier films when he used the same formula which worked many times execept one flop Gharwali Baharwali from around that time. Biwi No 1 was a superhit film if not a Blockbuster. The movie can be described as a superb comedy with an average story. Most DD films had brainless stories with lots of masala and silly comedy and I will admit the comedy even if silly is funny at most parts. Only disappointing DD film from the 90s would be Andaaz a remake of Toy Soldier and that too was a flop with overacting of lame comedy and average action. Biwi No 1 is the same formula it doesn't have anything new yet the comic scenes and the one liners are hilarious. Anil Kapoor deserves a hats off for his natural Punjabi act where he does hilarious comedy. Salman Khan is on of the most featured DD actors and after his combination with DD from superhit Judwaa Salman shined in most DD films. Salman Khan does a good job though his crying towards the climax gets cringeworthy and requires patience to watch. Karishman Kapoor is also a frequent DD actress and does a job well done especially in the second half. Sushmita Sen does an OK job depending heavily on her beauty and charm. She could've done better in terms of acting but she is OK. The rest including the child actor and the dog have provided good support. Songs are one of the big plus points of the film. Whether its the hilarious title song or the brilliant Shankar Mahadevan Hai Jawani Toh Ishq Hona Hai or the Chunari Chunari song most are good. But these 3 are the top chartbusters from this movie. This movie is definitely David Dhawan's best film after blockbusters like Aankhen Saajan Chale Sasural and the recent Judwaa. Biwi No 1 proves to be a good follow up and entertains. However keep in mind that if your going to watch this movie looking for realism and a very good story please skip this one because those looking for a realistic and neat story will get nothing but braindead comedy which is entertaining for most people but not for everyone!".

	schema:reviewBody "Das fliegende Klassenzimmer is a German movie from 1973 that runs for approximately 1.5 hours. There are other versions of this story from the 1950s even if they changed quite a bit in this 1970s film and a more recent one from the 21st century and I personally found all three of them pretty underwhelming. I guess it may be just Kstner's story not appealing to me at all. This one we have here will soon have its 50th anniversary and it was made by Seitz and Jacobs two filmmakers who were among the most known when it came to Germanlanguage films back then. But this does not mean that all their works were really impressive or so especially Jacobs sadly has a few stinkers in his body of work and this one here is certainly also not among his memorable movies. I am glad it was relatively short. The only pretty decent aspect in here is Joachim Blacky Fuchsberger's portrayal. He is a complete scene stealer whenever he is on screen but admittedly this is not that big of a challenge either as he is mostly sharing the screen with kids and even the grownups are maybe halfhis age and far from half his experience. Fuchsberger was in his mid40s when he made this one and is already quite a silver fox the way we remember him today. Without him this movie would certainly still have been worse. The frame with the scenes on the airplane early on and at the very ending isn't bad but even there the film is not half as successful in terms of emotion as it tries to be. And same can be said about the comedy. the kids' interactions are really uninteresting and some of their quotes are pretty cringeworthy in terms of how the writer attempted to let them talk kidsfriend so that this would not get a PG13 or so and when they are speaking and insulting each other it's pretty embarrassing too watch or I should maybe say to listen to. Anyway overall the story with the two rivaling groups of children is nothing that is good enough to carry a film of 90 minutes run time and the injury towards the end is one of the desperate shots at making this also a somewhat relevant film in terms of drama also with Fuchsberger's comment on the parallel between Unfall and Unglck. Overall I cannot say I enjoyed this color film at all. Thumbsdown from me. Not recommended.".

	schema:headline " Dr. Franco strikes again!";
	schema:reviewBody "You can say a lot of things about director Jess Franco including negative things mind you but most of all I'd like to think of him as a very clever filmmaker who always damn well knew where there was some easy money to earn! If there ever was a popular trend or franchise in horror cinema you can bet your bottom dollar that Jess Franco was part of it or at least attempted to rapidly shoot a film that profited by this particular trend. In the early 80's when the teenslasher was immensely popular Franco brutally hacked up young beauty queens in Bloody Moon and in the late 60's already he also took over the Fu Manchu series. Here in this film our beloved pal Jess further exploits the successful horror character of the evil Dr. Mabuse which was originally created by no less than the German topdirector Fritz Lang.La Venganza del Doctor Mabuse actually is one of Franco's better films of that period with delightfully twisted characters stunning locations truly beautiful camerawork and a terrific musical score. The story is of minor importance but it handles about the mean Dr. Mabuse and his accomplices stealing all kind of attributes from a National Research Institute including female staff members in order to complete his own evil mindcontrol ray. Dr. Mabuse has this impressive and horribly scarred manmonster that kills for him while the entire police force desperately tries to catch him. This film is great and trashy entertainment starring some incredibly beautiful cultsirens like Ava Garden Ewa Strmberg and Beni Cardoso...all wearing miniskirts! The action sequences are a little grotesque but Franco's directing is very stylish and surefooted. Many of Franco's later films suffer from overlong and tedious scenes but this effort is pure excitement from start to finish. Typical Franco trademarks also include that he makes references towards his earlier films more particularly the Awful Dr. Orloff and that he rewards himself with a small supportive role. Definitely one of the director's best films and simultaneously a great title to illustrate the class of early 70's euroexploitation!".

	onyx:emotionText "You can say a lot of things about director Jess Franco including negative things mind you but most of all I'd like to think of him as a very clever filmmaker who always damn well knew where there was some easy money to earn! If there ever was a popular trend or franchise in horror cinema you can bet your bottom dollar that Jess Franco was part of it or at least attempted to rapidly shoot a film that profited by this particular trend. In the early 80's when the teenslasher was immensely popular Franco brutally hacked up young beauty queens in Bloody Moon and in the late 60's already he also took over the Fu Manchu series. Here in this film our beloved pal Jess further exploits the successful horror character of the evil Dr. Mabuse which was originally created by no less than the German topdirector Fritz Lang.La Venganza del Doctor Mabuse actually is one of Franco's better films of that period with delightfully twisted characters stunning locations truly beautiful camerawork and a terrific musical score.

Dr. Mabuse and his Frankensteinlike monster assistant are stealing all the parts and scientists they need in order to build a deadly death ray. I had to view this film in Spanish without any subs so I missed out on a lot of the dialogue. Another problem is that my print was from a horrible looking 16mm copy so hopefully someone will release a remastered version with subs because I'd probably bump my grade up a half a star. The film is unlike many of Franco's films made during this period because it features no sex no nudity and no real violence. The film is all style and you can tell Franco's putting all of his serious touches on the film. The music score is very good the locations terrific and Taylor is pretty good in the title role. The monster creature is actually better than two feature films that feature the Frankenstein character. Franco plays a bit part in the film and Monica Swinn also shows up. The police in the movie are an interesting note because Franco films them in a Western type setting which goes against the rest of the movie but perhaps this is better explained in the dialogue. The movie runs a fast 74minutes and hopefully will see a legit release one day.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a hidden gem even by Jess Franco's standards. Never receiving a cinematic release it has cropped up on German television during the 1990s. It is a kind of scifi horror a partial return to the saga of Doctor Orloff from Uncle Jess's earlier films  there's even a Morphotype character Andros a disfigured henchman nicely played by Moiss Augusto Rocha. Rocha labours under makeup that is effective from a distance but not so much during the many closeups Franco has chosen to give him. The mute is regularly beaten and chastised by leatherclad Leslie Beni Cardoso.Music comes from Jess and Rolf Khn and is either ubiquitous levels of jazz or more haunting pianolead refrains. It gives the production a sophistication it may not otherwise have. The location may be the Mexican border but nothing is specified. You didn't think it would be did you?And yet a gem this is. Jenny Hering Ewa Stroemberg and her partner who is reading 'The Island of Doctor Moreau' are enjoying dressing up for each other one evening when Jenny spots Andros outside dispatching the apparently dead body of a young woman. This she reports to Stetsonsporting Inspector Thomas Fred Williams who shares a tempestuous double act with boss Crosby played by Jess Franco who also plays a drunk in a nightclub  I don't think it is supposed to be the same character. The mad scientist is villainous Farkas played by a shaggy Jack Taylor who is developing some Death Ray or other.The version I watched is dubbed into German with English subtitles. The dubbing is surprisingly meticulous. In one scene a beagle Carlos is seen to yawn in the way that dogs do with appropriate noises overlaid! This kind of attention to detail in a film for which details are a secondary thought like Farkas's specific plan and whether or not he is actually Mabuse or not is charming to me.I thoroughly enjoyed this. The pacing is refreshingly quick although perhaps we spend too much time in the company of the policemen who fail to make much in the way of progress. The locations are exceptional the whole production shines with beautiful shots and ultimately I find it curious that when lesser Franco films are available on DVD this languishes in the 'hard to find' corner of the internet. Well worth tracking down for lovers of sleazy sophistication.".

The director and one of the writers too is the infamous Jess Franco and the working title tells us already that this is his take on the longrunning prolific Dr. Mabuse franchise. But honestly the title may just have been an attempt to cash in because this feels nothing like a Mabuse film at all not just due to the absence of Fritz Lang and Gert Frbe. And I say this as somebody who isn't even a fan of the franchise. So people who like the Mabuse films will perhaps really despise this one here. First of all it is in color as pretty much always with Franco but never with Mabuse. Then it feels like a mix of spy thriller and Frankenstein movie with the characters running around like cowboys in a western movie for a large bit of the time. Franco did without the sex and erotica this time but that doesn't mean there no hot women in here. Another common theme for Franco. It's honestly nothing more than another trash movie by the master of the genre with some moments that are a bit on the memorable side for being so bad they are good already almost. But if you are looking for depth and realism this is the road you don't wanna take. Another review mentioned the psychedelic aspects here and that's certainly an accurate statement. As a whole another very bizarre movie by Jess Franco and I'd only recommend it to his most diehard fans. It's not so easy to get a hand on it anyway. Oh yeah according to IMDb this is 80 minutes long but there are shorter versions out there. I watched the DVD version in the Spanish language and that one only runs for 65 minutes. May have been censured to some extent. Overall a thumbsdown from me. Go for something else instead.".

	schema:headline " Jesus Franco's take on the Dr. Mabuse franchise.";
	schema:reviewBody "Jesus Franco's take on the Dr. Mabuse franchise...well that should sum up pretty much how this movie is like. Jesus Franco is a director who has always distinguished himself by delivering extremely bad and poor movies. He's always fascinated with putting a lot of nudity and explicit sexuality into his movies. He began early in his career by making mostly bad horror flicks in the '60's and '70's but his career has now reached a point that he's stuck to mostly softerotic movies. In many ways his career parallels that of Ed Wood's also not in the least because of the comparable qualities of their movies. Who ever gave him the green light to do a Dr. Mabuse movie? Fritz Lang is turning over in his grave.As you would expect this movie has actually very little to do with the previous Dr. Mabuse movies. It features an extremely muddled story with all kind of oddness's over it and you just simply don't bother to try and understand what the story is all about. It's some extremely bad and disjointed storytelling within this movie. Often the scenes and different characters and plot lines just don't blend in with each other.The characters Really a couple of cowboy cops? and dialogs are often just horrible and simply laughable. And yes of course the movie also features a couple of lesbian actions. A thing Jesus Franco also really seems obsessed with. The nudity and sexual content within this movie just seems terribly out of place and makes this more a 'dirty movie' than a real serious attempt by Franco. Not that I expected this in advance though.Like a typical Franco flick it's also a real cheap looking movie with bad locations laughable makeup effects what was that monster creature all about? and shot sequences without the use of any additional lighting or anything of that sort. On top of that Jesus Franco also felt to urge to compose the music for this movie. What an horrible horrible choice that was.Seriously only watchable for the fans of Francotrash.210httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The story is very realistic bitter and sad but the optimistic open conclusion relieves the tension and makes the movie more pleasant. The performances of the young Jana Pallaske and Robert Stadlober are stunning and deserved nominations to the Oscar the absence of their names withdraws any credibility of the Oscar nominations in any credible list. This film is another great example of the excellent German cinema. I liked the cinematography dark along the whole story with a kind of symbolic fusion of their spirits when they make love in the swimming pool and with light when the couple reaches the mountains transmitting a beautiful final message of hope and peace.

	schema:reviewBody "Engel  Joe or Engel  Joe or Hexe  Zottel is a German movie from 2001 so this one had its 15th anniversary last year and it runs for slightly over 1.5 hours. It is the most known work so far by director Vanessa Jopp who is also one of the writers working on the script here. The cast includes Robert Stadlober playing one title character and he was quite a star in German back then but rightfully today he is basically not a factor at all anymore when it comes to new films. He is certainly all about his looks that probably aren't too much mainstream but also nothing special. Talent is missing entirely in him. His female colead is played by Jana Pallaske and while she is certainly enjoying a better career than Stadlober these days there is also a reason why she appears on Dancing with the Stars the German version instead of Homeland. With her looks fading so will her career. The only reason why she looks somewhat fine in this film we have here is because her male colead is extremely untalented and makes it fairly easy for her. Those crying and screaming scenes by Stadlober were 100 cringe. In general the character of Engel cringy name too is all about the looks really the costumes the makeup and who plays him is entirely irrelevant at least with Stadlober's approach.Another cringeworthy thing here is the title. Reading it it becomes somewhat clear with the English name in the second half as well as the  instead of und that they had some ambition for this film to make an impact internationally too. It does none of that. The talent simply isn't there neither behind nor in front of the camera. Even with all the plot twists they included drug abuse prostitution pregnancy... the film never tells a meaningful message. Instead they made sure on all kinds of occasions that we never forget how beautiful Pallaske is by having characters verbally applaud her looks all the time. Guess what we already know the first time we see her. Another huge problem is that the filmmakers really tried so hard that we would like the two main characters but how is it possible to like either. One is a drugaddicted smalltime crook homeless pseudopunk very poor man's Farin Urlaub the other is a young woman who sleeps right away with one guy after getting engaged to another and apparently neither contraception nor her baby child are really important to her either.Oh yeah and when you believe that the film has hit rockbottom on enough occasions already then the ending happens. We have a young man suffering strongly from drug withdrawal so what do we do? Yeah lets go on a trip to the mountains. Of course this will solve everything. Forced happy ending that has nothing to do with realism? Check. This film is a gigantic failure and it is shocking to see so many people work on the script and then we gets unrealistic quotes from start to finish and a plot or several plots that aren't remotely working either. I suggest you stay far far away from this one. Highly not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "This review refers to the Englishlanguage version of F.P.1 which was made in simultaneous German and Frenchlanguage versions with three different casts. The Frenchlanguage version is presumed to be lost.F.P.1 is of greatest interest as one of very few science fiction features made in the 1930s. Curt Siodmak's screenplay was based on his own novella the story of Flight Platform 1 a huge aircraft refueling station in mid Atlantic. Designed to aid transoceanic flight it frustrates surface shipping interests who connive to destroy it. Amidst the intrigue is a love triangle between the F.P.1's creator his aviator buddy and the shipping heiress who makes it all possible.It's a great premise with some unique model and effects work and moments of real adventure. However there just isn't enough of them. It's not just that the airplane and action scenes are so brief the German version included a good bit more. It's that what is left over is so typically tepid and slowmoving  a real tragedy for a film with any pretense to futurism. Result a muddle though an intermittently entertaining one.And what the heck is Conrad Veidt that preening sinister aristocrat of the B's doing playing a daring roundtheworld aviator? His Major Elissen spends more time in white tie and tails than in a flight suit and his appeal to strongheaded heiress Claire Jill Esmond delectable in white satin evening dress is hard to explain. Perhaps he slipped something into her drink. Veidt didn't yet speak English very well in 1932 and his performance is a bit off leering and simpering over Esmond rather than enveloping her in suave allure. His sidekick Sunshine Donald Calthorp a shabby news photographer could have been Veidt's comic foil if he weren't so very underplayed.Claire eventually does throw Elissen over in favor of his best pal straightarrow Commander Droste Leslie Fenton Nails Nathan from The Public Enemy designercaptain of the F.P.1. The romance angle recedes at that point. Droste is merely a standup guy although he needs Elissen's help not just to build the F.P.1 but eventually to save it from the shipping cabal.An actual floating soundstage was built in the Baltic Sea just off Hamburg for the F.P.1 sequences. It's fascinating to see with its broad expanse of concrete flight deck humungous ballast valve system and chromium Art Deco chairs for Elissen to throw through windows during a gas attack. Yet Elissen's plane is an opencockpit Junkers whose slab sides and corrugated aluminum skin give it all the grace and aerodynamics of a grain silo. And few other planes  except a derelict old crate  figure in the action. The Germanlanguage version F.P.1 Antwortet Nicht F.P.1 Doesn't Answer retains more of the technogeek footage and is worth hunting down if you are curious. Not that it's much better in pacing or performance. Hans Albers and Paul Hartmann the male leads are way overage for their roles and Albers is an awful ham even if you don't understand a word of German. But there's Sybille Schmitz as a strong and hauntingly sexy Claire and Peter Lorre as the sidekick has a more substantial piece of the picture.An aside in the narrative unintentionally calls the whole F.P.1 concept into question. Elissen at one point is said to be flying a new plane that can go around the world without refueling! You have to love a scifi flick where the key technology is already obsolete by the end of the second reel.The real problem with F.P.1 was beyond the director's or the studios' control. It should have been made by Frank Capra then still in his Poverty Row adventure days Flight Dirigible. It positively cries out for Joel McCrea Fay Wray a streamlined Lockheed Vega monoplane and Americanstyle snappy patter to leaven the love stuff. And what a formidable Sunshine Lionel Stander might have made...".

It is a floating island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean for transatlantic aircraft to land on and refuel. It therefore foreshadows the naval aircraft carriers of the coming world war. Conrad Veidt is extraordinarily convincing with the mad recklessness of a man addicted to dangerous adventures but also with the lonely pathos which this brings him personally. It is one of his finer roles. The imaginative sweep of this semisci fi story is remarkable for the 1930s. It is a pity that the film is not better known. I have not seen the German or French versions but this one is superb. One of the most haunting shots in the film is of a lengthy corridor full of men who have been gassed and are lying unconscious. No expense was spared to make this a big production. However the producers should have realized that films with initials in their titles do not 'click' at the box office give no hint to anyone what they are about except to those familiar with this novel already and no one could imagine what F.P.1 could stand for until they had seen the film! As a milestone in the history of the cinema this strange and wildly ambitious film should not be overlooked.".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess this was supposed to be an early science fiction  adventure story about an aviator with personality quirks but I couldn't find myself interested in the plot very much.What was with Conrad Veidt's teeth in this movie? His front teeth all had huge gaps in them which made them look black. He looked old before his time he actually looked better years later playing Major Strasser in Casablanca which was released only a year before he dropped dead from a heart attack in 1943. Warner Brothers obviously knew how to package him so that he looked more debonair in the later film. Poor guy he really needed a dentist. I couldn't get into the tame romantic scenes at all since Jill Esmond who played Claire very pretty first wife of Sir Lawrence Olivier looked young enough to be his granddaughter.I watched the English video version put out by Video Yesteryear. Halfway through the tape it got interrupted by a PLEASE STAND BY WHILE WE CHANGE REELS message. I burst out laughing. What was that for? I bought this to watch the performances of the principals and to see Warwick Ward in another film other than the Pola Negri one I watched awhile ago with him in it from 1929. Had trouble finding him at first but he played the First Officer. Handsome man very intense eyes. Maybe he should have been given the role of the rival for Jill Esmond's character's affections.5 out of 10. Interesting as an example of an early sound Brit film but not much else.".

My German Studies teacher the focus of the class is contemporary German culture and using film as a source had us all meet there and see it. We got to meet the director and ask him all kinds of questions.He revealed that this movie was created in a unique fashion almost all of the acting was improvised and only very few scenes were scripted and that was only done for consistency. The crew was EXTREMELY small consisting of mainly the 4 main actors Dresen a cameraman and a audio person. Everything was on the spot and improvised giving the movie an almost documentarylike quality and many scenes were filmed on a whim. In fact Dresen revealed that the interviews that are interspersed throughout the movie he did not mean to originally include. They were only meant to see if the actors were in character and to see how they as their character would respond to the given questions and situations. To give the movie an authentic and natural feel each actor in fact spent some time I believe Dresen said a few months actually working the job that they had in the movie. Also Uwe is only shown smoking constantly because the actor Axel is a chain smoker. The musicians playing out of the toilet was originally a fleeting suggestions the group 17 Hippies had made and Dresen never intended to keep. The scene where Katrin walks alone in the snow was filmed basically before the movie had a plot with hopes that it could possibly be included somewhere along the way. The dentist scene was a fleeting suggestion that Axel had made he told Dresen that he was going to the dentist and if maybe he wanted to come along and film something that could be used in the movie in his role as Uwe. In fact the real dentist's nurse refused to be on camera and Dresen had to get someone from his small crew to stand in for the position in the shot but the actual operation and tooth removal is all REAL live footage. Alsothe first time Uwe tells the musician outside the stand to go away he was never supposed to go back out and yell at him to go down to the lamppost and in fact the musician was not supposed to obey him and move down there. Apparently the 17 Hippes the musicians were so convincing as street musicians that when the crew was not filming people would actually throw them change. I apologize for these revelations not being in any particular order but I found them fascinating and wanted to share them.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Scandinavian Dogme rules have found their way abroad. That's what I first thought after seeing this movie. No use of artificial sets everything filmed with a handheld camera... even the story reminded me of those movies. Is that a good or a bad thing I hear you think. Well personally I like that kind of movies but if you are only used to watch the mayor American blockbusters then you better leave this movie alone because this certainly isn't what you will be looking for.The story of the movie is quite simple. Two married couples who both have been married for quite some time see each other regularly. One couple is made up by Chris a radio DJ and Katrin who works at a truck stop. The other couple is formed by Uwe who owns a small snack  grill bar and Ellen who works in sales at a perfume shop. Ellen isn't very happy in her marriage with Uwe and when she starts an affair with Chris all seems to get better for her. But then they get caught by Katrin who walks in on them while they are bathing together and everything explodes. Each of them has a completely different way of dealing with it and while some weird things happen around them the events force them to think about their marriages their friendship the relationships with each other and so many more things...As I already said this entire movie feels a lot like it has been influenced by the Scandinavian Dogme rules. I know that there aren't too many people who like that but personally I do. Most of the time it offers honest cinema without too much extra's and that's exactly what you'll get from this movie as well. The relationships between the four leads are real and believable as are the people themselves they don't look like smart Barbie dolls but are normal human beings. Add to this a story which forms the most important part of the movie that isn't spoiled by some kind of spectacular stunt work but offers some fine comic relieves so now and then especially with the band that stands before Uwe's snack bar and grows larger every day even though he tells them to leave and you know that you have a nice movie. Overall this is definitely a movie that deserves to be seen by a larger audience. A good story and some fine acting with this one they prove that a good film doesn't need more. That's why I give it a 7.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "I heard about the movie from a friend who had seen it at the Berlinale Film Festival in 2002 where the movie actually won the Silver Bear Award in this year. He only told me about a little quite but funny movie which is taking place in a city in the eastern part of Germany former GDR but he didn't wanted to spoil it. Halbe Treppe literally means as much as on at to be half stairs or if one has climbed a few steps one finds itself at half stairs. This idiom does not make sense in German either so my conclusion was that this is a term only used in the former GDR i do not understand because i grew up in the western part of Germany. There are a few expressions only used in the GDR but now being used in all parts of Germany. My anticipation of the plot was something about living in typical socialistic suburban dwellings in the eastern part of Germany where the term Halbe Treppe is used for something i do not know. I forgot about the movie and finally watched it a few days ago on TV gladly without commercial breaks and i was absolutely surprised when i found out that Halbe Treppe is the name Uwe's Grillpoint the English title! which is situated between 2 stairs at Halbe Treppe! In my eyes the story in this movie could take place anywhere in Germany Europe but maybe the city of FrankfurtOder was not coincidentally chosen by the director. Well i have been there but many people from the old federal states and some from the new states too in Germany think FrankfurtOder is the end of the world the worst place to live in Germany because the city is situated head to head to the polish city Slubice bordered by the river Oder. For people from the U.S. maybe it is comparable to Tijuana but without the fence!! In the meantime Poland has become a full member of the EU so far but prejudices about Poland are though. Everything is different People language currency habits prices low. While Slubice is economically growing and growing Frankfurt is struggling with unemployment and disillusioned citizens where a lot of them have already moved away from the city for more information have a look at the English Wikipedia. It's very satirical when Chris crosses the border to rent a polish hotel room just to save the money if he and Ellen want to meet secretly Even cheating German couples support the polish economy due to cheaper prices! It must be great fun for the director to confuse the viewer with a story about the relationship of 2 couples if one expects a plot about the life in a struggling city emphasized by the fact that the movie is shot in the depressive mood of winter. Although my expectation of the movie were completely wrong i was hooked up immediately and always thought the situations the characters experience must end up in a tragic and sad disaster but the terrific comical elements the search for the escaped budgie the people who think Chris is a fortune teller who predicted the power failure make this movie a brilliant piece of German cinema.".

While the plot management could have been better though it does entertain one of the major problems you can find is the camera direction. As opposite as one may think working with a hand camera as Lars von Trier does in his Dogmas isn't a piece of cake but a matter of great care. If not you may get some really bad shots that would be the equivalent of shutting down the video and record an audio only scene. This is what happens here There is a couple of scenes mostly the ones in the cars where all you get to see is the face of the character speaking covering the 90 of your screen and then i switches to the face of the interlocutor. That and a couple of gratuitous scenes like the one with the dentist that may have been deleted are the big flaws you may find in the movie. As a conclusion I may say that I don't regret having seen this movie but it didn't change my life either.".

	schema:reviewBody "Das Haus in Montevideo is a West German Germanlanguage movie from 1951 so it has its 65th anniversary this year. This is one of the later career efforts by German filmmaker Curt Goetz who was in his 60s already when he made this one. And with made I am talking about him being a codirector cowriter and lead actor here. And he also plays the central character here. The plot here on IMDb actually sounds pretty interesting for this 105minute movie. A clean tidy family who lives in accordance with morals has a daughter who earns a fortune but she only gets the money if there is a big event of immorality taking place. So can you sell your approach to life for a huge sum? It sounds actually pretty deep and significant also from a drama perspective but it really isn't. It is pretty much all about the hullabaloo and shenanigans especially these of the father Goetz' character. His performance is also pretty solid I guess but I found none of the other performances memorable whatsoever. And as decent as the plot sounds and as funny it is still a film that really drags a lot on many occasions I have to say. Maybe it would have been best to keep it relatively short in the tradition of old German movie legends like Ernst Lubitsch and Karl Valentin. At 3540 minutes it may have been a really funny watch. But at not much under 2 hours it certainly isn't. There is an okay moment here and there but there are also weak moments with comedic intent that isn't working and has not aged well at all. And I don't think that this is just by today's standards. As a whole the film lacks focus essentiality and significance. This is also the main reason why I do not recommend this Germanlanguage blackandwhite film. Thumbs down from me. If you still wentwant to watch it let me tell you that there is a Heinz Rhmann version of the film from more than a decade later and that one may be better. I haven't seen it yet but Rhmann usually always delivers. Then again it's not really difficult or a challenge to be better than this one we have here.".

They even have to take time to recover after they receive a beating! It is a testament to Takashi that he can produce such empathy for these characters. His direction is polished and at times superb. One scene employs a single 8 minute take with no edits to emphasize the effect of relativity that the protagonist must be encountering on her fruitless attempts to escape and it is inspired. Takashi's trademark use of wide angle lenses is also at an apex in this movie serving to enhance the effect of bodily movements while at the same time trapping the characters between the foreground and background thereby outlining their plight their lack of freedom is rooted in their desire to fulfil their destiny yet at the same time despising what they do. The violence is balletic and certainly tips it's hat to the Hong Kong heroic bloodshed movies of John Woo et al but Takashi manages to make the set pieces his own by incorporating these formalistic camera techniques into realistic circumstances to draw the viewer into the world he has created. This is similar to Scorcese's Raging Bull where extremely formalistic techniques create a very realistic impression on the audience. The story deals with some familiar themes from Japanese cinema revenge rape malefemale power relations etc... and Takashi's use of motifs helps to relate the characters to one another and outline their connections. Even the title relates to the dichotomy facing our protagonist. The internal conflict of Ikko is mirrored by the external conflicts upon which she embarks. Black Angel is well conceived well shot and well acted and deserves to be ranked among contemporary Japanese cinema's finest.".

Both films have a lowbudget feel to them and evoke moods in much the same way that Wong KarWai's Chungking Express films do. Ishii really does a lot with this film even though it is considerably based on action movie cliches.  Fortunately he manages to breathe some life into it with some excellent camera work including a particularly wellfilmed continuous shot and the great performances of Riona Hazuki and Reiko Takashima as the two main female protagonists. One particular scene of note Early in the film Ishii breaks up the heavy crime drama with a strangely placed song and dance number that is composed of one long 3 minute shot from one angle.  Very strange.  It actually made me think of Franois Truffaut's Shoot the Pianot Player.  Early in that film a ridiculous dance number in the bar breaks up the tension in much the same way.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is part one of Takashi Ishii's Black Angel double feature.  The two films aren't connected by characters just a similar general plot focused on female killers.  Both films have a lowbudget feel to them and evoke moods in much the same way that Wong KarWai's Chungking Express films do. Ishii really does a lot with this film even though it is considerably based on action movie cliches.  Fortunately he manages to breathe some life into it with some excellent camera work including a particularly wellfilmed continuous shot and the great performances of Riona Hazuki and Reiko Takashima as the two main female protagonists. One particular scene of note Early in the film Ishii breaks up the heavy crime drama with a strangely placed song and dance number that is composed of one long 3 minute shot from one angle.  Very strange.  It actually made me think of Franois Truffaut's Shoot the Pianot Player.  Early in that film a ridiculous dance number in the bar breaks up the tension in much the same way.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know why so many people love flashy but empty Hong Kong action movies when there are much darker more violent and interesting crime and horror movies over in Japan! Quentin Tarantino's brilliant 'Kill Bill' is inspired by much of this stuff specifically Kinji Fukasaku's amazing 'Battle Royale' and Takashi Miike's mindblowing 'Ichi The Killer' so I'm hoping that it signals the beginning of a lot more attention from Western audiences on the seemingly endless invention of the more extreme end of the Japanese film industry.  The work of Takashi Ishii 'Evil Dead Trap'  as writer only  'Gonin' 'Freezer' hasn't received as much attention as the more flamboyant and controversial Miike but in his own way he's just as exciting. And while watching 'The Black Angel' I couldn't help but wonder if it was a favourite of Tarantino's. Babelicious Riona Hazuki plays Ikko who returns from the US to avenge her parents who were killed in front of her when she was a small girl. Mayo a mysterious and beautiful assassin called The Black Angel Reiko Takashima helped her escape from Japan as a child so now as an adult she borrows that name. Ikko is intent on killing yakuza boss Nogi the man responsible for the death of her mother and father only she doesn't realize that Mayo is now Nogi's reluctant mistress and that there meeting again is inevitable. 'The Black Angel' is an extremely cool movie. Ishii is a very inventive and original director who constantly surprises the viewer moving from an unexpected light hearted dance number to a confronting torture sequence. His characters aren't cliched and predictable and you are always on your toes. I highly recommend this movie and his other yakuza thriller 'Gonin' another film which takes a familiar theme and subverts it in fascinating ways. Forget old hat John Woo and Jackie Chan try the Takashis Miike and Ishii!".

At that time Ikko returns to Japan with the intent to kill all of those responsible for the murder of her family which includes the 3rd woman Chiaki Amaoka Miyuki Ono who also happens to be her stepsister. Now initially this was somewhat difficult to understand because of the fastpaced violence combined with the language barrier. However as the movie continues it eventually explains itself and all of the pieces of the puzzle come together at the very end. At any rate those who enjoy action movies will probably like this film.

Just pick the one you like the most. Furthermore take this line 'Accompany the last assassinatrix to her final mission.' Why on Earth would our heroine be the last female to kill for money? Will she do something that makes her job less attractive to other females? Will we see an atomic blast in the end which tears our little planet and its entire population with it apart?Fans of Jericho be advised you won't see ascending mushroom clouds this time. And the Black Angel is not a carrier adviser. It also turns out that she is not killing for money but instead out of revenge. Luckily or not she is the only one whose motives are absolutely clear. Having said that we can't really see apart from one case any character development throughout the movie. What we can see are scenes that can be familiar from Kill Bill namely massacres of armed personal body guards who are practically waiting for their rounds to be killed. However long minutes are inserted between those actionfilled fragments which can cast a bored expression on your face. For example we can learn that in Japan organized crime has close ties with politics and the police  however this is the case for almost every country in the world. Overall the movie is able to add up nothing or very little to what you might already know about Japan. I also have to mention the art director's work he did a really good job when he set up a television on a puddle  at least he made me smile. The free adaptation of the yellow bulldozer from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is also a notable point.In short mindless massacres flat storyline no character development no educational content very limited humor.".

I was pleased with the sequel to Gonin yet Black Angel Vol 1 never really impressed me. The story and direction were both excellently executed but a lack of characterisation made it rather tedious at times. What made Gonin so brilliant were the different motivations and emotions of the main characters. Thankfully with Black Angel 2 Ishii returns to creating good solid characters. The main three protagonists in this film are each well designed characters that make this an superior film to its predecessor. What starts out as a rather simple film builds up to an excellent finish that will definitely satisfy fans of Yakuza thrillers. As with most of his films Ishii is not afraid to include graphic scenes of rape and violence but he is able to counter these with scenes featuring touching displays of love and humanity. While Ishii has a way to go before equaling the brilliant Takeshi Kitano or Miike Takashi with this film he is returning to the form of Gonin that could open him up to being amongst the best directors in Japan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Takashi Ishii strikes gold again with this darknoir style thriller which takes us deeper into the world of the Black Angel Mayo this time portrayed by Yuki Amami. I have to say that after watching this movie I was greatly impressed at Ishii's style of storytelling and the nitty gritty feeling that he adds to this movie. From start to finish the film is gripping and it never lets go with its violent look at the Yakuza lifestyle in modern day Japan.On the streets of Shinjuku Yakuza gangs are vying for power and the only way to sit at the top of the class is to remove the crime bosses that are currently in power from their seat at the table. That's where Mayo Yuki Amami the Black Angel comes in. Hired by her reputation alone the Black Angel is an assassin who has never missed a target and always honors her end of the business deal and expects her employers to do the same. However her years of contract killing have really taken a toll on her spirit and now Mayo has turned to booze as a means of dealing with her guilt. On her latest assignment though Mayo finds herself on a collision course with Yamabe the bodyguard of the current boss of a yakuza outfit in the Shinjuku prefecture. Yamabe has his own innerdemons to deal with especially since he made vow to the new boss' father that he would protect the son no matter what. When Mayo is tasked with killing the son a simply contract turns into a total disaster when a rival hitteam get in the way and a pregnant woman named Suzu gets caught in the crossfire. From that point on Mayo Yamabe and Suzu's paths will intertwine as they find themselves in the crosshairs of each others guns as well as the Yakuza that is trying to stamp the three of them out.Don't wanna give away too much but this film has cultclassic written all over it and if some people think this is a sequel to the first it's really not. It's more of a prequel that tells more about Mayo and her life as a gun for hire. Ishii's directing with the use of flashbacks combined with a dark and ominous atmosphere really adds tension to the movie and the characterization for Mayo Yamabe and Suzu is really good. Also Ishii doesn't pull any punches when he shows the abuse that the women go through in this movie particularly for Suzu and she gets the worst treatment in this movie. At one point you have to wonder if the protagonists in this film will even survive or if anyone can truly be trusted but then again this is a sort of gangster flick so loyalty is totally overrated when it comes to fighting for power in the criminal underground. But overall Ishii certainly kicks things up with Black Angel 2 and there are times that I wish he'd make a third.Definitely recommend this film for those who love Japanese girls with guns style flicks. Be warned though the violence is extreme and the brutality shown is not for the faint of heart.".

This is the Hong Kong remake of Luc Besson's classic La Femme Nikita which is one of the greatest action pieces in the world of cinema. Black Cat fails to be great even though it is made in Hong Kong where action films are usually unmatchable. ErikaCatherineBlack Cat is a violent young female who goes to jail and has the same offer as in Nikita to become an assassin to the government. She starts the training and once she's ready and skilled enough the killings may start. What follows is tired scenes and nothing special in the whole movie. The action scenes are okay and stylish at times especially during the credits but they are so few and can't save the whole film. There is absolutely no depth in the characters Leung Simon Yam or others and the film is pretty irritating to watch because it offers nothing more than just gun fires and action which are nothing special considered this is made in the land of Woo Lam Mak and other great directors. So I can't recommend this too much but Hong Kong fans will want to check it out and so did I. This could have been far far worse and due to the few stylish scenes and images in the film it is not too impossible to sit through and in fact I've watched this two times now. 410".

This could have been far far worse and due to the few stylish scenes and images in the film it is not too impossible to sit through and in fact I've watched this two times now. 410";

Unlike the first film Black Cat has everything you thought Nikita had hardcore violence and gritty realism. The film follows a young female drifter Jade Leung who gets into trouble whilst in Canada. She's deemed uncontrollable and unfit for society. After a speedy trial she's condemned for life. That's until a suave C.I.A. agent Simon Yam gives her a second chance at life but with brutal consequences. A dark and dreary film with no light at the end of the tunnel. Jade Leung a former glamor model is perfect as the Black Cat. A hit man who has no feelings or emotions just a tool for the government. But like all machines they break down will she give into her emotions or will she go through her missions like a good slave? Check out Black Cat!Highly recommended.Followed by Black Cat 2 The Assassination of Boris Yeltsin.".

She then continues her job as the perfect assassin and a weapon of destruction.When I first saw this movie in the '90s the theme seemed too far fetched. The premise of the story was too far out there for me to relate to. This caused me to lose interest in the story. But now that we know that there really is a super soldier program like this called the MK ULTRA and it's off shoot the Monarch project conducted by the US secret government I now realize that this movie was actually 15 years ahead of its time.Like in real life there is no spy like James Bond who's so visible to the public there is no super soldier like Hei Mao Black Cat in real life. So this movie is like a James Bond version of the MK ULTRA. Even the part that she has a chip implanted in her brain is like the real life MK ULTRA soldier Duncan O'Finion. I'd have to applaud the far reaching imagination of the script writers.The movie is really vividly made with settings done like a real life MK ULTRA soldier might be in. Like she appears in the U.S. as a starters. The story could have taken place 100 in China or Hong Kong but for some reason the writers chose America for the killings to take place. Her mode of operation her relation to the agency that created her. The way the agency calls her to activate her all are straight out of MK ULTRA.Was all this a coincidence or did the writers knew more than they are alluding to in this movie ? With the real life MK ULTRA soldiers coming out nowadays the Black cat is out of the bag.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tagline Trashy HK entertainment at its best Review by Neo HK in the 90s is known for creating just as much trash as classic movies. Black Cat does not qualify as a classic but as far as trashy entertainment is concerned it is really pure guilty pleasure. Imagine someone who killed a police and in the process being recruited by the CIA and somehow become a CIA agent. As bizarre as it seems it didn't really matter as the film is ultimately fun in a trashy way.In the early 90s it is almost truism to say that any movie that look trashy sleazy and with some degree of sexual tension there will be the ever dependable Simon Yam. Yam is easily an underrated actor whose talent is still yet to be recognised within the HK Films Award. It is a shame as Yam is certainly someone who has come a long way since those Cat III days and one just need to glimpse at recent films like Eye in the Sky and Election for any indication. Here he is the typical early 90s Simon Yam whose screen presence alone allows him to ease through his supporting role.Playing the title character of the Black Cat is Jade Leung her raw and uncomforting acting makes her perfect for the role. The opening scene may seem a bit too staged but Leung's facial expressions when she kills the guy and the cop is just priceless to endure. However due to not fault to Leung's effort one must wonder why the director Stephen Shin didn't bother developing her character further. While the Black Cat succeeds in being trashy yet entertaining it is once again another case of what could have been. With the ending perfectly panned out for a sequel following Black Cat 2 is already on the list of upcoming movies Neo is going to watch.All in all the Black Cat isn't really trying to do too much nor is the director aiming for such lofty ambitions. Still somehow the flick manages to succeed all its trashy goals and the result is giving the audience some guilty pleasure. Perhaps Neo is just abnormal but in all truthfulness Black Cat isn't going to win any awards. Still for mindless entertainment alone you can probably get a lot worst than this and for one last time Black Cat is just plain trashy fun Neo 2008 I rate it 7.7510www.thehkneo.com".

	schema:headline " Patrick Swayze's third personal favorite underrated best action film he ever did!";
	schema:reviewBody "Black Dog 1998 is Patrick Swayze's underrated unappreciated explosive nonstop highspeed adrenalinepumping highway road war action film! This is my third favorite personal favorite Patrick Swayze's film! The first two are Road House and Steel Dawn but Black Dog is my third favorite film and I love this film to death! Just recently finished watching this and I love it so damn much. I love Patrick Swayze's characters Nomad Dalton and Jack Crews those are all my favorite characters! Directed by Kevin Hooks the director who directed awful Die Hard copycat film Passenger 57 and Fled this film is very decent and a damn solid good action film of the 90's and finally Kevin Hooks made a movie that I love. The only way to stay alive is to keep moving. Plot An excon takes a job driving a truck cross country. What he doesn't know is that the truck is filled with illegal weapons and now he must fight to survive and save his family. Patrick Swayze is back and he teams up with Randy Travis and Meat Loaf to deliver explosive nonstop highspeed action in this adrenalinepumping highway road war. A 40ton truck is a lethal weapon and veteran driver Jack Crews Swayze knows how to use it. Desperate for cash he's got one last delivery to make. The trip's barely begun when he and partner Earl Travis discover they've been set up and are being chased by Red Meat Loaf a relentless fanatic who's as deadly as he is greedy. Now with his family his life and his freedom on the line Jack's going to buckle up put the pedal down and show Red and the Feds a thing or two about road rage. After being doublecrossed and rudely underestimated Jack and Earl shift gears becoming a twoman wrecking crew trucking down the highway blazing a trail of dieselpowered destruction.This film is for all of truck drivers out there this movie is great not to many movies like this. Trucker that does not know of this movie it is not a trucker. This movie it should be in every driving school great movie. The acting in this movie is very decent and solid Patrick Swayze is always awesome and fantastic! Randy Travis as Patrick's partner was excellent! Meat Loaf as the villain in this movie was fantastic! Jack Crews Patrick Swayze is an ex con and a truck driver who desperately needs the money to support his family and pay off his deb for the house. He accepts the offer from his manager to make a delivery from Atlanta to New Jersey a lot's of toilets' for 10000  so he thinks this is cool easy money so he does what he is told too on he's trip he find's out that he was set up and he is transporting illegal guns and now he has to fight for his life and for his family. Black Dog is Patrick Swayze's best underrated highway speed action movie that was released before The Fast and the Furious come out it is an action film of the late 90's that I will always cherish and love to death. This movie is very underrated solid action film. I love it to death. I have this movie on Bluray the same Patrick Swayze movie I have on Bluray are Steel Dawn Road House and this film they are all in my collection but I don't have Uncommon Valor because that film was never released on Bluray I am still waiting on the release. Black Dog is a 1998 action film directed by Kevin Hooks and starring Patrick Swayze. The film tells the story of a trucker and excon who is manipulated into transporting illegal arms. The film costars musicians Randy Travis and Meat Loaf.R.I.P.  Patrick Swayze 1952  2009 I really miss you so much and I wish you could do more bad ass action movies I am your biggest fan and so was my mom we all miss you and we all love you I love you to death! Black Dog why doesn't THAT film get the cultappreciationnotice of this POS Steel Dawn underrated and Road House are my top 3 personal favorite Patrick Swayze movies he ever did! This movie get's 10 out 10 for Patrick Swayze's best underrated action movie he ever did alongside with Road House!

	schema:reviewBody "Black Dog starts as just out on parole truck mechanic Jack Crews Patrick Swayze is called into the office by his boss Cutler Graham Beckel he tells Jack he's got a job for him to drive a truck from Atlanta to new Jersey  he'll get paid 10000 for it. Jack isn't keen on the idea since he has no license  wants to stay out of trouble for his families sake at home that night Jack finds a foreclosure letter hidden by his wife from the bank who are going to repossess his families house. Amazingly they owe the bank 9000 so that 10000 he was offered just hours before suddenly looks very tempting. Jack accepts the job but soon finds himself hauling a lorry of guns which are being tracked by the FBI  local redneck scumbag Red Meat Loaf wants to hijack the truck  steal them for himself I guess Jack is just having one of those days...Directed Kevin Hooks Black Dog is a cheesy but sort of fun action flick that could have been better but also could have been worse. The somewhat predictable script by William Mickelberry  Dan Vining doesn't take itself too seriously  feels like an extended version of the final climatic truck chase from Mad Max 2 1981 in the sense Jack has to protect his truck from all sorts of marauding bad guy's obviously Swayze is no Mel Gibson  the two don't compare in terms of excitement or quality but that's what I kept think while I was watching it. The character's are clichd  one dimensional but they serve their purpose well enough there's some alright oneliners including a funny one where a bad guy ends up splattered on the road  Swayze says 'Eeww roadkill'! That line alone is almost worth watching this for. It certainly moves along at a brisk enough pace you've got your bad guy's  you've got your good guy's as well as those caught up in the middle  you know what I actually thought Black Dog was pretty fun it's not art but it's entertaining  how can you not like a film in which the main villain is Meat Loaf  the main hero is Patrick Swayze? You can't  it's as simple  straight forward as that.Director Hooks does alright some of the truck crashes are impressive although the actual chase scenes lack a little spark they are OK but not quite as exciting as I'd have liked. There's not much violence apart from a few shootouts  a fight at the end. Talking of the end even though Swayze has been hauling a lorry of guns  making lots of things blow up the FBI give him back his license they let him go scott free they take care of his 9000 debt  let him drive the truck to the police pound. Isn't that a bit well generous? I mean he beat Cutler up didn't he? That in itself is assault  it doesn't matter if the guy he beat up is a scumbag either also what about all the destruction he caused? Surely he broke the terms of his parole somewhere along the way didn't he?Technically the film is fine it looks like it had some money spent on it although it doesn't quite look like a mega budget affair. The acting is OK Swayze looks bored  embarrassed Meat Loaf is Meat Loaf while Charles S. Dutton puts in a funny performance as FBI agent Alan Ford Ford? Trucks? Is that meant to be an injoke because I ain't laughing guy's!.Black Dog is a silly cheesy  amusing way to pass 90 odd minutes it's a light hearted action flick using big trucks. It's watchable enough for sure.".

This isn't simply a music video stretched out to an hourandahalf.  This director actually knows how to make a movie.  The plot ain't deep but there IS a plot which is important.  The ideas are dopey but the actors aren't simply laughing their way through but rather they treated this like a serious work.

Patrick is pretty much always fun to see act in any movie that he is in other than the banter back and forth from the EvilGraeme Beckel's character who had taken his wife played by Brenda Strong the woman walking down the street only in a 'bra' that caused 'Kramer' from Seinfeld to crash his car T.V.s Seinfeld and daughter then making it through that Hellish chase situation and accident only to lose a new found friend 'Sonny' the F.B.I. man suddenly being sideswiped by The heavierweightcoupon clippingJimmy Swaggartwannabeevil boss Singer rock staractor Meatloaf at the end of this flick Jack Swayze can't get an even break. However this is how most big budget Studio production houses usually take it into their hands to change a movie script until the believable is now ridiculous usually at the end of a movie. Kind of like when Sidney J Furie made Superman IV and the Studio execs slashed his budget in half...this time however at pretty much the last minute before scene shooting got started. But Blackdog is entertaining and funthe cast is a great cast. Heck with a good beer it gets even better. But please if you must drink stay at home and be nice to those around you.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the genre movie that this is it's a pretty enjoyable movie to watch. It's definitely no worse or better than any other similar simple straightforward action flick from the '90's.Of course the movie is suffering from more than 1 problem though. One obviously is its story. It's simple and actually doesn't make a lot of sense and is a real unlikely one. I mean why did Red ever let the truck drive off from his place only to dangerously attempt to hijack it later on the very same day. But oh well without this story we wouldn't had all those exploding trucks and action scenes within this movie.Well it's not like the action is much spectacular though. Funny enough there are lots of exploding trucks and cars but they already seem to blow up when one of the passengers farts. Actionwise this movie just isn't good or spectacular enough to watch.Another problem with the movie is that it has far too many villains in it. It's like the main characters against the rest of the world. The movie also doesn't seem to be able to make a choice who to make the main and most important villain of the movie with as a result that all of the villainous characters aren't really anything memorable or evil enough since the movie spends to much time on showing the many different villainous characters of the movie.The movie is from the period when Patrick Swayze's career of course already was more or less on a death end. Nevertheless he's always good and serious with every role that he plays. He's also credible in this role despite his already showing age. He was perhaps a tad bit too old at the time of this movie to play the main lead in an action movie. Meat Loaf mostly seemed to have had fun with playing his role which shows on the screen. But like I said before since he plays a villain he didn't get the screen time he deserved. There are parts in the movie were he completely disappears only to show up 20 minutes later again.But despite this all the movie is good and entertaining enough to watch. It's current rating on here would suggest that this is one of the worst action flicks of the '90's but it hardly is. It's also no better than some action flicks but also definitely no worse than some others.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

There are parts in the movie were he completely disappears only to show up 20 minutes later again.But despite this all the movie is good and entertaining enough to watch. It's current rating on here would suggest that this is one of the worst action flicks of the '90's but it hardly is. It's also no better than some action flicks but also definitely no worse than some others.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

I said screw the test and watched this movie.I have never been a fan of Mr. Swayze. Didn't see Dirty Dancing or that movie where he plays a tough bouncer. Didn't want to. But this movie is very good for what it is worth. First of all I compare the storyline to Smokey and the Bandit....except minus the humor and lamentably the actors. The movie is about a excon trying to save his house by driving a truck full of illegal weapons across the eastern seaboard. You've got some great people in this movie Patrick Swayze he looks like he could be a truck driver Randy Travis who I admit I didn't recognize with the beard. I have no idea why he grew it Possibly 50 Cent's brother. No doubt..when you see this man who isn't related you'll hear Wanksta begin playing And the best Bloated Bible Thumping Meat Old Ass Bat Out Of Hell Loaf..who I cant believe actually CHOSE that name. This movie is not geared towards film buffs nor does it pretend to do so. This movie is for those who love the road and Cannonball Run the first one only jeez or Smokey and The BanditNumbers 1 and 3..Dom Deluise and that retarded elephant killed number 2 The rest of the characters are a joke especially the FBI agents...ever seen Pardon The Interruption? but this movie is nothing more than an exciting and hard to stop watching road classic. Plus I live near where they drive the truck through how about some love for South Carolina and N. Carolina looks amazing in the movie So In conclusion don't put down your Dead Poets Society or your Good Will Hunting for this but sit back with a beer and enjoy this modern classic.".

It is about a truckie who is driving a truck filled with firearms while guys come along try to kill them and get the guns. Meat Loaf's acting performance wasn't great he should have just made a contribution to the soundtrack and I thought he was overthetop at the end racing a truck wildly raving and chanting bible verses. But the action scenes are good despite the unrealism. Explosions happen when they wouldn't normally and shooting people doesn't seem to do anything but make them wince. At one stage Patrick Swayze is beating a guy up on the truck and Meat Loaf comes along in his utetype vehicle and shoots him in his arm. He winces but he keeps punching with the same vengeance and strength as before. Despite lack of credibility it was an exciting adventure and was a film about truckdriving which I have never actually seen in a movie before. Overall it was great and the chase scenes are very welldone sometimes. If you aren't expecting too much and don't mind unrealistic things and you like action movies see this.".

He agrees to do the job so he can save his house and life hood.Not known to Jack his load contains illegal weapons that his boss is selling to gangs in the country. Jack gets to the truck stop when meets the boss Red Meatloaf. Jack chooses the truck he wants to use to pull the load. Jack finally gets on the road with a guy named Earl Randy Travis in the passenger seat and two another guys named Sonny and Wes following at the rear in Sonny's car.Soon the trip gets rough and deadly Red is working for Jack's boss and wants the load. But Jack doesn't give up and wants to put on a fight soon its a dangerous game of cat and mouse across the country. To make matters worse the FBI and ATF are also on Jacks tale trying to stop him to grab the illegal load.This is a very fun movie Kevin Hooks keeps the action non stop as Jack is trying to get the load home. The special effects are fantastic and they really destroyed a number of semi trucks for the movie. The only downfall is the ending the ending is pretty basic and sometimes even disappoints but apart from that the movie is pretty fun and very underrated. The soundtrack is also a great one.".

It starts out ignoring the fact that Crews is carrying illegal weapons and ignores the moral issues this may throw up regarding the film painting him as a good man it then focuses on big truck action with plenty of cars trucks jeeps blowing up and skidding all round the place.  The second half keeps some of this action but it realises that it needs to end with Crews being a good guy and suddenly the guns issue is brought up and it looks for a happy thriller style end.  The plot is quite unlikely  Why did Red suddenly seem happy to steal this load  he'd never done it before and the twists aren't exactly a surprise.  The action is distracting for the most part  but overblown spectacle doesn't replace genuine excitement and as Burt Reynolds discovered how many times can you watch a truck crash before it gets old.The performances are not great.  Swayze is poor and just has a pained expression on his face throughout.  Meat Loaf is a not so much a meatloaf as he is a huge glazed ham  he overacts and looks bugeyed like he was in one of his videos.  Charles Dutton and Stephen Tobolowsky aren't great but their oddcouple interplay at least makes them interesting.  The rest of the cast are familiar faces Randy Travis Gabriel Casseus etc but don't really have very much to do.Overall it's quite enjoyable because the action scenes are quite good.  The story is daft and the actors don't have much to do but the sheer spectacle of it covers the whole for most of the film.  Almost.  The final five minutes is dumb and typical of the film's sense of spectacle over substance.".

	schema:reviewBody "I honestly wasn't expecting too much from this movie but for what I got I was entertained and never bored. BLACK DOG is a fairly standard late90's Bgrade action movie but its colorful characters help it to transcend the genre clichs and make it somewhat memorable. The basic plot is that Jack Crews Patrick Swayze is in need of some extra money and agrees to take a truckdriving job transporting some goods. Little does he know that it's some illegal guns and soon he has people on his trail as he tries to make the delivery.I've never been too much of a Patrick Swayze fan mostly because I don't think he can act that well. He has some charisma for sure but the only movie I've really enjoyed him in prior to this was ROAD HOUSE. Here he doesn't get that kind of a role to play but thankfully the supporting players pick up the slack and make the movie worth watching. Of those cast members the most entertaining were Meat Loaf as a Biblequoting madman and Charles Dutton and Stephen Tobolowsky as a bickering FBI and ATF agent respectively. Their short scene that opens the film is in my opinion the best part and sort of sets the tone for what follows at least when they're on screen. Randy Travis also has a supporting role but all they can do with him is make jokes and references to his reallife career as a country singer.In general the acting was decent for this type of movie. The action of course was welldone. By virtue of being produced before Hollywood became obsessed with CGI and shakycam this film features real stunts real explosions and crisp clean action sequences done with some flair. Yes having cars and trucks explode on impact in a collision is ridiculous but it's also ridiculously entertaining to watch. Most importantly the truckdriving sequences were filmed in an interesting way and actually on the highway. Other positives I can think of are a suitably bombastic score and some gentle soundtrack cuts courtesy of Randy Travis. I don't really care for country music but he's one person I can tolerate.The negative aspects I can mention are all fairly standard for the genre. There's a lot of plot holes story threads that aren't followed up on or at least satisfactorily and of course the premise. Part of this can be chalked up to the run time. At 89 minutes it is a little light on story and character development but then again it didn't exactly need to be complex. Overall this was much more fun than I was anticipating. It's by no means a good movie but it's pretty entertaining for what it is. When all is said and done there's a lot worse ways to spend your time. Also they do explain what the title means in case you were wondering.".

He shouts threats over the phone that are unfortunately not aimed at whoever talked him into signing on to this film to begin with. Brenda Strong plays Swayze's wife who likely suspects his bullshit and just plays good wife because that is all the screenplay can summon her to do.

Brenda Strong plays Swayze's wife who likely suspects his bullshit and just plays good wife because that is all the screenplay can summon her to do. The film is about as exciting as a kick in the crotch. A suggestion would be to use one of those trucks to run this film over. Score 1  10";

If it weren't for the explicit versions I think most folks would forget about them soon after viewing unless just gawking at naked gals here and there in the guise of a legitimate film is your kind of thing. The BIG problem with Emanuelle In America is that it can't make up its mind if it wants to be mere exploitation or hardcore as it bounces back and forth but never really completes those goals.Li'l Miss Sexpot herself Laura Gemser is Miss Emanuelle who will travel anywhere and subject herself to any danger in order to get an ultimate story to further her journalistic endeavors her sneaking around and snapping pics reminded me a lot of later Charlie's Angels adventures. She joins a harem of sorts and fondles women and watches bestiality mingles with horny aristocrats gets an expose of a women's pleasure resort ah finally a bunch of naked men in a movie and shmoozes with bad men behind a snuff film ring. Yes a film like this DOES need lots of sex to keep it going but it's strange how much of it doesn't show up until much later.When sex scenes start they end abruptly like a bad tease. During the sex lots of jumpcuts jar the viewer so that it's not easy to get any pleasure out of viewing it. When hardcore footage appears it usually never finishes okay there's a lack of money shots. When there ARE money shots the scene has zipped by so fast you wonder if you were supposed to get excited or think that folks finish sexual encounters within one minute or less. Sex scenes in films like this are usually intended to arouse and these leave you somewhat confused.Here is where I DEFEND something about this film Those people who are only turned on by shaved squeakylooking pretty people in porn should not be so harsh to those of us who actually like a bit of body hair on men or if women aren't so artistically trimmed. I have a feeling that most are bitching about the hairy men because of the bearded guy in the hut in the Tarzan fantasy sequence. If anything his hirsute appearance enhanced the energy of the toobrief scene and I'm sure there are plenty of folks that appreciated a naturallooking man instead of plastic pretty boys. As for the women it's funny how so many reviewers are calling the actresses unattractive  seems there are too many men out there that have ridiculously high standards for women. I didn't find these women unattractive if anything they seemed real and still even out of the league that most of the drooling heterosexual viewers would ever get in real life. You know the kind guys with beer guts who wear hats and tshirts that say No Fat Chicks and think that all women are inherently bisexual. I say HOORAY for '70s hairy porn let's have more of it!For me instead of being creeped out by physically follicleblessed men I was creeped out by the sordid footage of the snuff films. Instead of a glimpse of one we are subjected to several scenes of it and it reminds me of those harsh slasher films that get women naked before they are dismembered. Are we supposed to be aroused by the nudity AND the physical violence at the same time? Otherwise why so much of it in this film? I say fill out the other basic hardcore sex scenes more and less of the poles and hooks being used as sexual torture. And to think David Cronenberg got his inspiration for Videodrome from this film.....eek!So take a look at Emanuelle In America so you can say you saw it and if you got a kick out it then it's actually okay. I saw it as a curiosity that had to be done and over with. It just really felt like a longgggg tease to me so that I had to dig into my stash of hairy '70s porn afterwards to feel satiated!".

	schema:reviewBody "Smut King Joe D'Amato does it again!!! Smokin' hot exotic beauty Laura Gemser plays a globetrotting nympho journalist in this incredible installment of the Emanuelle films. This one has everything  sleazy sex and lesbianism insanely cheesy music and dialogue simulated snuff footage even some beastiality for you true sickos out there  it really doesn't get much better than this. EMANUELLE IN America should be THE sleaze standard that all other exploitation films aim to match.Emanuelle begins her adventures by going undercover pun absolutely intended... and infiltrating a harem run by a wealthy businessman. Lots of tits and ass ensue including several softcore lesbo scenes. The Boss is a man of pretty discriminating tastes as we're treated to the first real shock of the film  and a doozy it is  a voyeuristic peep at a chick graphically jerking off a horse named Pedro!!! Inside the harem our heroine meets an Italian aristocrat and decides to use him as her next journalistic feature. After escaping the harem Emanuelle goes to visit this refined gent just to find that he too is a pervert with a pension for counterfeit artwork and orgy dinner parties. This scene gives us an opportunity to view our first hardcore action of the film a pretty protracted blowjob scene. While at the party our hardworking hottie learns of a secret brothel where women can indulge in any freakish fantasy...for a price. Of course Emanuelle smells another juicy scoop so off to the meatfarm it is. There we get a few actual hardcore porn scenes including a little Tarzan and Jane roleplaying and some 2on1 interracial action for one lucky young lady. While peeping in on the going's on at the brothel Emanuelle comes across a room where a lady is getting boned while she's watching some snuff material on a projector. This piques our randy reporter's interest and she heads back to headquarters to consult her boss about tracking down some more snuff films for an exclusive story. Her boss gives Emanuelle a guy's name who's known to run in those circles and our sexy scribe does what she does best  seduces this poor joker into giving her the info she wants. This scene has some pretty rough simulated snuff material in it including hottar dildo forcefeeding vaginal hook impalement and some pretty graphic forced breast reduction. Emanuelle takes her findings back to her boss who tells her the material can never be released due to it's supercontroversial nature. Peeved about the coverup Emanuelle heads to the jungle with her sometimes boyfriend Bill for some RR  this scene feels pretty out of place and nothing of any real note goes on here  and that's about it.There are definitely some strange continuity faults with this film  such as the fact that all of the sex scenes in the beginning of the film are pretty light and standard 70's softcore with the exception of the stallion handjob... and then towards the middle and end all the sudden we're treated to some pretty hardcore full on penetration sex action. Also the violence at the end is totally out of place with the rest of the film  but honestly I find these quirks kind of endearing and actually help the overall buildup of the film. I also liked how tips from one undercover investigation made a smooth segue into the next investigation. My only real gripe is that the insanely hot Gemser is not shown in any of the hardcore sex scenes...this would have been a true plearsure and would have shot this film up to an 11. Personally I loved this film and hold it at the very top of the 70's exploitation genre out of all of the films of this type that I've seen so far. A definite mustsee for fans of extreme sleaze  Highly recommended  910".

	schema:reviewBody "Emanuelle in America has the reputation of being one of the sleaziest most vile films ever made. Well having watched it a couple of times I have to say that its reputation is a tad overblown. Yes the average moviegoing public would probably be offended by many parts of EIA but when you think about those objectionable scenes they're not that freaky. There is much worse on the internet right now than what is seen briefly in EIA. EIA was made during the greatest period of exploitation films a period which alas will never be recreated again. The mores of the 1970s made it possible for films to explore the sleaziest darkest part of the human psyche. Remember these films were released theatrically. There's almost no chance today for a film like EIA to be released on the big screen no matter how many sleazy or super violent films have been made recently like hmm Passion of the Christ? Arf! Anyway there's something backwards and ahead of its time about Emanuelle in America. It's painfully backwards in the attempts the producers tried to shock jaded 42nd ave viewers with bestiality and such but forward thinking in the way sex is shown so carefree and dare I say fun? It's like the realization of a silly Penthouse forum story made come to life...seriously the film is sexy in only the way 1970s can be. The beginning is great. Seeing Laura walking around New York which the groovy theme song makes EIA look like an adult version of the MARY TYLER MOORE show intro Laura is a free woman who's almost always in control a career woman and is sexually active. The only thing missing in the intro is Laura tossing a hat in the air.The biggest problem with Emanuelle in America is the script. Films like this are not known to have solid scripts but the producers actually tried to create a semblance of an interesting story amidst the sleaze and lurid goings on but then completely forgot a satisfactory ending for this. I love the fact that film suddenly veered into snufflike territory at the very end but it became sorta pointless without a proper conclusion to that last minute plot line.All in all I think Emanuelle in America is a masterpiece of 1970s exploitation. It has almost every exploitation element in it the only thing missing like most of exploitation films is male homosexuality. Laura Gemser is hot. The music is amazing and the cinematography is actually pretty good. I only give it 8 because of the missing ending and because of some boring drawnout spots.If want to see a film that captures the warped side of the 1970s in all its Eurocult glory make sure to watch Emanuelle in America.".

Meeting and even more than that..! an influential politician Emuanuelle finds a trail to the legendarynotorious snuffmovies where real humans are tortured and killed on film...A very interesting story but sadly the execution is only average because Emanuelle in America is nothing else but typical 1970s standard soft sex! When youve seen one example of the endless Emanuelleseries youve seenem all  this movie is no exception! In my opinion the sickest scene is featured in the 30th minute when a naked girl caresses the dick of a horse. Then nothings gonna happen... After one hour the first blow jobscene is brought on and in the last third the movie there are some short hardcore takes filmed.And then at the very end youve got to see those notorious snuffsequences..! Yes they are extremely violent! Yes they are extremely disturbing!! However they have a pretty short running time from about 15 seconds all together and they are quite similar to those featured in Pasolinis Salo. And I cant get rid of that feeling director Joe DAmato only added them to give this after all very tame movie some shocking and provoking impulses..!If you want to see a real sick Joe DAmatomovie watch his splatterfest Buio Omega instead!!!".

Emmanuelle in America stars beautiful Laura Gemser as a reporter and the plot involves her as she is forced to do and watch horrible things in order to do her job. This includes making love to every male she meets seeing some disgusting perversions and finally very vile snuff takes on video. In other words this film is exactly what the whole exploitation genre is about.I found couple of scenes very off putting and I don't think too many can say they actually LIKED this one. I understand that horror fans and marginal cinema lovers will want to check this out just as a curiosity but it is very hard to imagine anyone liking what they see. Well maybe some perverts out there..The most disgusting thing was the genuine horse masturbation scene near the beginning and that is something only D'Amato could have the guts to show I think. There is also pretty large amount of hard core porn footage so if you can't handle XXX material stay away as well. There is one orgy scene in which room full of people scre with one another and that is REALLY dirty scene. I think you have got the point by now what the film is about so no more about these scenes After the slow beginning the real nature of the film reveals and that consists mostly of scenes mentioned above!The notorious snuff scenes at the end are fake but so incredibly realistic and made me feel VERY sick. How the heck would someone like to shoot stuff like that? Shame on you D'Amato! They are as gratuitous as this film as a whole but maybe this had its audience because otherwise D'Amato wouldn't have made this in the first place. That's why because he always knew what public wanted and made movies only because of money. He has also done couple of better films which can be seen as real films too and they include the legendary Anthropophagous the Beast and Goblin composed Buio Omega. D'Amato was businessman in the field of cinema but fortunately there are also some noteworthy films in his filmography. And he has also produced many great films like Michele Soavi's brilliant debut Aquarius internationally known as Stage Fright and Bloody Bird so his career was definitely not bad as a whole.Emmanuelle In America is legendary sleaze fest and as dirty as this kind of trash can be. Only twisted minds like me want to check this out but I don't think many will actually like what they see. Even exploitation and trash can be worth many viewing times and cinematically noteworthy but that cannot be said about Emmanuelle in America in my opinion.510 but very difficult to tell why!".

	schema:headline " The Personification of Joe D'Amato's Work";
	schema:reviewBody "There are basically two kinds people in this world those who like smut and those who don't.  Those who like it should revel in the work of Aristede Massaccesi a.k.a. Joe D'Amato.  Those who don't should stay as far away from it as humanly possible.  However I see myself as that rare someone who is able to walk the line that divides them.  I can watch a D'Amato film from beginning to end but will have a storm of mixed feelings afterwards.  The first Joe D'Amato film I saw was either Emmanuelle Around the World Emmanuelle in Bangkok or Emmanuelle and the Last Cannibals.  I saw them on Showtime andor the Movie Channel now called Starz back in late '92 and early '93.  I was not familiar with D'Amato at the time I was intrigued by the star Laura Gemser.  I had seen her in another Emmanuelle film called Emmanuelle Queen of Sados not directed by D'Amato and was struck by her exotic beauty.  I had always been a fan of 70s movies and many of the Gemser and D'Amato films had the texture of kung fu movies exploitation movies and other genres of that time.  Unfortunately the cable stations stopped showing them and the only ones I could find at the local video stores were the aforementioned Emmanuelle Queen of Sados and Black Cobra a softcore film directed by D'Amato with Gemser and Jack Palance.  But finally in 1995 I jumped on the information superhighway and thanks to many cult films sites on the net I was able to find many if not all of these films and purchase them.  Upon receiving the videos I soon realized that I wasn't as seasoned a Joe D'Amato fan as I thought.  I watched Black Emmanuelle Gemser's first outing in the title role and Erotic Nights of the Living Dead I was shocked in find her in a hard core scene in the former with Angelo Infanti the same guy who blew up Michael Corleone's wife in The Godfather!  I'm not going to say I've never watched pornography but it wasn't what I was looking for.  In fact I would find out later and much to my relief that a body double was used to substitute Gemser in the scene. I was still however shocked to find these films I had seen late on Friday and Saturday nights contained graphic often violent scenes of hardcore sex. It took some adjusting but I found that I was still curious.  I tried to find Emmanuelle in America the unofficial grand daddy of 'em all on the net but tracking it would prove not to be so simple.  The online store that was supplying it appeared to have ran out of copies.  So I went on to buy other D'Amato films like Caligula the Untold Story.  Though I was taken aback by the graphic scenes I wasn't surprised by them.  Finally I found another site that carried it.  Though I was anxious I must admit I was eager to see it especially the infamous snuff film at this point I feel obligated to point out that it is well documented that the snuff footage seen in the movie was staged so please don't go awry trying to contact the FBI to confiscate the film.  I finally saw Emmanuelle in America' and its most famous seen.  I found I wasn't as jaded as I thought as I found myself quite disturbed by the footage.  Emmanuelle thought she saw it in a dream but when her boss at the paper shows her photos of the crime she replies much to my shock Amazing.  I burst out laughing at her quip but when the film reached its anticlimactic end I was surprised to find that Emmanuelle did not further investigate the sadistic crime then I thought to myself It's a Joe D'Amato flick.  What do you expect? And I burst out in laughter again.".

Those who don't should stay as far away from it as humanly possible.  However I see myself as that rare someone who is able to walk the line that divides them.  I can watch a D'Amato film from beginning to end but will have a storm of mixed feelings afterwards.  The first Joe D'Amato film I saw was either Emmanuelle Around the World Emmanuelle in Bangkok or Emmanuelle and the Last Cannibals.  I saw them on Showtime andor the Movie Channel now called Starz back in late '92 and early '93.  I was not familiar with D'Amato at the time I was intrigued by the star Laura Gemser.  I had seen her in another Emmanuelle film called Emmanuelle Queen of Sados not directed by D'Amato and was struck by her exotic beauty.  I had always been a fan of 70s movies and many of the Gemser and D'Amato films had the texture of kung fu movies exploitation movies and other genres of that time.  Unfortunately the cable stations stopped showing them and the only ones I could find at the local video stores were the aforementioned Emmanuelle Queen of Sados and Black Cobra a softcore film directed by D'Amato with Gemser and Jack Palance.  But finally in 1995 I jumped on the information superhighway and thanks to many cult films sites on the net I was able to find many if not all of these films and purchase them.  Upon receiving the videos I soon realized that I wasn't as seasoned a Joe D'Amato fan as I thought.  I watched Black Emmanuelle Gemser's first outing in the title role and Erotic Nights of the Living Dead I was shocked in find her in a hard core scene in the former with Angelo Infanti the same guy who blew up Michael Corleone's wife in The Godfather!  I'm not going to say I've never watched pornography but it wasn't what I was looking for.  In fact I would find out later and much to my relief that a body double was used to substitute Gemser in the scene. I was still however shocked to find these films I had seen late on Friday and Saturday nights contained graphic often violent scenes of hardcore sex. It took some adjusting but I found that I was still curious.  I tried to find Emmanuelle in America the unofficial grand daddy of 'em all on the net but tracking it would prove not to be so simple.  The online store that was supplying it appeared to have ran out of copies.  So I went on to buy other D'Amato films like Caligula the Untold Story.  Though I was taken aback by the graphic scenes I wasn't surprised by them.  Finally I found another site that carried it.  Though I was anxious I must admit I was eager to see it especially the infamous snuff film at this point I feel obligated to point out that it is well documented that the snuff footage seen in the movie was staged so please don't go awry trying to contact the FBI to confiscate the film.  I finally saw Emmanuelle in America' and its most famous seen.  I found I wasn't as jaded as I thought as I found myself quite disturbed by the footage.  Emmanuelle thought she saw it in a dream but when her boss at the paper shows her photos of the crime she replies much to my shock Amazing.  I burst out laughing at her quip but when the film reached its anticlimactic end I was surprised to find that Emmanuelle did not further investigate the sadistic crime then I thought to myself It's a Joe D'Amato flick.  What do you expect? And I burst out in laughter again.";

In this case Emanuelle Laura Gemser is a libidinous fashion photographer and photojournalist who travels to various locations and not just in America though she is New Yorkbased notsosurreptitiously snapping photos of wealthy people having sex almost no one questions why she insists on wearing that ugly pendant even while she herself is having sex.

First you're watching a halfhearted lesbian coupling in a steam room then next thing you know you see a woman fondling an erect horse penis surprise!. Then it's back into hardR territory until you suddenly see a woman performing fellatio on a man not a horse presented in a decidedly tripleX fashionparticularly jarring when up until this point Emanuelle's America is a land where men seldom even remove their shirts to have sex let alone their pants. There's more hardX scenes to follow none of which involve Gemser but whatever prurient thrills that provides are quickly dashed by the horrific snuff film footage that follows. Scenes of women getting hot oil poured down their throats and getting nipples torn off are a definite moodkiller yet they're presented matteroffactly here making their brutality that much more appalling.That's not to say I hated this movie. The gorgeous Laura Gemser is a compelling screen presence though to be a sex goddess she's quite detached in her sex scenes looking more like she's posing for a still photograph.

Emanuelle goes abroad to look for a story any story. The plot is VERY secondary to getting the beautiful Miss Gemser naked as much as possible. But of course this being a D'Amato film that's not enough for him so he throws in bestiality real and snuff fake but disturbing.

The rest of film still only featured Laura Gemser looking pretty as a picture staring vacantly into the camera and holding endless boring conversations that didn't lead the story anywhere.Snuff!  The word must have hit D'Amato like a heavensent flash or perhaps from somewhere a bit further south. Hence the film would contain three rather short scenes of men torturing and eventually killing naked women in front of a camera which eventually gave Emanuelle in America its notoriety.

Yes we know they're bogus but the images if not the idea alone remain creepy even 30 years down the road.Need I mention that neither unsimulated sex nor fake snuff sequences make Emanuelle in America a good movie? Without said scenes the movies would be an extreme bore about as entertaining as a 3rd graders schoolplay  containing said scenes it remains a footnote in the filmrecords of gorehounds and pornhistorians.2 from 10 for the film itself 2 more for soundtrack and creepiness of the snuffscenes makes 4 from 10 and more generous than that it doesn't get.".

As Emanuelle and a group of friends watch through the window a woman performs a sexual act on a horse. This is not simulated bestiality. Somewhere or other the director found an actress willing to molest a horse.It starts to get truly freaky when Emanuelle stumbles upon a snuff film ring. At first we only see very grainy 'snuff' footage. However in the film's climax we are treated to the filming of a snuff picture from the perspective of a woman under the influence of LSD. This distorted view only makes the footage more disturbing.What makes the film particularly odd is that it shifts back and forth between playful soft core and disturbing exploitation. For example the aforementioned snuff scene is followed by a tropical island frolic. The change in tone is jarring to say the least.The film does benefit from good production values. There is some very nice camera work and it has a cool 70s rock soundtrack. However the bizarre plot line makes it an odd if memorable film experience.".

This documentary didn't have all the recreations of History Channel and many many other well done docs but for it's time it was finely executed. It used real footage authentic photos and actual quotations. Reynard was used as to compare Hitler and his ego. If you ever read Reynard or studied the story Reynard the Fox was medieval Europe's trickster figure a nasty but charismatic character who was always in trouble but always able to talk his way out of any retribution. I thought that this movie is a beautiful study of human tragedy as well as human condition. I could find no contradictions nor any reason to not study this movie as a piece of art and history. In 1962 this topic was still so fresh and unbelievable in peoples' minds that to see this from their perspective would have been shocking and unbelievable.

The folktale is illustrated with static woodcuts you half expect a picture of Vlad Tepes somewhere along the way.

Well perhaps at the time it was among the best films about him or perhaps the AMPAS members just liked the idea of an antiNazi film hardly a risky decision on their part!.

I wasn't sure what exactly I was getting myself into but I was interested in finding out what the son of Osamu Tezuka Makoto Tezuka could do.What I witnessed was a visually stunning film drenched with atmosphere held back only by underdeveloped main storyline or should I say climax. To say that the story was bad is inaccurate. After the quite intense opening I quickly learned that this film was going to offer much much more than a typical murder mystery gory as it may be in parts the characters are so interesting and enjoyable to observe I almost forgot about the grisly slaying that punctuate the film throughout.In fact when the climax did in fact arrive it almost seemed to abrupt. Though the film clocks in at a little over two hours so much time is spent soaking us beautiful imagery and tense atmosphere that the revelations in the final scenes seem out of the blue. Perhaps much more could have been done in regards to this but seeing that this film had a rocky path to cinema release perhaps some things were out of Mr Tezuka Junior's hands.As stated above the film is shot wonderfully with great colour compositions and clever visual arrangements. The use of CGI in the film is minimal but it is high enough in quality to fool those of more literal mindsets. The sound design is also worth a mention as it really adds to the dark and foreboding mood of the rain drenched glistening imagery and cramped and cluttered spaces.Much has been said about Tezuka's references to other film makers in this film particularly Hitchcock but for what it's worth it isn't a negative aspect. It isn't cheap and I think it is a sincere attempt by the director to show us as filmgoers just what makes him tick. The medical aspects of the story perhaps echo Makoto's own upbringing his father being a doctor originally and I like to think that this film reflects his father's work much closer than people have assumed an exploration of humanity and human life.That is what I see this film is and the murders are just an enabler for the real dissections to take place.".

I was simply amazed by this tense atmosphere! A perfect example how to stage such a thriller full of uncertainty fear and suspicion.So why then disappointment? Well the horrible thing is that within the storyline at the very end weakness is concealed.Of course there are few other slight negatives like some rare awkward moments when the acting felt kind of enforced. And also when the editing was really strange when the plot jumped in an incomprehensible way to a total different place so the storyflow felt kind of broken. But in contrary i have to say that there were sometimes ingenious moments of the editing when only few seconds were cut out this had an interesting staccato effect.I wouldn't say that the story itself is that bad because throughout the film the storyline makes perfectly sense and is combined with the masterly crafted atmosphere very compelling. The only problem is that the ending feels rushed and the explanation was to me way too incomplete. I was just a bit dissatisfied after the long yet amazing buildup. I don't want to spoil anything so i will keep my mouth shut about the precise fact why this solution was so insipid to me. But maybe other people won't be that bothered by it it is still only my opinion.I just want to say that you should definitely watch this film if you already have an interest in it. Do not hesitate! You will definitely enjoy it! In many aspects i would even call it a masterpiece!! .. but .. it is just simply that .. damn solution!! ".

There is much to be said for this gruesome and good looking film not least the convincing performances by the two female leads. They are both referred to as 'halves' and I assume that in reality both are AngloJapanese which clearly helps their looks and hence the modelling career but seems to set up jealousies and dislikes along the way. There are some fantastic neon and rain drenched scenes seemingly filmed around the Shinjuku district of Tokyo and imaginative soundtrack effects which are often most unnerving. Indeed the films begins amazingly well and then treats us to the most horrendously elaborate kill its just that to maintain such a long running time the twists and turns have to be such that in the end you feel slightly cheated.".

Burt helped by the beautiful Indian Sarah Collins Marina Malfatti chases the malicious killers and the ending settle disputes by shooting .This Italian production is a moving S.W. movie starred by Fred Robsham  Klaus Kinski and Marina Malfatti . The film deals with a mysterious stranger  become a new sheriff  who vows to clean up the town of dreaded outlaws  and it takes on a strange gunslinger against treacherous gang  the O'Hara brothers . This Spaghetti movie gets the usual Western issues  such as greedy antiheroes  violent facing off  quick zooms  and exaggerated baddies . It is an acceptable  passable Western with several titles as Matador Nego or Pistoleiro Negro  or Assassino Negro or Black Killer that contains an interesting and violent plot about a sheriff seeking vendetta . It packs crosses and double crosses  thrills  shoot'em up  violence  and results to be quite entertaining  though drags at times  balancing in ups and downs . There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing some pursuits  crossfire or stunts every few minutes . It's a thrilling western with breathtaking confrontation between the protagonist against the heartless enemies formed by a brutal gang of Mexican brothers led by Antonio Cantafora . The main starring is the unknown Fred Robsahm and the popular Klaus Kinski who appears elegantly dressed and with a brilliant look  gaining a reputation for his ferocious talent and equally ferocious temper  Kinski plays as a strange lawyer who occasionally joins in on the action with his deadly law books . Here he plays with lots of gesticulation and excessive gestures . As he is fine  as he ravages the screen with his peculiar face and using suddenly his hidden weapons . This Spaghetti is made during his Italian period when Klaus starred a lot of Westerns  later he collaborated with Werner Herzog with whom played several prestigious films .

Kinski is cool as the weird lawyer that has a strange habit of transforming he's law books into deadly weapons. Great soundtrack and some nice cinematography gives the film good atmosphere and it's well worth the watch. Available on DVD from xploitedcinema".

	schema:reviewBody "There are so many spaghetti westerns that have some weird film concepts. Some of them don't really stand out when it should had. This movie is one of those films that deserve one more glance. After all there isn't a lot of western movies that has a character James Webb Klaus Kinski a lawyer that disguise his guns with books! It's a little silly but a pretty cool idea. It was a bit surprising to find out that Klaus Kinski isn't the main lead of this movie but more like a supporting character. The trailer and marketing posters for the film were very misleading. I was hoping he was as it would make the movie a little more memorable. Since the movie doesn't really focus much on him the movie directed by Carlo Croccolo AKA Lucky Moore goes another route with the normal often clich concept of a mysterious drifter rescuing a fearful lawless town from bandits or gangs. In this movie that drifter is named Burt Collins Fred Robsahm who become the new sheriff of the town call Tombstone when the previous one was killed by a Mexican gang known as the O'Hara Brothers Ramon Antonio Cantafora Pedro Enzo Pulcrano Miguel Calogero Caruana Ryan Antonio Danesi  Slide Mimmo Maggio. I really can't buy them being Mexican. They don't even look anything near Hispanic. Who know that the English sounding O'Hara was indeed Spanish or Latin American. While the bandit's costumes look ridiculousness they were very striking sinister in their actions. The movie was surprising very grim  violent compare to other Spaghetti Westerns at the time. While yes there are some one shot unrealistic kills some of the kills were pretty intense. There were some really hard to watch brutal moments like the rape scene that might turn off some people. The movie also has a lot more gratuitous nudity than I thought coming in. Both Tiziana Dini as Consuelo and Marina Malfatti as Sarah Collins are beautiful ladies and seeing them in the buff is a guilty pleasure even if it didn't make any sense and seem very unnecessary. Still only one of them was treated like a real person than eye candy. Marina Malfatti's character had lot of character development. She had a very good back story and purpose to take revenge on the O'Hara brothers. It was nice to see a female character have more to do than a loveinterested. She was badass most of the film shooting arrows and stabbing bad guys in the neck. Still like the villains her Indian getup is a bit laughable and bit short. Her ass was nearly out the whole movie. The lead Fred Robsahm wasn't that bad but his character was a bit confusing and dry. He's nearly forgettable. I still don't really understand what was the relationship with him and the lawyer James Webb. There's a very pointless and totally implausible plottwist near the end which perfectly summarizes the overall clumsiness of this unconventional Spaghetti Western. It was bit odd. To be honest the storytelling is a little confused and messy. It appears a lot more convoluted than it really should do. About the James Webb character I was really hoping that he turned out to be a villain because Klaus Kinski play it off like he was. There were a lot of things that he did that made you question who side he was really playing on. I really didn't see him as a hero type. The English dubbing was alright for the most part. It's wasn't jarring or distracting like other critics say it was. Some of the film editing was bit awkward. It was cuts so badly that it make it seem like two characters were in the same room when they were in two different locations. There were some serious plot hole due to the editing like the missing redhead that was to go warn the main character but she just basically disappears and there's no mention of her anymore. Maybe the print I had had her scenes cut or something. It was a bit peculiar. It was really hard to tell what's going on at times. The music by Daniele Patucchi sounds more like Australia outback than American western it's still very impressive. The cinematography is alright but there wasn't much to look at. Kinda wish for a little more use in beautiful locations. Black Killer hasn't aged well since it's released. The movie was often use as stock footage for later films such as 1972's Bounty Hunter in Trinity. This ultralow budget gem is often badly copy in DVDs with discoloring and dirty grain film footage. The version I had had this static sound that rang throughout the film. It felt like it was watching a movie in the nonstop pouring rain. Nevertheless it's still was a tremendously fun and actionpacked gunslinger movie. Overall A must watch for any Spaghetti Western fan.".

There is also some novelty that Kinski is playing a lawyer ! though one who is handy with a gun. Other positive things in the movie include a good musical score as well as some good shootouts. And there is a significant amount of nudity which you usually don't see in a spaghetti western. On the other hand there isn't much of a story here and the little there is unfolds very slowly. There were a couple of slow stretched where I almost drifted off into sleep. This isn't a bad movie but I would only recommend it to Kinski fans andor spaghetti western fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many spaghetti westerns had absurd gimmicks that made them memorable while at the same time subverting the iconography of their traditional American counterparts. Perhaps most famously there was Django and his coffin in Black Killer we have Klaus Kinski's lawyer with his guns disguised as books! Like a lot of the spaghetti western gimmicks it's simultaneously completely silly and very cool. On the whole though its business as usual spaghetti western style in this movie. We have a lawless town called perhaps unsurprisingly Tombstone which is terrorised by a gang of Mexican bandits called somewhat improbably the O'Hara gang. A mysterious drifter called Burt who is adept with a firearm comes into town and is made new sheriff by the fearful locals. The bandits subsequently kill his brother and rape his sisterinlaw an Indian called Sarah. Burt and Sarah band together with the help of Kinski's lawyer to get revenge.To be honest the storytelling is a little confused and messy in this one. And it can appear a lot more convoluted than it really should do. But it ultimately is a pretty straightforward violent western. The sexual violence is fairly unpleasant while one of the unfortunate early sheriffs is shot several times and then killed with a knife. It was good to see the character of Sarah get in on the retribution though  a female Indian with deadly skills with a bow and arrow made for a pleasant contrast to the typical taciturn gunfighter antihero she teams up with. Kinski is good as always as the lawyer who we can only assume the film is named after. He is in a rare goodish guy role in this one. He is dubbed with a silly English accent though it has to be said which is quite distracting. Allinall though this is a pretty entertaining spaghetti western.".

Kinski was an amazing actor! His on screen charisma has yet to be equaled his bright blue eyes and grimaces were almost naturally petrifying and somehow he always managed to make even the crappiest movies worthwhile viewing. He appeared in many Spaghetti Westerns some of which are widely acclaimed masterpieces by now The Great Silence Bullet for the General... and others still are very obscure and nearly impossible to trace down like Black Killer. This ultralow budget gem can hardly be called a masterpiece but it's nevertheless a tremendously fun and actionpacked gunslinger adventure. The title doesn't refer to a cowboy with a dark skin color but to Mr. Kinski himself and he doesn't even play the lead role. That's how proud the creators must have been for being able to cast the Klaus Kinski ha! Klaus plays a mysterious and freaky lawyer entirely dressed in black and always carrying around books that contain guns instead of knowledge and he's temporarily hanging around in the little town of Tombstone. The remote town is under the constant siege of terror of the five Mexican O'Hara brothers who killed no less than NINE Sheriffs in only a couple of weeks time. The local authorities assign lone traveler Burt Collins as the new Sheriff but the murderous O'Hara clan immediately kill his brother and rape his Indian sisterinlaw. Collins teams up with the awkward lawyer to terminate the reign of the O'Hara's once and for all. The plot of Black Killer is a little too confusing and convoluted for its own good sometimes but director Croccolo easily forces you to look past the script's incoherence and focus on the outrageous sequences of explicit violence as well as the awesomely ingenious gimmicks. The lawyer's method of killing people is original to say the least and the O'Hara brothers too come up with inventive ways to viciously entertain themselves. The gunfights and executions are quite nasty and particularly the rapescene is unsettling to watch as it seems to last for several whole minutes. Tiziana Dini provides the film with an overload of gratuitous  but welcome  nudity while the rest of the cast delivers more than adequate acting performances Daniele Patucchi's musical score is very enchanting and the filming locations are overall convincing. There's a very pointless and totally implausible plottwist near the end which perfectly summarizes the overall awkwardness of this unconventional Spaghetti Western. In conclusion Black Killer certainly lacks the quality and competence to rank among Italy's best Westerns but there's more than enough stuff to recommend if you're an openminded admirer of the genre. And for the record Kinski is a cinematic deity!".

The thing that I like best about this type of film is the entertainment value and that is where Black Killer unfortunately falls down. The film is likely to be a target for many because of the fact that it stars the great Klaus Kinski and indeed the actor the helped to make The Great Silence such a pleasure puts in a decent performance amidst a somewhat tedious movie. The plot is all over the place but seems to have something to do with Kinski's lawyer character complete with gun concealing books and a band of Mexicans. The atmosphere is gritty and the film features a handful of fairly nasty scenes although it's not nearly as action packed as some of the other Spaghetti Westerns released around the same time. You cant really expect coherency from seventies Spaghetti Westerns of course and it really wouldn't be a problem if director Carlo Croccolo had managed to make the action entertaining and the characters interesting but unfortunately this didn't happen. The title refers to the fact that Kinski dresses in black and goes around killing people but even this theme has been done better in other films e.g. The Grand Dual. Overall someone may get some enjoyment out of this but in a genre populated by entertaining films I can't recommend seeing this one.".

Sharon eve has her befuddled and frustrated husband Larry Currie Graham crewing the carpet as she's thought to be an unstable kook until her visions attract the serial murder Billy Morton. Whom Sharon claims to be in psychic contact with to make her his next victim.We see Sharon at first working with the police on a missing person case that she solves with the little boy later found murdered in an alley just where Sharon says he was. The killer who's on the scene follows Sharon back home in his car and runs her off the road causing Sharon to lose her eyesight. Back home and feeling sorry for herself and not wanting to live anymore Sharon ties a weight to her body and throws herself into the swimming pool but just there and then her visions psychic not normal comes back to her as she sees a young girl being murdered in a park. Quickly changing her mind by swimming to the surface about leaving this realm of existence Sharon goes back to her psychic visions in order to help the police to prevent or solve the murder.Back with the living it seems that no one knows and Sharon never tells anyone in the movie about her attempted suicide and new insight on going on living but the movie audience. Sharon desperately calls the police about her vision of murder and tries to stop it before it happens. The police that includes Insp. Frank Schumann Michael ironside and his partner Det. Fay Howard Anne Marie Loder are not at all impressed with Sharon's revelations. This action on the part of Schuman  Howard seemed a bit strange when we saw her earlier in the movie solving a murder for this same police department and police officers and probably having solved a number of other cases in the past! Finding the missing girl murdered like and where Sharon said the police and her husband Larry are more against Sharon using her psychic abilities then ever before with the exception of the now believing Insp. Schumann who's told by his superiors to have Sharon put off any future missing persons cases. This gives you the impression that someone upstairs in the department is trying to have them covered up.The movie Black Light has Sharon's husband Larry a computer software engineer working with Dr. Anna Gdard Lori Hallierwho's treating his wife to cure her of her blindness. Dr. Gdard thinks that with the help of a new visual system that her medical computer company is producing she can get Sharon's sight back. As Sharon's sight improves her visions are recorded on video tape showing just who the serial killer is which has him move in for the kill on Sharon to quite her and her visions forever.Full of plotholes and misdirections by the moviemakers that by the time you should get really into the movie you lose all interest in it. Just by the credits you already know before the movie even starts that there's no suspense in Black Light to who the killer is since he's none of the people you would usually suspect in the movie are not playing the role of the killer he's just actor Billy Morton in the credits! The ending with Sharon being chased by Morton is so ridicules with him acting more blind then she does and not even being able to find her even though she seems to know her way around the house and front lawn with out as much as tripping over anything. The films conclusion is too outlandish to even describe you have to see it for yourself with Sharon defying physical and mechanical science as well as common sense to do in the crazed killer and with Insp. Schumann who Morton strangled earlier in the movie comes back from the dead but not in time to save Sharonit turned out that Sharon didn't need his help at all!".

Did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story then just loaded it up with action? Of course not! Black Mask is awesome walltowall action throughout nearly it's entire running time. It's also deliciously gruesome and we get plenty of severed limbs decapitations and creative ways of watching the bad guys and quite a few innocent people too! get slaughtered. Most of Li's other martial arts films are nurseryschool when compared to Black Mask there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence bloodshed or action sequences whatsoever! And that made me a happy camper. Again if you go into a Jet Li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot you are going for the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite of his movies though beware of the horrendous dubbing.".

Sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix.  But now it seems that we discuss guys like Jackie Chan Bruce Lee and Jet Li.  It is a pointless comparison seeing that Lee is dead but it is a fun one.  And if you go by what we have seen from Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask you have to at least say that he would match up well against Chan.  In this film he comes across as a martial arts God.Black Mask is about a man that was created along with many other men to be supreme fighting machines.  Their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose.  They are invincible in some ways.  Now that is the premise for the film but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes.Jet Li is a marvel.  He can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do.  And that is what makes watching him so fun.Besides the martial arts in the film Black Mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that Jet has with his costar the police officer.  They are great together.  But to be honest. if anyone is reading this review they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department.  And the answer to that is a resounding YES!!!  Lots and lots of gory mindless action.  You will love this film.".

Some readers will probably ask if this film is supposed to be so funny why all the excessive and gory violence? well for one thing the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different from culture to culture and while Hong Kong audiences would recognize this violence is extreme it's certainly only slightly more than average for a HK action film.Also Black Mask is really the kind of film that takes a genre's conventions and pushes them to extremes simply because the conventions themselves are wholly unrealistic. After decades of watching people get shot without any noticeable open wounds many people were horrified to see Bonnie and Clyde and the outlaws of the Wild Bunch spurting blood all over the place. But the fact is when you're shot with rapid metal projectile it's almost certain that blood will spurt especially from an artery.This film is a Chinese comic book movie. It is true that the Spiderman films never get this gory  but if they were faithful to reality they would be! Well despite its comicbook origins this film is faithful to reality.The only complaint I have is the flashy overstylized filming and editing. If the makers of this film had shot it with an eye to Hollywoodstyle nostalgia as e.g. The Rocketeer or the recent Sky captain film I doubt anyone would have found it offensive.But as it stands I still had a lotta fun watching this movie.".

And mindless action is right.  You get to see Jet Li Jump spin kick punch shoot make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets. It's true that this movie was released to a broader audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4.  That is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped.  Most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a North American film.  But you need to remember most HK film budgets aren't nearly as high as a North American film and the style in a HK action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them.  If you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing.My rating was an 8.".

It's not the greatest movie ever made but it's a fun little action bmovie that you get here.The emphasis is clearly on the word bmovie! You can't watch this movie expecting a Hollywood Blockbuster. Or anything that would resemble a logical story. It is quite literally a nobrainer. I have criticized movies for being nobrainers before. Why did I rate this one higher? Because I see it in the context. For example Black Mask 2 is a nobrainer ... but there is nothing there that is entertaining. Here you have some jokes that work but more importantly you have good choreographed action scenes. All of that is missing in the sequel if you can call it that ...".

Or anything that would resemble a logical story. It is quite literally a nobrainer. I have criticized movies for being nobrainers before. Why did I rate this one higher? Because I see it in the context. For example Black Mask 2 is a nobrainer ... but there is nothing there that is entertaining. Here you have some jokes that work but more importantly you have good choreographed action scenes. All of that is missing in the sequel if you can call it that ...";

With Yuen Woo Ping choreographing the action and Jet Li as the lead  the fights action are as good as it gets. There is enough blood and gore to satisfy the most bloodthirsty of action fans as well as some of the finest choreographed wire fu insanity of the period . Black Mask is for me a perfect blend of both styles of HK action . Also a good job from the cast which has Lau Ching Wan and a cameo from Anthony Wong.

This movie is like a hidden gem a prototype for the whole matrix tide and era. The fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit oldschool among HK movies. However the style the movie created was a unique blend of Kungfu and pop culture. With all the leather black costumes and decorations this movie features a batmanlike superhero in a black mask against a runofthemill gang of multinational supersoldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss. Yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child but it works. It's so impressive that the whole movie's gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats. In year 2002 they made a sequel which had a PG13 rating but without Jet Li and Liu Qing Yun. And you know how bad that was because Li and Liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship. And did I happen to mention Francois Yip? Her roundhouse kick was totally cool even cooler than the villain boss because she didn't use a stuntman for all the fighting. Did I mention she was also smoking hot? Anyway there are a lot of things to like about the movie.However the movie also suffered from a lot of problems. First off it's a mediocre script made at its best potential which means this production team deserved a better screenwriter. There are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like farfetched and don't totally make senses to the audiencesUS version was even worse because all the character developments were cut. Anyway you can't ask too much out of a comicinspired action movie. Also this movie is entirely improper for children. I won't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old. It's saturated with disturbing contents including blood gore sadomaso costumes extreme brutal violence and so on. Along with the style of the movie it can be called a wet dream for heavymetal rock music fans and action fans. the U.S. cut was milder but if you want to see it see the HK release for what it is. 710.

Other scenes are so improbable that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous killer CD roms?  Just give him Throwing Stars!!!!.

The plot has possibilities but are all squandered by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie strives for. And are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize Simon because he has a half mask on?

	schema:headline " Among Jet Li's worst films";
	schema:reviewBody "Mild SPOILERS contained herein.  I'm spoiling this film to save you the trouble of having to watch it.  Jet Li's movies fall into one of two categories  Shaolin period movies and movies set in modernday Hong Kong revolving around Triads or Triad like organizations.  Each genre has its best and worst films.  Twin Warriors' is Jet Li's best Shaolin era flick while The Evil Cult' is his worst.  Fist of Legend' while in the recent past is the best modern era' Jet Li movie. Black Mask' without a doubt is the worst.Jet Li plays a selfexiled mercenary who received an injection that gives him superhuman ability but shortens his life span.  In his new life' in exile he plays a pacifist librarian.  When his old mercenary squad goes on a rampage Jet Li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them.  He dons a very silly corrugated cardboard mask so as to conceal his identity from the police and public as a librarian as well as to conceal his true identity to his excomrades in arms.The version I saw was dubbed and horribly at that.  Why does Jet Li capture and hold hostage his library coworker if he's a pacifist?  Is there a love story between them?  Why does the police chief not care when he learns of the Black Mask's true identity?  The plot is just plain BAD.  Bad by way of the superhero cheesiness bad in the sense that characters are never properly developed bad in its character interactions all topped off by a halfexplained story I quickly lost interest in. The action and martial arts sequences are way over the top.  Lots of blood gore severed body parts aplenty explosions and Matrix style superhuman martial arts fiascos are present in the film.  Unfortunately this is the films best and only selling point.  If you want to see Jet Li playing a vigilante superhero in a Mission Impossible style movie Black Mask' delivers.  For the rest of us Jet Li fans it is a true disappointment.  This is one of those movies where Jet Li never gets to be Jet Li he gets neither the chance to charm us with his charisma nor a chance to impress us with his impressive yet realistic martial arts ability.  Normally a Chinese knockoff of Ozzy Osbourne would be enough to engross me in a film sadly Black Mask' proved to be an exception to that rule. Indeed the antagonist of this movie by the way he dresses his long straight hair and trademark round sunglasses looks like the modern and aged Ozzy Osbourne.   However the villain isn't onscreen long enough to make the gimmick worthwhile.   I am assuming the likeness to Ozzy was intentional in addition to the villain's look he also ran a satanic looking hideout.  So much more could have been made from the Ozzy Osbourne villain gimmick!   If only the writer director or ANYONE had bothered to give a background to and develop the character of the film's arch villain!Black Mask' was the first Jet Li film released on video in the USA after Lethal Weapon 4 and I'm glad I stayed away from it until now.   It may well have ruined my whole perception of Jet Li as a martial artist and actor.  If you want to see Jet Li at his worst rent Black Mask' and The Evil Cult' and make it a double feature or horror both intentional and unintentional. Otherwise stick to moves that utilize the talents of Jet Li and have plots that are semiwell thought out and plausible.  39 stars.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mild SPOILERS contained herein.  I'm spoiling this film to save you the trouble of having to watch it.  Jet Li's movies fall into one of two categories  Shaolin period movies and movies set in modernday Hong Kong revolving around Triads or Triad like organizations.  Each genre has its best and worst films.  Twin Warriors' is Jet Li's best Shaolin era flick while The Evil Cult' is his worst.  Fist of Legend' while in the recent past is the best modern era' Jet Li movie. Black Mask' without a doubt is the worst.Jet Li plays a selfexiled mercenary who received an injection that gives him superhuman ability but shortens his life span.  In his new life' in exile he plays a pacifist librarian.  When his old mercenary squad goes on a rampage Jet Li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them.  He dons a very silly corrugated cardboard mask so as to conceal his identity from the police and public as a librarian as well as to conceal his true identity to his excomrades in arms.The version I saw was dubbed and horribly at that.  Why does Jet Li capture and hold hostage his library coworker if he's a pacifist?  Is there a love story between them?  Why does the police chief not care when he learns of the Black Mask's true identity?  The plot is just plain BAD.  Bad by way of the superhero cheesiness bad in the sense that characters are never properly developed bad in its character interactions all topped off by a halfexplained story I quickly lost interest in. The action and martial arts sequences are way over the top.  Lots of blood gore severed body parts aplenty explosions and Matrix style superhuman martial arts fiascos are present in the film.  Unfortunately this is the films best and only selling point.  If you want to see Jet Li playing a vigilante superhero in a Mission Impossible style movie Black Mask' delivers.  For the rest of us Jet Li fans it is a true disappointment.  This is one of those movies where Jet Li never gets to be Jet Li he gets neither the chance to charm us with his charisma nor a chance to impress us with his impressive yet realistic martial arts ability.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Black Mask when it was released on video in the U.S. after it's run in the theaters.  At the time I was not very impressed.  This probably had to do with the fact that I had seen very few if any Hong Kong movies prior to this.  However after recently viewing it for a second time my opinion has changed and I would now say that it is an excellent movie.Black Mask is an action movie with a vengeance.  I was surprised that I didn't remember how brutally violent it was.  There is enough blood spewing bullet wound gushing and severed parts in this film to fill up a few movies. Characters are shot struck exploded impaled and burned just to name a few of the killing methods employed in the movie.  This is not to say that the film is an incessant barrage of violence there are also quiet character driven moments. I believe that these moments are particularly successful because they are a stark contrast to the furious action sequences. These contrasts exist also in the main character Simon.  As Simon he is pacific but as the Black Mask he is aggressive.  As the movie progresses so does his personal journey to find balance between his two sides.  I believe this journey is a theme that runs through the movie consistently at times in a more subtle way which lends to my opinion that the movie is a well made and strives to develop characters more than the standard action movie. This is apparent in the character of Rock who comes to question his convictions and methods.  In the end his beliefs would seem to be confirmed rather than denied but the character has made the journey to this discovery and that is an important factor in giving the film depth.The Black Mask character has more than a passing resemblance to Bruce Lee's character Kato from The Green Hornet.  I don't know if the Hong Kong version of the film gives a nod to this but the english dub finds female characters commenting on his retro Kato look.  I don't know anything about the development of the film in Hong Kong but I think it's a safe assumption that the character is inspired by Kato.  It's something I'll be looking in to.  Speaking of the dub I actually find that it is excellent.  It's not rushed or over the top as many dubs are.  The characters speak at normal rates are appropriately low key when they need to be.  Naturally this lends greatly to the end product of the english version of the film.Black Mask is an excellent action movie that features great fight scenes with the amazing Jet Li.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  The lead villain walks the fine line between credible bad guy and BMovie megalomaniac with marvelous results.  He's just a little too weird to be real but he's not over the top at all. All things considered it's a great movie and I'd encourage you to check it out!".

Very young Karen Mok plays an unwitting hostage to Li and adds sideline to the story.This genetically enhanced soldier scheme continued with other movies such as Huk Mau Black Cat which is in the same vain as this movie with also Black as part of its title.With fantastic moves like this who wouldn't be a star !

Apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing which my DVD copy didn't give me the option to turn off the movie contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated Hong Kong movies during this time. I still stick to my guns in the opinion that when it comes to action these guys no matter what their budget add an element of magic to the screen no Bourne Supremacy Casino Royale or Mission Impossible I'm not knocking these movies  I just reckon they lack the spontaneity of this one and feel too regulated will ever achieve. What is it? It's the feeling that the filmmakers were experimenting as they shot and edited not afraid to leave in some blemishes so as to learn lessons for the next time. For me this makes watching movies all the more fun and dangerous.".

The story there isn't one after an hour I forgot the whole plot completely but if its action your looking for well its non stop and thrilling.  Its not one of Jets best but it sure has its fare share of action if not more.  You must see this film if only for the action the story was to be desired along with the bad dubbing. I give this film a 310 for story but 710 for action and plenty of it.".
