This was my attitude at the start and I mention this because mostly I found the film to be engaging and interesting. This is mostly down to the way the film is pulled together appropriately enough because it has a real structure and rhythm to it that just works.Some sections work better than others though. Anything to do with Apple is most accessible because we are all familiar with the brand as a thing of beauty and easy use and it makes the conversations around this easy to follow. Conversely the sections with the toothbrush is less so because the work being shown does not appear to be necessary or be going anywhere. Although there are some exceptions everyone involved in the film is intelligent wellspoken clear and easy to listen to. There are a couple of slightly pretentious design types that rubbed me up the wrong way with their attitudes but otherwise I found it easy to spend time in the company of the contributors.Ultimately the film doesn't quite provide the level of insight or passion that one might have hoped but it does engage across the admittedly quite short running time. The subject is well presented made accessible and as much as possible tangible. Could have been better with more insight but for what it is it is accessible and engaging.".

Far more than most consciously realize and for those who do probably more than we care to admit.Gary Hustwit's previous Helvetica is on my rack and gets viewed probably about once a year. It's just that kinda documentary. Objectified is in my 'subjectified' opinion not quite so good not quite as thoroughly followed through but Hustwit remains one of my favorite documentarians.Objectified is certainly engaging enough to pull you into the designing backstage of our world the depth of thinking that goes behind much of what we take for granted. If you like stuff you'll like this movie. Even if you don't particularly care then I still recommend it. Hustwit is again able to show just how powerful a pull we give to the things around us what goes into them and what we get out. You may find you care a lot more than you think you do. We really have a materialistic mindset and this is a good first step to seeing it clearly ... and maybe finding a way out.".

	schema:reviewBody "This recreates a lot of the legends about Francis of Assisi  one of the best known of the Roman Catholic saints who is also admired and much quoted by Protestants. There's no doubt that the movie also recreates some of the historical facts about his life  his disagreement with his father over the course his life should take his visit to the Holy Land and encounter with the sultan and his struggle to gain recognition of his new order from the Pope. This also takes both the legends and the reality to unnecessary extremes at times  such as Francis' encounter with the cheetahs in the Sahara as he was seeking out the sultan. Throughout the whole movie Francis is portrayed in a too pious light his humanity I mean by this his flesh and blood reality as opposed to his kindness seemed lost in the mix. This is not especially surprising when you consider that the movie is based on a hagiography a biography of a saint written by by the Catholic author Ludwig von Wohl whose own commission from Pope Pius XII was to write about the history and mission of the Church in the world. Clearly the Catholic Church wants its saints portrayed in the best light possible and so a certain sense of veneration for Francis in a movie based on von Wohl's work is inevitable.Setting that aside and even Protestants admire Francis so I have no major criticism what I most enjoyed here was the continual reflection in the movie on the state of the church and the Christian faith and Christians the constant temptation to which we all give in to compromise the standards of Christ in favour of the standards of the world. The movie continually comes back to that theme one could even say it revolves around it as the primary battle Francis fights is to keep his order true to his rule  which was essentially the teachings of Christ that His own followers should renounce worldly possessions. Considering the repeated inability of Christians and the church to truly live up to the standards of Christ the most meaningful words here were probably put on Francis' lips although I'm unclear whether he actually spoke them if men were more perfect we would need less compassion. So true.This is at times interesting  but it's still significantly weakened in my view by its veneration of Francis rather than its objective portrayal of his life.".

While several historical inaccuracies are present Francis is referred to as Father Francis once yet St. Francis was never ordained priest in real life for example this is a good film to show to people if your purpose is to introduce them to the saint. Unfortunately the film does come out like a Disney film with all the colors and dialogue. Hardly present at all is the tension between Francis and his father Pietro. Omitted is the very important event when St. Francis returns ALL his property and clothes to his father and declares no longer shall i call you my father but I shall only say our Father who art in heaven.  a beautifully done scene in Brother Sun Sister Moon ten years later. On the good side it focuses on the supernatural  miracles God speaking to Francis. This is good because other films tend to make us forget that this is the life of a SAINT after all. All in all a great movie. There should be more films like this to change others' lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "Contrary to scant reviews of this movie as rather mediocre several interesting aspects make it worth a viewing. Perhaps aside there is the amazing parallel of movietoreality of lovely Dolores Hart who plays the noble woman Clare. Clare forsook marriage to an earnest noble Stuart Whitman and followed Francis Bradford Dillman founding the Poor Clares order of nuns. Hart was on the verge of marriage in 1963 when she decided to become a nun. The acting is good enough to keep one interested. And seeing some of the last appearances of old guard like Finlay Currie Cecil Kellaway and irascible director Michael Curtiz who directed many of Errol Flynn's swashbuckler movies and other Warner Bros. fare in Hollywood hey days sufficiently tempts the serious movie buff. The movie itself has the looklots of color but also the lingering epic Hollywood scaleof historical yarns of the late 40s on through the 50s. Like the better efforts of this genre the life of Francis progresses with a competent scriptparticularly in Francis's struggles against the establishment church. Thus it is historically preferable to Zeffirelli's minimalist Brother Sun Sister Moon which frames Francis and Clare as more akin to 60s hippies than inhabitants of the 13th centurywith a plot that meanders like a music videoand Donovan's music to prove it Zeffirelli also wanted the Beatles to appear in the movie!. This reviewer is perhaps tainted with some nostalgic bias since as a small boy I saw the Southern California premiere of Francis of Assisi in Downeysoutheast LA county suburbof all places! that included a live appearance and short commentary on stage by Stuart Whitman who in his rough out style played Francis's friendturnedantagonist having been jilted by Clare Count Paolo of Vandria. Years later at Universal I worked with Whitman who crusty as ever recalled memories of the movie shoot as a tolerably pleasant experience.".

Together with movies such as 'Flowers of St Francis'this focuses on the lives of the St Francis brotherhood and Marcelino we get a wonderful idea about St Francis and the monks of his order. Dolores Hart acted the part of Sister Claire very well. Full marks to Michal Curtiz for such an excellent production. 10 on 10!".

	schema:reviewBody "The road to movie dullness is paved with good intentions. The captivating story of a 12th century man who embraced Jesus' teachings of poverty and aid to the poor and the sick is given a reverent but sometimes tiresome treatment here. It also manages to either skip or gloss over several of the more striking facts of the real story! Dillman is the wealthy son of a successful merchant who begins to hear a voice in his head urging him to forsake his worldly possessions and rebuild the church. When he also forsakes his commission in the military he is placed under arrest in a dungeon! Eventually through the intervention of his female friend Hart he is released by his former comrade in arms Whitman. He then begs in the street for stones and begins to build a church eventually amassing 10 followers who help him with his work. They travel on foot to Rome where eventually they receive the Pope's blessing and before long Dillman has hundreds and hundreds of devotees following his practices. Hart even becomes a nun as a result of his example. One of his travels takes him to the desert where he comes facetoface with Sultan Armendariz who almost causes him to undergo a trial by fire. As he ages he loses most of his vision and begins to deteriorate but not before founding an order that lived on and lives on today. Dillman does pretty well as the title character offering up the type of beatific arrogance that not everyone can master. It's a role not completely dissimilar from that of Tom Tryon's in The Cardinal and one could see the men switching roles with relative ease. Hart who later became a devoted and successful nun in real life gives a solid performance. She is to be credited especially in 1961 for completely eliminating any beautifying makeup during her scenes in a habit. Whitman who was dabbling in cloak and sword films during this era is handsome but out of place. His accent is so contemporary along with his hair and his character fictional is too coincidentally tied to Dillman's in several ways for him to be all that believable. He does however have one decent scene near the end. An impressive assortment of esteemed veterans round out the cast. Kellaway plays a cardinal interested in Dillman's work Franz is Dillman's difficulttoplease father Currie plays a downright ancient Pope as can be the case! and Armendariz has a decent cameo as the Sultan. The film is luxurious in many respects with striking costumes splendid scenery detailed settings and so on but too many things keep it from realizing epic status. For one thing the story is trotted out in an almost comic book or Disney fashion. It's very episodic and some of the episodes are a tad too cutesy such as when Dillman blesses all the neighborhood animals. Then there's the uproarious moment when Dillman enters a leper colony and listens to this howler of a piece of dialogue I don't want your peace. I wanna get rid of my stink! Dillman should have gotten a nomination just for keeping a straight face through that one. Oh and don't miss the unfortunately staged scene in which Johns as a sweet simpleminded follower of Dillman comes to fetch him and as he's in profile an extra in the background is flexing his arm right at John's crotch level providing an hysterical unintentional sight gag! The film opens with shots of frescoes while the impressive ooh and ahh music soars. Unfortunately almost every single scene opens with a variation on the same ninenote melody until it becomes not only predictable but almost laughable. All Hollywood films change the details to make a film more entertaining or to broaden it's appeal but the introduction of a standard and predictable love triangle between Dillman Hart and Whitman was a mistake not to mention possibly in poor taste! Fascinating tidbits from the Saint's real life don't make the cut such as when he was shipwrecked on the Dalmatian coast or when the Crusaders in Damietta wanted to slay him as a heretic and the Sultan saved his life. The stigmata is barely suggested. Also oddly the man was known to avoid walking sticks and sandals yet the film shows him with both and even has Hart gifting ! him a new pair of sandals! It's not a bad film it's just a bit hampered by too many concessions and conventions possibly by a director who was too set in his ways.".

He must have been inspiring and charismatic but what we get here is a very passive reader of scripture.

What were the producers thinking?! There was a little more history in this version though including Francis' visit to Jerusalem and his meeting with the Sulton. While the story was certainly comprehensive than Brother Sun Sister Moon I prefer the latter even with Donovan's soundtrack which I'm getting used to since I bought the video! Bradford Dillman did a fair job but Dolores Hart with her teased helmethead sprayed hair looked very out of place sad to say. A lean Stuart Whitman as Paolo played a major part and helped carry the film. I was tempted to not watch the whole thing but I gave in.

But we continually jump between location exteriors to tight quasiexteriors and interiors with the unnaturally even stagebound lighting of the time. And the tone is hopelessly square to meet the mindless conformist hordes of the '50s without asking anything of them. 1961 is a great place to start marking the collapse of the Hollywood studio and star systems. Here an unlikely second banana Bradford Dillman is forced on viewers as a very poor leading man. If you ever wonder why unknowns are not asked to helm epics Dillman is your answer.I can accept that a saint's behavior might seem artificial but the whole cast here is so cardboard it's like watching robots. And a convention in which morally good people are distinguishable by their continual vacant smiles indicates the shallowness of the film. Can life possibly be this flat for anyone? It's bursting with phony good cheer and official story blandness. With enunciation replacing acting. None of the leads even attempts an accent y'know because a saint in Italy is pretty much indistinguishable from Joe Sixpack in Indiana. ...storybook costumes blonde fairskinned 'Italian' maidens? Blecch. It's the embodiment of shabby unworldly 1961 values that would soon be left behind. Jack Warner must have had this movie in mind when he concocted his disastrous production of Camelot.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was in fourth grade in Catholic school the nuns trooped us over to the local theater one sunny afternoon in the fall of 1961 to see this film. I remembered nothing about it except for a vague notion that it had bored my sandals off. When I saw that Fox Movie Channel had it On Demand I gave it another try just to see. I don't think I've ever had such an enormous gap between viewings of a film.And it's not bad at all. The first halfhour or so unfortunately is not good. It looks tacky and cheap like a '60s TVmovie. There's a ludicrous battle scene early on but this marks the point after which the film starts to get better. The Italian locations are beautiful. The film is overly reverential and was made for a general audience fifty years ago so we don't really get to see how much of a party animal Francis was before his conversion. Bradford Dillman pulls off the nearimpossible job of making this plaster saint interesting. The incredibly lovely Dolores Hart plays Clare the noblewoman who becomes the first Franciscan nun and Dolores actually did enter the convent the year after this film and is still there today and remains as lovely as ever. There is a subtlety in the relationship between Francis and Clare that often works but occasionally you get the feeling that the two are behaving in such a restrained way that they might actually be 13thcentury Vulcans. Of course the director here Michael Curtiz is responsible for the most romantic movie of all time Casablanca. Whatever is there between Francis and Clare is left subtle enough for us to appreciate while not peeving the more conservative members of the audience. Stuart Whitman the nobleman who loves Clare and serves as the third member of this nontriangle seems miscast here. Stu was never really the nobleman type.Interestingly the film takes a dim view of the Crusades as it shows Christian forces raping and pillaging their way to the Holy Land. There's a scene with Francis meeting the leader of the enemy Saracens that shows their Sultan in a much more civilized light. The film also states that Francis felt his mission from God was to save the Church from its own materialism and heresy pretty much along the lines of what Martin Luther would try to do two and a half centuries later. I'm not sure the nuns of 1961 really understood what was going on here.My nonCatholic wife says that Francis has always been well thought of outside the Catholic religion mainly because he loved animals and is generally felt to have been kind and modest. Not too many reputations have survived eight centuries of questioning and doubt intact. I really didn't expect to like this film or to get all the way through it but I was happily surprised to find that I rather enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Francis of Assisi at the age of 11 when it came out in 1961 at the old Stanley Warner Beverly Hills theatre. The film was given the red carpet treatment and a bunch of us Catholics went to see it.Unhappily this film is nowhere near as good a biopic of a saint as say Song of Bernadette is. Zefferelli certainly had a lot more fun with Francis in Brother Sun Sister Moon. The film is one of those international all star casts 2nd rate epics popular the late 1950searly '60s made by European production companies but released Stateside by one of the name studios Fox in this case. The American actors either unknown at the time Dillmanor of lesser rank status Hart Whitman were shipped to the Continent to make European films more acceptable to US audiences. The rest of the cast was mostly unfamiliar to US filmgoers then unless they caught British imports at the more offbeat theatres in town.Michael Curtiz so effective at Warners with Captain Blood Adv of Robin Hood Yankee Doodle Dandy and Casablanca among so many other classics drops the ball here. He must have been tired by this time having directed movies for some 40 years. The actors are given bythebook direction. A few scenes remind one of how great a film Curtiz had been able to make in the 1930s40s.Bradford Dillman does his best with what he's given but the screenplay closely following Louis de Wohl's novel The Joyful Beggar comes across pretty unexcitingly. The film is more outline than biography going from one episode to another interested in the standard fictionalromantic triangle as s sop to attract Protestants one surmises and never gets down to really giving a dynamic cinematic portrait of Francis. De Wohl wrote a long series of novelized saints' biographies in the 1950s that were popular among Catholics of the era. He died rather unexpectedly in 1961. They are of a type sometimes a touch titillating but in the end quite inoffensive. They were deemed fine reading for Catholic youth in the 1950s they are still good for children to introduce them to the saints. Just as an aside it's fun to know that De Wohl was employed by the US military in WWII to write pseudoNostradamus quatrains denigrating Hitler dropped by Allied planes over Germany to offset Hitler's claims that Nostradamus had predicted Der Fuhrer's success.Pedro Armendariz has a great role as the Sultan and is the most believable actor in this show altho Dolores Hart is very affecting as Clare especially at her leavetaking of Francis at the film's conclusion. The scene in which Francis ministers to Moslem prisoners after a Crusader victory is Dillman's most effective Francis being exposed to the brutality of war shuddering at the horrors committed by Christians in the name of Christ.Francis was revered even in his own time as Father Francis by his friars even tho he was only ordained a deacon. Father is a title given founders of religious orders by their spiritual children even today. The title has nothing to do with ordination. Indeed Francis did not want to be ordained at all but Pope Innocent explained that to be allowed to preach in church a man had to be ordained at least a deacon. Only then did Francis accept the formality so he could preach in churches. On the other hand Francis was an administrative failure. This is why Brother Elias his successor as Master General of the order is shown to be  accurately  pretty coldblooded in doing his job. Brother Juniper always muddling up things in the Flowers of St Francis had a simplicity that was beloved by Francis. another reason for Juniper to be in the movie  there was a popular daily 1panel daily newspaper cartoon at mid20th century detailing a presentday Franciscan Brother Juniper getting into comic situations. This was a simpler time when few citizens gave a 2nd thought to seeing a Catholic friar as a cartoon character. Today the Leftists wd surely be crying foul. How dare Catholics be funny where they can see it! Finley Curry as a Scottish??? Innocent III is much too old. And I doubt that popes even then conducted daily affairs dressed in Mass vestments and wearing the tiara just to let everyone know who was pope. Cecil Kellaway plays Cardinal Ugolino the sponsor and protector of the Franciscans. He wd later become Pope Gregory IX and spar with St Clare who fought him to a standstill winning the right for her and the Franciscan nuns to keep Francis' demand that his followers own nothing.Sorry to say the imposition of the Stigmata is one of the lamest special effects in film. It does nothing to convey the utter spirituality of the event and Mario Nascimbene's score leaves a lot to be desired. He did a lot better in other foreign films but he was nowhere near Korngold or Steiner in backing up Curtiz' direction as they had at Warners 25 years earlier.Francis of Assisi is an inoffensive 1950s wannabe epic almost a precursor of those sword and sandal movies made in Italy that were to follow during the early '60s  the Son of Hercules films and others. This one could have been  and should have been  a lot better.".

Stuart Whitman plays his rival for Clare's love of course Clare's love for Francis is purely religious. The addition of this love triangle is perfectly representative of old Hollywood's frequent ridiculousness. The only person who really rises to the occasion is Dolores Hart as Clare. She's quite good.

	schema:reviewBody "If one is only expecting to know the more important aspects of the life of this great saint who wanted to emulate the life of Jesus Christ and established the 3 vows of monastic life  obedience poverty and chastity then this the film for you. Otherwise I found it like various other reviewers too obviously Hollywoodish especially in production.

Also missing are the crucial aspects of the life of this beloved saint for instance where he publicly renounces his inheritance and worldly goods in general and exchanges his fine clothes for a simple cassock. The abrupt change of scene where he tells his father that he has no desire to follow him in the mercantile business and then we see him next hauling a cart through the streets asking for stones to rebuild the church would seem nonsensical and confusing to those unfamiliar with his life story.Also the timeline appears to be too short for comfort  Francis doesn't appear to have aged that much in between the time he founded the Franciscan order till his death granting that he was only in his 40s when he passed away.It would also have been helpful if purely optional had some of the more familiar stories surrounding the life of Francis were included as these are wellknown in the religious world such as his close association with animals the preaching to the birds scene would have been good and the fact that he first established the Nativity scene so associated with Christmas celebrations.All in all this film could be considered as a Not bad but could have been made better... sort of production.".

Francis also used swords in a war battle but he is always troubled by voices telling him what he is suppose to do with his life and when he leaves the military he is called a coward deserter and it upsets his entire family.

He wasn't always so saintly In fact this film shows his sudden transformation from a fun loving young man heading off to war and returning as a deserter transformed by divine inspiration. This of course creates conflict both with the church and his social circle but Francis utilizes his guidance from the Lord into fulfilling his destiny. A sweet and simple tale this is elaborately filmed and well acted with Bradford Dillman in the title role Dolores Hart as a young girl who follows in his footsteps and becomes a nun which Hart would do later in real life and Stuart Whitman as Dillman's old friend who was in love with Hart and blames Francis for leading Hart to her vow of poverty and chastity.It should be noted that 20th Century Fox had been filming inspirational stories for decade most notably The Song of Bernadette and I'd Climb the Highest Mountain as well as Biblical epics such as The Robe and David and Bathsheba. This one is presented with such innocent and simple joy that it seems almost effortless and to cynics probably too sanctimonious.

	schema:reviewBody "A gift from your heart Love for those who have no love Peace for those who have no peace PAX ET BONUM the words of a beggar that lead Francis' heart to conversion Encountering many biopics of saint Francis of Assisi nobody should skip the one by the famous director of CASABLANCA Michael Curtiz titled FRANCIS OF ASSISI. What surprised me in this film was the way the movie begins credits composed within the images of Giotto frescoes a work of art in the Assisi Basilica which have depicted the life of the saint for many generations. And one can begin to expect something of a great job. But as I went on watching the movie I noticed the fact there is something missing in it. Since FRANCIS OF ASSISI is purely a biopic it seems to be the question Is it possible to show the rich life of the Poverello in 105 minutes? but moreover one can deduce that all goes so fast as if the producers packed biographical facts one after another... Yet... ...it would be very unjust to treat this film from today's perspective. We have to realize that the film was made by Americans at a certain point in movie history when colossal epics were being made and occurred blockbusters at the box office. Producers concentrated much more on high camp production than on the message a film would convey. However if we get closer to the gist of whose life the biopic is about we realize that Saint Francis the poorest of the poor deserves something different than that. When watching FRANCIS OF ASSISI by Michael Curtiz we do not find Francis politically incorrect with the social and ecclesiastical system of the time we do not find him reject his possessions we do not find him totally filled with the spirit of the Gospel nor so much a radical follower of Jesus Crucified. It does not mean that there is no spirit in the movie it does mean however that there is hardly any Franciscan spirit That is with some exceptions combined with biographical aspects highlighted. Bernardo Quintavalle is an old man who offers financial help in rebuilding the church of Porziuncola Francis' farewell to his parents is rather filled with compromise than the radical no to wealth and the loveless toys we fill our days with as it was nicely put in the screenplay of Zeffirelli's production 1972. Clare is rather a calm lady of aristocracy than a youthful girl in love with the example of the friars. As a matter of fact Clare was much younger than Francis and could not visit aristocratic banquets merely as a child. Other errors could be enumerated but that is I think not the gist here.To be more objective with the movie I would like to concentrate on these exceptions contain foremost single moments. First it is surely the scene I quoted at the beginning when we see Francis leaving the tavern and symbolically his life of earthly pleasures and wandering the streets of Assisi. There he notices a procession with the Cross of our Lord and while gazing at Crucified Jesus a beggar tells him the words I mentioned at the beginning... pretty powerful scene! I liked the idea of focusing on PAX ET BONUM message the key one for Franciscans. Unfortunately it is little developed in the content later on. Another strong moment of the movie is the execution of stigmata saint Francis received from the Lord in September 1224. Although some people may have doubts as for the depiction of suffering generally the scene is worth a look as a more traditional interpretation than the one by Liliana Cavani in 1989 movie. Finally it is important to mention the fact that FRANCIS OF ASSISI is the only film so far which shows Francis' memorable visit at the sultan's and does it in a pretty convincing manner mind you by convincing I do not mean stunning.As far as performances are concerned one can say there is much to be desired particularly when concerning casting certain people. Dolores Hart is not bad as Clare but as I have already said rather a calm lady than an enthusiastic young female saint. Her personal biography later made this role perhaps more authentic as she became a nun. Bradford Dillman lacks the godly madness in the main role. All he portrays is just a seemingly unconvincing conversion from an easy going young man to a pious man of God. Finlay Currie the mainstay of the genre is not bad as Pope Innocent III but I do not think that he does equally good a job as in his other portrayals. Francis' parents Eduard Franz and Athene Seyler are far too old for the roles and therefore Pietro Bernardone appears to be too enigmatic.All in all what could I say in a nutshell about the film? More FRANCIS than FRANCESCO more an AngloSaxon man of reasonable faith than the Umbrian Poverello of emotional belief. Perhaps it is sad to say but FRANCIS OF ASSISI is the least convincing film about the saint so far among the several biopics. However I would never call it a failure...no failure at least for the sake of message and final moment.The scene of Clare's tribute and Francis' funeral leaves a visual effect in the viewer. PAX ET BONUM written in the red sky of setting sun just above the body of the poorest among the poor and birds chirping last farewell to their heartfelt preacher seem to link heavens with earth in the tedious spiritual pilgrimage of human hearts...".

When watching FRANCIS OF ASSISI by Michael Curtiz we do not find Francis politically incorrect with the social and ecclesiastical system of the time we do not find him reject his possessions we do not find him totally filled with the spirit of the Gospel nor so much a radical follower of Jesus Crucified. It does not mean that there is no spirit in the movie it does mean however that there is hardly any Franciscan spirit That is with some exceptions combined with biographical aspects highlighted. Bernardo Quintavalle is an old man who offers financial help in rebuilding the church of Porziuncola Francis' farewell to his parents is rather filled with compromise than the radical no to wealth and the loveless toys we fill our days with as it was nicely put in the screenplay of Zeffirelli's production 1972. Clare is rather a calm lady of aristocracy than a youthful girl in love with the example of the friars. As a matter of fact Clare was much younger than Francis and could not visit aristocratic banquets merely as a child. Other errors could be enumerated but that is I think not the gist here.To be more objective with the movie I would like to concentrate on these exceptions contain foremost single moments. First it is surely the scene I quoted at the beginning when we see Francis leaving the tavern and symbolically his life of earthly pleasures and wandering the streets of Assisi. There he notices a procession with the Cross of our Lord and while gazing at Crucified Jesus a beggar tells him the words I mentioned at the beginning... pretty powerful scene! I liked the idea of focusing on PAX ET BONUM message the key one for Franciscans. Unfortunately it is little developed in the content later on. Another strong moment of the movie is the execution of stigmata saint Francis received from the Lord in September 1224. Although some people may have doubts as for the depiction of suffering generally the scene is worth a look as a more traditional interpretation than the one by Liliana Cavani in 1989 movie. Finally it is important to mention the fact that FRANCIS OF ASSISI is the only film so far which shows Francis' memorable visit at the sultan's and does it in a pretty convincing manner mind you by convincing I do not mean stunning.As far as performances are concerned one can say there is much to be desired particularly when concerning casting certain people. Dolores Hart is not bad as Clare but as I have already said rather a calm lady than an enthusiastic young female saint. Her personal biography later made this role perhaps more authentic as she became a nun. Bradford Dillman lacks the godly madness in the main role. All he portrays is just a seemingly unconvincing conversion from an easy going young man to a pious man of God. Finlay Currie the mainstay of the genre is not bad as Pope Innocent III but I do not think that he does equally good a job as in his other portrayals. Francis' parents Eduard Franz and Athene Seyler are far too old for the roles and therefore Pietro Bernardone appears to be too enigmatic.All in all what could I say in a nutshell about the film? More FRANCIS than FRANCESCO more an AngloSaxon man of reasonable faith than the Umbrian Poverello of emotional belief. Perhaps it is sad to say but FRANCIS OF ASSISI is the least convincing film about the saint so far among the several biopics. However I would never call it a failure...no failure at least for the sake of message and final moment.The scene of Clare's tribute and Francis' funeral leaves a visual effect in the viewer. PAX ET BONUM written in the red sky of setting sun just above the body of the poorest among the poor and birds chirping last farewell to their heartfelt preacher seem to link heavens with earth in the tedious spiritual pilgrimage of human hearts...";

	schema:reviewBody "From a motion picture perspective the Jesus film is primitive and flawed for audiences who are familiar with cinematic convention. From a biblical storytelling perspective however it is brilliant. I'm therefore rating it at just 5  halfway between love and hate as I shall explain in this review.That the producers achieved what they set out to do is indisputable it's the most watched movie of all time. That the film is clear and truthful to the Gospel account of Luke is indisputable. That we need to consider the intended audience is also indisputable. Released just two years after Zeffirelli's magnificent masterpiece Jesus of Nazareth this film comes across as is a lifeless clone... IF you've seen the Zeffirelli film that is.But what if you haven't  what if you couldn't maybe because you live in the jungle some place away from TV sets and westernised living? Then some chaps come into your village set up a sheet between trees wait for dark and then display these magic pictures. NOW which film is the most powerful? The tables are turned and all of a sudden the Jesus film comes out tops. The film is not sophisticated but it's not meant to be. Its power is not due to the imagery but due to the Word of God that it illustrates.Now what about all the narration? It makes it sound like one of those old 16 mm Fact and Faith films that my maths teacher showed in school way back. Like an old newsreel. For a start narration makes the translators' tasks much easier it is after all the most translated film in history. However during the climax we actually loose the narrator altogether  a very unusual device and I'm still not sure if it works that way or not. If I was cynical I'd say the narrator went off for a coffee break but I think they did it that way to help draw the audience sitting spellbound on the hard earth more into the story. The idea of any cinematic style has long left the screen so it probably really doesn't matter and on the primitive level it certainly works.Again desperately failing not to be cynical I see this film as perhaps the Protestant answer to the Catholic Jesus of Nazareth that it desperately tries to copy in part and which was released just two years earlier. It reflects the fundamentalist ethos that it's okay to use film for religious purposes but it is not okay to be absorbed by it. Art can be tolerated so long as the message is loud and clear. I don't mean to be cruel or mean I admire and respect the folks who made this. However I guess I just fail to understand why the producers were not able to get a few more talented people to guide the project to completion. It is a prime example of blinkered movie vision. In the end it doesn't really matter however because the purpose of the film is to help nonChristians encounter Christ himself in his resurrection power  not to have a great night out.As a side note I have figured out a way to really enjoy this movie. Get something useful to do like washing the dishes or painting a wall. Then put the movie on in the same room and listen to the soundtrack as you work and forget it even has moving pictures. The film makes excellent audio and it has a wonderful added bonus whenever you get really curious all you need to do is take a peek at the screen and low and behold as if by magic there's a moving picture of what you've just been listening to! A quite awesome way of listening to the Bible on tape. Because the visuals are almost entirely incidental you can listen to the movie and not miss a thing!On this film I'm really sitting on the fence. For achieving what it set out to do which is basically tell the story of Jesus to primitive audiences I'd rate it 10 out of 10. As a film with any depth of artistic talent I have to be honest and give it a 1 out of 10. So I have to settle for a 5 rating. Which is one higher that the 4 that I hated myself for originally giving it before writing this review and finding a valid reason to mark it up at least one notch.".

It reflects the fundamentalist ethos that it's okay to use film for religious purposes but it is not okay to be absorbed by it. Art can be tolerated so long as the message is loud and clear. I don't mean to be cruel or mean I admire and respect the folks who made this. However I guess I just fail to understand why the producers were not able to get a few more talented people to guide the project to completion. It is a prime example of blinkered movie vision. In the end it doesn't really matter however because the purpose of the film is to help nonChristians encounter Christ himself in his resurrection power  not to have a great night out.As a side note I have figured out a way to really enjoy this movie. Get something useful to do like washing the dishes or painting a wall. Then put the movie on in the same room and listen to the soundtrack as you work and forget it even has moving pictures. The film makes excellent audio and it has a wonderful added bonus whenever you get really curious all you need to do is take a peek at the screen and low and behold as if by magic there's a moving picture of what you've just been listening to! A quite awesome way of listening to the Bible on tape. Because the visuals are almost entirely incidental you can listen to the movie and not miss a thing!On this film I'm really sitting on the fence. For achieving what it set out to do which is basically tell the story of Jesus to primitive audiences I'd rate it 10 out of 10. As a film with any depth of artistic talent I have to be honest and give it a 1 out of 10. So I have to settle for a 5 rating. Which is one higher that the 4 that I hated myself for originally giving it before writing this review and finding a valid reason to mark it up at least one notch.";

The plot of Jesus is generally wellknown even by nonbelievers. The opening scene displays John 31617 from the King James Version. Though the film claims to be entirely from The Gospel of St. Luke it also mixes elements from Matthew's Gospel i.e. a more complete Lord's Prayer said by Christ and the use of the trinitarian baptismal formula. Sadly the acting in Jesus is almost as wooden as the oilpainted icons of the Eastern Church. Brian Deacon delivers a sort of solemn meek interpretation of Jesus of Nazarethmaking the scene in which he casts out the moneychangers from the templelook as if he is only frustrated and not righteously angry. However in the film's defense the acting in Jesus is much more a product of its time in that this was generally accepted as to how Jesus acted. Jesus is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made not because of its production values or acting but because of its content. This 80minute film translated into God knows how many languages has communicated the Gospel to millions all across the globe. Jesus the forerunner of such films as The Gospel of John 2003 and The Passion of the Christ 2004 is one of the finest examples of evangelical filmmaking. Recommended for everyone.".

A minor point but it seems perverse.  The perfect chestnut hair  is  the aspect of the Stained Glass Jesus most often singled out for ridicule. And why an English actor who speaks in veddy veddy proper tones which often seem condescending? Why wasn't the actor who plays Judas chosen to play Jesus? He is tall and dark with piercing eyes and a little scarylooking.  JESUS pours its new wine into too many old bottles on the Sunday School shelf.

Someone who knew a little bit about making movies seems to have stepped in like that Second Pilate at a few points. The scene of the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes is nicely done. Catch that lowangle shot of the Master raising the Bread to Heaven.  The opening shots of the crowds kind of chasing Jesus are nice Gospel illustrations. The interest which St Luke had in the women who gave their all to Christ is conveyed appropriately. The brutality of the Crucifixion is shocking moving. And for people who really know their Bible it's kind of fun to count the peculiarly Lukan touches the screenplay is based on the Third Gospel for example there is no Crown of Thorns because Luke doesn't mention that detail.

I have read the Bible several times and this depicts the life and death of the Lord Jesus Christ very well. The script quotes the scriptures verbatim. That is very important when there are so many cults out there saying what sounds like the scripture but in fact it is not. Whether you are a believer or not whether you are seeking or not it is interesting to watch the life of the man who holds the record of books written about his life. I recommend it. The movie has a soft and pensive mood to it. Please do not expect an action movie. There is a prayer at the end which is really cool! Favorite Quotes For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son for whoever believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.Favorite Scenes When Jesus comes back from the dead and his disciples did not recognize him.".

That is very important when there are so many cults out there saying what sounds like the scripture but in fact it is not. Whether you are a believer or not whether you are seeking or not it is interesting to watch the life of the man who holds the record of books written about his life. I recommend it. The movie has a soft and pensive mood to it. Please do not expect an action movie. There is a prayer at the end which is really cool! Favorite Quotes For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son for whoever believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.Favorite Scenes When Jesus comes back from the dead and his disciples did not recognize him.";

	schema:reviewBody "The really good value in this movie is its accuracy. If you wish to research it you'll find great effort was made to do just that in many details though my comment is specifically referencing the dialog being accurate to the version of Scripture that was used.The weak points are the film quality is not outstanding and much more importantly the acting and directing leave very much to be desired.When this was originally produced it was hoped and planned that this would be the first of a long line of Biblically accurate films but the money just didn't come in and the project was eventually sold and this film became a major evangelism tools around the world. Many millions of people have seen this film and it has accomplished much good for the Gospel.My personal opinion is that the original vision didn't succeed because of the film's glaring weaknesses and those who would have financed more endeavors didn't because they felt those in charge simply didn't have the skills to produce the quality of films that would warrant their investment.The Gospel of John made in 2003 and also faithfully representing the version used is far superior primarily in communicating realism in the film. Every time I watch The Gospel of John I'm moved by the actor representing Jesus. His words are so powerful it's like Jesus Himself is really speaking. Of course this is what every movie about Jesus has wanted to accomplish and I think none does it better than The Gospel of John. I did not like however the Bible version they chose to use but nevertheless it's a powerful presentation of God's Word and I recommend it to everyone regardless of your opinions about Jesus. For the believer they'll be blessed and for the scoffer they may for the first time in their lives really perceive the very powerful claims of Jesus. This is a moving film.I know this was supposed to be a review of Luke and it was but I wanted to especially point you to John since it is IMO so much better in its delivery.Bear in mind when you see voting on Christian films you see a wide disparity because Godhaters don't like the Gospel. I noticed that on this film all who voted before I gave it either a 10 or a 1. A perfect illustration of my point. It deserves neither extreme.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this version many times and I still get goosebumps watching it. Being a Christian myself this film has a whole different impact on me unrelated to the actual quality of the movie itself. So I rate the film higher than I might because other criteria like accuracy to actual scripture and the focus of importance to Christ's message itself are well done. I think this is the best version including the Franco Zeffirelli film Jesus of Nazareth for a 'searching' person to watch. Partly because it is so accurate and the Zeffirelli has some important flaws.The only contention I have with this film is the fact that the lead actor is white and European. I have read the FAQ about this film and I understand that the director John Heyman meant nothing racist by casting Brian Deacon the actor who plays Jesus. From accounts of his auditions Deacon was simply the best actor for the job. I believe this and I'm sure there is no underlying racism in the film whatsoever. Having said that I still believe the casting of Deacon was a mistake.Accuracy and strict adherence to the scriptures were among the most important guidelines in the making of this film according to the film's creators. Yet there is a very significant lapse in accuracy with the casting of a white actor. Jesus was NOT white. He was Middle Eastern for lack of a better word. He was a Semite a Jew and the lead actor should have been also. Or at least physically similar to who Christ really was.The message of Christ is often marginalized because His message or His actual historical self is conformed by man to suit hisher own agenda. It is important to present Him as accurately as possible so that a person's decision concerning Him may be solely based on Christ Himself and not spurious inaccurate garbage. The popular image of Christ in America as white European blondehaired and blueeyed is inaccurate and it bastardizes the purity of his life message and mission. As any gross false representation of Him would do.Presenting Christ as a white person allows critics of any racial background to label His message and indeed Christianity in general as Western religion. Accurately portraying him as a person of Middle Eastern descent in one moment renders that argument false. As false as it really is. A Middle Eastern Israeli Christ is accurate and truthful and truth is the very core of Christianity.I am white and I can accept a savior that doesn't share my skin tone. When white people make films depicting Christ as white it sends a message. The same kind of message that whites send when they hang paintings of Him in their homes that depict Him as white. All this has an underlying message that Christ's skin color His heritage is important for a very wrong reason. It says He must look like us for us to believe in Him for Him to be respected. While His being a certain race and lineage was important to fulfill scripture hence it is important to portray Him as He was it is NOT important to His message His mission or to our acceptance of Him.People all over the world have responded very well to this film. If you are a believer in Christ it is easy to understand why. Because the power of His message is as real today as it was 2000 years ago. The more accurate the retelling of His story the more powerful the message becomes. This movie' s power comes from that accuracy. That attention to detail. It's just unfortunate that any major element like the actual personage of Jesus was allowed to be inaccurate. Christ Himself spoke again and again of the importance of fulfilling prophecy concerning His coming accurately. He said These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.  Luke 2444 NASB. I think it should be our duty as Christians to present Christ as genuinely as possible as genuinely as he lived.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brian Deacon stars in this film about the only begotten of the Almighty God known as The Jesus Film. The screenplay about the life of Jesus was based on the gospel written by Saint Luke which starts from the Annunciation when the Blessed Virgin Mary received the news from the Angel Gabriel that she is going to be the Mother of God up to the time when Jesus  the Son of God  resurrected from the dead.No question that this movie was not made with a great amount of budget similar to the likes of The Ten Commandments at 13 million back in the 1950's or 120 million to present day standards.In factit was only made for 6 million back in 1979 or 25 million to today's standard.Or better yetjust enough to pay movie stars like Leonardo Di Caprio or Tom Cruise.Nor was it really popular mainstream similar to other films about Jesus such as Mel Gibson's The Passion Of Christwhich earned 600 million worldwide. It even lost money earning only 4 million when it was released on the theaters back in 1979 13 million at present.Why did it lose money?The Jesus Film  the 1979 version  can be considered drymonotonous and boring while it was telling the story of Jesus.It also has low production values.What is even noteworthy was that the voices of the actors with the exception of Brian Deaconwho portrayed Jesus was not theirs.Accuracy of the gospel is the only thing it could be really be proud of.But in spite of themthe movie became the most watched film about Jesus of alltime especially in many countries abroad that were willing to evangelize and spread the word of God after it was used to spread the gospel.Its popularity outside the United States was truly surprising at present and it only shows that God is truly alive.Amen!!!".

Unfortunately the backstory just doesn't live up to the potential of the fictional game and the ending is abrupt. Still I found Black Heaven to hold my interest. Perhaps if the main character Gaspard Grgoire LeprinceRinguet hadn't been played as such a dimwitted dork the mystery might have had more tension. As such he's way too passive and detached.

Black Heaven cools it down a little bit. On the positive side we don't have to endure another Dennis Hopper 'attempt to steal the show' performance but the movie kind of neglects to embrace what makes it different and potentially superior. Black Heaven actually has something interesting going for it. Part of the movie plays out in a computer game and there is the sense that Black Heaven could do something more exiting with the story but it keeps everything neat and tidy sometimes resorting to cheap measures. The movie ends way too soon. Just when it looks like Black Heaven might just turn up the heat the game shuts down so to speak after a rather disappointing pay off.Looking back I'll say we have a curious and mystique little indie film but it's not quite there.".

It starts with a Blue Velvetlike opening with a young couple in the South of Francefinding a cell phone that leads them to a young man and woman attempting suicide by pills and gas fumes in a car.

He is smitten by the blonde woman wouldbe suicide and tries to find out who she is by a reference to a virtual reality program the couple mentioned before they tried to end it all. He goes with his friends to smoke some dope in an apartment where the mysterious blonde and her brother happen to live. SPOILERI could go on and fill in the rest of the story but let's just say Gaspard rejects his girlfriend and goes after the blonde only to find out her brother is using her to lure suicidal men to their doom so he can film their suicides. Huh? Are we supposed to believe that she has done this before and survived when she would have died if Gaspard hadn't pulled her out of the car? Are we supposed to believe that the only way he can satisfy this fetish?is to have his sister kill herself? What is this movie trying to say? It ends with Gaspard crying in the police station and telling his original girlfriend he really loves her.

While Audrey is a bit kind than her brother that she finally killed herself for being tired of all this  especially by seeing Gaspard gonna be killed by her brother while she know Gaspard does not wanna commit suicide at all.AlsoI think In the game the brother kept playing his sister's role  Samand seduce those who are tired of living to come out and meet Audrey to commit suicide together.2. What is this movie trying to say? A Everybody has a  Black Hole in hisher mind if heshe go deeply into it and be obsessed then may become the slave of hisher original desire and go to extreme...BesidesI think the director strongly hold a negative opinion on online video games which he may believeinspired our evil and original desires  like violence and eroticism and he just want us to stay away from it coz the whole story is basically about a young guy betrayed his gf and followed his original desire then being involved in all this messbut finally got forgiven after crying in the police station... the plot in the end is really a bit abrupt and naive.

When Creon's wife Eurydice Ilia Livykou is informed of the death of her son she also commits suicide leaving Creon alone.The theatrical Antigoni is a nice feature about the famous Greek tragedy of Sophocles focused in Antigone the incestuous daughter of Oedipus and therefore also his halfsister and Jocasta's granddaughter. The movie begins with an important big picture of Thebes and the major characters of that period and is extremely well acted. This is the first time that I watch this movie and I saw it in an American VHS. I only regret the quality of the subtitles that are visibly too much summarized since there are long speeches of characters that are translated in two or three words in English. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Not Available".

Over the years I've seen many versions of Antigone both films and TV and even read two translations of the timeless tale by Sophocles but I was mainly interested in seeing this one as I've never heard it spoken in Greek before. Can't understand a word whether it makes it more authentic or not is debatable  and after digesting all the concepts in the play whether you need another idea to debate is also debatable  but it certainly adds another dimension.Strong minded woman Antigone wants to bury her brother Polyneices returned from exile who kills but is killed in battle by her other brother Eteocles who is feted as Thebes' saviour and given a hero's burial. Wilful King Creon decrees death to anyone honourably burying the traitor Polyneices bringing calamity and endless moral dilemmas for all concerned. Antigone is excellently played by Irene Papas fresh from The Guns of Navarone the year before. This is Sophocles whizzed through in eighty minutes concentrating on this wilfulness pride and refusal to listen either to their gods counsel or commonsense. It's been a salutary lesson for all people but especially despots and politicians of all eras some wilfully blind leaders lead nations to war and destruction with their gods on their side and in the aftermath justify themselves even if it means black must be whiteand vv too of course. The ever modern tragedies are that the despots and politicians never heed the lessons in here though and indeed that ordinary people still desire shepherds to lead them. Without going into any of the moral and ethical points raised plenty mentioned in other comments here as a film it's a reasonable effort and well acted and engrossing enough although I'd always imagined Thebes to be a little grander somehow. If you're still unsure memorable lots to chew over but absolutely no laughs.".

	schema:headline " Moral and Ethical Grounds Shaping Characters in Antigone";
	schema:reviewBody "Moral claims do not give rise to philosophical grounds. Yet In Antigone it is clear that moral actions prompt philosophical questions and inherently make good drama.This review acts as a strict focus on how moral and ethical points are made throughout the film and how they act as catalysts to progress the story and keep the viewer involved. Be it known that I have not read the Sopheclean text of Antigone and fully derive all of my comments and criticisms solely within the boundaries of the film.The character flaws present in the film mostly derive from wayward and distorted adherences to moral ideologies. For example Antigone's ethical and moral backbone throughout the film is guided by powerful intangibles like love and loneliness which makes her rash and at times misguided. Creon's moral code is also in knots as he acts as a Euthyphro in the fact that he is conflicted and contradictory to many of his beliefs that shape him i.e. his aforementioned moral code. Values undoubtedly shaped the society of Ancient Greece. Loyalty was a cornerstone value in this society yet loyalty drifts and fades as tides turn in Antigone. For example as Creon is crowned King of Thebes he is shown immediate support as the new benevolent King yet mourning for Oedipus or any mention of him whatsoever is non existent. Is this a loyal Thebes? Though support of Creon was warranted by his grace the remembrances of a fallen king laid flat. As Creon sits on his thrown surrounded by his court he states The country's foe is always mine. Little did Creon know that he was the biggest threat to his country and thus his own foe. Because of the nature of Greek Tragedies and the intuition of most people the common viewer could understand this at first glimpse. It was clear that Creon's hubris and pride would be his downfall.Antigone acting as the protagonist in the film is the embodiment of good. Yet contradictions within her moral ideology leads to questioning what good actually is. Is her entire moral and ethical embodiment good? Is it her choices of which moral standpoints to act upon that are what is good? Or is it her actions that are good? Simply put Antigone is a walking paradox. It is impossible to know what is good. Acting against Zeus due to her undying love and care for her brother or burying her brother because it is just in the Gods' eyes to do so. Both are contradictory and both can be good.It is clear that both the protagonist and antagonist have inner conflicts. Their inner ideologies contradict. What makes one a protagonist and another an antagonist lies in the fact that the shared ideologies between them also conflict. Inner contradictions within an individual which conflict with another individuals already clashing ideologies makes it impossible to know who is right and who is wrong. Both characters were acting upon the same ethical grounds. They acted to safeguard human law religious law and family values. Is it then that moral grounds are shaped by convenience and circumstance? Does one's moral backbone fit the skeleton of a different distortion of themselves? Is moral rectitude a variable of space and time? Is it the contradictions of moral standpoints that are convenient because they can be malleable to fit any form? These are the questions that I believe the film poses. The film does a fantastic job at examining exactly what grants a legitimate moral claim or action which most people are curious about. Reason is man's most precious gift and by the will of nature the tone of his reasoning is determined by his moral code.".

	schema:headline " Director's Purpose";
	schema:reviewBody "I believe the director's purpose was to persuade the audience to consider the following argument Man is given only a limited number of chances to change his unrighteousstubborn behavior into something more righteous just and humble. If man refuses to submit to these chances thereby procrastinating his repentance until the end he not only causes unnecessary suffering upon others but also upon himself. This theme is illustrated through Creon in four ways.Creon is given many chances throughout the film to change from stubborn tyrant to humble citizenone who is equal and openminded with everyone else. His first opportunity to change occurs through the exchange of words he has with his son Haemon. Haemon attempts to persuade his father to free Antigone by stimulating his mind to reason. He graciously tells his father that he respects him and that he will submit to his will if it be just. However Haemon does not believe his father's will is just and attempts to open his mind to other truths that exist outside his narrow perspectivenamely the truth of what Antigone did for her brother was noble and laudable. Haemon also gives a metaphor to what will happen to his father if he does not submit to humility Pliant trees survive even the fiercest storms. But rigid trees will break and collapse in the slightest wind. Even hearing the Chorus say that the words of his son are worth giving attention to Creon is too dogmatic at this point. It's going to take a lot more to change his heart.His second opportunity to change is given to him through Antigone's last testimony before she is sentenced to dwell forever in the cave. Feeling that death is about to overtake her she cries out to Creon asking him what she has done wrongwhat law she has broken. She admits that if her action is wrong she will repent of her sins. But she also admits and prophesies that if her accuser is wrong that the same death and curse placed upon her will also come upon him. This is a foreshadow of what was yet to take place to Creon a man who continued to act as the rigid tree his son earlier warned him about kind of like an Abinadi moment. Still Creon is set in his ways and refuses to renounce his unrighteous judgments.His third opportunity to change seems to be the most effective in softening his heart. Knowing that the prophet has never been wrong about any foretold prediction the blind prophet foretells the terrible fate that lies at Creon's discretion if he does not change. These words carry heavy weight into Creon's heart causing him to now consider freeing Antigone and burying Polynices.The fourth opportunity comes from the Chorus. Upon contemplating the prophet's words Creon announces Tell me what I must do and I will do it. The Chorus reproaches the king and tells him that he must free Antigone and bury Polynices in order for the curse to be removed. However by the time he acts on this advicewhich was the advice he was given all alongit is too late. Antigone Haemon and his wife all end up killing themselves as a result of Creon's procrastination. He now finds himself in a world of pain having finally learned to comply with obedience through the things in which he suffered but was now too late to do anything about. The last scene where Creon is escorted outside the walls of the kingdom produced a haunting image for me in what will happen to those who procrastinate the day of their repentance. Those who do so will in a like manner be escorted outside the celestial gates by the sentinels that guard themkeeping the impure and unholy out.".

These words carry heavy weight into Creon's heart causing him to now consider freeing Antigone and burying Polynices.The fourth opportunity comes from the Chorus. Upon contemplating the prophet's words Creon announces Tell me what I must do and I will do it. The Chorus reproaches the king and tells him that he must free Antigone and bury Polynices in order for the curse to be removed. However by the time he acts on this advicewhich was the advice he was given all alongit is too late. Antigone Haemon and his wife all end up killing themselves as a result of Creon's procrastination. He now finds himself in a world of pain having finally learned to comply with obedience through the things in which he suffered but was now too late to do anything about. The last scene where Creon is escorted outside the walls of the kingdom produced a haunting image for me in what will happen to those who procrastinate the day of their repentance. Those who do so will in a like manner be escorted outside the celestial gates by the sentinels that guard themkeeping the impure and unholy out.";

Thebes then comes under the control of Creon who rules that Eteocles is to have an honorable burial while Polynieces is to remain above ground. Creon saw Polynieces as a traitor of the town and undeserving of an honorable burial. Antigone sister of Polynieces and Eteocles decides to defy Creon's orders and bury her brother. As a result she is sentenced by Creon to live the remainder of her days confined in a cave. Haemon Creon's son tries desperately to change his father's opinion but is unable to do so.

Once Eurydice the wife of Creon learns of the death of her son she too commits suicide. In the end Creon is alone due to the fact that he was unwilling to reconsider his punishment. This movie raises the question of whether or not the virtues of one are more important than the virtues of others. Antigone was trying to ensure that her brother received an honorable burial so that he could proceed to the afterlife she had an obligation to do this because he was her brother. Creon on the other hand made the edict and felt as though he must adhere to it because if he did not his subjects would think that he was weak and that they could do as they pleased. The movie in my opinion shows the need for reason and compassion when dictating laws that others must follow one must consider the virtues of others while at the same time maintaining the peace and keeping order.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning of the movie Isme exhibits selfpreservation when she does not want to help Antigone bury their brother Polynieces. She values her own life above honorably burying her dead kin. Their other brother Eteocles deserved an honorable burial according to the king since he was not a traitor. The king decrees that Polnieces be left to the wild animals to devour because the gods willed it. Antigone is not worried about preserving her own life because she feels like she has a higher calling to respect the dead especially when it is your own family. She knows by burying Polynieces she could be ordered to be put to death by the king who is also her uncle. However she feels there is an unwritten law given by the gods which is greater than his law that the dead should be buried. The king is in a position to where he is supposed to govern the city by its laws which is not to bury the enemy near the city. Obviously he is valuing the law over his family because Isme Polynieces Eteocles and Antigone are his nieces and nephews.The story is very comparable to the trial of Socrates. Socrates felt like his philosophizing was a service to the gods. The city of Athens accused him of creating new gods and corrupting the minds of the youth. He is placed on trial and sentenced to death because of the charge.Socrates like Antigone chose death over not obeying the laws of the city because they valued their own beliefs. In both stories there could have possibly been room for compromise. It was noble that the King and the city of Athens were trying to enforce the laws of the land. However it appeared they did not even consider the views of Socrates or Antigone. In fact the King regrets his decision to sentence Antigone to death after she has already died. It is not clear whether the city of Athens deemed their decision appropriate after Socrates died.Justice is when there is harmony between society and individuals. In the story of Antigone it seemed like the death of Antigone caused more chaos than harmony. By the time the King realizes he had been stubborn in the sentencing his son wife and niece have committed suicide. It seems it would have been more just to give Polynieces some type of burial. If the King had decided to bury him so much of his family would not have died. Like Antigone Socrates was no longer living harmoniously with Athens because he was convicted of disobeying their laws. Socrates never made new gods he just had different views of the gods Athens served. It seems Athens framed him and caused chaos by trying him. It was the city of Athens against Socrates at his trial. Because the city deemed his actions unjust he was killed even though he did not technically disobey the law.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Antigone's two brothers are killed King Creon rules that only Polynices will be denied a proper burial because he died an enemy of the state. While Polynices died banding together with others against the city of Thebes his brother Eteocles died defending the state. Antigone buries her brother Polynices even though the King ordered that he be neither touched nor buried. When caught Antigone did not argue nor deny her actions for she believed what she did was right. When banished to a cave Antigone killed herself before the king could retract his punishment. The morality in question here is about the placement of Antigone's loyalty. Should she obey the commands of her God or the commands of her city's ruler? In Crito Socrates claims that disobeying one's country is worse than disobeying one's mother and father that doing so harms the soul and makes life not worth living. Antigone's moral beliefs however were to obey the rules of her God and give her brother a proper burial and rather than breaking those rules she acted upon them and accepted her fate calmly just as Socrates did in the Apology. In Euthyphro Socrates ponders over the meaning of piety with Euthyphro and although a definition is never reached many examples of piety are given. Actions that are pleasing to the gods or that are concerned with the care of the gods are all pious actions and therefore good and moral. This is because the gods would not will anything that is immoral. I think that in Euthyphro and Socrates' opinion Antigone's actions would be moral because she is acting upon her knowledge of the rules of the gods.".

	schema:headline " Review deals with moral dilemmas in Antigone";
	schema:reviewBody "The plot of Antigone is about the city of Thebes having just come under new rule after the death of Oedipus along with his two sons Polynices and Eteocles. The city's new ruler King Creon is plotted against a citizen mourning her brother's death Antigone. After the death of both of her brothers Creon states that only Eteocles shall be given a proper burial because he died defending his city. On the other hand Polynices got together an army to fight against Thebes and died an enemy of the state. Antigone has the internal dilemma of choosing to obey her king or to obey the divine ruling of the Gods and to honor her brother with a burial. The moral dilemmas presented in this film can be related to those in Plato's works Euthyphro and Republic. The main question brought about it what is right or just? Antigone must question is the justice in her brother's burial a greater justice than Creon's rule? Euthyphro would argue yes it would be justified to bury her brother in a religious fashion for he was a believer and its what the Gods would want therefore it is just and pious. In Plato's republic Thraseymachus argues that just is the will of the stronger. He believes that a ruler must be obeyed. Thus in his perspective Antigone would have gone against what was right and just by going against her ruler her king Creon. The problem that we as the viewers must question then is how can you decide which justice is the greater one? Antigone apparently sees going against the will of the gods a s a greater injustice for she buries her brother despite Creon's demands. It is then King Creon who is placed in a difficult situation when his punishment to Antigone his son's soon to be bride causes her to hang herself and thus he tears apart the family. Though he once stated that a rule with exceptions is a weak rule one can argue that the rules of morality must have exceptions so are they therefore weak? Or are they stronger because they can be molded to fit any question. I saw the min questioned posed in the film as which injustice was greater thus presenting each character with their own internal argument. Memorable parts of the film having to do with morality How hard is it for a mind to be changed by force? King Creon Reason is man's most precious gift and by the will of nature the tone of his reasoning is determined by his moral code. Antigone the movie".

On the one hand Antigone must remain loyal to her brother and is obligated to bury him. On the other hand it was forbidden to bury enemies of the city near it. The only real problem I have with this movie is that there was nothing stopping her from burying her brother further from the city. While in the movie the command is that he shall not be buried in actuality there was no such rule only that it could not be near the city. But I suppose that would result in a boring movie. Even though she seemed to go against the commands of the gods it was the ruler who ended up being punished by the gods for retaliating against Antigone. What does this tell us? Perhaps that commitments to family are stronger than to the law but if this were so how would the city's existence be possible? Clearly the laws are more important. Perhaps the only thing that really irked the gods was the way in which the ruler handled the situation. Executing Antigone went too far and insulting the prophet of the gods sealed his fate. Where do our true loyalties lie? Our society or our family? Are they one and the same? Overall a decent movie. If you have a bit of time to ill I recommend you check this movie out.".

	schema:headline " Antigone in relation to Plato and Socrates";
	schema:reviewBody "Antigone is an old Greek play turned movie that is about family civil disobedience and commands of the gods. In the film King Creon has just occupied the throne and has commanded that Eteocles the previous ruler have a royal burial while Polyneices Eteocles' brother has been declared a traitor and is to be left to the birds. I'll give a little bit of the backdrop here simply for clarification purposes. The two brothers Polyneices and Eteocles have two sisters Ismene and Antigone they are all the children of the previous king Oedipus and were born out of incest. When King Oedipus vacated the throne his two sons agreed to rule together obviously this did not work out as planned so Polyneices raised an army to attack the city and overthrow his brother. They met on the battlefield and killed each other right after this is where the movie begins.King Creon proclaimed that anyone who was caught trying to bury Polyneices would be stoned to death. Antigone wants to bury her brother anyway because she believes that it is against the gods' will not to give him a proper burial. This is synonymous to the Greek philosopher Socrates who claimed he must live the philosophical life by questioning Athens' wise men on their selfproclaimed knowledge. He said that this was a command by the gods and that he was doing his city a service therefore he would not stop living a philosophical life even if the cities' rulers command it. Antigone is caught with her brother's corps King Creon has her buried alive in a cave. Antigone accepts her sentence with dignity claiming that she did right by the gods for burying her brother. In the Apology Socrates is sentenced to death by the city since he will not abstain from his questioning lifestyle. Similarly to Antigone Socrates knew he would be found guilty and accepts his fate calmly. Both protagonists stuck with their moral beliefs rather than bending to the pressure of man they felt it would be better to die than to live in disobedience to the gods.At one point Socrates questioned a man named Euthyphro about the meaning of piety. Euthyphro gives multiple definitions throughout the dialogue for what piety is doing what is pleasing to all the gods the part of justice which is concerned with care of the gods and praying and sacrificing to the gods. Socrates finds holes in each of these definitions however and the conversation ends unsatisfactorily. I believe Euthyphro would have told Antigone that she was correct on obeying the gods and honoring her brother he also would have told the king that he was just in punishing Antigone despite her being engaged to his son. Socrates taught that obeying the gods was more important than obeying human law. However in Crito his friend tries to convince Socrates to run away from his death sentence and Socrates refuses because he doesn't want to disregard the laws of the city thus weakening the state. Haemon Creon's son does not outright tell his father thus the law that he is wrong in punishing Antigone. Merely that Creon ought to think it over and change his mind. Because he does not Haemon and Creon's wife ultimately commit suicide and Creon is left alone and unhappy. Not too many years after they put Socrates to death the great city of Athens fell and it has since never returned to its previous glory.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the film Antigone the debate on what is just and unjust is presented. This theme is of course a very popular topic in Greek literature. The Greek philosopher Socrates questioned many times what to follow based on what is considered just. The film depicts the character Antigone going against King Creon's decree by doing what she considers just but ultimately she died standing up for her cause. Creon who is the current king to the city of Thebes has recently taken the throne after the exile and death of the previous king Oedipus and the death of his two sons Polyneices and Eteocles. After Oedipus left Thebes his two sons were left to switch back and forth being king of the city. The first brother to have a turn was Eteocles. When the time came for his reign to end he of course did not want to give up his noble position. So based on his brother's inability to step down Polyneices decide to revolt and started a war against the city of Thebes. Ultimately both brothers were killed in the battle. After their deaths Creon took the throne and since Polyneices was the one who started the war Creon deemed him a traitor and Eteocles a hero for defending the city. For Creon's first edict as king he declares that Eteocles will receive a rightful burial but Polyneices' body will be left in the desert unburied since he was a traitor and does not deserve a rightful burial. Antigone who is one of Polyneices and Eteocles' sisters does not agree with this edict and viewers too might have conflicting views on this edict. Antigone is faced with the tough decision to either follow the unwritten laws of the gods that say to bury the body or the written laws of the city that say to follow the king's command. Antigone struggles with her decision but since she sees Polyneices as her brother and not as a traitor she rebels against the laws of the city and follows what the gods' command. Similarly in the book Apology the author Plato transcribes Socrates' speech of defending himself against living a philosophical life. Socrates too had to make a similar decision like Antigone to either follow the god that told Socrates to live his philosophical life or follow the city's command of him stopping his philosophical life. Socrates like Antigone chose to follow the god because he thought it was more just to follow the god than to follow the city's laws in that situation. Due to them both rebelling against their cities' laws Socrates and Antigone were both sentenced to death. Creon did not want her blood on his hands so he left the decision up to Antigone to either live or die. Antigone eventually killed herself since she was put in a cave to die. She knew that she was ultimately going to be judged by the gods so in her mind since she followed the gods' commands she exemplified justice and had nothing to lose by ending her life for her just cause. At this point in the film viewers may feel bad for Antigone's death since she was only trying to do the right thing or they could agree that she broke the laws and therefore her death was justified. Socrates too decided to face his death instead of escaping. However in the book Crito Socrates reasons for facing his punishment were because the laws of the city told him to do so not the god. Because of this change in who to follow one could argue that it seems as if it is just to follow both the laws of the city and the gods but it may depend on the situation and person. So as a viewer of the film Antigone however we see that it is more just to follow the gods because in the end they stopped hearing the prayers of the city and turned against Thebes because of King Creon's actions.".

	schema:reviewBody "Antigone written by Sophocles is a characteristic Greek tragedy where the city's king Creon is faced with a moral dilemma that eventually hastens his fall from grace. Set in antiquity the movie's plot is designed to question presupposed ideas of justice and wisdom as they were seen through the ancient Greek perspective. In the movie the protagonist Antigone is faced with a moral dilemma after her king Creon orders that her brother should be left unburied a terrible punishment in ancient Greek culture since it would prevent his passage through the river Styx. Eventually Despite the king's decree Antigone decided that her brother's death without burial was unjust and challenged Creon's authority to prevent his burial by performing the ritual herself. After the discovery of her crime Creon sentences Antigone to death  an act that created a great deal of unpopularity in the kingdom and incited lines of questioning very similar to contemporary Socratic arguments.Creon's decision to sentence Antigone to death and her brother to a hellish afterlife were seen as unjust and despotic by the people of Thebes and caused his wisdomauthority to be questioned. Since ancient Greeks believed that the Sovereign set the morality of their city state the act of questioning alone represents Socratic argument. Sophocles sets up questioning in a manner very similar to Socratic arguments made through Euthyphro and Apology by using Creon's own son and oracle to test Creon's judgment in an attempt to show that just being a king does not make someone wise or knowledgeable of justice. The morality of Antigone eventually surfaces after Creon's fall from grace. At the end of the movie Creon finally sees the error of his ways but Sophocles uses his downfall to express how even king's judgment can be governed through hubris instead of actual wisdom.".

The grounds for Antigone's moral claim were her religion and her family values. Antigone believed in the unspoken rule of the gods and she believed that burying her brother Polynices was a right and just act because of the gods. Antigone is indifferent to what is right and wrong unless it pertains to the gods. This reason is very closely linked to Socrates' reasons for his actions. Socrates is sent to court because he is charged with corrupting the youth and not believing in gods. Socrates claims that he could not have been acting unjustly because the gods ordered him to go search for someone that was less knowledgeable than he. When the courts claim that he has been acting wrongly Socrates claims that he will not stop living a philosophical life even if the courts tell him to. Likewise Antigone claims that she will not stop burying her brother even though the King has ordered her not to. King Creon claims that Antigone committed an unjust act because she disobeyed him and the king demands obedience whether his rules are right or wrong. This ties in with Socrates' argument that one must never do wrong return an injustice for an injustice or mistreat others. Even though Antigone knew that the King's orders were not just she should not have buried her brother Polynices because that was a wrong act. She should not have returned the injustice of the king ordering the people not to bury P with disobeying the king by burying him. If the laws were to ask Antigone if they had made an agreement Antigone would have said yes.

	schema:headline " Justice vs. Morals in Antigone";
	schema:reviewBody "Antigone is a tragic tale that centers on honor justice and morals. The story takes place in Thebes soon after the city has been attacked. The movie begins with Antigone and Ismene being devastated after their two brothers killed each other in battle. Antigone tells Ismene how the new ruler King Creon is going to provide an honorable burial for Eteocles but leave Polynieces unburied for the vultures to pick apart for his betrayal to Thebes. The Ancient Greeks held the honor of their cities in very high regard. The fact that Polynieces attacked the city that gave him his life was appalling to King Creon. King Creon based his decision off of divine law and what Zeus would want for betraying ones homeland and brother. This basis can be compared to Socrates' argument that he must obey the gods and his divine sign. King Creon believed he stood for justice and was doing the right thing by following the gods rule yet in Euthyphro Socrates came to the conclusion that something is not right or just just because the god commands it. On the other hand Antigone sees honoring her family and her love for her brother as the right thing to do. Antigone tells Ismene that she is going to give Polynieces a proper burial even if it goes against the King's command. Antigone also bases her decision on the unwritten law of the gods because she thinks it is higher in power than the King's edict not to bury her brother. After Antigone buries Polynieces he is unburied by the King's soldiers and they catch Antigone at the burial site when she returns to her brothers side a second time. King Creon sentences Antigone to death without any deliberation. Haemon King Creon's son stands for reason and tells his father that others can be right too and one should not be so fast to judge. He tells his father how the city sees Antigone as noble but they are too afraid to speak out against the King's verdict. This situation is similar to the trial of Socrates in that all parties on both sides say they believe in the gods and base their decisions off them yet they all have differing views of what is right. Antigone believed she was following the rules of the gods and standing for the justice of her own blood. King Creon also believed he was following the god's laws and stood for the justice and values of the state. Socrates claimed to be obeying the command of the god and stood for all that is right and good i.e. virtues truth fairness and justice. The jurymen in Socrates' trial accused him of being impious and used the justice of the laws to sentence Socrates to death. In both cases neither side showed any flexibility in what they saw as right and just. There is an ethical dilemma in that what is just is not always morally right and one should use reason to determine this rather than basing decisions solely off the gods command.".

The ethical dilemma presented in the film is much like Plato's works Euthyphro and Republic. Creon as the ruler Thebes thinks it just to not bury the fallen enemies near the city as it would disgrace the city. Antigone on the other hand feels it just to her fallen brother a confederate to the previous regime that he be given a proper burial in regard to his and Antigone's beliefs in the Gods. The conflict gets its genesis from a varying view of what is just or the right thing to do. Take Plato's dialogue between Socrates and Euthyphro in Euthyphro. Euthyphro explains to Socrates that something pious just good is something unanimously loved by the Gods. Socrates raises the question as to whether the gods love the pious because it is the pious or whether something pious is only pious because it is loved by the gods. The circular dilemma present by Euthyphro brings a question to Antigone. Is she right for wanting her brother buried and disrupting edicts by Creon's rule? Is her pious belief in the Gods something she ought to uphold? Does the good or justice in her brother's burial supersede Creon's rule? Additionally in Plato's Republic Thraseymachus explains to Socrates that the just is the advantage of the stronger and that it is just to obey one's rulers. Socrates argues against this conclusion but with weak premises. For Euthyphro Antigone would be justified in wanting her brother buried in his religious fashion which would dictate his corpse not rotting in the woods. Thraseymachus on the other hand would say that the justice resides in the ruler Creon for better or worse. Which is right?".

	schema:headline " The Ethical Dilemmas in Antigone";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie Antigone is based on Sophocles' tragic play. It follows the play's plot perfectly and does a great job showing the emotional responses of the characters. There is great turmoil within the city after Oedipus left because of exile. His two sons Polynices and Eteocles are fighting with one another because Polynices raised an army to fight against Thebes. They ended up killing one another leaving Oedipus' two daughters Antigone and Ismene. Creon was named king after Oedipus left and he decided that a proper burial should happen for Eteocles the brother that died as a hero defending his city. As for Polynices King Creon decided that he was not worthy of a proper burial and his body must be left unburied for the animals and scavengers. When Antigone heard his edict she was shocked and upset that King Creon was not going to give both brothers a burial. She plotted against him and decided she would bury him herself. She goes to her sister Ismene for support in her decision but Ismene wanted no part in Antigone's plan. When the people of Thebes discovered who buried Polynices' body they were shocked. King Creon sentenced Antigone to death for disobeying his law even though she was engaged to his son Haemon. He told his people that the laws are the laws and no one is exempt from them not even his family. The plot quickly turns tragic when Antigone hangs herself in the cave she was sealed in. When Haemon finds her he is so stricken with grief and anger that he lashes out at his father and ends up killing himself.With this story there are two major ethical dilemmas that the characters are faced with. Antigone's dilemma deals with her religion and belief that the Gods command all bodies to be buried and they will cause unhappiness within the city and her family if these commands are not followed. She is also trying to grieve for her lost brother in the best way that she knows how being a dedicated and honoring sister by burying his body. Antigone was handed a hard circumstance in which she had to choose between the honor and loyalty of her Gods and Family or choose to obey the King. King Creon's dilemma is the fact that his soon to be daughterinlaw disobeyed him and he has to treat her like a regular citizen in order to maintain the respect he has from the citizens of Thebes. If she was pardoned from the law other people would start to use that as an excuse to stop following the laws and orders of the King. These two dilemmas are in direct relation to Plato's idea of justice and what is right and wrong. According to Plato's accounts of Socrates' dialogues in Crito and Apology justice is never doing wrong or causing harm to anyone. In this movie Antigone felt that it was an injustice to her family and her brother to not bury his body and it was wrong and unjust in the eyes of the Gods. As Euthyphro would say it was an impiety to the Gods to leave his body unburied.".

It is dignified stately and absolutely dripping with fate destiny and tragedy.But what if you are more like an average moviegoer? Does it hold up under more normal criteria? I think it does to some extent but not particularly well. The plot is started at the very beginning of the opening scene as Antigone expresses her determination to bury her dead brother and everything else follows inevitably  the entire story is plotdriven. It's a rather simple plot but it does carry you along. I'm not sure there's a lot more that's really compelling about the film. It's pretty stagey with actors and extras forming nice patterns as if lining up with chalk lines on the floor. Although there are a number of small processions and such this is not a costume epic with a cast of thousands and crane shots filling the screen with colourful eye candy. It's filmed in black and white. Is the acting good? Sure but bear in mind that the range of emotions is quite limited and characters pretty much talk in set speeches. They do imbue their dignified speeches with the correct emotions and make them sound sincere.But to be honest I don't think you would recommend this film to anyone unless they had a preexisting interest in classical Greek drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "Again this film marks one of the many I've missed from last year's Tokyo International Film Festival so I'm pretty glad it finally made its way to our shores. The premise is a sure giveaway of the plot but anyone wishing to watch a Japanese romantic weepy will know what you're in for from the start. I Give My First Love To You doesn't deviate from the formula but like others that came before it and for others in the same genre to come what fans almost always do is to hold onto whatever sliver of hope there is for the couple in question to be together forever in a happily ever after against the odds of what medical condition one or both of them suffer from.Here the lovebirds are portrayed by Masaki Okada as Takuma Kakunouchi the boy who suffers from a weak heart condition and is given a death sentence that he will not cross 20 years of age and Mao Inoue as Mayu Taneda the daughter of his doctor Toru Nakamura with whom he falls in love with during his frequent trips to the hospital when young. Needless to say they grow up together and in one of their childish games he promises that he will survive and marry her wished upon a four leafed clover she finds in the field. They grow up as a couple and have each other for support in school but as Takuma is aware his days are numbered and are looming over the horizon and so is contemplating giving her up so that hopefully she can find someone else to grow older with.Much of the scenes that require you to pull out your tissue packs involve how clingy Mayu can be in not relenting in her feelings and her resolve that one day Takuma may just pull through his condition or that the proper heart donor may just come along which the narrative of course will introduce but not without putting the characters through some morality checks and in so take the opportunity to explore why the necessity to keep some red tape onto these medical administration and the technicalities and rationale behind such confidentiality clauses otherwise well you can see how family members can be put in a spot be it the donor's or the recipient's. There's a key scene that makes one think how what can be perceived as selfishness is nothing more than again that bit of hope every family member and loved one hold on to.The narrative doesn't promise much about how Takuma tries to scout for an appropriate chap for his girlfriend to fall in love with since Yoshihiko Hosoda's Takashi was a little too pushy and in fact irritating to begin with nor does it have a lot of screen time to dwell on the potential distraction Takuma faces with another fellow female patient Ryoko Yoko Moriguchi but whatever it managed to cover in between the primary couple's life touches on the necessity for them to spend almost every waking moment with their significant other and to make such moments count which Mayu knows and Takuma finally learns to appreciate a lot more. The latter half of the film then switches tact to demonstrate the extent how a loved one will likely go through in their grief and hanging onto whatever little hope a situation may bring and that extends to family members as well not such the romantic other half. After all any death or potential death affects a larger community.I will not deny this makes a perfect date movie since the message here is quite clear on the appreciation of someone else no matter how quirky they can be and never to doubt anyone's commitment. Between the two leads whose performances were key in fleshing out the intricate characters and making them believable and engaging Mao Inoue shines as that cheerful ray of sunshine in Takuma's life and her antics are what brings about the light hearted moments in the film. It's melodramatic territory sometimes but your typical Japanese romantic movie that will tug at your heartstrings this will be. Be prepared and pack those tissues. Recommended.".

I thought the beginning started out pretty well until it started to go in a route that has been done before just too many times and has been done better. There are tear jerking moments in this and will lead girls and maybe some guys to almost cry while watching it mainly cause of the emotion that is poured out in some scenes. This movie is kinda like the Japanese version of The Notebook although it was adapted into a movie from a Japanese novel or manga. The story is basically about a boy who is dying very quickly and won't have a chance to reach the age of 20 but there is a girl who is deeply in love with him and her father is a doctor. Soon another guy is put into the equation who falls for the same girl and so on. It's decent romanticdrama and is a good date movie as well.7.410".

This movie is kinda like the Japanese version of The Notebook although it was adapted into a movie from a Japanese novel or manga. The story is basically about a boy who is dying very quickly and won't have a chance to reach the age of 20 but there is a girl who is deeply in love with him and her father is a doctor. Soon another guy is put into the equation who falls for the same girl and so on. It's decent romanticdrama and is a good date movie as well.7.410";

	schema:reviewBody "Right from the beginning of the movie it is obvious the viewer has discovered something especially heartbreaking and emotionally beautiful. The natural environments which are vividly colorful and heighten the impact of the scenes occurring there contrast with the dull bleakness of the school and hospital rooms the film is primarily centered around. Over the course of the feature selfishness is an important theme discussed both visually and through dialogue. Takuma Masaki Okada discovers as a young boy that he won't live to see the age of twenty with his current heartcondition this shocking truth additionally hurting Mayu Mao Inoue his closest companion and paramour who he promises to marry when they are older. Despite the revelation that Takuma's health may restrict him from such a commitment Mayu's unwavering affection is brilliantly portrayed though at the same time Takuma is concerned for the future and the agony his inevitable passing will bring if she remains close to him.Takuma's narration assists the audience in comprehending how dear Mayu is to him and contextualizes the reasons behind why he may eventually choose to leave her. However despite their characters sharing considerable proximity over the course of the feature I wondered if the leads were totally aware of each others feelings and though these are presented visually this could have been heightened verbally there being one scene in particular where the leads argue as to whether they unanimously understand one another. It should be noted moreover for the most part the dialogue is entertaining and mature fitting perfectly with the story.At the same time Kou Yoshihiko Hosoda is unmoved by the fear of being selfish his arrogantly inconsiderate character though well portrayed nefariously affecting the mood of the film his infatuation with Mayu jeopardizing the relationship between the leads. Though there is reason for his character's repetitive appearance other individuals in the film with less screen time deserved greater attention. This is especially true for Dr. Takahito Toru Nakamura who is an entertaining yet sympathetic figure his professional devotion and critical evaluation of himself being well delivered while the relationship between he and his daughter Mayu potentially needed further attention to accentuate their fatherdaughter bond. The passing of Mayu's mother before the story begins is barely touched upon which could have proved a subplot capable of heightening Mayu's desire to never be without Takuma. Moreover Teru Natsuki Harada who like Takuma suffers a rapidly declining heart condition is a character that he is able to relate towards due to their similar circumstances her role deserving further attention to heighten their prior knowledge of each other which is only briefly discussed while additionally fleshing her character out further. Tetta Sugimoto and Yoko Moriguchi as Takuma's father and mother admirably portray parents stricken by grief who only want the best care for their child the acting by the cast being potentially one of the film's most brilliant qualities. Though humor is on occasion used a scene where Mayu addresses the entire year level and confesses her love for Takuma being especially comedic the profound realism exhibited by the melodramatic seriousness of the plot makes the feature feel all the more believable none of the scenes appearing forced or out of place.Despite the film containing a romantic narrative the theme of death is strongly discussed especially by Takuma the film addressing the thoughtprovoking notion on whether death is more difficult than life or if it's in fact the other way round. Furthermore the luxury of hope is well included in the story and despite the ending undoubtedly provoking a tearyeyed response the film concludes in a manner that efficaciously beautifully and romantically closes this particularly touching feature.".

This video tape is now one of my greatest treasures. I can't find this movie anywhere no matter where or how hard I look  not online not in video stores or specialist stores not in libraries or anywhere else. Only in Knowhereland. Will I ever see this whole movie?Why am I so obsessed with 10 minutes of a movie I haven't seen? Funny and strange I know. Those 10 minutes felt like a lifetime of offthescale filmmaking. The maddest 10 movie minutes without any need for gore or special effects. Total unadulterated Art capital A included because this truly was great Art. Those 10 little minutes alone felt like 3 or 4 full movies and 6 or 7 top Directors all rolled into one crazy hypershow. It was surreal funny heartbreaking philosophical happy disturbing spiritual frightening sad scientific insane solemn and I'm running out of words to describe all the things those 10 measly minutes were. Now it's only 5 minutes on ancient video tape. Woe is me.I will tell you nothing about the plot. I do know what the movie is about and its style of presentation but it's better to seek the movie like me  I hope you've better luck. I will tell you about the first 5 minutes I saw because I don't want to ruin the other 5 minutes  the ending which is intense and overwhelming in a freeing way. Oxymorons pepper this movie. If I was reading this I'd leave at this point. Why ruin even just 5 minutes of a movie by knowing what happens in it? Regardless I'll carry on because this clip withstands knowing it  you have to see it. I hope I remember this correctly long time ago. I came in on a black and white scene of a man with bright white hair and thick rimmed square glasses. He was walking around a bright but dusty and dilapidated building. He wore a boringlooking suit  bureaucrosy personified. He appeared like an awkward type of person uncomfortable with life. But he was a funnylooking guy and strangely likeable. As he walked on a stage appeared out of the darkness. As he got closer to the stage a guy dressed like a punk came from the shadows. He looked menacingly at the Bureaucrat and reached into his black leather jacket. Suddenly he pulled out a microphone. He pointed the microphone at the Bureaucrat in a threatening way at first then offered the Bureaucrat to take it in a friendly way. The Bureaucrat declined. The punk looked angry then sad then defiant then he started to sing. The song was a mad punky riottype song a cry to the skies. The lyrics were rebellious decrying the Soviet UnionRussia for had losing its old glories and becoming weak in the eyes of the world and to itself. It was a call to violent action. The Bureaucrat moved away from the stage awkwardly as the song got more impassioned and violent. On his way he came across a group of punks lounging against a wall. They motioned him to sit with them and made room for him in the middle. He sat there awkwardly and pretendied to like the music as he tapped along and nodded his head. One pretty punk girl glared at him momentarily and then started to smile a real smile and then nod her head a bit in rhythm with the Bureaucrat's nodding. Suddenly the other punks in the group started to nod their heads. The Bureaucrat was freaked out but they were smiling happy smiles so he kept nodding and they kept nodding. Then the punks raised their arms and wiggled their torsos. They seemed to be having fun so the Bureaucrat joined in with them with the wiggling. They all wiggled up onto their feet laughing standing in a circle wiggling. Just as they started to break into a dance it seemed like the walls behind them were pulsing. But as the lights lowered those pulses became disco lights as the dance got crazier and crazier and increasingly punky with the Bureaucrat the maddest dancer of them all.The Bureaucrat flung his arms around full of joy. Unfortunately he noticed the time on his watch. Immediatey his face was flooded with utter dread. His shoulders and arms and all of his full life and joy fell from him. Panic arose and a frenzy began. He pushed his way through the punks as they pleaded with him to stay. They started to grab him. He tried to pull away as it started to get a bit freaky. By the time he got to the door the punks appeared like zombies or cannibals and it suddenly seemed like a horror movie. He tumbled out the door but came out of an underground rail station walking up some steps. He looked out onto the busy streets  back in reality. Phew! The Bureaucrat brushed the dust from his boring suit. He jumped to action when he saw a bus at a bustop. He started running and flailing after it  an adsurdly funny run. As the bus pushed on from the bustop he went totally mental screaming and shouting and whistling. Finally he raised his arm defiantly violently and willed the bus to stop. 'The movie froze here on a freeze frame of the Bureaucrat with his arm raised aggressively and a frightening look on his face. This then had an image superimposed on it. The image faded in to reveal the punk singer on the stage with the raised arm and violent fist and face  it was a perfect fit face on face. Then it cut back to the Bureaucrat. The movie started again. The Bureaucrat lowered his arm shocked by and ashamed of his own violence. He lowered his arm and watched the bus leave. dejected.Suddenly the tone of the movie changed completely from black and white to the sepia tint you get from old photographs  a pale orange brown. I can go no further  it'll give away the amazing ending. It truly is an ending of endings  the very best ending I've ever seen. The very best movie I've ever seen even though I've only seen 10 minutes of it! I can give no higher recommendation than the one I give to this movie.This movie is totally insane but also completely logical and sensible. If anyone knows where I can find this wondrous movie please let me know. Thank you.".

The Bureaucrat brushed the dust from his boring suit. He jumped to action when he saw a bus at a bustop. He started running and flailing after it  an adsurdly funny run. As the bus pushed on from the bustop he went totally mental screaming and shouting and whistling. Finally he raised his arm defiantly violently and willed the bus to stop. 'The movie froze here on a freeze frame of the Bureaucrat with his arm raised aggressively and a frightening look on his face. This then had an image superimposed on it. The image faded in to reveal the punk singer on the stage with the raised arm and violent fist and face  it was a perfect fit face on face. Then it cut back to the Bureaucrat. The movie started again. The Bureaucrat lowered his arm shocked by and ashamed of his own violence. He lowered his arm and watched the bus leave. dejected.Suddenly the tone of the movie changed completely from black and white to the sepia tint you get from old photographs  a pale orange brown. I can go no further  it'll give away the amazing ending. It truly is an ending of endings  the very best ending I've ever seen. The very best movie I've ever seen even though I've only seen 10 minutes of it! I can give no higher recommendation than the one I give to this movie.This movie is totally insane but also completely logical and sensible. If anyone knows where I can find this wondrous movie please let me know. Thank you.";

I had no idea what the film was about only that I'd heard that People walk out of Russia. This film really had you captivated for the entire journey  and you really connect with the characters within it so much so you experience their emotions with them  you laugh with them you are on the verge of tears at moments and you feel their determination. The acting was great  there were some familiar faces in the likes of Jim Sturgess 21 and Ed Harris everything else...and they do very well in their roles. Colin Farrell finds himself taking a respectable role in a respectable film  and does a very good job at it  and even manages to work a Russian accent which he pulls off  and he pulls it off well. Surprisingly well actually! Saoirse Ronan at 1516 is incredible in this. Given her youth she manages to draw in the audience with her character's history and gravitas. The other actors within this despite them being relatively unknown on the Hollywood stage join the cast well and the chemistry is there to make the journey and the true stamina of the group believable.The cinematography was immense with shots overlooking parts of Russia Mongolia Tibet and India  just helps you realise the vastness of the journey. Most of the journey is filmed looking closely at the characters but this is what is crucial to the audience enjoying the story. You can't have 2hrs and 13 mins of beautiful scenery and see the intimate struggles with each of the characters...therefore the director does well to mix the two. The audience can see just what the struggles and difficulties are...but are treated to some amazing shots of the scenery which make you realise how incredible this journey was. I even got a map out later and routed the journey they tookI should expect that this film would receive some Oscar nominations maybe for cinematography director perhaps even best picture but I would love to see Jim Sturgess having a nomination for his role.".

Whatever  it doesn't matter Peter Weir's The Way Back this movie about that book which tells the tale of gulag escapees and their harrowing journey to freedom is a welltold and inspiring tale than anything else.All of the actors are terrific in their roles  Jim Sturgess as the de facto leader of the bunch showing a more improved and mature side to his acting since 21 Ed Harris as the gruff American Smith who is hardedged and ironwilled until he eventually befriends... Saiorse Ronan as Irene the runaway girl who joins them on their quest  Ronan here shows a perfect balance of various emotions while not overdoing it like many child stars her age... she definitely is one of the best young actresses today Colin Farrell as the violent yet humorous soldier who protects the team from danger in Siberia and provides comic relief when needed  Farrell shows that he can be tough yet likable at the same time without being completely overblown and shows his versatility as an actor European actors Dragos Bucur Alexandru Potocean Sebastian Urzendowsky and Gustaf Skarsgrd round off the remaining escapees and they all acted great in their respective and differing roles. The chemistry between all of the actors at parts are great.Having said that the film's only flaw is that it sacrificed substantial characterization for realism and visual spectacles. The characters are thinly but not overly so fleshed out and the interactions between them are short before the next walking shot. But when it comes to realism and believability the film succeeds. I was surprised when I saw National Geographic was one of the coproducers of the film but I wasn't as soon as I saw how realistic the depictions of survival the characters did in the film. Men will do anything to escape to freedom and the determination and spirit to survive in a harsh and unforgiving natural world is what Weir and his script is trying to say but the walking parts are written in masterful detail that any line of dialog may ruin it so silence is sometimes golden in these parts. The screenplay also challenges the usual Hollywood clichs that usually are found in this film genre and it transforms them into better more realistic and sometimes unsettling situations.Productionwise the film is a triumph. The production design is great and makes extremely well use of real locations. The cinematography by Russell Boyd is dazzling simply marvelous it is wide sweeping and epic with lush scenery of forests deserts and the snowpeaked Himalayas exquisitely shot throughout. The wide cinematography makes the experience even more harrowing thanks to Lee Smith's fluid and crisp editing and Burkhard Dallwitz's great music score and terrific music timing  Dallwitz and Weir know when and how musicsound can be used in a scene and that sometimes silence is crucial to certain moments. Here Weir uses that silence to terrific and very intense effect and with his extremely focused direction manages to being out a very exhilarating and at the same time excruciating in a good way experience. So much so that I forgot about the controversy surrounding the true story and found myself hugely engrossed in the movie not wanting it to end.In short the film lightly suffers from lack of proper characterization but is heavy on almost everything else  acting directing cinematography production value and music. If it had proper characterization it would have been an instant classic and a contender for the Best Picture Oscar. Still as it stands The Way Back is still an epic adventure an inspiring sometimes funny and often intense and harrowing experience that also proves that Peter Weir is still an ambitious tourdeforce filmmaker.Overall rating 77100".

When Nazism was defeated in 1945 half of Europe was just beginning a sentence in Communist bondage that was to last another thirty five years. This aspect of the story is all the more effective because it is told through the eyes of a small group of people and at a personal level.

Almost all Weir's tooinfrequent movies are at least noteworthy Witness Dead Poets Society if not downright great Year of Living Dangerously The Last Wave.With The Way Back Weir may have made his greatest film ever. An epic and unrushed 2 14 hours trek from a Soviet Gulag to the green hills of India this is a beautifully filmed and superbly acted piece. Let it take its time it is thrilling and appalling but also beautiful.The story which Weir apparently has long wanted to film is based on the account of a Polish army officer who later moved to England and wrote with a ghostwriter the book The Long Walk describing the journey he took with seven others. The movie is quite true to the book right down to the American Mr. Smith Ed Harris' character. While the veracity of the story in the book has been questioned that doesn't interfere with the great filmmaking.Harris is fine as always as is Colin Farrell as a Russian thug but it is Jim Sturgess as the Polish leader of the expedition who has the most bravura performance.Bravo to the cast cinematographer and most of all Mr. Weir.".

An epic and unrushed 2 14 hours trek from a Soviet Gulag to the green hills of India this is a beautifully filmed and superbly acted piece. Let it take its time it is thrilling and appalling but also beautiful.The story which Weir apparently has long wanted to film is based on the account of a Polish army officer who later moved to England and wrote with a ghostwriter the book The Long Walk describing the journey he took with seven others. The movie is quite true to the book right down to the American Mr. Smith Ed Harris' character. While the veracity of the story in the book has been questioned that doesn't interfere with the great filmmaking.Harris is fine as always as is Colin Farrell as a Russian thug but it is Jim Sturgess as the Polish leader of the expedition who has the most bravura performance.Bravo to the cast cinematographer and most of all Mr. Weir.";

	schema:headline " Impossible Incredible Freedom";
	schema:reviewBody "Sixtime Academy Award nominated director Peter Weir Master and Commander The Far Side of the World The Truman Show directed and wrote the adaptive screenplay for The Way Back based on the book The Long Walk A True Story of a Trek to Freedom by Slawomir Rawicz a Polish POW from the Soviet Gulag where the story begins and on real life accounts of the journey. The film unluckily missed a very well deserved 2010 Oscar birth telling the tale about an unthinkable journey of kinship created between a diverse group of Soviet Gulag escapees. Their journey covers 4000 miles from Siberia to freedom in India giving meaning to the word incredible. The cinematography is used most majestically by capturing panoramas of the strikingly dangerous yet breathtakingly beautiful landscapes. The splendor of the film goes beyond the wilderness with the selection of a very accurate and diverse cast starring Jim Sturgess 21 Ed Harris The Rock Colin Farrel In Bruges Saoirse Ronan The Lovely Bones and Mark Strong Sherlock Holmes. Together they recreate the peril and wonder of the impossible journey on foot that started with the idea of a man named Khabrov Strong to break out of the Godforsaken Soviet Gulag in Siberia. A Polish man named Janusz driven by the fire to get back to his wife puts the idea into action. An older wise American known as Mr. Smith Harris joins ranks when he hears about Janusz's plans and warns him that Khabarov never had any aspiration to actually leave the place. However the idea becomes a reality attracting an indebt prisoner named Valka Farrel and four other men escaping the Gulag and meeting a young girl named Irena Ronan on the path to freedom.The story is synonymous with walking more than a marathon every day through harsh terrain uncontrollable elements and lack of food and water for an openended amount of time. The gravity of the story is unmatched by any film released this year told through the art of cinematography and the acting talents of the cast. Both Oscar worthy aspects of the film however the cinematography itself is unmatched by any 2010 film. Also a lot can be said about the allstar cast concerning Jim Sturges Ed Harris Colin Farrel Mark Strong and Saoirse Ronan and their superb character portrayals however there is one other actor that stands out. A man in the group named Zoran played by Dragos Bucar is able to break through the thin layer of dramatic tension in the film with his clever social humor. The comedy he creates does not take away from the story and instead adds to the story allowing the characters to unwind and have a good time. The outcomes to films within the jailbreak genre are inevitably easy to predict therefore causing films like The Way Back to work hard in order to be original. The Way Back does a very good job by differentiating the way it is captured on film through its beautiful cinematography however great films such as The Shawshank Redemption and The Great Escape will always be on top of the genre. The Way Back isn't far off though with its main shortcoming stemming from the ending relying on a storyline tangent not fully developed not the montage the montage is great.This is the most underrated movie of 2010 with its limited advertising exposure release and lack of award fulfillment with only one Oscar nomination for Best Make Up well deserved as the group of survivors' skin is torn apart by the elements. A 4000mile true story taking place in the World War II era with excellent cinematography and great acting seems like the ideal candidate for the Oscars. So why was this must see film left in the shadows?".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of a small group of people escaping from a Siberian Soviet prison part of the Gulag in wartime and walking 4000 miles to freedom looked a trifle grim in the trailer but Peter Weir has managed to produce a rather beautiful film out of it using Bulgaria and Morocco as locales rather than Siberia and the Gobi desert. Only Darjeeling in India plays itself. My only trouble with it is the rather uneven character development. The story lends itself to ensemble playing but we learn little about two or three of the walkers. In the case of the lead character Janusz Jim Sturgess who is the source of the story this is explicable as we are seeing the others though his eyes but it has to be said that both Mr Smith the excellent Ed Harris and the Girl Saiorse Ronan leave a lasting impression.I know there is some doubt as to the authenticity of the story taken from a 1955 book by Slavimir Rawicz a former Polish army officer and indeed what the group are supposed to have done looks impossible but that's not a problem because the relationships ring true. It is remarkable how an almost random collection of individuals including one with a very unsavoury past can driven by sheer necessity wind up functioning as a team. Partly this is due to the leader actually having some navigational knowledge and therefore inspiring confidence in the others. Mr Smith remarks early on that the Janusz has a serious weakness he is kind but when the chips are down we see that even the hardbitten Mr Smith is capable of compassion.Strangely enough after the initial scenes in the prison camp and the escape there is not a lot of drama. The group encounter very few people on their travels and those they do meet take little interest in them perhaps they had not heard about the bounty for escapees. Obtaining food and water is obviously a big issue so mind out for the messy hunting scenes. I was astounded at how well their footwear stood up to the punishment my hiking boots are not good for 400 miles let alone 4000. Actually they must have wandered around a bit  the northern end of Lake Baikal and Lhasa in Tibet are about 1800 miles apart though the prison camp was somewhere north of the lake. It's also not clear how long the walk took but at times it seemed like years. Weir's great achievement is to keep us watching a very drawn out tale. Personally I think I would have died of boredom if I had been in this particular walk if starvation hadn't got me first.".

Its one of those movies you don't want to miss out on seeing. The cast is wonderful and the cinematography is breathtaking. Exotic and grandiose shooting locations contrast nicely with the alltoo human struggle for survival of the characters. There are no specific flaws in this movie that you can point out and sayThere! Thats where they screwed up. No but the movie somehow leaves you unsatisfied in the end. Its not about what the movie did wrong but there were so many places where it missed out where it could have transcended the gap between Good and Fantastic. For one the characters seemed to mould into one another there wasn't much to tell them apart you could have easily switched the backstories of any two characters and it wouldn't have made a difference. As such there was no emotional bond you form with any of them deaths hardly matter to the audience. There have been movies where a character dying would break the heart of the viewer but here it barely registers. Also it hardly brings out the true nature of suffering. Apart from the extensive makeup and the occasional staggeringandfalling there is not much of an indication of the physical toll and mental trauma that a person would go through in such a circumstance. As such when they do finally make it to their destination the happiness that the viewer feels is shortlived and minor. A Way Back reads more like a documentary. It doesn't manage to pull off the human side of it. One movie which had so much potential I would be glad if there's a remake by a better director and cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Weir's first film in seven years is another exercise in sturdy direction with strong social themes running through it  recalling many of his previous works in style and content. It follows a group of escaped prisoners from a Siberian gulag in 1940 as they brave the treacherous wilderness of Asia for freedom from the Soviet regime. It's tough viewing for the most part but there is a surprising amount of comic relief along the way provided chiefly by Colin Farrell's salty character. The group scavenge for food even fighting off wolves for the carcass of an animal at one point  but the constant bickering and relentless doom and gloom does begin to wear. The film picks up however once Saoirse Ronan enters the picture and her youthful feminine presence brings an interesting dynamic. Emoting with a flawless Polish accent almost like a miniStreep her character is one of the more compelling and layered and gives this emerging young actress a chance to display her skills. The cinematography is serviceable but hardly spectacular  capturing a harsh arid landscape as opposed to Malicklike celebration of nature.As the film wears on the struggle to survive intensifies particular when they reach the Ghobi desert  the scenes are very well done but viewing becomes quite grueling. Harris bring a certain integrity to his role in a rather unshowy performance with not much character introspection I can see why his Oscar buzz has disappeared. In fact character development across the board is quite lacking and watching the plot unfold with the knowledge of the outcome of the story already provided in the opening titles  the narrative becomes quite arbitrary and the story doesn't always sustain interest. The final leg of the journey through the Himalayas almost seems rushed compared to the bloated second act. Still it's a very wellmade film with good acting and visuals  just don't expect to be inspired.".

	schema:headline " Solid story that looks great but is told with far too much reverence and respect  to the point of being hard to engage with emotionally";
	schema:reviewBody "A group of men break free from the security and barbed wire fence of a Siberian gulag in search of freedom however the guards are very small beer to the real prison  the ravages of nature itself and the great distance which must be crossed before they can be truly free.Given that the focus of the film appeared to be one of endurance in the face of great suffering this film is a bit of a hard sell for the casual viewer looking for something to watch of an evening certainly for me this was part of the reason it took me a minute to decide to watch it. While it was an OK film I'm not entirely sure if it was worth the two hours plus that it took to watch because it gives the viewer very little to engage with in doing so. The story is impressive in terms of the toll and also the sacrifice involved and accordingly the film wears it very seriously indeed. Hollywood excess is avoided and any crass sentimentality is absent both of which I appreciated being omitted and restrained and Weir documents the journey with a solemn air throughout. The first problem is that it feels like you're in a church  bowed with reverence witnessing things of importance but not really engaging with them because you're not really worthy. This feeling of worthiness really kept me at arms' length from the characters and the challenge they faced to the point where it felt a little indifferent towards any specific one of them  not in a cruel way but the feat appears to have been the focus rather than the people.This is still able to make an interesting film though because the feat is quite a thing and as I said the film is very careful to do it justice and not sentimentalise or trivialise it. This is my second problem with it  it probably overdoes it in this regard considering that so much of the story is questionable. I try not to let facts get in the way of enjoying a good movie because as a Brit I am used to seeing Hollywood twist history to make it more sellable to the midWest etc. Thing is though it is hard to accept that this is a good story when the film emphasises that it is true and also treats it with such reverence and respect for fear of getting it wrong. Quite how one can get it wrong when so much of it is in doubt is anyone's guess but the film takes this route and it hurts it in the process. It still makes for a very sturdy film but there without caring about the characters or really feeling in their trial it didn't do a terrible lot else for me and I was surprised by how much of it I was just able to watch with very little involvement other than my eyes and ears.One thing the film does do really well though is the delivery visually speaking of course. The locations are immense and are put on the screen by director Peter Weir and cinematographer Russell Boyd in such a way that captures not only their natural beauty but also the sheer uncompromising size of the places. It looks great throughout and I was surprised when I looked it up to find that Boyd didn't even merit an Oscar nomination for his work here although it is an award category that has yet to give one to Roger Deakins so no surprise. It perhaps contributions to the look at this epic story worthiness that the film has but in the case of the looks it is worth it.The cast also match the worthy tone and don't have a lot of time for character in between portraying hardship and perseverance. Sturgess struggles to really make an impression but he is OK in a central role. He is fortunate though to have Harris Strong and Farrell with him because they both bring presence and charisma in a way that looks easy. The rest of the group are good as well but they also struggle to make an impression in all the worthiness.The Way Back is an interesting film that looks great but it is also overly worthy and serious to a point that it is hard to really engage with it because it is hard to reach the characters on the pedestal that Weir puts them on.".

	onyx:emotionText "A group of men break free from the security and barbed wire fence of a Siberian gulag in search of freedom however the guards are very small beer to the real prison  the ravages of nature itself and the great distance which must be crossed before they can be truly free.Given that the focus of the film appeared to be one of endurance in the face of great suffering this film is a bit of a hard sell for the casual viewer looking for something to watch of an evening certainly for me this was part of the reason it took me a minute to decide to watch it. While it was an OK film I'm not entirely sure if it was worth the two hours plus that it took to watch because it gives the viewer very little to engage with in doing so. The story is impressive in terms of the toll and also the sacrifice involved and accordingly the film wears it very seriously indeed. Hollywood excess is avoided and any crass sentimentality is absent both of which I appreciated being omitted and restrained and Weir documents the journey with a solemn air throughout. The first problem is that it feels like you're in a church  bowed with reverence witnessing things of importance but not really engaging with them because you're not really worthy.

	schema:reviewBody "Now the question that is raised regarding this film is 'is it true?' There are a lot of suggestions that it is not and Weir is deliberately vague at the beginning where he says that he 'dedicates this film' to three men who reportedly appeared out of the Himalayas in 1945. He does not suggest that this film is based upon of true story though it is based upon a book by a Pole named Slawomir Rawicz who alleges that he escape from a Soviet Gulag in Siberia during a blizzard and travelled over 6000 km to freedom. However documentary evidence suggests that this did not happen but rather that he was freed and sent to Iran. Another story is that Rawicz stole the idea from another Pole who made that claim and further there is a suggestion that the British in India debriefed a trio who had claimed that they had walked from Siberia.The question is is it possible? Well my suggestion would be that it is though the journey is fraught with dangers. Not only does one have to evade the Soviet army and the locals as any escaped prisoners have a bounty on their head but they would have had to cross the Gobi desert and then the Himalayas. Of the seven that escaped from the camp only four of them survived and one departed in Tibet when he decided to return to the United States through China. However I would suggest that the most difficult and gruelling part of the journey would have been across the Gobi Desert and the film is very clear about that.I did think that this was a good film despite the authenticity of the story being doubtful. Peter Weir does make very good films and this is no exception. However it is very long though that is to be expected of such a film like this. One in a way would like to have followed their course on a map and I am suspicious that not only a directly southern route would have got them to Tibet it wouldn't have or that once they had crossed the Gobi desert they would have come to the Great Wall of China. I suspect the Great Wall or at least the section they encountered was much farther to the east than where they would have been.I could say that this movie is all about human endurance and survival and while it is it is not necessarily the case. The main character whom Weir deliberately did not name Rawicz was sentenced to the Gulags on a trumped up charges based on evidence that was tortured out of his wife. However he does not hold a grudge against his wife and he one desire is to return to her so that he may forgive her. This is what motivates him and drives him on however as we know it was going to be another fifty odd years before the wall comes down enabling him to return to his wife.".

	schema:reviewBody "Note There probably won't be any spoilers but I'm afraid to submit a review without clicking the box. I will mark any that come up.Peter Weir is one of the great directors in recent history having directed three absolute masterpieces Dead Poets Society USA 1989 The Truman Show USA 1998 and Gallipoli Australia 1981 and a decent number of good films alongside them. His greatest strengths as a director have been his incredible facility with leading actors that has often lead to excellent performances from surprising performers and his ability to create a backdrop in seemingly all scenes that is realistic enough to accept and yet so perfectly controlled that it paints the picture for his camera. Both of those skills are on display in The Way Back. The film's story while dullsounding in the abstract is an interesting metaphor for many countries' though Poland is the obvious example here long journey away from authoritarian Communism toward individual freedom. Spoilers We see how Communism tore down the old religions and yet rather than its return a new western religion is attempting to take its place. We see how the definition of freedom becomes so weak that the characters consider the ability to die outside prison walls freedom in Siberia. We see how wandering through the tightlycontrolled dangerous cold ruthless terrain of one type of authoritarianism in Russia shares similarities with the hot wild dangerous dry terrain of another in Mongolia. We see how it's a nearlyimpossible final trek through dangerous mountains of doubt asking for help repeatedly along the way that finally brings our heroes to the lush greens of freedom. Spoilers Over The acting is universally excellent highlighted by Ed Harris Jim Sturgess and Colin Farrell. Harris has the only dynamic character one who begins knowing only too well the value of hiding his emotions and slowly learns that he no longer needs his mask. His performance is nothing short of amazing. Sturgess while not playing a very dynamic part still has plenty to sink his teeth into and hits every right note. Farrell is a scenestealer as a viciousbutnotstupid true criminal who doesn't know how to operate free and knows it.Perhaps the most memorable part of the film is the score. Burkhard von Dallwitz's score in this film is one of the best I've ever heard with an impressive combination of variety and cohesiveness and absolutely pitchperfect emotionality for every moment.Weir as is his wont in later years keeps the editing and camera work minimal. We have still camera shots with relatively little cutting throughout the film which allows us to remain connected with the characters as they journey. There are notable exceptions in the beautiful flyby shots of the environs that remind us just how far these men are going and the close intense steamingbutstillfreezing loud environment of the mine that is shot with quicker cuts different colors and more closeups. His work is stunning.There are some problems with the film. The third act is rushed and drives home the metaphor so obviously that it's almost laughable. The journey through Siberia is a bit repetitive. But those are relatively minor flaws in a beautiful film. Peter Weir remains a genius.".

	schema:reviewBody "As war begins to rage in Europe and Poland is split between Germany and Russia a young Polish man finds himself in a Gulag in Siberia in squalid conditions among a motley group of men from various backgrounds. Conditions are horrific made worse by the harsh winter weather and life is made even worse if you are chosen to work in the mines. One inmate declares he knows a gap in the fence and a group of inmates decide under the cover of a winter storm to make a run for it. They manage to get away far into the surrounding forest as the blizzard rages around them. But being free of the Gulag doesn't mean total freedom not only do they have to fight the elements but there are wolves as well a bounty given to locals if they capture runaways and somehow of course they have to get out of Russia.The men make their way south with the idea of getting to China. It's a long way through the frozen lands of Siberia and along the way one of them succumbs to the elements. Further south they pick up a young woman another runaway Pole and on reaching Mongolia they discover that Communism has taken hold there meaning safety is not guaranteed leaving them the only option to cross the Gobi desert and make their way to Tibet and over to India.This film by Peter Weir is based on the 'true story'  although that's been debunked and it's an epic tale. The journey is huge yet somehow for most of the group they will endure anything to survive and get back to those they love. It should be an engrossing story but it really doesn't manage to maintain interest. For starters this mammoth trek feels like a mammoth cinema trek which goes on far too long I found myself not wanting them to reach safety for themselves but for me as I couldn't wait for the film to end. Also it's difficult to relate to these people some are criminals some are viewed as criminals by others but we rarely get to know more about these people other than a few snippets gathered conveniently by the woman. Because of this it's difficult to find an emotional connection to these people who by all accounts are going through a huge life altering journey.It's a shame as it really should be an engrossing story but it all feels very formulaic in it's presentation and while performances are okay with actors playing various nationalities and there's an abundance of accents and surprisingly all the characters speak fluent English! the film just drags towards the end and it's main redeeming feature is the glorious variety of landscapes that fill the screen.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The Way Back is a masterpiece a mustsee film for thinking people and for lovers of cinema as a serious art form. I was on the edge of my seat through the entire film and was stifling tears. I could not resist applauding at the end. I couldn't wait to discuss it with friends. Several hours after I left the theater I kept seeing everything  a meaty sandwich clean water flowing from the tap  through the prism of The Way Back. I'm a longtime fan of director Peter Weir who gave us classics like Picnic at Hanging Rock Witness and The Year of Living Dangerously. Weir has outdone himself.The Way Back depicts a long walk that Gulag escapees took from Siberia to India. I've been lucky enough under luckier circumstances to travel some of the world the film references from Poland to the Himalaya. The film's authenticity in language costume even hairstyles swept me up into its world.Both Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia attacked Poland in September 1939 thus beginning World War Two. At first the Communists killed and deported more people even than the genocidal Nazis. Over a million Poles were deported in cattle cars. Many died many never returned. No one knows exact numbers. Many struggled to return home traveling on foot through Eurasia making shorter treks comparable to that depicted in The Way Back I've met such people.Janusz Jim Sturgess is a young Pole falsely accused by Soviets. His wife is tortured to force a confession. Without ceremony he is shipped to hellish Siberian concentration camps and mines. Janusz determines to escape with a ragtag multilingual crew of followers.Janusz is not particularly handsome or muscular or super intelligent. He doesn't have a commanding voice or swagger. His potentially fatal flaw in this environment is kindness. Jim Sturgess' Janusz is one of the best aspects of the film. In real life true leaders usually are not like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Janusz grew up in the woods and knows how to jerryrig a compass to point his group south and a mask to survive blizzards. In the world of Gulag escapees that's enough to make him the big man. Indeed Valka Colin Farrell a very tough gangster declares or diagnoses that Janusz is the leader the man whom the other escapees must obey both for their own individual benefit and the benefit of group survival.Prison escapees traveling thousands of miles of the Eurasian landmass with minimal gear face multiple dangers from malnutritioncaused blindness to mosquitoes to snakes to dehydration. Some succumb and die en route. You can't help but bet the same horrible game of chance that Valka proposes who will die next? And will his meat be tender  that is will we resort to cannibalism? A crew member falls. Surviving companions in stunning testimony to their own humanity take the time burn the calories devote the effort to fashioning makeshift graves and funerals. And then they march on.What looks very beautiful on a calendar  an unspoiled mountain forest of snowdusted evergreens  is actually all but an execution chamber for a hungry fugitive with no tools and only rags for shoes. The last thing a good man sees after making the simple mistake of walking too far with a limited light source will not be a breathtaking natural vista but a comforting wrenching hallucination of home.Weir's best choice as a filmmaker here was simply to get out of the story's way. The Way Back does not want to be your best friend. Weir makes no attempt to cozy up to the viewer to sweeten the story with phony warmth or touching crescendos. Weir makes no attempt to juice the action with cinematic steroids. For much of the film the viewer is watching one grueling step after another.Guess what? This is what it's like to suffer for a goal this is what it's like to be crushed this is what it's like purely by chance  not because you are a better person or because God likes you more  to survive. You go on hour after hour after seemingly pointless hour toward your questionable impossible objective. This film is an endurance test. It will separate the men from the boys. Folks who think a movie about fantasy sexy ballerinas is great filmmaking and who think that temporarily losing their cell phone service is a human rights violation will probably walk right out of The Way Back. Characterizations come slowly and are not forced. We discover in a ruined monastery that one character had been a priest. We discover that a girl can get taciturn men to talk. Characters speak of food as hungry people do. Add more salt! to a fantasy meal one begs. Valka makes a decision that caused this viewer to cry. I never thought the film could make me care about this murderous thug but it did. There is inevitable and surprising laughter also not forced but integral to the circumstances.There are moments of high drama. The men must fight wolves. Weir could have lavished lengthy closeups on those sharp teeth snarling snouts and prickly pelts. He doesn't. The wolves are on screen only long enough to establish what they are and what they are up to. And then the next deadly and impossible challenge rolls down the shoot at the viewer just as it did for those who took this long walk and the millions of other humans like them who have survived life and death challenges under impossible conditions. The Way Back is like those poignant gravemarkers the marchers make en route testimony to those who have lived anonymous and agonizing lives in this pitiless world. If you don't think about the big questions while watching this film and if you're not grateful to the film for that you don't deserve it.".

The film is very well acted on all parts and most impressively in my opinion the best actor nod would go to Colin Farrell! The film is a power house of emotion about a journey to freedom and the trails and tribulations these brave men struggle through. The film is very well paced and the cinematography is simply break taking. I was also taken back by the fact that this film was inspired by a true story and believe you me when the end credits role you will understand why they had to make this story into a movie.I love it when a film surprises me on all fronts and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent way to spend 2 hours in the cinema this weekend. All in all I would rate this movie 9.5 out of 10 and look forward to seeing it again on blue ray".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this with only a basic understanding of what the background was to the story. Also  I did not know previously that it was Peter Weir's first film for 7 years. He should have stayed where he was.The premise of the story is an extraordinary one  a group of prisoners escape from a Siberian Gulag during the second world war and manage to walk all the way to India. Amazing stuff  especially as it is supposed to be true. However the articulation of this story left me disappointed.The opening credits tell you the entire story from start to finish through the use of a couple of sentences. Because of this  the whole dynamic of 'what will happen next?' is taken from the viewer as we already know the end. Anyway  that disappointment aside  the story starts off well enough and a strong early performance from Mark Strong augers well. Then what? The escape happens  off screen  and no more Strong. Things then seem to take the repetitive undramatic route as we embark on our looooooong journey. Essentially the weak story goes like this  escape Gulag  start walking through Siberia  encounter hardships  somebody dies  start walking through Mongolia  encounter hardships  somebody dies  start walking through China Tibet....etc etc. you get the picture until we end up in India. And that's it !!! I ask myself  So what?The characters are one dimensional at best. I got to the stage where I couldn't tell one from the other. And as for the Polish  Russian accents. They may be authentic  I don't know  but the fact that I see two Irish actors Farrell and Ronan with strange accents didn't help matters.Acting Farrell is good here to be honest. He carries that menace and unpredictability around with him with great aplomb. His accent though sullies it for me. Harris and Ronan are okay too. However Burgess didn't do it for me. His presence or lack of it let the film down I fear. But he is new enough to this game so it might get better for him  if he gets another chance.Photography As you would expect  the landscape dominates the story and is captured beautifully.Overall  watching the film was just as much of an endurance test as the walk itself. And the rushed ending twee to the extreme.Poor  510.".

White Chicks pulled out all the stops and remains one of my favorite movies to watch till this day.There was just so much hilarious material that was quite different from some of the other comedies I had recently seen. Yes the main plot is really unbelievable but it pays off. All the cast knew what kind of film they were working with and slap it up whenever they can. One of my favorite scenes is in the dressing room and another is at a restaurant. I will leave it at that for those who have not seen it. This film left me smiling long after it was over because it started off strong and carried out the whole way through. That's all it really needed to do. I must say that there was nothing wrong with this film at all and that it was totally funny. It was kind of obvious how when the brothers in the film dressed up to be the sisters they looked nothing like them but I still thought it was a great underrated comedy!".

Frankie Faison was alright playing the chief and delivered a few clever scenes. Terry Crews was excellent as Latrell Spencer and was a good touch to the movie. Of course the stand outs were the Wayan brothers which any one could tell even just from the trailer of the movie. This performance almost stood up to their roles in Scary Movie 1 and 2 which is really really saying something. Lets hope they keep writing movies with Keenan Ivory Wayans who deserves as much credit if not more for the writing and starring in them as well because God knows they can act and act brilliantly.

I totally understand why many love this movie but some really think it's a crap. If you want to see a serious comedy you won't like this one because it's very absurd. I mean how can two black guys transform into two white chicks and nobody sees the difference.

It's actually quite funny and has some laughoutloud moments. Keenan Ivory Wayans finally offers a film that's actually funny without heading too much towards the direction of horrendous stupidity. Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans are supported by a competent cast that includes Lochlyn Munro Jaime King John Heard Anne Dudek Busy Philipps and Frankie Faison. I find Marlon Wayans unbearably annoying in his other films but here he is quite likable and his character is more mature than the crap he played in other films. Shawn Wayans did show signs of a good actor in 'Requiem For A Dream' and here he does a decent job. Both actors are excellent as the white chicks. However 'White Chicks' isn't without its share of flaws. The opening sequence makes you want to walk away from the movie. Some of the comedy just falls flat and some of the toiler humour is overdone. Yet in spite of that the movie works as a brilliant comedy. I love the scenes where Marlon's character returns home after partying and he dozes off while his wife is whining Latrell's lust for 'Brittany' 'Brittany' and 'Tiffany' wanting to listen to hiphop in the car but their friends prefer something else... there are quite a few such moments that got me laughing out loud.".

Shawn and Marlon Wayans play FBI agents assigned to investigate the kidnapping of rich debutantes in the Hamptons. In order to fit into this foreign territory they go undercover as young white coeds getting involved with a group of high society debutantes that may be able to help them solve the crimes. The premise has to be one of the dumbest ideas ever but the movie doesn't take itself seriously and you can just sit back and enjoy. First problem is that after the transformation they look nothing like The Wilson sisters but we have to accept that they do since everyone else does. There are some really funny moments in the film but also just as many groans from the audience. Of course not all of it is funny some is way to racist to be funny and some is toilet humor which is the worst attempt at trying to get laughs. The cast is familiar with comedy and the leads Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans do their best and they are funny most of the time. Marlon Wayans is also the worst actor in the movie especially during the serious scenes. Jessica Calffiel is hilarious as Tori and I hope she finds work in Hollywood since she's really talented and pretty. The rest of the cast is mostly unknowns and may spark a laugh here or there but they aren't worth mentioning .Keenen Ivory Wayans wrote and directed White Chicks however Scary Movie 1 and 2 are a lot better. A lot of people complain that this movie is too racist but you shouldn't take everything serious especially a dumb comedy. Rating 610 funny movie yet it goes overboard with its 110 running time. This film is worth watching if you liked Scary Movie and other films of that caliber.".

The comedy  or the horror  arises out of these black New Yorkers' attempts to mimic spoiled white girls.They fool everyone even the girls' intimate friends.

My guess is there were some gags involving plastic surgery that got cut from the movie when someone realized that the mother still looks better than the Wayans brothers.Now I can suspend my disbelief for anything  even the idea that tall black men in zombie makeup look like cute white chicks. But the movie doesn't seem to want to help me. The Wayans' characters  and thus the Wayans themselves  seem very uncomfortable committing to their parts. When they first don their getups these blithering idiots are mystified and furious when guys hit on them. Kevin or is it Marcus? drops his drawers and nearly moons them before he realizes he's disguised as a woman.

Marcus has an insanely jealous wife who complains of waiting up for him all night even though it's only 802 and he's two minutes late. I laughed but writerdirector Keenan Ivory Wayans must have included this joke by accident. He's more interested in flatulence dildos and homosexual panic. Meanwhile the people and types skewered in this movie come off like parodies of cartoons of parodies  seven degrees separated from any actual people.I just noticed that I wrote two years instead of two hours. I swear to you that's a real typo. When I tell you I hate this comedy I mean it.".

However what do you get when a Spanish directorwriter use British actors to depict a portrayal of violence and the media in the United States? A lot of confusion.This movie is well shot conveys a message and has several actors who for better or worse evoke an emotional response from the viewer. Sadly the message conveyed is largely inaccurate everything from the impact media has on children to the notion of the permanence of death  which develops well before the age of 10 mind you is one sided or flat out wrong and aside from being a character piece for a few of the actors to showcase their talent the film provides little novelty to the 'good child gone bad' genre as a whole. Although several of the characters come to life they are poorly written and at times flat. As the movie progresses it is almost as if the writer  director wrap up every stereotype about how the media is a terrible influence on children and serve it to the viewer on an oversized platter.Due to the message conveyed repeatedly in this film it comes off as preachy which makes it hard to enjoy the movie let alone be surprised by the manner in which the plot unfolds. Had the writer  director approached the issue with more tact knowledge and attempted to make the rise of Alex's behavioral issues more ambiguous I think they would have had an independent gem. While the film brings up interesting questions about the beliefs parents have about their children and showcases how many problems children face may be averted if parents would simply pay more attention to their child the total transparency of the film overshadows these questions preventing the viewer from making up their own mind let alone think about how these issues arise in society in any meaningful way. Basically the expectancy mark this film set for itself was not reached.Overall this film is likely worth a rent and may provide an interesting insight into the view foreign countries hold about the violent media in the United States. Although I am unsure if the directorwriters of this film honestly believe the message about the evilness of the media or if they were just too lazy to accurately highlight a possible social problem. Regardless just approach this film with an open mind and do not expect anything new sharp or thought provoking.".

The general plot follows the vicissitudes of Alex he is a child who wanted to be an astronaut and had an astronaut imaginary friend up until his parents bought him his own TV. Since the TV shows lots of violent acts like shootings murders and war movies Alex is now a violent 10yearold who wants to be a soldier and has a US officer as his new imaginary friend.The direction is quite poor in and of itself. A good portion of the movie consists of the main character monologuing about being a soldier so he can kill people torture prisoners make Nazilike experiments on his victims become a dictator and so on while a collage of violent stock footage runs on the screen. This happens quite often too and I think makes at least 2530 of the whole movie.The characters are about as stereotyped as possible what with Alex hanging around with the geeky kid when he's good and then with some bullies who smoke and have knifes after he switches over to the bad side. Alex's family is about as clich as possible with the mother being obsessed with the newborn twins the father having an affair and both dismissing their kid's behavior as a phase.The imaginary friend concept is sort of nice and adds an interesting layer to the movie as both friends astronaut and officer are played by the same actor and they switch roles depending on the phase Alex is currently in. It's not enough to save the movie from its silliness though.I want to be a soldier is quite enjoyable to watch for its so bad it's good wackiness and its unending stream of dumb plot devices that ultimately end up in Danny Glover stating how TV is evil. However it's far from a good movie if taken seriously. I can only suggest you rent this film if you're smashed andor in for a laugh with some friends.".

There is a message in the movie..and to be quite honest its a very poignant message... watch it.. you'll like it but it has that thing Schindler's List has... where its a good film but it feels wrong saying its good..if you know what i mean. Very worth the watch...ignore the over critical analytical yuppie reviews... its a film... a good film.";

	schema:headline " A bunch of hypocrites made this film.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's kind of funny that Cannigo Films Cuca Canals and Christian Molina made a movie bashing and preaching against television violence when its movie is just as violence. Hypocrites. Christian Molina is not a role model at all with his work in erotic thrillers. A series of movies that sex and violence! So he has no right to preach against television violence. I think personally he made this movie only because he sees television as a threat to cinema filmmakers. The movie is produce by a Spanish director but it's doesn't feel like a Spanish film. It doesn't even feel like an America film or British. I have no clue where this movie is supposed to be place at. I want to be a Soldier is a movie about Alex an average ten year old kid who has a great imagination. While the film wants you to think of this as unhealthy obsession that marks him asocial to the point that children like him are unable to befriend his peers. The reasons because he has imaginary friends that indicate an emotional void that been missing. Big names in child development had long maintained that kids must invent their friends for dark reasons. Clearly it's not like that at all as Alex has a good relationship with his parents. In reality many people have imagination friends and it's pretty healthy. Alex seems like a normal boy who creates one just for fun. A role model name Astronaut Captain Harry based on his interests in space travel is not troublesome. It wasn't until the birth of his twin baby brothers Alex feels more neglected than usual. With his parents spending more time with his brothers he seeks somebody to spent time with him. He sees it in everybody's favorite babysitter television. He ask his father into buying him a TV for his room and starts spending hours watching violent programming. As his antisocial behavior deepens he also takes on a new imaginary friend Sergeant John Cluster who will teach him how to realize his new dream of being a great soldier. It was here that he became more and more morbid fascination for images portraying violence. He begins to develop a problems with his parents and school when he start to act out the violence he sees. The producers got the idea for the film due to reading a newspaper headline that stated By the time a child turns 18 if parents don't prevent it their child will have seen more than 40.000 murders and 200.000 acts of violence on Internet TV newspapers etc. Canonigo collaborates with a group of teachers to help get this movie be made so to prevent that. I think the movie just makes it worse by over blowing that all television is bad. Television isn't all bad for children. Media is about 50 bad and 50 good. Nothing is intrinsically evil. TV like all technology is a double edged sword. It can distract you from other more productive things but also help you be aware of the world you live in. There are some programming that is very beneficial for children that teaches people to do or finish a task. If a child is watching smart quality programming that child will be more like welloff than those that didn't. Just because a child is watching a violence movie doesn't mean he will turn out evil. Violence in societies such as ours is declining as media violence increases. In the US the rate of violent crime has been in sustained decline for 10 years. It's because most media that shows violence shows the consequences of such actions which is death prison or personal pain. Most children are smart enough to know that and willing to follow those rules in place so they don't end there. Plus most television have rating system in place as well as rules of what they can show and can't show. Watching violence in television is the same as seeing it in art paintings books and other media sources. If there is a source that needs to be look at it's the internet. The internet has more freedom than television on what they can show. Like I said before it's depends on what you view. Alex sees his parents are constantly fighting due to the twins which is causing the boy to hate them as he blames them for the downfall of his family life. There is a really good speech toward the end about that. The movie does bring up some good points but still the film basically one side says that if you are a soldier or want to be a soldier you are a psychopath who likes killing and torturing anything you can like a Nazi. It has nothing to do with patriotism protecting yourself and your family or helping others. The military has other roles then killing people especially today. Soldiers can send to areas to help the people affect by natural disasters drug abuse or crime. If your sole purpose in joining is to kill you won't pass the screening process. The kid needs real discipline not No TV. That should be the primary point made in the film. The movie suffers from that. The fact that Danny Glover Robert Englund and anybody involve in the film that continues to film horror and action violent movies after this is prove that they have no clue what they are talking about. They shouldn't be taken seriously.".

It starts at the beginning of the film with 10yearold Alex as happy as any child can be while also expecting two younger twin siblings. The moment the twins are brought into the home kind of presents a problem for young Alex as he finds that he can no longer do what he did before having them there thus emitting a burst of rage from him when he can not watch T.V. I thought it was quite humorous when he dropped hints to his dad that he wanted to have his own T.V. in which the dad relented talked to his mother about it and ultimately buys him one.It takes a twist when he switches on the television to be greeted with scenes of war death and pure sadness. He then sees the army who are handing out cases of water and other provisions. That is where the Army Captain imaginary friend is born and the Astronaut Harry pretty much dead. He gains an allout fascination with the violence of war cuts his hair like an army recruit and wears his dad's army uniform.In general I think that this film's message is pretty much this When you bring in two new babies and show them more attention than what you showed the one before them and the father is having an affair with the mother it's going to end pretty nasty for any child. The child begins to lose touch with everyone around him primarily focusing everything within happiness anger sadness frustration. All this pent up emotion tends to erupt and who did it erupt with? Poor little Max whose brother a teenage boy older than either of the kids in the film gets upset beats the crap out of Alex who whips out a knife and is ultimately stabbed by the teenager and left to die on the street....I know pretty brutal right?

	schema:reviewBody "Wilderness is an effective and brutal thrillerhorror movie. The premise is straight forward a group of juvenile offenders and their keeper out on a camping trip are picked off one by one by a mysterious and ruthless killer with a crossbow a pack of attack dogs and a skill for booby traps. It is brutal violent fast moving and visceral. It is quite well made the tension and pace never drops which is essential for this kind of movie and there is a gritty unremitting feel to the movie which works in its favour. The deaths are unpleasant and violent and the characters aren't likable keeping it somewhat unpredictable as to what is going to happen who is going to die and so on. Wilderness doesn't hold back in terms of the violence and nastiness but still keeps for the most part a gritty realistic vibe and it works.The movie shows you don't necessarily need likable characters but only believable ones to make a movie work. The more likable characters are only more likable by comparison i.e. they are only cowardly or selfish as opposed to being sadistic and cruel. The one character that seems like they may actually be competent and a decent human being is out of the picture comparatively early on. This comes across as lot more credible than those movies which contain groups of supposedly hardened criminals or delinquents who prove to be suitably heroic and noble and band together when it comes to the crunch. The characters here aren't over the top nasty either they are full of petty meanness and posturing selfishness and banality without being irredeemably evil as you would probably expect such kids to be in real life. The acting mostly by fairly unknown young British actors is pretty good and low key the Brits are generally better at this sort of thing. This gives the film its grittier edge and helps make it a little bit less predictable than it could be. Okay the designated hero is obvious from the getgo and it isn't too unexpected when most of the unsavoury cast is wiped out but it isn't cloyingly obvious all the way through that things will happened the way you would predict in accordance with movie conventions.The movie is not without flaws. The plot isn't always particularly believable or fresh. It seems strange that there is on one prison guard with this group of about ten juvenile offenders out on a supposedly deserted island and the killer seems almost too effective is dispatching his prey although to be fair it works for the movie in terms of the scariness of the villain and some explanation is provided for his skill in this regard. Toward the end when the hunter and his motivation is revealed he is far less effective a bad guy his motivation and presence slightly contrived Though still plausible and he suddenly seems to become a lot less competent in order for him to be defeated. It might have been better if the makers had left the killer a mysterious motiveless figure. There are a few times when the movie does seem to go a bit too far with its nastiness the flip side of the movie slack of restraint. The way in which some of the gorier death scenes such as the first dog killing are lingered on is a bit too much and toward the end some of the character's abhorrent behaviour comes across as a bit much also Okay we already knew these guys were scum can we get on with it.On the whole a slick well made and exciting movie which is both helped and hampered but mostly helped by it's willingness to be mean spirited and harsh.".

	schema:headline " Welcome to the Wildnerness we got fun  games!";
	schema:reviewBody "Call us uncivilized savages if you must but who honestly doesn't enjoy raw and barbaric adventuremovies in which the blood and violence literally bursts from the screen? In case you were thrilled by movies like Battle Royale Blood Camp Thatcher or even the more classic milestone The Most Dangerous Game you simply have to see Wilderness a brand new British survivalhorror effort directed by Michael Deathwatch Basset. After the suicide of a fellow inmate a troop of juvenile delinquents  for whom all hope for rehabilitation was given up long time ago  are sent to a prison island for a severe lesson in elementary lifevalues. On the island however a madraving psychopath lies in wait for them and even the innocent guards and some random girls become defenseless targets. Trained and equipped like an experienced hunter the killer annihilates nearly the whole gang by using deadly boobytraps and ravenous dogs. As you can derive from this brief plot description originality isn't Wilderness biggest trump and the script doesn't even bother to keep the killer's identity secret for a long time. But seriously who cares about aspects like these when a film is so adrenalin rushing and bloodsoaked? The hunting humanspremise is mixed with the textbook 80's slasher plot of a revengeseeking killer but you aren't given a chance to grumble about the banality as there is gore and excitement everywhere! The island itself is a captivating location resulting in masterfully choreographed sequences and some utterly imaginative boobytraps. Unlike in his previous film Deathwatch Michael J. Basset definitely doesn't cut back on the blood  gore here and we're gladdened with closeup shotgun action amputated body parts chopped of heads and loads of aggressive dogaction! The character drawings are very well processed and Basset fully uses the nihilistic and totally lackadaisical nature of youthful criminals. These young social outcasts don't care about anyone but themselves and pretty soon there are sub plots involving betrayal jealousy and cowardly behavior. The sound  visual effects are terrific and Peter Robertson clearly has a talented eye for versatile camerawork. Following films like Dog Soldiers 28 Days Later and The Descent this Wilderness is yet another piece of evidence that the British horror industry is working on a remarkable revival nowadays. Highly recommended!".

	onyx:emotionText "Call us uncivilized savages if you must but who honestly doesn't enjoy raw and barbaric adventuremovies in which the blood and violence literally bursts from the screen? In case you were thrilled by movies like Battle Royale Blood Camp Thatcher or even the more classic milestone The Most Dangerous Game you simply have to see Wilderness a brand new British survivalhorror effort directed by Michael Deathwatch Basset. After the suicide of a fellow inmate a troop of juvenile delinquents  for whom all hope for rehabilitation was given up long time ago  are sent to a prison island for a severe lesson in elementary lifevalues. On the island however a madraving psychopath lies in wait for them and even the innocent guards and some random girls become defenseless targets. Trained and equipped like an experienced hunter the killer annihilates nearly the whole gang by using deadly boobytraps and ravenous dogs. As you can derive from this brief plot description originality isn't Wilderness biggest trump and the script doesn't even bother to keep the killer's identity secret for a long time. But seriously who cares about aspects like these when a film is so adrenalin rushing and bloodsoaked? The hunting humanspremise is mixed with the textbook 80's slasher plot of a revengeseeking killer but you aren't given a chance to grumble about the banality as there is gore and excitement everywhere! The island itself is a captivating location resulting in masterfully choreographed sequences and some utterly imaginative boobytraps. Unlike in his previous film Deathwatch Michael J. Basset definitely doesn't cut back on the blood  gore here and we're gladdened with closeup shotgun action amputated body parts chopped of heads and loads of aggressive dogaction! The character drawings are very well processed and Basset fully uses the nihilistic and totally lackadaisical nature of youthful criminals.

	schema:headline " A horror movie where most of the characters are villains";
	schema:reviewBody "I had a bad feeling about this movie during the first minutes even though I had read the plot before. It seemed like a gloomy drama about the life of a bunch of young prisoners that would end up having almost no room for horror whatsoever. I feared that Wilderness would turn out to be one of those films that frantically try to give a lesson about life or something like that. Appealing as that may sound it didn't look much like a horror movie to me at first and I was very close to leave it unfinished during the first minutes. Fortunately I was patient enough to realize that I had a pleasant surprise ahead of me when all of a sudden the locations changed and the circumstances became far more dangerous than they are inside a prison. So for those of you who think this is probably a movie with a profound message and a big amount of drama sorry to disappoint you but this is more than anything a flick meant to be enjoyed by gore lovers.In Wilderness a bunch of violent prisoners are sent to an isolated island after one of the interns commit suicide. It appears that the young cellmate whose name was David felt forced to take his own life due to the constant aggressive harassment that he used to suffer from his fellow inmates. The idea for the educational little trip is to build some selfrespect and learn a few things about the values of life with the object of achieving a better relationship with the others. However these nasty young rascals won't hesitate to show their true colors as soon as they disembark and they even have the pleasure of coming across a bunch of pretty female convicts from a different group. The whole point of the trip gets quickly forgotten but a new lesson regarding survival is what the inmates are forced to learn when the figure of a mysterious hunter appears out of nowhere and starts to chase them for no evident reason.Essentially Wilderness is a movie that is probably not meant to be taken very seriously. It is on the whole an entertaining gore fest with some of the most enjoyable and brutal scenes that can be compared to Battle Royale Wrong Turn Friday the 13th and Il Camping del Terrore by Ruggero Deodato although many people would probably disagree with that. Nevertheless in the end it manages to achieve its own dazzling and yet simple denouement where the mysterious surroundings is revealed in a very simplistic and crude way. The filming location is pretty much one of the highest points of the film. The idea of a killer running wild in an isolated island full of enormous trees and bushes pretty much creates this unsettling atmosphere of being actually locked up and the characters somehow appear in real danger for the first time. This is rather ironic considering that the film takes place in jail during the first minutes. With nothing else to add I highly recommend this film to anyone who is in the mood for amputation narrows beartraps fire and wild dogs on the loose.".

	schema:headline " Despite uneven plot and characters this Wilderness is still worth getting lost in";
	schema:reviewBody "Well I can honestly say that the UK horror film Wilderness directed with some feverish intensity by Michael J. Bassett follows on the heels of another great Britishmade horror film Neil Marshall's acclaimed The Descent 2005. Wilderness has the same intensity attention to story and characters and propensity for gruesome special effects and gore that leave little to the viewer's imagination.I actually have no doubt in my mind that Bassett was in some way influenced by The Descent  my personal favorite horror movie so far this millennium  especially with its outdoors setting and a mindless killer chasing after tough nonstereotypical young people. But what gets Wilderness points here is that it's while it's billed as a horror film it's actually more along the lines of a gruesome adventurethriller with some slasher movie elements thrown into the story for good measure  think the classic short story The Most Dangerous Game by Richard Connell combined with Deliverance 1972 Predator 1987 the Japanese Manga series Battle Royale and any slasher movie about a revengeseeking serial killer you could think of and you get Wilderness.Where Wilderness differs from The Descent aside from setting and characters is that the film's protagonists aren't really protagonists. The film's main characters are a motley group of six juvenile delinquents many of them violent offenders. How violent you say? Well one Steve Stephen Wright is a violent manipulative neoNazi skinhead sociopath and his pal Lewis Luke Neal also a neoNazi skinhead follows his every command. Another Blue Adam Deacon is a rapist. Of course there's also a weakling in the group a sexual deviant named Lindsay Ben McKay who also gets bullied a lot by Steve and Lewis. Jethro Richie Campbell is the only black member of the group. And the newest member of this wholesome crew of violent youths is Callum Toby Kebbell a young man prone to uncontrolled bursts of anger and violence who is there because he committed a brutal murder.So after one of them commits suicide in his bunk the whole group is shipped off to a nearby island where their supervisor Jed Sean Pertwee of Marshall's Dog Soldiers will hopefully teach these boys some dignity and respect through a little bit of hard labor in the forests of the UK. It turns out that they're not alone on this island since Louise Alex Reid of Marshall's The Descent also a juvenile corrections officer has the same idea and is camped out there with her two young female charges Mandy Lenora Crichlow and Jo Karly Greene. Soon enough however both groups come to realize that they are not alone on this island either and that someone or something is hunting them down one at a time and that maybe one of them is not who heshe appears to be either and it soon becomes clear that the only thing that matters is survival and getting off the island alive and in one piece or die trying...Let me just say that Wilderness is most definitely not a movie for children. The fact that every time I've seen it on television late at night is proof of that. True to most horror films of late Wilderness is extremely and ferociously and sadistically violent. But the gore is contrasted against a rather thrilling backdrop cool story and intriguing characters who don't deserve our sympathy but somehow we hope that some  some is italicized  make it out alive and in one piece. Eventually however what the story boils down to is a case where the hunter becomes the hunted and the characters are able to turn the tables on their hunters if you've read Richard Connell's original short story or you've seen Predator for the hundredth time like I have then you know what I mean.This turning of the tables on the antagonist can be a little bit hard to swallow considering how it comes about and who it is that actually does the tableturning. This sudden changeofcharacter for one of the main characters is unexpected because none of them are really that welldeveloped to begin with so the change seems a little bit forced and tends to cheapen what up until then has been a rather shocking gripping and steadygoing thriller. There's also some cheeky teen romancetype stuff going on in here too which also seems a little bit forced and a little cheesy considering the film's atmosphere and elaborate setup.Lastly there's also some ill feelings geared toward the film's ending which is rather ambiguously optimistic. Strange I know but just see it to understand what I mean and make up your mind about whether or not it ruins your latenight fun.Wilderness is a great movie with an interesting premise that stayed my interest a little bit by forcing us to root for underdeveloped characters and believe some rather stupid actions on their part. But the setup chaseaction scenes and gruesome special effects make this a particularly uneasy and gripping adventurehorrorthriller.710".

	schema:headline " Suspenseful modern horror";
	schema:reviewBody "Wilderness isn't a great modern horror film but it does a good job of taking old ideas and rehashing them into a fresh and exciting plot line. The influences to the film are clear with the muchcopied classic 'The Most Dangerous Game' being fused with more modern films such as 'Battle Royale'. The basic plot line isn't too far removed from your common slasher film but director Michael J. Bassett gives him film an extra edge by putting the focus on the struggle as the protagonists battle with the wilderness naturally the main threat and even each other. The plot focuses on a group of juvenile delinquents who are sent to an uninhabited island when a young lad staying in their home is found to have committed suicide. However the island doesn't turn out to be uninhabited at all as aside from a local hermit there's also a group of girls there with the same idea  and some mad psycho with a crossbow and a group of bloodthirsty German Shepherds who is seemingly hell bent on not letting any of them off the island alive! The director seems more bothered about atmosphere and tension than characters as while some of the people inhabiting the film are well defined their actions are often questionable and none of them are particularly interesting. But even so this isn't a problem as the film is constantly suspenseful and the fact that there is an unseen psycho in the woods bodes well with the atmosphere on display. Michael J. Bassett seems keen to go against the clichs of the horror genre as there is no mystery to the killer's identity after the first half of the film and the crossbow weapon works well. There's a fair amount of gore on display although the film never matches the initial death sequence in the wilderness in terms of gore. The acting isn't terrible but the 'thick' British accents sound really phoney to an actual Brit like me. Sean Pertwee is the only recognised name on the cast list but the rest of the cast which is made up of mostly British television stars provide adequate performances. Overall Wilderness is certainly a good horror film and comes recommended.".

Its an amped up highly charged popcorn movie with a damn great young cast. If Lions Gate or someone does not pick this up they are bloody insane!!

I totally bought into this film. Its chock full of jumps great kills and really awesome amounts of gore. This is a total horror and genre geek must see! Its an amped up highly charged popcorn movie with a damn great young cast. If Lions Gate or someone does not pick this up they are bloody insane!! This is film gets me really charged up for the next Michael J. Bassett offering.";

	schema:reviewBody "Wilderness shows us that just because you're making a film about a bunch of teenagers in the woods getting killedit doesn't have to suck. There's nothing particularly fancy about this movie but it's reasonably smart sufficiently gory thankfully unpretentious and refreshingly unselfaware .The story concerns a group of boys in a juvenile detention facility in Great Britain. When one of their bunkmates is bullied into committing suicide the head guard is assigned to take the teen convicts to a remote island for a character building exercise. While on the island they make two discoveries. One is that a female head guard and two girl convicts are on the island for the same reason as the boys. The second is that someone is out to murder them all. It really is that nakedly formulaic but these filmmakers take the time and effort to execute the formula as well as they can. The result is a fairly entertaining teen slasher flick. Well it's really more of a teen skewering flick but if that's what you enjoy you'll like Wilderness.Now there's not any more depth to this film than your average kidsgettingkilled movie and it's not making any wry observations about the genre or trying to be ironic or anything like that. It just wants to be a nice little horror flick. There's plenty of running and screaming and a few legitimately shocking scenes. There's even some furtive sex but without any nudity. That's probably the only teen slasher clich that isn't featured and professionally pulled off.The acid tests for this kind of script isHow stupid do the characters have to be in order to get killed? and How overthetop ridiculous is the murderer's ability to kill them? When people who should be running away in fear always stop and look in that dark room or always fall and sprain their ankle fleeing from the killer or when the killer can punch through a wall with his bare hand or get stabbed and shot but just shake it off those are the signs of a bad script. Wilderness avoids almost all of those flaws except for an ending where the previously very smart skilled and tough murderer suddenly become a stupid wuss. Oh well. Nobody's perfect.Actingwise everyone in the cast gives fine performances. Granted the roles are all broadly and obviously drawn but Stephen Wright and Luke Neal create a believable codependent relationship as two bullies and Karly Greene as the girl who comes between them gets to show her character is just as cruel and selfish as the two boys. Sean Pertwee and Alex Reid as the male and female guards also engage in a cute who's got bigger balls stare down.If there's any problem with this film it's that the only characters who even remotely resemble good guys are disposed of early on and the ones that are left are either ciphers you have no reason to care about or bad people who to some extent deserve what they're getting. It's also a little odd that the ones who survive are probably the least interesting characters in the story.If you don't like teen slasher films there's nothing special here to bother with. If you do enjoy that genre and would like to be reminded what good one looks and feels like go rent Wilderness.".

We had our own home grown business with such films as The Wickerman various Hammer House of horror films and movies such as Straw Dogs shot in the UK. Then things went very quiet and it seemed as if the British had given up making damn good horror.Wilderness has come out of the UK film industry's attempts to go back to the good old days of believable horror pictures. Firstly you had 28 days later Dog Soldiers The Last Great Wilderness and most recently The Descent. All are incredibly interesting movies showing a rare inventiveness in horror film direction usually despite a tiny budget. The British have shown that horror does not need a rack of special effects to make it creepy it just needs a simple plot line and a villain you don't see until the last few frames.In Wilderness you don't get much simpler than that. Take a group of male young offenders and their guardian and put them on a remote Scottish or Irish island then add the mcguffin of an old hippy tramp finally add some female young offenders then add the real villain of the piece and some hunter dogs. Now start killing off the key film characters with a variety of nasty bloody methods and moments and then add some mutiny and a little of the untamed male 'hunter' mentality and you have a film which 'tried' to be something fascinating.Wilderness suffers in my opinion from 2 things. The twin curses of poor dialogue and there being no real sense of danger. The people are not really marooned on this island they have some means of getting off it  hence no real sense of desperation which a film like this sorely needed. This is a real pity. The director had the makings of a serious horror movie  a kind of Lord of the Flies meets Deliverance with little bits of First Blood Part 1 thrown in some nasty traps and hints of Predator not really seeing the hunter until the last few minutes. I hope though that the Director of this will make other horror films. it all looks like its going in the right direction and the more good horror movies out there the better.".

Wilderness is a well put together sort of mix of survivalist horror action thriller  teen slasher film all rolled into one  it's very similar to Severance 2006 another British survivalist horror film made the same year but without the comedy elements. Wilderness takes itself very seriously in fact there's a fairly disturbing opening sequence showing the bullying  subsequent suicide of a young offender in prison with which his tormentors are given a free holiday for as punishment!  it's fairly grim going right through until the end with some brutal murders some really unlikable character's who do some really nasty stuff  a pretty bleak atmosphere. The film has a good pace there's plenty going on  there's some very memorable moments here but it's not perfect the fact that all of the character's are so unlikable is a problem because you end up wanting them to die rather than rooting for them  I was disappointed by a fairly lacklustre twist at the end  an all too predictable killer.The film looks good  there's none of that awful slowmotion fastmotion quick cut editing shaky handheld camcorder cinematography or any colour bleaching which is great it's nice to see a film shot pretty much 'as is' rather than have lots of pointless  often annoying postproduction techniques inserted. There's some nice gore here too there's a fair amount of blood splatter someone is shot with arrows dogs tear the side of someone's face off  bite his chest  stomach open leaving his insides hanging out there's a severed head on a spike there's a slit throat a guy has his foot sliced off by a bear trap there's a severed arm there are stabbings  the violence levels are up to the required standards. There are one or two really great scenes here the bit when Callum stands looking around by sees nothing then moves away only for the leaves on the ground to move or when the killer slashes someone's throat from behind without them even noticing them there are very effective.With a supposed budget of about 3000000 this was shot in Scotland  Nothern Ireland here in the UK  the locations are nice enough. The acting is pretty solid although some of the accents are a little off putting  feel very forced  at times dubbed. Sean Pertwee is the only cast member of any real note here.Wilderness is a very good film that will have most gripped the plot is good  the action  gore is great. Definitely well worth a watch as far as I am concerned.".

Instead they end up fighting for their lives.On the island though the boys run into 2 girls and their own warden from another detention center. Neither of the two wardens are very happy about each other's group being there but when one of the boys is found dead they band together to fight for survival. Naturally the two wardens are taken out by the killer first so the kids despite many of them disliking each other constantly backstabbing each other and trying to outdo one another must find a way to work together to stay alive.Wilderness is a terrific premise with an amazing sense of realism to it. The acting is fantastic particularly from Toby Kebbell Callum Stephen Wight Steve Lenora Crichlow Mandy and Alex Reid Louise. The deaths happen at appropriate times and yes they are gruesome and sometimes disturbing. The killer also has a pack of crazed dogs which he terrorises the teens with. It becomes obvious to both the teens and the audience who killer is what his motif is a standard fare in horror movies.Wilderness is gripping and fast paced. I was glued to the screen for the entire film following the teens working out who was trying to deceive who and delving into the complex relationships with each other. The only disappointing part which is quite minor is that although the warden mentions what the kids are in prison for you don't know who is in for what. The teens that survived are the ones that should have in my opinion.Overall a highly recommended horror which is fast paced full of unusual characters nasty deaths and a true struggle for survival.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wilderness is directed by Michael J. Bassett and written by Dario Poloni. It stars Sean Pertwee Alex Reid Toby Kebbell Karly Greene Stephen Wight  Lenora Crichlow.After the suicide of one of their inmates at a British male young offender institution a group of teenage offenders and their prison officer are sent to a remote island for outdoor rehabilitation. Once there tho they find that they are not alone as two young female offenders and their officer are also using the island for the same purpose. A battle of the sexes is the least of their collective worries however because someone is stalking them. With only one thing on their mind to kill them all.Chances are that if you pull ten reviews off of the internet for Wilderness you will find in most of them references to Scum Dog Soldiers Battle Royale and Deliverance. Which while it comes across as lazy pigeonholing is a fair enough point to make. However Wilderness while not being as good as any of those film's deserves to be allowed to stand on its own two feet with survivalist heart proudly beating in its chest. Yes the story is a touch derivative but Bassett's film is pleasingly nasty and serves the gore hounds well. After the set up introduces us to the inmates of this wing of Moorgate Prison where the moody Callum Kebbell walks into a den of bullying and suicide it's clear that these are not characters we are meant to like. This collective bunch consists of robbers murderers and sex offenders. As a group of people they are as unlikable as it gets this works a treat once we get to the island and things start to go belly up as they come under attack from an unseen assailant and start to turn on each other in the process. Who do you root for? Eh? Exactly.With the characters' struggle to bond together to survive we have the reason why Wilderness should be fairly judged on its own terms. Leaving aside for the moment that it contains inventive and grisly deaths that it thrusts these young hotheaded adults into a Lord of the Fliesian there's another one for you type situation makes for a fascinating watch. Particularly as the sense of dread that lands on the island with the protagonists never leaves the film. There's also a wry observational arc on the British institutional system we may be ducking from crossbow bolts and snarling German Shephard's but Bassett and his team are not just about the blood. No sir. Even as Poloni's misanthropic script starts to bite hard there's still some humour to be found while Alex Reid's underused but making a telling mark tough female exsoldier is the smartest character in the film. To call this a blood for bloods sake movie like some critics have is just unfair since some thought has gone into making it exactly not that.Bassett considerably improves from his debut horror picture Deathwatch. But Wilderness does have problems to stop it from being a top tier British horror. There's bad decisions made with a couple of the most interesting characters and the reveal of the killer is far too soon. There's also some pacing problems that are further highlighted by some of the average acting from the lesser principals left to carry the story. However steering us away from dwelling too long on the young bucks caught in the headlights is Kebbell who oozes charisma as Callum the character is in truth not fully formed his moody past is only briefly touched upon but Kebbell plays him smart yet dangerously feral a leader in waiting indeed. But it's Wight's turn as a bullyboy Nazi that runs away with the film. He's as dangerous as the person hunting them down the last person you would want to have to rely upon in a crisis. He is a vile and nasty piece of work that Bassett enjoys playing the audience's sympathies with.At times brutal and even unforgiving as a human interest piece Wilderness is a far better survivalist horror than some would have you believe. 710".

The young group are shipped off to a deserted island to build character and bond. However they're not alone and someone with a crossbow and a pack of dogs begin to hunt them down.Woodland horror. I love this subgenre. However this particular British item builds an interesting story to only fumble it with halfbaked revelations obnoxious characters and splintered direction. The survival trek is filled with blood soaked surprises jarring jolts and a notorious mean streak. Yippy! Yeah some of the wicked deaths are ferocious but it did become a bit boring. When director Michael J Bassett gets hot under the collar after slowly milking it out to begin with he engineers taut and breakneck tension to only let the lean story be navigated by implausible and contrived staples that eventually go on to cement a numbing and uneven pattern. The unmasking of the killer is flat though its no surprise and it never is because we find out just after it all begins and the confrontation comes off lousy and underdone. The characters don't break away from their underwritten clichd persona's. They do become a sorry and tiring bunch that you couldn't care less about. Sure they're not meant to be likable but hell they really irritated me. But I guess that was the perfect mould though. The story stays firm and simple going out hard. I have mixed emotions about it but this is more towards its timing and pushy developments and how it eventually went about trying to cover its lack of atmosphere with rapid uncertain movements and bloated shocks. I thought the setting could've been implemented better. Peter J Robertson's professional camerawork gets some nice shots and his location framing and adventurous style works off fine. The music by Mark Thomas features a foreboding sting. The performances are by the books. Sean Pertwee sits back Alex Reid gives all her will to the part and Toby Kebbell neurotically goes through the motions. Stephen Wight is probably the pick of the lot as the seething bully skinhead.".

The young lady Alex Reid as Louise has some experience with the movies with Arachnid 2001 and The Descent 2005 to her credit. The main draw here is the charismatic Sean Pertwee Dog Soldiers 2002 as this band of brothers guide on an uninhabited island known as The Wilderness an old army training ground handed over to the prison service for the aid of character building there's an irony here somewhere and rehabilitation.A good concept in theory but executed in the manner of amateur hour at a local movie making convention. I don't mean to sound lowspirited I want these actors' and actresses' careers to take off and its makers too this is a big step into the void of movie making while their talents might have been appreciated on the small screen here they are underpowered by the transgression to wide screen. Wilderness may have missed the boat where charisma and originality is concerned but as a first attempt it is an okay try. The direction is sustainable with a steady pace and at times atmosphere but it does need more work and with a halfdecent sense of photography from Peter J. Robertson the trees and the woods is not the place to be going at anytime if Peter J. Robertson is in charge. With the help of one Mark Thomas Dog Soldiers 2002 and his musical score it can just about make it but a good movie needs goodness from all directions too.What has let this movie down is its terrible script Dario Poloni and extremely tacky dialogue that these unfortunate actors and we too have to suffer at times it reaches beyond cringing to sheer embarrassment. This is innercity underclass and its flotsam and jetsam parodying and nothing else and the actors here are just trying too hard to be something they are not and it shows. Was there ever a period of research for these roles or were they just thrown together with the bad the good and the ugly? Also too is the predicable plot not just the storyline but the actual plot you can see this coming well into the first half it's only a matter of principle to see this to the end to prove yourself right. Wilderness may have been a learning curve for all those involved and we too have learnt that we should not judge this cover until we have seen it from the inside out.".

And I have to admit that this film does make you think that in some places.But to start with this film sorta takes you in abit you're following the story wondering whats going to happen...so thats a good thing right? Well the first few times you see the gore you think oh my god thats gross...then you see it again and you're like ewww...then you see it again and eventually you end up just watching this gore with no reaction whatsoever because you've seen enough of it already....and this is a common problem with most British horror films like 28 days later.Some of the acting isn't brilliant either...and correct me if i'm wrong but i got the impression this was a pretty low budget movie. You could predict pretty much everything from start to finish and the so called twist at the end...is abit poor....the fact they couldn't think of anything else but i won't spoil the 'fantastic' ending for you If you're a fan of repetitive and predictable gore...go ahead and watch this.

	schema:headline " A strange and creepy horror SpanishGerman coproduction about vampires with the unforgettable Soledad Miranda";
	schema:reviewBody "It deals with Linda Westinghouse the German Ewa Strmberg  a charming young American lawyer working in a law office in Istanbul . In the night she has erotic dreams in which appears a sexy vixen vampiress the Spanish Soledad Miranda her pseudonym Susann Korda was created by director Jess Franco  and she was destined to become a legend  and makes passionate love to her from which she's unable to defend herself . A minor case about an inheritance forces her to travel to one of the small islands off the Turkish coast. Then her nightmares come upon her in ghastly and lively ways . Later on  the beautiful Linda is is sent to a mental institution where Dr Steiner The Italian Paul Muller  who is also a vampire expert treats her but things go wrong .An erotic and eerie horror tale about a seducing bloodsucker who kidnaps and murders girls to appease her insatiable thirst for female blood.This is a passable yarn by the prolific writerproducerdirector Jess Franco  considered to be one of the best films in his second period . Unforgettable and attractive Soledad Miranda as a sexpot brunette who harasses women and sucks their blood . This fragile beauty appeared in numerous comedies dramas Bmovies and horror films mostly in Spain  over thirty films altogether from 1960 to 1970 . In 1970 Soledad was in a car accident on a highway in Portugal and she sadly died . Ironically before this tragic accident the powerful German film producer Artur Brauner had offered her a contract which would have made her a great star. Soledad was destined to become a legend .Her biggest break came from legendary director Jess Franco who cast Soledad in such cult classics as Count Dracula  Eugenie De Sade  Sex Charade  The Devil Came from Akasava and Vampyros Lesbos. Soledad is generally regarded as Franco's greatest discovery and not until the years after her death has she become a cult starlet with fans all over the world now discovering the beautiful doomed actress. This Vampyros Lesbos is a pure psychedelic movie  being well produced Artur Brauner and Arturo Marcos but in short budget . Shot in Istanbul  Turkey  posing as the fictitious city in which lives the Countess vampire Nadine Carody  gorgeous Soledad Miranda though she was was dubbed. This classic terror motion picture  a classic in some circles  was professionally directed by Jess Franco who never considered the film to be a horror story but instead felt it was tale of anguish . Franco is really influenced by Bram Stoker's Drcula  Carmilla's Sheridan Le Fanu  BHorror movies  German expressionism  and the Universal Terror . The picture was really cut  and it has several versions both  soft and hard . Initial releases of the film were met with negative reactions from film critics  while the general critical reaction had been poor  however today is considered to be an acceptable fim. Furthermore  support cast is pretty good such as Dennis Price as Dr. Alwin Seward  Paul Muller as Dr. Steiner and Jess Frank or Jess Franco himself as a sadist killer . Special mention for musical score composed by synthesizer  full of strange sounds  jazzy  shouts and psychedelic soundtrack from Manfred Hbler and Jess Franco as David Khune . The film has a lot of titles the German version is Vampyros Lesbos Die Erbin des Drcula the French version titled Vampiros lesbos was used while the original German release title was spelled Vampyros Lesbos and Spanish versin titled Las vampiras .The motion picture was strange and regularly directed by Jess Frank  here using continous zooms surprising closeups  including blood drops  scorpions  butterfly  other insects and and kites . Jesus Franco was a Stajanovist filmmaker who realized 203 movies . However  here uses his trademarks  as he pulls off a complex narration  extreme zooms  and lousy pace . As the picture belongs to Franco's second period in which he made soso flicks . Jesus uses to sign under pseudonym  among the aliases he used apart from the names Jess Franco or Franco Manera were Jess Frank Robert Zimmerman Frank Hollman Clifford Brown David Khune  Toni Falt James P. Johnson Charlie Christian David Tough  among others . Franco used to utilize usual marks such as zooms  nudism  foreground on objects  filmmaking in doityourself effort style or DIY and managing to work extraordinarily quickly  realizing some fun diversions and a lot of absolute crap . Many pictures had nice photography  full of lights and shades in Orson Welles style  in fact  Franco was directionassistant in Chimes at midnight and edited El Quijote by Welles . He often used to introduce second  third or fourth versions  including Hardcore or Softcore inserts or sexual stocks many of them played by his muse Lina Romay . In many of the more than 200 films he's directed he has also worked as composer writer cinematographer and editor. His first was We Are 18 Years Old and the second picture was Gritos en la Noche 1962  the best of all them  also titled The Awful Dr. Orlof  it's followed by various sequels such as El Secreto del Dr. Orloff 1964 aka The Mistresses of Dr. Jekyll   Orloff y el hombre invisible 1970 aka Dr. Orloff's Invisible Monster and finally Faceless 1987 . He also directed to the great Christopher Lee in 4 films  The Bloody Judge  Count Dracula The Blood of Fu Manchu and The castle of Fu Manchu . Jess's influence has been notable all over Europe . From his huge body of work we can deduce that Jess Franco is one of the most restless directors of Spanish cinema and often releasing several titles at the same time. Many of his films have had problems in getting released and others have been made directly for video. More than once his staunchest supporters have found his new films to contain much footage from one or more of his older films . Jess Franco is a survivor in a time when most of his colleagues tried to please the government administration. He broke up with all that and got the independence he was seeking. He always went upstream in an ephemeral industry that fed opportunists and curbed the activity of many professionals . But time doesn't pass in vain and Jesus' production has diminished since the 90s  however he went on shooting until his recent death .".

Vampires gratuitous nudity especially memorable from  the stunningly beautiful and ill fated Soledad Miranda violence pretentious symbolism some aesthetically pleasing scenery and camera work all bound together by one of the most unique genrebusting rock scores ever chock full of fuzz guitars and electric sitar.The legendary Jess Franco has made more cult movies than the mind can conceive of but this must surely stand out as one of the most artistically successful of his career. 'Vampyros Lesbos' manages to juggle sex art trash and horror and impresses on every level. A truly wondrous movie! Don't miss this one uncut natch if you get the chance!";

	schema:reviewBody "After missing it a couple of times on TV one of them in the guise of the shorter and 'clothed' Spanish version and thinking about picking up the DVD in either region on several occasions I finally managed to sit down and watch via the nowOOP R1 DVD from Synapse what is perhaps Jess Franco's bestknown film. Not having been particularly bowled over by either of the two Soledad Miranda films I had watched until now  EUGENIE DE SADE 1970 though this is one I need to watch again and SHE KILLED IN ECSTASY 1970  I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed VAMPYROS LESBOS. The reasons for this are many and varied and all in all I'd say it is without a doubt one of Franco's most enduring  and impressive  works.As most of you probably know already the film is based on nothing less than that vampiric chestnut  Bram Stoker's 'Dracula'  which Franco had already filmed a year before and in which VAMPYROS' leading lady Soledad Miranda had also appeared! Not having watched that particular adaptation I cannot say which 'version' is the more successful  but in the case of VAMPYROS LESBOS Franco certainly imbues it with an overwhelming visual style which goes hand in hand with a bizarre and intoxicating soundtrack that almost encourages one to overlook its deficiencies which being a Franco film it could hardly fail to be without!From the very first shot the film weaves a haunting and dreamlike mood which is for the most part effortlessly sustained throughout that is as indescribable as it is hard to shake off. Frankly this is what Franco is all about to me counting Luis Bunuel as my favorite filmmaker I cannot but admire the ingenuity coupled sometimes with naivete with which Franco pulls off this surreal 'trip' of a film memorable images abound in VAMPYROS LESBOS many of them allegorical elliptical or just plain weird  that in its own way also manages to be a remarkably effective spin on Stoker's 'old' vampire tale. In fact the film's updatingjettisoning of the 'established' vampire myths a modern beachhouse replacing the old family castle and decked out with fishnets rather than cobwebs instead of sunlight having a deadly effect on the vampire we get to admire her while sunbathing and skinnydipping  though the method of disposing of her remains through incredibly violent means is surely one of its most endearing aspects. Apart from this not only is the vampire herself like the nymphomaniac in SINNER 1972 driven through rape towards lesbianism as much taken with her victim as one expects it to be the other way around but also we have what passes for the traditional 'vampire hunter' Dennis Price's Dr. Seward actively wanting to go to 'the other side' the confrontation scene between the two which takes place in the lobby of his clinic is masterfully handled  except for one embarrassingly amateurish moment when Price is made to slink down the stairs when he should be running for his life! whereas the vampire's henchman named Morpho no less is not the expected creepylooking hulk  if still a mute  but rather a lanky thug in a suit sporting cool shades and a pistol not to mention being secretly enamored of his Mistress! And then there's Jess Franco himself in a quite revealing bit as a crazed sadist foreshadowing perhaps his Vogel of EXORCISM 1974Of course the film would not have worked quite as well without the beguiling presence of Soledad Miranda who dominates every scene she's in be it the various tantalizing nightclub acts surely among the finest setpieces in a Franco film and several of them feature this type of scene  though we are never told quite why she should be doing them being a Countess and all! that we see her perform or the utterly graceful and totally natural manner in which she lures our understandably confused heroine Ewa Stroemberg into her particular 'way of life' away from her boyfriend and the routine which governs her 'normal' existence. As has been promised by the title we get to see a lot of female nudity  a Franco trademark if ever there was one  but since the plot deals with an obsessive relationship not only Miranda and Stroemberg's but also Heidrun Kussin's Renfieldlike 'infatuation' with the former it does not feel overemphasized here and in any case is really quite tame considering the director's standards of even a few years later.The film's basic plot is waferthin 'padded' by numerous repeated actions and images which coupled with its necessarily languid pace induces a sense of drowsiness in the viewer this however is not a detriment to the film at all as this quality is also to be found in the work of even the major arthouse filmmakers I felt entranced in much the same way for example while watching Robert Bresson's A MAN ESCAPED 1956 recently  a film possibly admired by Franco himself seeing that it's referenced at the start of THE DIABOLICAL DOCTOR Z 1965.For those of you who are interested I would like to point you in the direction of an excellent analytical study of the film  which lies at the heart of a lengthy article about five Jess Franco movies from the 1970s  written by Maximilian Le Cain that was published in the 'Senses of Cinema' online journal. Here's the relevant linkhttpwww.sensesofcinema.comcontents0327jessfranco.htmlImmediately after watching the DVD to my horror I discovered that both VAMPYROS LESBOS and SHE KILLED IN ECSTASY are to be reissued next year by a different company Image and that these will most probably use the reportedly superior transfers that were available for Second Sight's impossibly expensive for my tastes being blind purchases and all R2 discs. Well I'm actually thankful I paid less than 12 shipping included for VAMPYROS whereas I managed to acquire ECSTASY in a perfectly acceptable VHS dub. Depending on the extras  not that Image has shown itself too generous in this department thus far at least where Franco is concerned  I may eventually upgrade these two fun Franco flicks featuring the lovely talented and ultimately tragic legend that was Soledad Miranda!".

The film follows the course of the strange romance between Linda and Nadine. Linda falls under Nadine's spell and a living nightmare soon begins. This film mixes dream and reality in a terrific way. Franco appears as Memmet a sadistic killer. Soledad is absolutely fantastic in this movie. She's very lowkey yet totally captivating all the same. You'll wish you could be possessed by her! Franco's direction involves crazy zoom shots interspersed footage of insects with a scorpion that perhaps is meant to mirror the Countess and a funky popart style. The psychedelic music used throughout the movie was written by Manfred Hbler and Siegfried Schwab. Despite its European success Vampyros Lesbos never received distribution in the United States. It was long considered the Holy Grail of the European lesbian vampire genre. It was a renaissance in interest in Jess Franco as well as the charttopping success of the soundtrack in the '90s that brought the film back into attention.

And that's maybe why this film has such a bad rating on IMDb people like me thought that it was a horror vampire flick but get a arthouse film instead. For this film probably won't appeal to most hardcore horror fanatics. It's all about soul and atmosphere like the Hammer films so if you like them than Vampyros Lesbos is gold. The stars of Vampyros Lesbos Soledad Miranda and Ewa Strmberg are both great and plays theirs roles with big credibility. And it's really not hard to see why Soledad became such cult star either she is phenomenal. I also have to mention the ultra cool soundtrack made by the groovy German duo Manfred Hubler and Sigfried Schwab. Really great soundtrack one of the music segments in the film were actually used by Tarantino in Jackie Brown. I liked this film and I will give it a 8 out of 10. I also looking forward to see more from Franco in the nearest future.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not much happens in this movie. Like most Franco films it features scenes that are slow and extended with clich situations. Its saving grace is that it reflects the dreams and hallucinations of the womanvictim so the elongated scenes have a dreamlike quality which is effective and sometimes seductive. The violence is restrained some blood here and there. Although I dislike gore I did wish the horror element was played up more. I enjoyed the musical score uniquely psychedelic. It had some success as a dance reissue in the mid 90s. Soledad Miranda is incredibly beautiful. To me watching her is reason enough to go through this film. Her strip tease scene is very unique and fortunately gets repeated in the film. Her looks are beguiling in every one of her seduction scenes. Otherwise the movie is an average mixed bag.".

It had some success as a dance reissue in the mid 90s. Soledad Miranda is incredibly beautiful. To me watching her is reason enough to go through this film. Her strip tease scene is very unique and fortunately gets repeated in the film. Her looks are beguiling in every one of her seduction scenes. Otherwise the movie is an average mixed bag.";

Linda is assigned to resolve an inheritance issue with the Hungarian Countess Nadine Oskudar Soledad Miranda that has inherited a real estate from Count Dracula. Linda leaves her boyfriend Omar Victor Feliman in the Istanbul Hilton and travels to the Kadidados Island. While waiting for transportation in the continent Linda is advised by a local that the island would be a place of death and insanity and she should not travel to there. However she does not pay attention to the man and meets Countess Oskudar that is a lesbian vampire fascinated by Linda. The Countess drinks the blood of Linda and she has amnesia and is sent to a mental institution where Dr Steiner Paul Muller who is also a vampire expert treats her and puts an advertisement in the newspapers. Omar finds Linda and Dr. Steiner teaches her how to kill a vampire. Linda has to be very powerful to resist the spell of Countess Oskudar that has a crush on her and destroy the vampire.Vampiros Lesbos is an erotic and cult version of Bram Stoker's Dracula by Jesus Franco. The story is very similar to the classic novel of 1897 but instead of Count Dracula the vampire is a sexy female that was raped by Dracula centuries ago and does not like man. The lead actresses Ewa Stromberg and Soledad Miranda are very beautiful and undress practically in every scene. The film is very entertaining and funny. My vote is six.Title Brazil Vampiras Lsbicas Lesbian Vampires".

The rest is pretty much convoluted nonsense about Linda trying to fight the vampire urge and eventually overcoming Nadine and some other random nonsense  which is all just really an excuse to show as much tits and ass as possible  not that that is a bad thing...The acting in the film is OK I guess for this sort of thing and the direction and camerawork range from very decent to plain amateurish depending on the scene. There's a few scenes where the lighting is used to good effect  but who am I kidding...this one is all about the nekkid chicks.

	schema:headline " Poor poor Dennis Price  frown for all you're worth me old son";
	schema:reviewBody "My purpose for watching this wasn't for the lesbian content I'm sure I could find steamier stuff if I tried  it was to see the depths to which such a fantastic actor as Dennis Price the star of Kind Hearts and Coronets about 22 years earlier was forced to sink to in order to pay his bills. It truly is a depressing experience though remarkably Price manages to escape with most of his dignity intact. This seems an even greater achievement when you consider that the DVD is of a Spanish film dubbed into German with English subtitles.In Vampyros Lesbos he plays a Dr. Steward psychologist and secret vampire enthusiast the latter hobby suddenly being revealed out of nowhere once the plot requires it. You see despite being given a rather illdefined character to work with and in direct contrast to the rest of the cast Price actually acts. Mixing concern with frightened fascination he draws your attention in whatever scene he appears and probably gets more close ups in this film than in any other I've seen. It's not a particularly large part but he does have a fair amount of screen time and it was a joy to watch him. It was a huge shame that I couldn't actually hear him speak his own lines as the German dubber made the best attempt to deaden any emotion that Price attempted to convey but his facial expressions were enough and so I just imagined Price's voice instead. Whilst the direction elsewhere in the film can be called into question Price manages to create a great atmosphere of tension in his encounter with Countess Nadine pleading with her to give him the secret of vampirism. The only real slipup is in his death a few seconds later in which upon realising that his life is distinctly on the line gently canters down some stairs rather than make a bolt for it allowing Nadine's burly henchman to effortlessly catch up with and throttle the life out of him though I suspect this is more a directing fault than anything that could be blamed on Price himself. And it must be said that the strangling is rather unnerving.However after Price dies we still have fifteen minutes left until the end of the film which we must spend with the other characters that we've been presented with throughout the duration and this is where the film falls down  every scene lacking Dennis Price is absolutely dire as he is the only actor capable of giving a decent performance and the story holding everything together is so flimsy that it might as well not be there. And indeed isn't for a majority of the time. Price's Dr. Steward is actually in one of the many seemingly pointless subplots peppered here and there which also include a scary pervo bloke who gets his kicks him tying up women and threatening them with a hacksaw and an insane woman throwing herself about a clinic waiting for Countess Nadine to return to her and give her a bit of a seeing to. These characters serve no function at all and are rather tedious all told.The main plot line concerns itself with Linda who is apparently worried about the frequency of erotic dreams she's been having about a woman she's never met before. When her boyfriend a shifty looking spiv type takes her to a stripclub ?! she recognises the dancer that's being charitable as the woman in her dreams. Turns out the woman is Countess Nadine Carody a vampire with connections to Dracula himself. Linda goes to Nadine's estate to help her with insurance or something and has various encounters with her during the running time. Narrative consistency is thrown out of the window when despite being frightened of Nadine when they first meet she quite happily goes skinnydipping with her ?! and then lies nude with her on the beach  It's good to lie naked in the sand. Especially when you're with somebody. Yes. Good grief. And in the next scene she's once more a bit suspect about the whole deal.I know what you're thinking  It's lesbo porn it doesn't need a plot! But there isn't really much of the steamy shenanigans going on to uphold such a claim and the few scenes of Near naked ladies snatch a few fumbling kisses are played so stiltedly that any erotic tension is immediately dissipated. The director seems to think that propping a few nude women here and there automatically means sexy when it well doesn't. It just gets tedious and laughable more than anything else. It comes to something when I was far more willing to watch Dennis Price writing in his diary than two rather beautiful ladies having it away with each other.The direction is full of clever and artistic shots of scorpions and moths and a kite ... which are meant to make us nod our heads sagely and say Ahh mmm... but just come off as pretentious and silly. We're also forced to endure a bizarre striptease performance in which Nadine removes her clothes and puts them on her partner who seems to be pretending to be a mannequin twice and both times it's dull as hell. Fortunately the group of 40somethings in the club appear to be enjoying themselves though since they staggeringly fail to notice Nadine killing her partner on the second run through and clap anyway I'm not so certain that their opinion is valid.Apparently this is a cult classic with its dire soundtrack the sitar has never been my favourite instrument achieving acclaim in some quarters. Allegedly. I can't say that I was disappointed with this film as I knew it was going to be rubbish to start with. Fortunately it was vaguely worthwhile simply to see Price's performance though it's certainly a disc that won't be given another spin in quite a long time.".

The cast features other familiar faces Dennis Price as a clinic doctor with an interest in the supernatural and Paul Muller as a psychiatrist but it's Miranda who will command most of ones' attention.This is all very well shot on stunning locations in Spain Germany and Turkey. The only real debit for this viewer was the music score which is much too loud and overbearing.

All of the key elements of Bgrade movies are there  the freaky camerawork the vacant stares of many of the actors the implausible excuses for gratuitous nudity. It all gels well together in this little excursion.I rated this movie a 3 because to rate it higher would do it injustice to its Bgrade heritage. It would score much higher in Bgrade circles for the cheese factor and the provision of stuff to poke fun at. Fun stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Queen of the Night will bear you up on her dark wings.I guess you can look at Vampyros lesbos as director Jess Franco's 70's modern variation on Bram Stoker's Dracula using Soledad Miranda as the seductive female lesbian vampire who took lessons from her master..that being Count Draculain capturing victims through a form of hypnotic lust invading women through their dreams. You could say that Ewa Strmberg's Linda an agent whose firm Simpson  Simpson is handling Dracula's will which would entitle that his inheritance of the Kadidados islands..and everything on it be left to her is Mina the object for which Carody desires to initiate into her inner circle. Andrs Monales as Linda's lover Omar would be the Jonathan Harker the one who stands between Carody and her paramour. There really isn't a strong candidate for Van Helsing..it seems like Dennis Price as scientist Dr. Alwin Seward who runs a clinic and studies vampirism would be but he harbours a desire to be a vampire himself so he could obtain supernatural powers. Within Seward's clinic is AgraHeidrun Kussin who is the Renfield of the film except instead of madness she's more overcome by a state of constant orgasm wantonly desiring to return to Carody locked up in Seward's clinic. Her husband is Memmet..portrayed by the director in one of his typically bizarre roles who works at a hotel which charters a small boat to ferry people to Carody's island. Memmet is actually a psychotic torturer..who likes to sucker females into the hotel wine cellar where he binds them before the nasty business whose madness derives from the fact that Carody changed his wife into a lunatic only yearning for her touch. Paul Muller is given frankly a thankless role as Linda's psychiatrist who believes her rantings of being haunted by fantasies of Carody is merely bad sex. Carody's relationship to Dracula subtly mentioned here and there in the film comes from an incident near a castle she lived overcome by depravity and violence. Men were ravaging the village women attempting to rape her..this also provides the emphasis on why she hates men dragging her from her castle..Dracula killing the man on top of her subsequently adopting Carody into his family. Carody mentions how she was the woman who made his life worth living and that he always desired her body taking just enough blood he needed to survive finally turning her into a vampire. The Turkish locations are definitely highlighted in this film as Franco's camera embraces various aspects of his setting. But the pleasure for me is Soledad Miranda. The many ways Franco shoots her the character is all hers. Of her short few lead roles I think this She Killed in Ecstasy  Eugenie de Sade each display her hold on the viewer. Whether it be her very unusual stage act where she dresses a human mannequin for an audience before biting her assistant's neck the way her face is lit or the abstract camera anglesit seems Franco wants you to see her as a very special creature not meant for our world. Whether she's naked in a bikini or wearing lingerie on stage Miranda is a showcase for our viewing pleasure. She's a darkeyed goddess to me a portrait on celluloid. I would definitely say Miranda's iconic accessory for this particular film is her red scarf. It's around her neck almost always. Jos Martnez Blanco is Carody's henchman Morpho with dead eyes which stare right through you. The score only heightens the otherworldly nature Franco's direction brings to this fantasy. It's a vampire film but I felt it embraces the erotic side rather than the violence often elaborated in Dracula adaptations. Sure Carody's bites but I think this is more about her seduction and entrapment over female victims she desires than the relishing bite on the jugular for flowing blood. I think the ultimate nourishment for a vampire like Carody is capturing the heart and soul of her victim not their lifeforce.".

	schema:text "    A lone man recently released from prison seeks out the people from his past who he believes betrayed him. While he forces each to atone for their sins he must also face what meting out vengeance will do to his immortal soul. Meanwhile he's not the only one looking to settle old scores. Hired by the man responsible for the events which lead him to prison an eccentric contract killer follows his every move. Scenes of them crossing paths sometimes violently are interspersed with the assassin's selfrealizations of how to deal with struggles within his own life. As if old enemies and hired guns aren't enough a young female detective begrudgingly works alongside a veteran investigator looking to simply survive his last two weeks on the force before retirement as they seek out the brazen excon who has been blazing a path of gasolinepowered destruction in his vintage Chevelle.";

	schema:headline " A really worthwhile action flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Faster does not try to be anything it's not. It is a fast paced action flick with plausible performances from all round.I've always liked Thornton as he is very good at playing a drugged out low life. He is perfect for this role. Forget Thornton though nothing fits better than the role The Rock played. A cold mean man with big muscles looking for revenge. That's exactly who the Rock is and I could easily say there was no better man for the job! Oliver JacksonCohen as the hitman also played a decent role and I really liked the addition to his role of being challenged. Maybe I'm not expressing myself very well but what I think I'm trying to say is that Faster didn't feel corny in any scenes. Like most action films go waaaaaay overboard or some try to mix too much drama into it when it's supposed to be an action flick. I didn't feel any negative element like that linger around in Faster. It's solid action that's believable and although it does have some drama in it it's woven in quite well but in any case the action overpowers any other element the movie may have to offer.Throughout the movie I was actually gripped with tension and it also has a good twist at the end though the smarter movie goer would probably pick it up early on.I really can't say anything bad about this film besides the fact it's just an action movie and that's not a negative because that's what it set out to be and that's what it is. No academy performances no sensational script but much better than other actions movies because like I said no corny scenes all plausible no dodgy romance scenes.By the way without giving too much of a spoiler I also really enjoyed the fact how Faster developed a scenario where I expected at least one character's life to turned to ruins but instead an unexpected but easily believable resolution was found. Everyone got what they deserved which is great and I also got what I deserved enjoyable action! By the way this movie no where near deserves a 6.7 rating on IMDb. I know action titles aren't given too much credit but Faster deserves to be at least 7 probably about 7.2.".

A man focused on his mission. The Rock is a coldblood murder machine. Nothing heroic or even sympathetic about this guy which makes him fascinating to watch as he runs down his list.This movie doesn't reinvent the wheel but it is a nice cure for the sugar coated holiday releases flooding our cinemas.

That's why I did not give it a full score.But those things aside this movie was quite fun to watch. Loved how Dwayne Johnson finally decided to get back to his action roles after the lame kid movies he had starred in lately. His screen presence was awesome and kinda reminded me of the good old times while he was wrestling.The music and the setting were awesome it really did remind me of the 70's revenge thrillers. The entire movie was like an ode to the old dark and moody revenge movies just as Kill Bill was. I believe they got the setting and tone of the movie quite right and the music itself was awesome. Nothing flashy just melancholy sounding from beginning to end.The action scenes were quite good since Dwaynes character The Driver just oozed of cold blooded anger and hatred. Making the showdowns quite interesting and funny at one point as well. The other characters were entertaining as well The Killer and The Cop. Each had their own story going on until they get intertwined with each other as the movie progresses.Overall I loved the movie and I feel anyone who is wanting to check out a action flick this weekend should definitely check this movie out. It will be worth the money spent if you are looking to be entertained.".

Whether throwaway crap like The Scorpion King or just plain embarrassing stuff like The Tooth Fairy we get it Dwayne you can laugh at yourself  how about getting down to business! I just never felt compelled to see one of his movies. Until now.I could tell from the trailer this one was going to be different.Faster is a throwback to the merciless action flicks of the 1970s. Existential in tone. Ruthless in execution. It's kind of a cross between Death Wish and Vanishing Point. A pure undiluted revenge drama that shows Dwayne Johnson really can walk the walk when he wants to. This isn't Grated pabulum for the whole family. This is a leather glove across the chops Rrated blast from the muzzle of a sawedoff shotgun. The plot isn't very complex but the pacing is beautiful as is the purity of this amazing movie.Billy Bob Thornton does a great job too as The Cop a lowlife drug addicted slimy little lawman with 9 days to go before retirement and one last case to solve. And Oliver JacksonCohen is terrific as a yuppie hitman with a personal score to settle.If you like movies that are intent simply in kicking your ass for 90 minutes you could do a lot worse than Faster. After all these years I'm finally a Dwayne Johnson fan.".

However two people are in the hunt to stop him veteran cop Billy Bob Thornton only days from retiring and a young hit man Oliver JacksonCohen both on Driver's trail. The race is on and there can be only one winner.My Comment The story is simple and straight to the point Driver wants revenge. Driver gets out of prison after 10 years and he starts hunting down the criminals who were responsible for killing his brother. However things get complicated when a hit man comes after him. Not only does he have to avoid the cops but now he is also a target. Physically the Rock is imposing in this film but he only speaks about 2 dozen words in the whole movie. The Rock does not have much dialog but his tough mannerisms and cold blooded killer facial expressions are enough. Billy Bob Thornton's performance as the sleazy cop is excellent. If you want to see an action packed revenge flick this is a good one to see. CBS Films Run Time 135 Rated R810".

	schema:reviewBody "I went expecting a basic action film. I did not get it.What we got was a man's movie  and in this reviewer's opinion one of the best in recent memory.This it is not yet another film about revenge  it is a film about vengeance and that's another animal entirely. If the true essence of great storytelling and myth is that it takes us on a journey that is on the surface almost simplistic but leaves the audience more by the end then Faster succeeds and succeeds way beyond expectations.In sidestepping the current vogue for mindless action it does hark back to the 70s  and the look and feel are very true to those roots. Finally we might be leaving aside the lowbrow sarcastic sadism that has ruled action films for a decade now and getting to action film that engages rather than kills to entertain. Director George Tillman keeps the speech sparse and the direction too. While the film overhypes the testosterone levels through the hardware and the subplots there is an overall spareness to this that lifts the film. Finally it doesn't establish that there may be a world beyond vengeance too soon. In the dialog between a truly excellent Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje and Johnson the film goes from one level to another entirely. For this reviewer the Gaytons have written in that exchange one of the most iconic scenes on film in recent memory. And if this sounds like raving then it is because it deserves it brilliant writing and stonehard action combine to give the audience an experience to remember.This is a film that needed a star to really work and in Dwayne Johnson it has found one. He creates a character that is the closest I've seen to the uncompromising spirit of Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven and Dirty Harry in quite a while. Here there is genuine steel in the eye. This is tough without the token quips and ironic smiles. This is tough mean tough gutsy down to business get the job done filmmaking for men tough.Without a doubt a man's film  and one of the best in recent memory  and while Johnson's clowning may have been a strength in some previous films the uncompromising hardness he shows here has the potential to make him a real Alister.Go be surprised as we were.".

The Rock walks or rather runs out of prison after 10 years and starts hunting down the guys responsible for killing his brother. Things get complicated when the cops Billy Bob Thornton Carla Gugino and a playboyassassin Oliver Cohen and his girlfriend Maggie Grace LOST! start hunting him.

The Rock walks or rather runs out of prison after 10 years and starts hunting down the guys responsible for killing his brother. Things get complicated when the cops Billy Bob Thornton Carla Gugino and a playboyassassin Oliver Cohen and his girlfriend Maggie Grace LOST! start hunting him. There are great supporting actors like Mike Epps Moon Bloodgood and Mr. Eko from LOST along the way.I enjoyed it my wife enjoyed it and we are going with her family to see it again after Thanksgiving lunch.";

This movie just proves Dwayne Johnson isn't a sell out. This was simply his best film yet. You know lots of people also thought that a man from WWE who wanted to see if he could act would not make it big. Well you were all wrong he is a pretty descent actor he is not terrible and not bad he is excellent.The movie storyline is a revenge plot. After a bank robbery Dwayne Johnson's character Driver loses his brother in gang like activity so he seeks his revenge on all those responsible for his brothers death. In his way is Billy Bob Thorton a cop looking to put Driver down.I love that in the movie there are really no full names Dwayne's character is named only Driver. Billy Bob Throton's character is only titled as Cop. I thought this movie was well thought out well designed and well acted. I honestly had thought this film was just a movie that you see once and probably don't see it again but I probably will get this movie on blu ray when it is released on blu ray and DVD. So this movie is a 9 out of 10 for me.".

Physically he's imposing but much of the film leaves him short on spoken material. I'd call this a good call given that his most dramatic scenes aren't believable.

Unfortunate for the ticket buyer a likely action connoisseur Faster has very little action. Driver's checklist is a breeze most of his prospective victims put up zero fight whatsoever. When the bad guys aren't even trying it's difficult for me to get excited. I've had tougher times finishing grocery lists. Then there's the story involving Killer. Whatever stoic forceful appeal Driver displays is contrasted by the arrogance of Killer. This is fine by most measures but Killer never lives up to the hype painted around him. It seems that the title comes from his exclamation that Driver is a faster draw with a pistol but it would have been just as descriptive to call him inaccurate. This man of adventure is willing to concede that a getaway driver betters him with a gun I'd rather not tell that to my concerned girlfriend if I were him. I never got the feeling of the game between the two and a highflying car stunt from the trailer which was absent from the finished product could hint at a more involving struggle between the characters.Faster is directed by George Tillman Jr. with high energy. The general look of the film is a slightly more colorized bleach bypass film look of many recent grungy movies. The editing is crisp and CGI use is limited to being tastefully unobtrusive. Jokes and gags are few in number but every once in a while one crops up to lighten the mood. Overall very strong pacing with some well incorporated flashbacks and slow motion.The lack of a classical showdown really hurts Faster which otherwise measures up as one of the best actionrevenge films of recent years.

I never cared about wrestling or The Rock but since he switched to acting I've generally been impressed by Johnson. We can all agree material like Tooth Fairy is lame but he was surprisingly solid early on in The Rundown and Walking Tall. The guy even out acted veterans like Travolta and Keitel in Be Cool. Since then he's turned in a number of good performances Get Smart The Other Guys and now Faster. While he works in lighter genres like comedy this man was made for a movie like Faster. He exudes a sense of dark vengeance. Johnson plays a man simply known to us as Driver. Driver has a serious score to settle with some guys and fresh from a 10year prison sentence he's out for blood. Hot on his trail is Cop Billy Bob Thornton. Also added to the mix is Killer a professional hitman hired by one of the men Driver's after. Killer is unessential to the story but he's played surprisingly well so it's hard to fault his presence. The movie has its share of action but not the amount the trailer made it look to have. In fact a scene that was featured prominently in ads was completely cut from the film. You may recall  Johnson and Killer play chicken with their Chevelle and Ferrari. Neither gives and the two cars collide head on sending the Chevy flying. I can't fault the filmmakers for this. They might have felt the confrontation to be superfluous that the movie ended better without it. That's fine and it did have a good ending I was just expecting more and was very much let down when it went to credits. So that's my one beef aside from a minor complaint about an unrealistic twist. But neither was enough to hurt the movie too badly. In fact I was impressed at Faster's emotional core. Johnson isn't a robotic killing machine he's a man with a soul. Some of the men he hunts aren't entirely soulless either. Morality is very much a problem for Driver and it's this that elevates Faster above mindless Rrated violence. It's good Rrated violence. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "STAR RATING  Saturday Night  Friday Night  Friday Morning  Sunday Night  Monday Morning A former bank robber Dwayne Johnson is released after serving a lengthy prison sentence with only one thing on his mind cold brutal revenge on all those who were involved in his brother's murder all those years ago. But as he goes about his deadly mission he finds himself on a personal emotional inner battle as he considers the possibility of redemption and forgiveness.There's nothing unusual about an ex wrestler trying to eke out a post wrestling career by appearing in low budget straight to DVD action films or maybe the odd supporting role in a big screen action thriller. And everyone would have had every reason to write off Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as one such example from the off set. But here we have an ex grappler who appears to have gone above and beyond and made an impression on critics and cinema goers alike that not many others have. He's considered to have a charisma and charm that makes him a natural 'actor' and not just another ex fighter pretending to be a real such thing. While I don't necessarily agree with all this appraisal I can't deny what I see which is just such. And while Faster has gone straight to DVD there is undoubtedly an air and atmosphere to it that isn't apparent in your average such film.There is a clever high concept element to it in the way all the characters aren't given proper names but simply descriptions of them i.e. 'Driver' or 'Receptionist' as we could know their real names but we might have to be killed if we did. But Faster is aiming to be more than your average DVD action film in more ways than this. It is a cold brutal story of a man on a mission of honour and sworn vengeance that he can't switch off and it plays out in this hard unforgiving way before the power of redemption and forgiveness dawn on him and he is forced to search his own soul and make sacrifices of himself before he crosses the line and loses any sense of moral authority.While the end impression doesn't leave the powerful impact it quite could have this is an undeniably ambitious and surprising action thriller that delivers a lot more than it promises.

And everyone would have had every reason to write off Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as one such example from the off set. But here we have an ex grappler who appears to have gone above and beyond and made an impression on critics and cinema goers alike that not many others have. He's considered to have a charisma and charm that makes him a natural 'actor' and not just another ex fighter pretending to be a real such thing. While I don't necessarily agree with all this appraisal I can't deny what I see which is just such. And while Faster has gone straight to DVD there is undoubtedly an air and atmosphere to it that isn't apparent in your average such film.There is a clever high concept element to it in the way all the characters aren't given proper names but simply descriptions of them i.e. 'Driver' or 'Receptionist' as we could know their real names but we might have to be killed if we did. But Faster is aiming to be more than your average DVD action film in more ways than this. It is a cold brutal story of a man on a mission of honour and sworn vengeance that he can't switch off and it plays out in this hard unforgiving way before the power of redemption and forgiveness dawn on him and he is forced to search his own soul and make sacrifices of himself before he crosses the line and loses any sense of moral authority.While the end impression doesn't leave the powerful impact it quite could have this is an undeniably ambitious and surprising action thriller that delivers a lot more than it promises.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the second of two movies I watched with my movie theatreworking friend today The first was Tangled. I was partly hesitant to watch what I thought was going to be an exploitative revenge flick starring a former wrestler once known as The Rock. To my pleasant surprise it was a little more than that though there was the requisite shootings that earned this an Rrating though not a hard one like that for The Expendables last August. In the leading role Dwayne Johnson moves well and handles what dialogue he has adequately well. And costar Billy Bob Thornton does his usual fine turn as the abouttoretire cop coming after him. Although the story is handled seriously enough I had an MST3K moment when another cop played by Carla Gugino asks Haven't I seen this guy before? when looking at Johnson's surveillance tape and I replied back to the screen Yeah in Race to Witch Mountain! I have to admit here that I actually said Escape before my friend corrected me. And when Lost veteran Maggie Grace appeared on screen this same friend thought she was in SoninLaw with Pauly Shore possibly mistaking her for the role Gugino played there. I corrected him but I don't know if he got it By the way Ms. Grace seems here mostly for eye candy though she appearing in a black bikini is the closest to skin showing here. Another star from the TV show I just mentioned Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje has a great scene with Dwayne as a preacher who was previously part of the gang that had his brother killed asking for forgiveness and willing to forgive him as well. Not every subplot made sense or seemed necessary but it was a mostly enjoyably diverting 90 or so minutes that made me admire the way director George Tillman Jr.previously known for Soul Food and Men of Honorhandled the whole thing. So on that note Faster is worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "Faster is a very entertaining action film which made me have a good time of drama and violence despite its lack of narrative innovation.However coscreenwriters Tony and Joe Gayton took advantage of that lack of originality in order to build a solid tribute to the exploitation cinema which was pretty popular during the '70s. The main characters do not even have names and they are identified by their function in the story driver policeman murderer...there is no need to know more about them. However the Gayton bros. transcend that simplification by introducing contradictory and very interesting aspects to the characters making the movie to be much more than the simple thriller it could have been. To start with the driver is not rejoiced by the death of his enemies thanks to the solid and almost mute performance from Dwayne Johnson it is perfectly clear that the main character only fulfills with his duty in order to honor his dead brother's memory and that he does not find any pleasure in the revenge. He might not be a brilliant actor but Johnson has showed a good range in every type of movies from the comedy to the action and even though not every movie in which he is involved in is good he always shows aplomb and credibility with the characters he interprets.Billy Bob Thornton also brings a competent performance as a policeman who is in noir's best tradition corrupt drugaddict and alcoholic. But the attempts to redeem himself at his son's eyes feel sincere and what could have been a living clich becomes into a real person thanks to the screenplay and Thornton's sincere work. I also liked the work from Oliver JacksonCohen as the murderer because he can credibly express the turbulent emotions which are hidden under his character's apparent coldness. Besides his character looks like the typical British thug on the beginning but there are various interesting details in the way in which the character was written like his unusual past the reasons why he became into a hired murderer his warm relationship with the character Lily and the conversations he has with his shrink which make him to transcend that. And finally I think that Carla Gugino Jennifer Carpenter and Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje also bring credible performances.In conclusion I can recommend Faster as a very interesting action film with dynamic direction good performances and a well written screenplay.".

I'm British by the way so it's got nothing to do with the accent The hitman character is truly annoying and so is the beautiful Maggie Grace there kissing and ridiculous dialogue as well as background just takes away any realism that the film has.

Detective Cicero Carla Gugino is assigned for the case but sooner a veteran detective near retirement Billy Bob Thornton teams up with her.

	schema:headline " Not even nature can duplicate character not even in twins";
	schema:reviewBody "Psychology is a dubious science as it is but when a Hollywood screenwriter gets his hands on it anything even closely resembling fact is thrown out the window. In the mid1940s Freudian psychology reached the peak of its popularity and films such as Hitchcock's 'Spellbound 1945' and Lang's 'Secret Beyond the Door 1947' utilised their own versions of psychoanalysis to provide easy answers for their characters' delusions. Robert Siodmak's 'The Dark Mirror 1946' is no different in that we are offered a halfbaked pseudoscientific dissertation on why even identical twins can be anything but identical when it comes to personality traits. In fact screenwriter Nunnally Johnson who also wrote and directed 'The Three Faces of Eve 1957' actively pumps the familiar but questionable notion that twins respectively represent the good and evil sides of man. This duality is similar to that explored in the earlier versions of 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 192019311941' though the two sides of the human coin are here separated from their mutual shell and allowed to behave as independent entities.Olivia de Havilland excels in dual roles as Terry and Ruth Collins twin sisters who might just have pulled off the perfect crime even if only one knows it. When the sisters' shared boyfriend is murdered in cold blood two witnesses place one of the twins at the scene of the crime while three more provide a solid alibi for the other. The only problem is that nobody can tell the pair apart. A police detective Thomas Mitchell is torn apart by the case how can he charge either woman with murder if he can't decide which of the sisters is in fact a murderess? Only through Hollywood's good friend Dr. Freud can the true nature of the crime be exposed. The distinction between the good and insane twin is clearly drawn early in the film with de Havilland playing one sister Terry as a cocky dominator and the other Ruth as more softlyspoken with eyes always downcast and hands delicately clasped together. Clarifying the dual relationship is some convenient symbolism used in the film's climax Terry is dressed in black and Ruth in white.Convincing optical effects and the use of body doubles are employed successfully to create the illusion of two Olivia de Havillands. The actress does well as both characters perhaps channelling her dislike of sister Joan Fontaine to portray the snarling psychotic and homicidally jealous evil sister. Though they start out perfectly alike it doesn't take long for the two Collins sisters to develop distinct personalities in the eyes of the audience and Siodmak should quickly have dispensed with the obvious nametags either a necklace or a single letter pin added to ensure that the audience could follow who was who. Perhaps misguidedly the presence of twins is at first played largely for laughs with composer Dimitri Tiomkin keeping the atmosphere surprisingly light and fluffy. Fortunately however the mood darkens substantially in the film's second half as the hatred simmering slowly within the darker twin threatens to spill over into reality. Though the unlikely psychology behind 'The Dark Mirror' tests one's credulity at regular intervals the strong acting and unique storyline make this one worth seeking out.".

	schema:headline " There is Something About Twin Siblings";
	schema:reviewBody "One can possibly write a monograph or study regarding this subject the good and bad in humanity as shown by twins in movies. It runs the gamut in films like A STOLEN LIFE THE DARK MIRROR THE CORSICAN BROTHERS DEAD RINGER COBRA WOMAN even watered down in THE PRISONER OF ZENDA. In the last one the King is a drunkard while Rudolph Rassendyl is a brave resourceful type in the actual novel that is the sequel RUPERT OF HENZAU the King develops into a paranoid villain who loathes the distant cousin who rescued him. As for the others Bette Davis's good sister in A STOLEN LIFE watches her bad sister steal Glenn Ford from her. Douglas Fairbanks' wilder brother critically wounds his brother in a duel over a woman in THE CORSICAN BROTHERS. Maria Montez's good and bad sisters in COBRA WOMAN fight to the death for a royal crown. Davis good sister actually entraps herself killing the bad one in DEAD RINGER.THE DARK MIRROR has the same split between good and bad siblings but it makes a stab in fitful Freudian Hollywood fashion at psychoanalyzing the situation. A doctor has been murdered and the suspect is his fianc one Ruth Collins Olivia De Haviland. While Lt. Stevenson Thomas Mitchell is questioning Ruth and seemingly about to close a relatively simple homicide case neatly and quickly Ruth's identical twin sister Terry shows up. It turns out that one of the two sisters was seen by dozens that night and the other cannot produce an alibi. But the problem for Stevenson is that the one who was seen never said what her name or identity was it could have been either Ruth or Terry. Likewise the person who was last with the Victim could have been Ruth or Terry. As Mitchell later says to the psychiatrist Dr. Scott Elliot Lew Ayres unless he happens to grab the girl just after she commits the crime there is no way to identify the guilty sister from the innocent sister once they are both back in general circulation.Dr. Elliot is asked to examine both girls quietly. Mitchell and Elliot both are aware that this neat little alibi does not have to work permanently for the girls' advantage. You see the innocent one does know the guilty one did it and how long before the innocent one will crack or the guilty one will consider silencing the innocent one? Dr. Elliot studies the girls dates both and concludes Ruth is normal but Terry is psychotic and jealous of her sister. Now they know who is more likely to have been the guilty one and who the innocent one  but the innocent one still refuses to admit she is shielding the guilty one and the guilty one now seeing the innocent one as an impediment to her happiness with Dr. Elliot in the future is considering how to push the innocent one over the edge into suicide.The film as a mystery is fairly simplistic and it's resolution is too fast.

	onyx:emotionText "One can possibly write a monograph or study regarding this subject the good and bad in humanity as shown by twins in movies. It runs the gamut in films like A STOLEN LIFE THE DARK MIRROR THE CORSICAN BROTHERS DEAD RINGER COBRA WOMAN even watered down in THE PRISONER OF ZENDA. In the last one the King is a drunkard while Rudolph Rassendyl is a brave resourceful type in the actual novel that is the sequel RUPERT OF HENZAU the King develops into a paranoid villain who loathes the distant cousin who rescued him. As for the others Bette Davis's good sister in A STOLEN LIFE watches her bad sister steal Glenn Ford from her. Douglas Fairbanks' wilder brother critically wounds his brother in a duel over a woman in THE CORSICAN BROTHERS. Maria Montez's good and bad sisters in COBRA WOMAN fight to the death for a royal crown. Davis good sister actually entraps herself killing the bad one in DEAD RINGER.THE DARK MIRROR has the same split between good and bad siblings but it makes a stab in fitful Freudian Hollywood fashion at psychoanalyzing the situation. A doctor has been murdered and the suspect is his fianc one Ruth Collins Olivia De Haviland. While Lt. Stevenson Thomas Mitchell is questioning Ruth and seemingly about to close a relatively simple homicide case neatly and quickly Ruth's identical twin sister Terry shows up. It turns out that one of the two sisters was seen by dozens that night and the other cannot produce an alibi. But the problem for Stevenson is that the one who was seen never said what her name or identity was it could have been either Ruth or Terry. Likewise the person who was last with the Victim could have been Ruth or Terry. As Mitchell later says to the psychiatrist Dr. Scott Elliot Lew Ayres unless he happens to grab the girl just after she commits the crime there is no way to identify the guilty sister from the innocent sister once they are both back in general circulation.Dr. Elliot is asked to examine both girls quietly. Mitchell and Elliot both are aware that this neat little alibi does not have to work permanently for the girls' advantage. You see the innocent one does know the guilty one did it and how long before the innocent one will crack or the guilty one will consider silencing the innocent one? Dr. Elliot studies the girls dates both and concludes Ruth is normal but Terry is psychotic and jealous of her sister. Now they know who is more likely to have been the guilty one and who the innocent one  but the innocent one still refuses to admit she is shielding the guilty one and the guilty one now seeing the innocent one as an impediment to her happiness with Dr. Elliot in the future is considering how to push the innocent one over the edge into suicide.The film as a mystery is fairly simplistic and it's resolution is too fast. But De Haviland makes both sisters have really individual personalities that succeed as separate people. Ayres gives a decent performance trying to balance his professional detachment to his growing love and concern for Ruth. And Mitchell although supposedly a bumbler at first does demonstrate a crafty catandmouse technique with Terry at the conclusion of the film.";

The police and the psychiatrist have their work cut out...Straight out of the corner of postwar Hollywood that began to take fascination with mental illness The Dark Mirror triumphs more as a technical exercise than as anything resembling thought provoking analysis. The simplistic Freudian elements aside film is impressively mounted and performed by Siodmak and de Havilland respectively. Story follows the trajectory of a catandmouse game with the makers nicely putting us the viewers into the same struggle the authorities have in sussing out which sister is the damaged killer.Siodmak's The Spiral Staircase attention to detail and grasp of mood setting really lifts the piece to greater heights. Aided by the considerable photographic skills of Krasner The SetUp Siodmak creates a world of psychological disturbance a place aligned with suspense and symbolism. Right from the doozy of an opening scene to the denouement Siodmak manages to keep the contrivances to the rear of the play and let de Havilland and the visual textures be the prime focus.The effects work is very good with de Havilland having to quite often play off against herself. Sure in today's age of High Definition et al you don't have to stretch your viewing experience to see how the effects were done but why would you? Just enjoy de Havillland's riveting performances in the dual roles see also her excellence in The Snake Pit two years later her skillful little subtleties as she deftly plays out the respective psychological traits of sibling rivalry gone astray.Is it a gimmick movie? Well no not really it's honest about what it wants to achieve in terms of psychiatric observations and treatments.

	schema:reviewBody "The Dark Mirror is an excellent psychological thriller about murder jealousy suspects who are identical twins and a psychologist who helps the police to identify a murderer. The atmosphere of the piece is at times rather unsettling and intense but it's also intriguing and extremely enjoyable to watch.The 1940s was a period when there was a great deal of public awareness of psychoanalysis and Freudian psychology and so the methods used to identify the evil twin in this story would certainly have held a lot of interest and fascination for audiences at that time.An investigation into the murder of a well known doctor seems to start off well for police Lieutenant Stevenson Thomas Mitchell as he quickly has witnesses at his disposal who can positively identify the young woman who was seen coming out of the victim's apartment on the night of the murder. The woman in question works on a magazine stand in the medical building where the late doctor worked but Stevenson encounters a problem when she is able to provide compelling evidence that she was actually four miles away from the murder scene at the critical time.Later Stevenson discovers that the suspect is one of a pair of identical twins but then he confronts another problem as the two sisters are unwilling to cooperate and he is unable to make any further progress without any evidence to prove which one is the culprit. It's at this point that he calls in the assistance of Dr Scott Elliott Lew Ayres a psychologist whose speciality is research into the characteristics of identical twins.Dr Elliott carries out a number of tests involving inkblots word association and polygraphs from which he identifies which sister is capable of committing murder and he then works with Lieutenant Stevenson on a scheme to trap the evil twin into exposing her own guilt.Robert Siodmak's style of direction is impressive and very effective in building up the suspense. There are some passages where the mood becomes quite sinister and the masterful use of light and shadow enhances this atmosphere enormously. Examples of this are the opening sequence during which the camera surveys the contents of a dark room before discovering the murder victim and a scene involving the twins in which one sister is almost entirely engulfed in shadow.The techniques used to show both twins on screen simultaneously are totally convincing and Olivia De Havilland's performance in her dual role displays great subtlety and intelligence. The way she conveys the sisters' many similarities whilst also portraying their differences in an understated manner is very accomplished and best appreciated on repeat viewings. Thomas Mitchell is also entertaining as the competent unassuming and good humoured detective who is often bewildered by what he discovers.Fans of Final Analysis will notice some similarities with this movie however in a typical neonoir subversion of expectations in the 1992 film both identity swapping sisters are actually evil.The Dark Mirror is a stylish movie and the generally swift and natural manner in which the action unfolds contributes greatly to its overall appeal.".

It's driving the Chief Detective Thomas Mitchell nuts. Either Ruth was walking in Jefferson park while Terry was stabbing a swain to death  or the other way round. A psychologist who happens to specialize in twin research Lew Ayres is called into the case and manages to unravel it.The burden of the film falls on De Havilland and it's a heavy one. She doesn't only have to play two slightly different characters she has to play three because one of the two is covering up a psychotic personality. She does her best to pull off the psychotic monster when it emerges at the end but it's obviously a strain on her talent because she pops her eyes out and goes through more mental contortions than Humphrey Bogart's Captain Queeg on the witness stand.Olivia De Havilland is simply too nice a lady. She's no longer the spring chicken of the Errol Flynn movies of ten years earlier but she remains beautiful  and more than that delicate vulnerable winsome and edible. It would be a sin to think of her legs. In fact though she can be pretty bawdy. In a later interview she described some trouble that Errol Flynn was having with his tights during a kissing scene in Robin Hood. That's what being schooled in a convent will do to you.Thomas Mitchell is the exasperated cop Lew Ayres with a thin mustache is the psychologist who examines the twin sisters. Actually he shows them a couple of Rorschach ink blots and at least one of them is from the real Rorschach series and showing them in a movie today would be a justiciable offense. The murderous twin's answers are rather revealing too in a subtle way. Tainted without being obvious. The writer must have done his homework. I speak to you as your psychologist. That will be ten cents.It's always tricky to pull off a twin movie successfully. It involves a lot of clever work on the part of the visual effects team when the two identical characters appear on the screen at the same time. They've done a splendid job here.It must be said that without the twin angle there's nothing special about the movie. It's a routine B murder mystery. But with the talent exercised by the writer the director and especially De Havilland it's a neater job than you might expect.".

At Warner Brothers the pecking order was first Bette Davis and then Ida Lupino. It wasn't a question of settling for crumbs all Olivia got from Warner Brothers were the wife and girl friend of the hero mostly Errol Flynn. According to the Citadel film series book the Films of Olivia DeHavilland she wasn't even behind the other two actresses because Jack Warner couldn't see her in these parts.With a whole lot to prove and now free of Warner Brothers Olivia did this independent film for the short lived International Pictures before it merged with Universal. This is a player's delight twins one good and one evil. Her friend and friendly rival at Warner Brothers Bette Davis was doing a twin role in A Stolen Life the same year. Olivia was entering the high point of her career she would be nominated for three Best Actress nominations resulting in two Oscars in the next three years. The Dark Mirror proved to be quite the appetizer for what was coming up.A doctor in a medical building filled with doctors winds up a homicide victim and it turns out he's been dating the girl over at the news stand for some time. But when Thomas Mitchell as the assigned homicide cop investigates he discovers there are two twins who occasionally spell the other at the stand a kind of private joke only available to twins. One's got an alibi one's really circumstantially close to the scene of the crime but which is which.As Mitchell says he hates the thought of one of these women beating the rap. But as it turns out in that same medical building there is a psychiatrist played by Lew Ayres who's done research into twins. Ayres becomes a police consultant but he gets compromised himself by falling for whom he feels is the good Olivia.Not to take anything away from Olivia DeHavilland who did a marvelous job in both parts. She said that this was the most taxing role of her career especially the homicidal twin. But there are two problems. I don't think the law would have been that squeamish then both would have been arrested one is clearly covering for the other after the fact. A smart prosecutor would have convicted them but for the fact Lew Ayres's testimony would have been tainted in any trial by his involvement.Ayres is fine as well as the tweedy psychiatrist. The role is a dress rehearsal for the part of the doctor he played in 1948 opposite Jane Wyman in Johnny Belinda.DeHavilland does a great job but the story which interestingly enough got an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Story for the screen which I can't understand since it is too much to swallow.".

But when Thomas Mitchell as the assigned homicide cop investigates he discovers there are two twins who occasionally spell the other at the stand a kind of private joke only available to twins. One's got an alibi one's really circumstantially close to the scene of the crime but which is which.As Mitchell says he hates the thought of one of these women beating the rap. But as it turns out in that same medical building there is a psychiatrist played by Lew Ayres who's done research into twins. Ayres becomes a police consultant but he gets compromised himself by falling for whom he feels is the good Olivia.Not to take anything away from Olivia DeHavilland who did a marvelous job in both parts. She said that this was the most taxing role of her career especially the homicidal twin. But there are two problems. I don't think the law would have been that squeamish then both would have been arrested one is clearly covering for the other after the fact. A smart prosecutor would have convicted them but for the fact Lew Ayres's testimony would have been tainted in any trial by his involvement.Ayres is fine as well as the tweedy psychiatrist. The role is a dress rehearsal for the part of the doctor he played in 1948 opposite Jane Wyman in Johnny Belinda.DeHavilland does a great job but the story which interestingly enough got an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Story for the screen which I can't understand since it is too much to swallow.";

However the apparently simple investigation goes into a tailspin when it's revealed Collins is one half of identical twins. It must have been a daunting task as a performer to take on the roles of protagonist and antagonist in the same film yet Olivia De Havilland pulls it off to great conviction. Playing the parts of Terry a cunning and manipulative psychopath and Terry's twin Ruth a shy and more naive woman. By changing her mannerisms vocal tone and demeanour for both roles De Havilland showed to spectacular range of her acting ability.Although the acting on show by De Havilland and others in The Dark Mirror was top standard the same cannot be said for the narrative. It starts off well with the dilemma of identical twins causing The Dark Mirror to become a gripping mysterious piece along with the wise cracking dialogue between Detective Stevenson and Terry adding to the film's aura. Yet when the narrative shifts from thriller to dark romance with the introduction of Doctor Elliot a man who falls for Ruth yet bitters Terry into jealously The Dark Mirror becomes tedious due to its predictability. Although the acting throughout the romantic portion of the narrative makes for emotional involvement it also makes the actions of Terry Ruth and Doctor Elliot predictable resulting in being able to know the narrative's outcome before its reached.On a lighter note The Dark Mirror has a good amount of comic relief served up by Thomas Mitchell as Detective Stevenson whose wise cracks create breathing space from the drama and earlier on has great chemistry with De Havilland as her more sinister character. Unfortunately this tense relationship is under developed due to relatively small role Mitchell plays here. The comic relief also comes in the revelation of Collins being an identical twin particularly for the witnesses who are dazed by this fact resulting in a few laughs on the audience's part.Although story wise The Dark Mirror is not the most superb of films it does not get in the way of the fine acting on display which for a time entices us into the narrative.".

	schema:headline " One of these twins is not like the other.";
	schema:reviewBody "Olivia de Havilland gives one of her greatest performances in a dual role as twin sisters one of them a psychopathic murderess. At first glance these two ladies who alternate working at a newspaper stand one pretending to be the other seem so much alike so at first her performance is difficult to make heads or tails of which character she is playing. But everything is not as it seems and when detective Thomas Mitchell her costar from Gone With the Wind and psychiatrist Lew Ayres get involved it will only be a matter of time before the psycho is exposed. In the meantime the innocent one shows signs of mental illness herself and a clever scheme ends up exposing the truth resulting in a truly shocking ending.DeHavilland is one of those actresses who as she aged became grander and grander bringing in qualities of Melanie Wilkes into many of her performances with breathy ladylike qualities that made her sometimes too good to be true. But this performance is one exception even though the manners and politeness are still there qualities of the butterfly who spits acid are slowly revealed inside both characters. In a sense this is close to her truly only other performance of this nature the evil cousin in Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte who seemed all cream and sugar on the outside but was filled with venom when all was said and done.The slow road to revealing the truth about both personalities is worth the wait the examinations of Ayres' psychiatrist revealing the neurotic nature of one and psychotic manners of the other. Then you end up confused for a bit not knowing which one is whom as the trail leads to the end of the road for one and heartbreak for the other. The result is pleasantly perplexing concluding in a manner that is never melodramatic in spite of its tragic circumstances. Watching the guilty party slowly being trapped and revealed will have you on the edge of your seat.While the analogy of what twins are supposedly like mirror images the same in all but mentality is implausible this does reveal some pondering ideas of the intensity of their relationships. This was one of several melodramas about twins released during this time the others being the camp Cobra Woman with Maria Montez and the Bette Davis melodrama A Stolen Life all about one good sister and one bad but connected with the other so tightly that the result could only be destruction for one and a difficult journey for the other.

	onyx:emotionText "Olivia de Havilland gives one of her greatest performances in a dual role as twin sisters one of them a psychopathic murderess. At first glance these two ladies who alternate working at a newspaper stand one pretending to be the other seem so much alike so at first her performance is difficult to make heads or tails of which character she is playing. But everything is not as it seems and when detective Thomas Mitchell her costar from Gone With the Wind and psychiatrist Lew Ayres get involved it will only be a matter of time before the psycho is exposed. In the meantime the innocent one shows signs of mental illness herself and a clever scheme ends up exposing the truth resulting in a truly shocking ending.DeHavilland is one of those actresses who as she aged became grander and grander bringing in qualities of Melanie Wilkes into many of her performances with breathy ladylike qualities that made her sometimes too good to be true. But this performance is one exception even though the manners and politeness are still there qualities of the butterfly who spits acid are slowly revealed inside both characters. In a sense this is close to her truly only other performance of this nature the evil cousin in Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte who seemed all cream and sugar on the outside but was filled with venom when all was said and done.The slow road to revealing the truth about both personalities is worth the wait the examinations of Ayres' psychiatrist revealing the neurotic nature of one and psychotic manners of the other. Then you end up confused for a bit not knowing which one is whom as the trail leads to the end of the road for one and heartbreak for the other. The result is pleasantly perplexing concluding in a manner that is never melodramatic in spite of its tragic circumstances. Watching the guilty party slowly being trapped and revealed will have you on the edge of your seat.While the analogy of what twins are supposedly like mirror images the same in all but mentality is implausible this does reveal some pondering ideas of the intensity of their relationships. This was one of several melodramas about twins released during this time the others being the camp Cobra Woman with Maria Montez and the Bette Davis melodrama A Stolen Life all about one good sister and one bad but connected with the other so tightly that the result could only be destruction for one and a difficult journey for the other. Daytime soaps have also dealt with the same issue Days of Our Lives' Marlena and Sam All My Children's Stuart and Adam etc so obviously films like this made some impression on the writers who created those characters.";

	schema:reviewBody "It will take you awhile to get to Lew Ayres as a character though. The movie opens on the body of a murdered man in a dark room. At first it looks as though this is going to be a police procedural with Lt. Stevenson Thomas Mitchell in the lead as he methodically finds out who last saw the dead man alive who the murdered man was with etc. Suspect number one is whittled down to a woman who runs a magazine stand in the office building where the dead doc worked. She is hauled in for questioning but she has an ironclad alibi that includes a concert and a walk in the park both miles from the scene of the crime and she has witnesses that have no reason to lie for her. The good lieutenant is just about at his wit's ends when he discovers his suspect has an identical twin. Olivia DeHaviland as Terry and Ruth Collins. So the lieutenant quips that one is guilty of murder the other obstruction of justice unless they fess up. Terry quips back which are you charging with which crime? The twins have a lawyer and are armed with the fact that you can't haul multiple people in for the same crime when you know one is innocent and just see how it shakes out.At this point Thomas Mitchell fades into the background and the film becomes a psychological drama with Lew Ayres becoming the male lead. Ayres plays Dr. Scott Elliott initially called in as a witness for the police but when the Lieutenant discovers Dr. Elliott has spent his career studying twins he proposes that he make friends with the Collins sisters offer to use them in a study and see if he can determine which is the murderer through a psychological profile.This is the part I find hard to swallow. The Collins twins have all their ducks in a row legally and mum is the word when it comes to talking to the police and yet they both agree to be studied by a doctor specializing in twin psychology both yapping their brains out about their individual thought processes all based on the fact that the good doctor SAYS he is not working for the police? I'll let you watch and see how this all shakes out.I will say that Olivia DeHaviland like Joan Crawford was much better at choosing roles that showed off her acting talent than her original studio  in her case Warner Bros. From 1935 until she freed herself from WB she was pigeonholed as a light comedienne or the love interest of Errol Flynn in whatever swashbuckler he happened to be appearing. That doesn't mean she wasn't entertaining in those roles I'm just saying she was capable of so much more. This film is a seldom seen example of DeHaviland's excellent skill. You actually see the two distinct personalities of the twins emerging as Olivia has several conversations with her twin that only exists as a result of editing and trick photography.Very much worth your time and since it is hard to find any other way I have to highly recommend the recent pressed release by Olive Films. I don't like to plug individual commercial products but I know of no other way to see this fine piece of writing and acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a review written by a specialist on the Uboat warfareFirst off I am pleased to say my worst fears were not realized. This movie is not a retelling of the capture of the Enigma machine from U110 with Americans substituted for British. The only thing the historical incident and the movie have in common is that both include an Enigma machine and a Uboat.The basic premise of the movie is this It is spring 1942. Although not stated explicitly in the movie this coincides with the implementation of the 4rotor Enigma machine and the subsequent intelligence blackout which proved quite inconvenient for the Allies. Allied intelligence learns that a crippled Uboat is awaiting a rendezvous with a supply submarine. An American World War I Sclass submarine and its crew are disguised to resemble that supply submarine with the goal of boarding the Uboat and seizing the Enigma. Naturally the operation does not go as smoothly as predicted. The American boarding party ends up trapped on the Uboat and must figure out how to get home with their prize.The special effects including sound effects are good and there are lots of satisfying explosions and interesting underwater camera views. The plot is a bit predictable and seems to owe a lot to many previous submarine movies including Das Boot. There are a few technical issues that purists will notice for example American Sboats were not actually equipped with radar an awful lot of bullets were sprayed around the interior of the Uboat without appearing to damage anything vital and the plan to open the torpedo tubes at a depth of 200 meters seemed illadvised to say the least.One scene was disturbing however. Early in the film the Uboat comes upon a lifeboat full of British sailors. The Uboat commander orders his gunner to kill them all because The Fhrer has ordered us not to pick up survivors. It is disappointing to see the myth of Uboats executing occupants of lifeboats perpetuated yet again. The truth about the Laconia order is it did forbid picking up survivors but did not specify that they be shot simply that they not be rescued or aided as well as the only case on record in World War II in which a Uboat purposely fired on survivors in the water.In general this is a good action film. It's no Das Boot but then I knew it wasn't going to be. For one thing it lacks the emotional impact and suspense of Das Boot also the grim wartime mood that pervaded Das Boot is absent from this movie. In fact for U571 the World War II setting seems almost incidental as the plot could be adjusted easily to fit any other twentieth century war real or fictional involving submarines.In sum this is not really a World War II movie. It's a submarine movie with nonstop action and plenty of explosions.29 April 2000 One more thing which needs to be mentioned. In an interview in the 23 April Washington Post the director Jonathan Mostow states that the movie Das Boot was based on a lie because ... it pretended that the captains and crews were submariners first and only incidentally Nazis. They were dedicated Nazis they had to be to fight that hard.As anyone familiar with Uboat history knows this is nonsense. It is well known that the Uboat arm was the least political of any of the German military branches in World War II. While some Uboat men were indeed confirmed Nazis many were not. Men fight hard in every war not for reasons of ideology but for reasons of personal survival and out of a sense of duty and obligation to their group or unit. Mostow's opinion on this particular topic is just that  an opinion apparently not founded on any knowledge of Uboat history or military psychology".

Of course a handfull american sailors who even cant read the german instruments of the different machines in U571 probably manage to get away with the submarine immediately. After being heavily bombed by a german destroyer they are even able to reach an absolutely incredible depth. But not enough of course they send the destroyer to the bottom with only one coincidentally their last torpedo. Not only the fact that this heroic voyage is absolutely implausible and ridiculous makes U571 the worst movie Ive ever seen. Also the story that the Americans found and decoded the Enigma is just a falsification of history. Of course America did a lot for ending the nazityranny but in this case it was the achievement of english sailors and scientists. Im really not a german nationalist and there were a lot of good and even great movies about WWII  e.g. Saving Private Ryan but U571 isnt.

	schema:reviewBody "With all of the new advances in sound and visual technology there was ample scope for a truly authentic modern American remake of the classic 'submarine movie' of the 1950's and 60's. And heaven knows it doesn't require much study to realise that Yank submariners played a huge part in the war. The Pacific war that is  not the Atlantic. There were some tremendous daringdo escapades with memorable victories. In fact I understand that the American fleet was the most successful submarine fleet of the war with also fewer casualties per unit vessel. They accounted for over half of all Japanese maritime losses.Moviemakers don't need to invent heroes and scenarios then they are already spoilt for choice. So why this? Why a completely fictitious movie not only about an event that didn't happen but a travesty of true naval history? I believe it is generally agreed that the 'enigma' capture was a British success. The Yanks weren't even there. Moreover when Britain began supplying the USA with intelligence intercepts garnered from its application they were ignored by their naval highcommand with appalling consequences to coastal shipping. But then Hollywood's airbrushing out of American mistakes and British successes is almost as inevitable as the typecasting of Germans as dumb robotic bigots. It's not something to take personally. Though after all this time it does get a bit tiresome.Audiovisually at least the movie was right on the money especially if you have a decent home cinema. Bangs and clangs come over solid and visceral. There was clever though rather obvious use of CGI. Little issues of personal tension didn't harm the rather shallow Alistair Mclean style plot and gave a little substance to its equally shallow characters. Unfortunately all the old clichs were stowed aboard too conflict between skipper and first officer 'Run Silent Run Deep' 'Up Periscope' 'Crimson Tide' catandmouse conflict with a destroyer 'The Enemy Below' 'Das Boot' diving below the vessel's testdepth Yawn  'Das Boot' 'The Enemy Below' 'Ice Station Zebra' 'Crimson Tide' and so on.And there simply isn't enough space to enumerate all of the tacticaltechnical errors that could have been avoided with just a little research.Like so many Hollywood offerings today  'Titanic' 'Pearl Harbour' 'Gladiator'  a wonderful opportunity was abandoned in favour of crass spectacle. Instead we got a movie that shamefully ignored all of the American submariners' sterling accomplishments  true episodes at least as remarkable as those depicted here  in favour of wellengineered implausible and frankly misleading pap.Don't worry about snubbing us Brits. We're thickskinned and used to it. But if I were a Yank instead I would regard this movie as an act of treason so shamefully does it disavow their true nautical heroes.It's a pity the director didn't just update 'Torpedo Run'.".

As for its mindless entertainment value if you have only ever seen one u  boat movie you will essentially have seen U571 because it goes to great pains not to miss any clich in the book the first third in particular is an almost exact copy of Das Boot.What really angers me about U571 though apart from it being a really bad movie is the premeditated way it tries to remanufacture history. Without going into details the actual Enigma machine was relatively well known the difficult bit was cracking the code  which was brilliantly accomplished by the British after some spadework from the Poles. Next there is the cheap attempt to whitewash racial segregation in the US by throwing in a black sailor and then putting the onus on the Germans by showing a German sailor being shocked at seeing a black person  maybe it was the historical inaccuracy he was astounded by. Even worse the film promotes an almost fascist type of ideology namely the leader principle mindless submission to authority the objective must be achieved regardless of the cost of human life enemy or comrade. So ironically U571 with reversed sides and minus the special effects could pass for a German propaganda movie of that era.".

Stormtroopers in every sense... 5 Why didnt the German captain do more to damage the engine while he had the chance? 6 Why didn't more Germans fight back?The movie itself is a very straightforward WWII adventure action flick tense and fastpaced although the 'being a hard decision maker' subtext was both heavy handed and unnecessary. Also there was some rich manipulation prior to the boarding. The makers thought 'hmmmm not too heroic sneaking on board a uboat and then murdering the crew.... we'd better make the Germans look evil by executing a load of adrift Allied seamen'. This little piece stuck out like a sore German thumb. Perhaps those who wrote and directed this should acknowledge the current wisdom that war creates few if any real heroes.

The U571 was never captured by Americans and was sunk with all hands off the coast of Ireland by British aircraft so I hope nobody gets his history from this. The Germans were furthermore quite humane when treating survivors in the sea and while they could not take them on board they rarely shot them all or deliberately killed them. The German navy commander Karl Dnitz was not found guilty of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials. In fact in 1942 the captain of U156 tried to rescue survivors from a sunken British ship after radioing the allies only to be attacked by American bombers which killed many of the survivors on the deck of the Uboat and forced it to dive which killed the rest. The allies often killed German sailors who survived sunken U boats or left them to die even when they could have saved them. This film is also short on realism. The German movie Das Boot was criticized by former Uboat sailors for its portrayal of depth charges being too close to the Uboat and not sinking it. Well this movie had the depth charges a lot closer the hull shaking like crazy yet no rupture or major leaks occur. Depth charges don't have to hit the craft they're designed to cause a crack or dent in the hull and water pressure does the rest. Machine guns that fired from a German destroyer were enough to compromise the hull's integrity but the boat still dives beyond its accepted limit after all that with no problems. The ability of a handful of men to operate a damaged foreign Uboat to achieve all these deeds and still survive to tell the tale is about as fantastic and unrealistic as you can get. It's a propaganda film with all its cheesy music of pure good us versus pure evil them and a pretty unconvincing one.".

Some scenes were so blatantly exposition and predictable to boot. Take for example a scene where a character explains how a submarine will implode when it goes too deep. Well that's a no brainer. He takes an egg yes eggs are so common in an officer's barracks and it's rather obvious that it's going to be crushed for dramatic effect. The sailors sit enthralled as if they didn't know of such things as going too deep is a bad thing. And as he predictably crushes the egg one character jumps in fright. They were supposed to feel tension but I certainly wasn't feeling any. It was then also plainly obvious that the crew themselves would be put in such peril later on... and sure enough they were. This was by no means an isolated incident.The style of the movie was also unsatisfying. An early scene at a dock just looked like it had been constructed on a soundstage. And when on the submarine it was always felt too clean and brightly lit... I would expect a more gritty atmosphere. The movie's feel and ambience was never quite involving enough.Because of my complete lack of history knowledge I didn't know what happened in the real events relating to this film. I didn't even know what happened in this film. So I can't debate the morals of whether it was accurate or not.

Who can possibly believe that a crew who had never visited such subs before could handle it with such precision and not only solve problems that the German crew could not solve but also destroy one German sub and one destroyer?

Why are the persons in this movie only boring and annoying? Why was this movie ever made?At least I didn't feel anything for the American crew.

A Parisian man who is obsessed with Turner's music befriends him and attempts to save Turner from himself. Although for Dale the damage is already done his poignant relationship with the man and his young daughter rekindles his spirit and his music as the end draws near.";

	schema:reviewBody "I never write or read these comments because I don't care much what others think of a movie and I sure as heck can't stand reading a pointless review by someone pretending to be the NY Times movie critic using words like iconoclastic and otherwise taxing their thesaurus.  But being a musician and avid fan myself I felt I owed this to Dexter Gordon an excellent musician whose work I would have said oeuvre if I was pretentious but I say what I mean and I don't need to impress you to make me feel better was nothing short of legendary.  Yes Dexter Gordon is not an actor but he did a good job and apparently the folks who hand out the Oscars thought the same not that I would necessarily use them as a barometer mind you but they do pick more winners than losers.  Although Dexter did spend about 15 years onoff in Paris this story is NOT autobiographical but the storyline of dealing with addictions mental pain and physical suffering while honing a great talent can be applied to the lives of many jazz greats like Charlie Parker Lester Young  Bud Powell just to name a few.  It's a dark movie indeed but the life of a musician can be very dark.  This movie shows how 2 people can work together to overcome their fears regrets and troubles and how they interact with the various people and situations in their lives a true character study revolving around music.  The movie is actually more about Francois' character than Dexter's as it's seen from his point of view. It's about the frailty of the human soul and it's about compassion for supreme artistry.  Most importantly regardless of your impression of the movie you get to see some real legends perform some wonderful jazz.  Yes Dexter Gordon was certainly beyond his prime and you will hear a few clunkers and pitch variance but you will appreciate his talent nonetheless if you understand or enjoy jazz music at all.  If you want to hear him really shine go listen to his music from the late 40's  also the 60's during his first comeback Dexter had 3 great comebacks  and they say Sinatra was a genius at reinvention.  That will give you a true sampling of his talent before he got old and started losing his wind.  Even though he didn't play to perfection he still played damn well in this movie and you can hear the experience in his phrasing and choice of notes  for instance at the very end of Body  Soul where he formerly played a very long ending like a virtuoso in an earlier recording something you probably expect from someone like Kenny G who plays about 40 notes where only 10 fit comfortably Dexter now plays a single beautifullyplaced note.  That one single note blew me away!  You have to understand and appreciate the fact that most players and most people say way too much with their music or words when a carefully placed note or word can say volumes with its understatement like a single picture with no caption.  To play that one note in that one spot was pure genius.  Bob James has been known to do the same  less is more sometimes.  Francois Cluzet does a heckuva job as protector and friend and the cameo by Martin Scorsese is priceless.  The ending always leaves me wanting more and that's the mark of an excellent movie  one so good you don't want it to end you want to be within the movie yourself and you feel you're a part of it.  The only reason I gave this a 9 instead of 10 was because it's not a great classic movie like Casablanca or The Godfather but it touched me as much or more than those movies ever had.  But this wasn't meant to be a piece of cinematic history and achievement it is what it is a period film about life of a jazz legend and in that respect it does everything possible and them some.  This movie deserves your respect your time and your admiration of a great jazz saxophonist Dexter Gordon and kudos to all the musicians involved especially Herbie Hancock.  Actress Lonette McKee does an excellent job on the vocals as well.  It also gives you a good feel of a real urban jazz club in the early 60's and how life was for these jazz legends.  If you get hooked on this stuff you'll never listen to anything else as it will never measure up but jazz is very cerebral and it takes someone with a passion for aesthetics to appreciate it.  Chess is great too but you don't see many kids playing Chessmaster on their computers.  This movie is an acquired taste and an excellent one at that.  Thanks for the memories Dexter.".

But being a musician and avid fan myself I felt I owed this to Dexter Gordon an excellent musician whose work I would have said oeuvre if I was pretentious but I say what I mean and I don't need to impress you to make me feel better was nothing short of legendary.  Yes Dexter Gordon is not an actor but he did a good job and apparently the folks who hand out the Oscars thought the same not that I would necessarily use them as a barometer mind you but they do pick more winners than losers.  Although Dexter did spend about 15 years onoff in Paris this story is NOT autobiographical but the storyline of dealing with addictions mental pain and physical suffering while honing a great talent can be applied to the lives of many jazz greats like Charlie Parker Lester Young  Bud Powell just to name a few.  It's a dark movie indeed but the life of a musician can be very dark.  This movie shows how 2 people can work together to overcome their fears regrets and troubles and how they interact with the various people and situations in their lives a true character study revolving around music.  The movie is actually more about Francois' character than Dexter's as it's seen from his point of view. It's about the frailty of the human soul and it's about compassion for supreme artistry.  Most importantly regardless of your impression of the movie you get to see some real legends perform some wonderful jazz.  Yes Dexter Gordon was certainly beyond his prime and you will hear a few clunkers and pitch variance but you will appreciate his talent nonetheless if you understand or enjoy jazz music at all.  If you want to hear him really shine go listen to his music from the late 40's  also the 60's during his first comeback Dexter had 3 great comebacks  and they say Sinatra was a genius at reinvention.  That will give you a true sampling of his talent before he got old and started losing his wind.  Even though he didn't play to perfection he still played damn well in this movie and you can hear the experience in his phrasing and choice of notes  for instance at the very end of Body  Soul where he formerly played a very long ending like a virtuoso in an earlier recording something you probably expect from someone like Kenny G who plays about 40 notes where only 10 fit comfortably Dexter now plays a single beautifullyplaced note.  That one single note blew me away!  You have to understand and appreciate the fact that most players and most people say way too much with their music or words when a carefully placed note or word can say volumes with its understatement like a single picture with no caption.  To play that one note in that one spot was pure genius.  Bob James has been known to do the same  less is more sometimes.  Francois Cluzet does a heckuva job as protector and friend and the cameo by Martin Scorsese is priceless.  The ending always leaves me wanting more and that's the mark of an excellent movie  one so good you don't want it to end you want to be within the movie yourself and you feel you're a part of it.  The only reason I gave this a 9 instead of 10 was because it's not a great classic movie like Casablanca or The Godfather but it touched me as much or more than those movies ever had.  But this wasn't meant to be a piece of cinematic history and achievement it is what it is a period film about life of a jazz legend and in that respect it does everything possible and them some.  This movie deserves your respect your time and your admiration of a great jazz saxophonist Dexter Gordon and kudos to all the musicians involved especially Herbie Hancock.  Actress Lonette McKee does an excellent job on the vocals as well.  It also gives you a good feel of a real urban jazz club in the early 60's and how life was for these jazz legends.  If you get hooked on this stuff you'll never listen to anything else as it will never measure up but jazz is very cerebral and it takes someone with a passion for aesthetics to appreciate it.  Chess is great too but you don't see many kids playing Chessmaster on their computers.  This movie is an acquired taste and an excellent one at that.  Thanks for the memories Dexter.";

The plot is simple and transparent but digs deep into the soul of a viewer who yields himself up to the movie whether he likes jazz or not. I highly recommend this movie that shows the ups and downs of life in several aspects but is really a tribute not merely to jazz musicians but actually to the beauty of life that is found in personal experience and more importantly in inspiring works of art. The director Bertrand Tavernier is French and has made many movies on a wide variety of subjects. This film is almost all in English but his French films are well worth watching even if you have issues with subtitles. This film made me cry and other of his films have similarly moved me. I hope readers will see this film and perhaps venture to watch some other films by director Tavernier. A thing of beauty is a joy forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Round Midnight 1986If you love jazz and especially if you love bebop and the 1940s and 50s music carried on by the real Dexter Gordon who stars here you ought to like this movie a lot. Or at least like and love the music.And the music is great with Herbie Hancock taking the Oscar that year for original score. Gordon is excellent too playing the fictional character Dale Turner not so different from his real life as Gordon lived in Paris for years because the jazz scene was still alive there for him. The movie is based on a book loosely based on two earlier jazzmen however the great and troubled Bud Powell who played piano and of course the legendary Lester Young who played like Dale Turner the tenor sax.And so do I sort of. I love this stuff the music and even the lore a bit the individuals that make up that fifty years or so of classic jazz.But the music is not entirely the movie. As a plot a series of meaningful events and conversations this is meandering which can be wonderful in a better film and sometimes poorly acted and poorly written. It's full of stupid clichs frankly. And in fact it seems like what it probably is an outsider's rosyeyed vision of the American jazz scene as it was transplanted in Paris. It's filled with inevitable smoky rooms quirky characters tough but marginalized woman alcoholic men and dark nights. I'm sure that's accurate in the outline but it comes off as naive and prepackaged. Add the final element that the music is played for a bunch of White Europeans who really love it but don't actually get it sorry to say the way it was gotten here in America or was back in the day. It all rings false. Increasingly.I'd love to know what other insider jazz people think of this portrayal. Watching the Ken Burns documentary of jazz series with all the clips and comments gives another kind of false view aggrandizing as it is but is has all the elements of truth built in to know something of the honesty and difficulty of the scene in the States. Director and writer Bertrand Tavernier is trying something noble and probably coming from a love of jazz but it's almost unwatchable as a movie.In fact it's almost insulting with all the clichsthe troubled French man who loves it all in a wideeyed way and is supposed to show a rare empathy for the poor unappreciated Americans at the top. And that's the core of the movie. He says more than once in different ways Your music changed my life. Yeah yeah of course! That's still not going to fill two hours on the screen.Take these comments with some saltthe movie got lots of nominations for awards. And Dexter Gordon is terrific in his acting if not always his somewhat stiff playing which is a kind of revelation. And it might be enjoyable for the lack of glitz here for all the quiet a.k.a. boring for some conversations. You'll get the feel in the first twenty minutes. And love the music.

	schema:headline " A tribute to a by gone music film and musician in ROUND MIDNIGHT!";
	schema:reviewBody "'Round Midnight the song is a jazz standard by pianist Thelonious Monk. It is thought that Monk originally composed the song sometime between 1940 and 1941. However Harry Colomby claims that Monk may have written an early version around 1936 at the age of 19 with the appropriate title of Grand Finale. 'Round Midnight is the mostrecorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician. On the website allmusic.com it is listed on over 1000 separate albums.The FILM 'Round Midnight was inspired by the lives of reallife jazzmen Bud Powell and Lester Young combined into the character of tenor sax player Dale Turner played by Dexter Gordon. The character of Francis Borler a Parisian man obsessed with Turner's music who befriends him is based on Francis Paudras who wrote Dance of the infidels a portrait of Bud Powell about his friendship with Powell.It is director Bertrand Tavernier's audiovisual lament for the impending death of jazz.In 'Round Midnight reallife jazz legend Dexter Gordon brilliantly portrays Dale Turner a musician slowly losing the battle with alcoholism estranged from his family and hanging on by a thread in the 1950's New York jazz world. Turner gets an offer to play in Paris where like many other black American musicians at the time he enjoys a respect for his humanity that is not based upon the color of his skin. There he meets an admirer who befriends him and tries to save Turner from himself. Although for Dale the damage is already done his poignant relationship with the man and his young daughter rekindles his spirit and his music as the end draws near.Considered one of the world's greatest tenor saxophonists jazz legend Dexter Gordon 19231990 was once quoted as saying Jazz to me is a living music. It's a music that since its beginning has expressed the feelings the dreams hopes of the people. Gordon Dexter's height was 6 feet 6 inches and his nickname was Long Tall Dexter and because he was so large so was his sound. He was known for his tendency to play behind the beat. Growing up his doctorfather introduced him to his patients Duke Ellington  Lionel Hampton. Dexter joined Lionel Hampton's band in 1940 and then went on to play for Louis Armstrong Fletcher Henderson Billy Eckstine and Lester Young. During the late 1950s he spent time in and out of jail and in the early 1960s recorded some landmark albums for Blue Note Records before moving to Paris for 15 years. Gordon found Europe in the 1960s a much easier place to live saying that he experienced less racism and greater respect for jazz musicians. Upon his return to the states in the 1970's he was rediscovered and claimed a genius. Near the end of his life he turned actor and made the film ROUND MIDNIGHT that captured some of the similarities of his life story. He was Oscar nominated for the role. Gordon died of kidney failure on April 25 1990 at age 67. He was voted musician of the year by Down Beat magazine in 1978 and 1980 and in the latter year was inducted into Down Beat's Jazz Hall of Fame.Back in 1986 I managed a small art theater in Dayton Ohio and we played this film ROUND MIDNIGHT. That's when I first discovered this amazing slice of life film that took me to a world I had only heard of. And this too is what film preservation is about sharing the past of others So sit back and enjoy this tribute to a by gone music film and musician in ROUND MIDNIGHT!".

	schema:reviewBody "What the previous reviewer failed to mention is that this great movie is about BUD POWELL's life after he moved to France in 1959 due to his continuing health and mental problems. Powell next to Monk was the greatest jazz pianist in history and is portrayed perfectly by tenor sax great Dexter Gordon. By the end of the film I was left wondering what could have been for Powell. How much more of a brilliant career could we have seen ? Miles Davis always claimed that the electroshock treatments that Powell received in the 1950s during his various stints in mental sanitariums robbed the great pianist of his creativity and musical genius. Whatever the case Powell joined the long list of sad endings to great great jazz careers. Charlie Parker Brownie Lee Morgan Eric Dolphy  the streak of tragedy and greatness cut short runs like a bright orange thread throughout the history of this fine music.If you are a jazz fan this movie truly is required viewing. If you are music fan I suggest you give it a try. A moving piece.".

Director Tavernier is worshiping at the temple of the mightiest that have ever played and his love of the craft the milieu the joy and presence of Jazz seeps through every aspect of this truly dreamy film that drifts along on a thin plot that is still surprisingly and rewardingly rich in characterization.Dexter Gordon does not act but rather plays the alcoholic centerpiece Dale Turner without guile or any sort of oafish pretense that a real actor would bring to the character. He is merely there playing himself. His raspy tenor voice and sax both gifts us with a veracity that draws us to him and to the greatness of his art that is a difficult master off the stage.Dale's guardian angel throughout is Francis a dedicated deeply ardent fan who is desperate to steer Dale away from selfdestruction a common trait amount many musicians especially at the time Miles Davis Stan Getz John Coltrane and of course Charlie Parker. Gordon himself suffered terribly from heroin addiction in the '50s. Francis in a way invites Dale into the perfunctory world of family of some normalcy and this centers Dale and brings him around again to his true love Jazz.This is all rather a distraction from the music which is simply extraordinary. Two CDsa soundtrack and music from the movie which Dexter Gordon released separatelyhave been released through the years. Both are easy essentials to a Jazz lovers' collection. Indeed if you do not love jazz I am afraid this movie will miss the mark completely for you.Many greats are also in this movie including Herbie Hancock and Bobby Hutcherson and a host of other jazz lights who are mostly window dressing but they all contribute to the wonderful soundtrack.If you enjoy the art of jazz this movie is absolutely essential to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know how anyone could rave about this film. I thought it was excruciatingly long slow and very very boring. I gave it two stars out of ten.I must say that Dexter Gordon is one of my least favorite players of his generation and what fame he was able to garner probably comes more to do with his having outlived the rest of his contemporaries than it does with his musical accomplishments but to focus so much attention on him and to have to listen to him hoarsely whisper or mumble his lines for over two hours was torture. And here was yet another example of Ray or Walk the Line syndrome  a biopic about a onetime talent who had become a derelict begging for drinks. Why are we supposed to find this kind of behavior interesting or entertaining? I was not touched and found it impossible to care about what happened to his character.I thought the music was very disappointing and mostly because of Dexter Gordon. It seemed like he was holding everyone else back. He was appearing alongside a bunch of other guys all known hotshots who all looked like they came to play and Gordon could barely squawk out a few notes. In general all the music was too slow it barely held together and it was pretty much lifeless and dull. I was so disappointed especially after the buildup this film got. I don't see how anyone with even the most cursory and superficial interest in jazz can call the music in this film great jazz.I don't know what kind of a fetish or obsession this director had with jazz but I thought all of the discussion on screen about the music sounded completely sophomoric and pretentious. It also bugged me greatly to hear Dexter Gordon's character speaking of the evolution of advanced harmony and some of the players who helped usher it forward with new technical and theoretical innovations and placing himself in the time line alongside the likes of Basie Charlie Parker etc. Of course this was not Dexter Gordon talking but his character but it was irksome for me to hear Gordon who is a second class jazz man talk like he was the Son of God or something.The story line was tedious what little plot that there was. Why this Francis character would ever get so worked up over the Dale Turner character didn't wash for me. Okay if this was about the reallife relations between Bud Powell and Francis Paudras I could see why he'd basically give his life over to help the guy but from what was shown in this film it landed like a lead turkey. I fault the director and also the whomever it was that made the terrible casting decision to use Dexter Gordon who at 63 was way too old for the part. Powell would have been 34 Lester Young would have been 50 in 1959. Gordon seemed too physically challenged and barely able to speak so that it was painful to have to sit through his performance. Watching Gordon was like watching an old dog trying to get up the stairs.In a perverse irony seeing Martin Scorcese on screen as the oily manager of Dale Turner was strangely humorous.For a film that is supposed to be anthemic and give a definitive view into the jazz world 'Round Midnight misses the beat.".

Gordon's performance is as good as any great character actor. The supporting cast is also excellent.The story is told in this really impressionistic and laid back way. It feels as though it takes its cue from the quality of hard bop jazz and the mindset of the main character. I don't want to spoil the ending but its beautifully restrained. You know what is coming and you figure out how it the end ultimately resolves but the filmmaker doesn't hit you on the head with the precise details of how.My only criticism is that the street sets looked a bit contrived and artificial but given the strength of the story the commitment of the actors especially Gordon and the amazing music it really doesn't matter.".

Then I realized I also knew these two guys intimately.  I grew up with them.  We all played hockey in the living room and busted stuff. We shotgunned pilsners and we all went camping and did hideous amounts of damage to ourselves and those around us in the process and we only survived through sheer luck and by keeping the gas pedal floored and not looking back.  Man its bang on right.This film captures certain of the unique qualities of being Canadian better than any other film that I have seen.  Nothing Second City or Bob and Doug Mackenzie ever did compares to the genius that made this film.  Its not the goofiness or the idiocy its the spirit of these two bozos that wins your heart.

	schema:headline " It truly is F.U.B.A.R. but it's also a funny mockumentary";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember it was the summer of 2002 when I first heard of this mockumentary reading something about it in a Canadian magazine. For a while I didn't know much about it other than the fact that it was comedy movie produced in my country and didn't get around to seeing it until about four years ago. I may have been reasonably impressed during my first viewing but I'm not 100 sure. I definitely wasn't sickened by it which some people obviously would be but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I've seen it twice since then and still think it's a little weird just like I did the first time but with my second and third viewing I had seen it before and knew what to expect which made it a bit better.Dean Murdoch and Terry Cahill are two headbangers who have been friends for a long time and live in Alberta Canada. They love beer heavy metal and hockey. A documentarian named Farrel Mitchener has decided to follow them around with a camera documenting their everyday lifestyle. Terry works at a furniture factory assisting in delivering furniture to houses and Dean is a wannabe rock star. The two of them are caught on camera doing what they love which includes getting drunk and causing a ruckus late at night! Farrel also interviews family members and friends of the Alberta headbangers for his documentary. Eventually Terry tells Farrel and the camera that his friend has testicular cancer! Dean has been keeping this a secret but the word gets around and he cannot ignore his condition any longer! The first time I watched Fubar I expected it be more about a rock band and didn't think it would be as weird as it turned out to be. However after watching it three times I certainly can't say it has never made me laugh. The two main characters are stupid but reasonably likable and a lot of the humour comes from the stupid things they say such as Dean thinking Merlin is a real historical figure. Drunken rampages and getting into fights a fight with Farrel at the campsite for example can also really stand out. It can be hard to pick up all the jokes which I don't think I've ever succeeded in doing. Some parts didn't impress me such as Dean talking about putting his testicle in the microwave but most of the film isn't that disturbing. Aside from the humour I also like Dean's positive attitude during his treatment process. Paul Spence and David Lawrence play the starring roles convincingly and it's not surprising that the doctor S.C. Lim is a reallife physician playing himself here as his scenes look like they're from a real documentary with a doctor speaking.Apparently F.U.B.A.R. is an acronym meaning Fed up beyond all repairrecognition and that's probably a fitting title for this movie. It's extremely silly crude juvenile and insane so much so that the acronym is a good way to describe it but that's not always a bad thing. It's rated R which obviously means adults only and I'm sure the film would make many adults cringe as well but for some adults however probably mostly male it's pretty funny even hilarious to some. Around the beginning I could have easily given Fubar an 810 but the two idiots can't carry the film for 76 minutes consistently enough for that and could have really gotten tiring if it were that much longer. Still this mockumentary is often very funny for certain tastes and very Canadian. I'm still not sure if I fully get it but when it comes to crude juvenile comedies you could certainly do much worse.".

For a while I didn't know much about it other than the fact that it was comedy movie produced in my country and didn't get around to seeing it until about four years ago. I may have been reasonably impressed during my first viewing but I'm not 100 sure. I definitely wasn't sickened by it which some people obviously would be but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I've seen it twice since then and still think it's a little weird just like I did the first time but with my second and third viewing I had seen it before and knew what to expect which made it a bit better.Dean Murdoch and Terry Cahill are two headbangers who have been friends for a long time and live in Alberta Canada. They love beer heavy metal and hockey. A documentarian named Farrel Mitchener has decided to follow them around with a camera documenting their everyday lifestyle. Terry works at a furniture factory assisting in delivering furniture to houses and Dean is a wannabe rock star. The two of them are caught on camera doing what they love which includes getting drunk and causing a ruckus late at night! Farrel also interviews family members and friends of the Alberta headbangers for his documentary. Eventually Terry tells Farrel and the camera that his friend has testicular cancer! Dean has been keeping this a secret but the word gets around and he cannot ignore his condition any longer! The first time I watched Fubar I expected it be more about a rock band and didn't think it would be as weird as it turned out to be. However after watching it three times I certainly can't say it has never made me laugh. The two main characters are stupid but reasonably likable and a lot of the humour comes from the stupid things they say such as Dean thinking Merlin is a real historical figure. Drunken rampages and getting into fights a fight with Farrel at the campsite for example can also really stand out. It can be hard to pick up all the jokes which I don't think I've ever succeeded in doing. Some parts didn't impress me such as Dean talking about putting his testicle in the microwave but most of the film isn't that disturbing. Aside from the humour I also like Dean's positive attitude during his treatment process. Paul Spence and David Lawrence play the starring roles convincingly and it's not surprising that the doctor S.C. Lim is a reallife physician playing himself here as his scenes look like they're from a real documentary with a doctor speaking.Apparently F.U.B.A.R. is an acronym meaning Fed up beyond all repairrecognition and that's probably a fitting title for this movie. It's extremely silly crude juvenile and insane so much so that the acronym is a good way to describe it but that's not always a bad thing. It's rated R which obviously means adults only and I'm sure the film would make many adults cringe as well but for some adults however probably mostly male it's pretty funny even hilarious to some. Around the beginning I could have easily given Fubar an 810 but the two idiots can't carry the film for 76 minutes consistently enough for that and could have really gotten tiring if it were that much longer. Still this mockumentary is often very funny for certain tastes and very Canadian. I'm still not sure if I fully get it but when it comes to crude juvenile comedies you could certainly do much worse.";

What I got was a movie that was either way too short or way too long. The joke is that metalheads are stupid and drink beer. If you get the joke do you need to see it for 76 minutes? Because that's the only joke in this film. It could have been 15 minutes. Or had it been 2 hours maybe we could have explored the characters a bit more and the depth would have cleared things up.The film isn't all bad though. It's mildly entertaining  especially Deaner. Tron and Terry are only background to Deaner's madness and tight underwear. I also enjoyed how the film took an unexpected turn towards the end though they didn't really do anything with that. For an independent film with no real actors or director it's not bad. Honestly I couldn't have written or acted or directed this story any better. And I'm not Canadian. This film may not be an underground masterpiece but it's also no disgrace to Pilsner. I guess watch it if you're really drunk or on ludes.

	schema:reviewBody "There were a couple of drunken character moments early in this film that gave me some good strong belly laughs but the longer the film went on the less I laughed and the more I just winced sighed and eventually bailed 30 minutes before the end.

Instinct makes him question the official CIA explanation told by CIA chief Jackson Oscarized secondary Louis Gosset Jr that cites an unknown terrorist group called Black October Black Septemberalike . Terrorist attacks on US military based in Israel are just the smokescreen for a great threat . Alone and armed only with his combat training and determination to uncover the truth the journalist attempts to find out a risked political web . Renewing a fiery affair with his exIover Susan Clifford Lisa Berkley  in her first and last film now the US Embassy press attachee he soon finds himself taking on an old adversary . And when his former marine colleague Colonel John Cooper John Finn of Cold case suffers a terrorist attack after a secret rendezvous with him Mike realises he holds the pieces to a deadly plot . If the lies don'd kill you  the truth will will  .This exciting though belowpar Actioner packs suspense  car chases  thrills  noisy action  political intrigue and violence . Boring pace with its ups and downs  stands out only for ending scenes when takes place the attempt terrorist in 11th station  Via Crucis and Holy Tomb . Picture reveals an alarmingly realist insight into USMiddle Eastern politics and terrorism since the 2000s dealing with a alQaedaesque terrorist organization and the conspiracy theories that some believe the US government is using the Middle East as a coverup . The highlights of the movie result to be the battles to save the lives of thousands of innocent people in a desperate attempt to prevent a deadly plan to create an international disaster of catastrophic proportions  as in a race against time Lundgren confronts a terrorist scheme in the God Friday climax  including hokey religious symbolism . The scene where Dolph Lundgren's character runs through the mass of people during the Easter celebration was shot during an actual enactment by pilgrims of the twelve stations of Christ. Hidden cameras were used to get the footage and a pair of incognito Israeli National Squad paratroopers followed Lundgren for his protection. None the less pilgrims and tourists thought his fake blood was an actual wound and real soldiers pointed M16 guns at Lundgren and got him down on the ground as they had not been well informed of the film production .Regular acting by Dolph Lundgren as a twofisted American journalist on a dangerous foreign assignment finds his own life in jeopardy when he uncovers a deadly labyrinth of political intrigue  better is Lous Gosset Jr as CIA boss Lou Jackson. William Tannen who had written the script and was in the final stages of preparation in Israel to begin shooting in one week was replaced because the lead actor decided that the script he signed on to do was no longer viable and that he began to do a major rewrite  Tannen actually said the word No and was excused by the Israeli producer a former prop man.

The highlights of the movie result to be the battles to save the lives of thousands of innocent people in a desperate attempt to prevent a deadly plan to create an international disaster of catastrophic proportions  as in a race against time Lundgren confronts a terrorist scheme in the God Friday climax  including hokey religious symbolism . The scene where Dolph Lundgren's character runs through the mass of people during the Easter celebration was shot during an actual enactment by pilgrims of the twelve stations of Christ. Hidden cameras were used to get the footage and a pair of incognito Israeli National Squad paratroopers followed Lundgren for his protection. None the less pilgrims and tourists thought his fake blood was an actual wound and real soldiers pointed M16 guns at Lundgren and got him down on the ground as they had not been well informed of the film production .Regular acting by Dolph Lundgren as a twofisted American journalist on a dangerous foreign assignment finds his own life in jeopardy when he uncovers a deadly labyrinth of political intrigue  better is Lous Gosset Jr as CIA boss Lou Jackson. William Tannen who had written the script and was in the final stages of preparation in Israel to begin shooting in one week was replaced because the lead actor decided that the script he signed on to do was no longer viable and that he began to do a major rewrite  Tannen actually said the word No and was excused by the Israeli producer a former prop man.

	schema:reviewBody "Mike Anderson Dolph is an exMarine now an investigative journalist based in L.A. He travels to Israel to try to get the story on some murders at a military base. A terrorist group called Black October is claiming responsibility but is that the whole story? Anderson also is attempting to get to the truth through CIA operative Lou Jackson Gossett Jr. It seems Anderson is getting close because several attempts are made on his life. He must uncover the conspiracy before it's too late. Can he do it? It seems Cover Up was an attempt by Dolph to do something a bit more respectable. There's certainly nothing wrong with trying to change things up and attempting to break away from typecasting  it's just that Cover Up is kind of on the dour dark and dry side. He's more than entitled to try something different but it's just a shame that it's this  because it's still trying to keep one foot in the action world with some blowups and maybe some mild shooting and fighting  but it's not entirely a straight drama either. Despite the more seriousminded tone of the film Dolph still manages to appear shirtless for no apparent reason. Some things can't change apparently.If Dolph really wanted to break away from the cycle of action movies he was doing at the time he probably shouldn't have reteamed with Louis Gossett Jr. after The Punisher 1989. Not that we mind of course they make a fine team but what action remains in this movie is too close to his old work yet not far enough away to separate himself from it. In Dolph's defense it's a tough line to straddle. And he does look very cool with his cigar. It really makes you think Gossett was supposed to appear in The Peacekeeper 1997 to make a DolphGossett trilogy but instead Montel Williams of all people showed up to fill the role.A good example of how this is an atypical Dolph movie comes when there is a scene in a pool hall and all they do is talk and play pool. In any other movie punches kicks and pool cues would be flying. But Mike Anderson is a reporter you see not a fighter. Although he is exmilitary classic clich we all love. So what about that? Presumably it explains what fighting does occur later in the movie.The Israel locations are some of the highlights of the movie and are shot very well by the cinematographer. The King David hotel and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre among other sites in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem are on show. The climax during the religious procession also gets the local flavor very well. Cover Up may be lacking in overall excitement but as a travelogue there's certainly something to see.To keep things in perspective Cover Up is much better than The Last Warrior 2000 Agent Red 2000 and Detention 2003. Cover Up is really not even a bad movie just a bit on the dull side. Dolph seemed to realize this because he came roaring back into classic form with his next movie after this Showdown In Little Tokyo 1991 one of his best and a Comeuppance Reviews favorite. Dolph fans will still appreciate Cover Up and it makes a good onetime watch.".

This was the first film where he seemed to want to prove he can act and he does it quite well. A pity he is typecast as an 'action' hero. He'd still do quite well in a big role in a major film. Possibly not the lead but a supporting role.The film is also a little disturbing in how it shows now as some of the events depicted in the film have seemingly come to pass. Not in the way the film portrays them true but the effects globally have been largely the same.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a great Lundgren film however i did not care for the abrupt ending at all. There were a couple twists that shocked the hell out of me and didn't see coming what so ever however it ended too quickly and it seemed that they were rushing things the last little bit. All the characters were great and Lundgren  and Louis Gossett Jr. are absolutely fantastic in it and i cared for both there characters. The Directing is very good. Manny Coto does a very good job here creating suspense lots of action good camera angles and he kept the film at a fast pace! solid job. Thereis a bit of blood. We get some very bloody gunshot wounds a couple stabbings with swords and a impaling. The Acting is excellent!. Dolph Lundgren is AMAZING as always and this is one of his best performances. He is very believablereally likable and kicked that ass! and his chemistry with Lisa Berkely was good. Louis Gossett Jr. is great in this when on screen he is a very good actor  and it was good to see him again!. Lisa Berkely was hot and did her job pretty well and her chemistry with Lundgren was good. John Finn is also very good here that's all i'm gonna say. Overall I highly recommend this film! 12 out of 5".

However there is a conspiracy in the works...in that conspiracy lies in the fact that for some unfathomable reason Louis Gossett Jr and Dolph Lundgren agreed to be in this lame thriller. Yes i'm saying this material is below even Dolph Lundgren. I had recently discussed this movie with EFilmcritic writer David Corneilus who wrote an article about Oscar winners who should send back their gold statue naming Louis Gossett Jr as a worthy contender for the fact that he was in Firewalker with Chuck Norris The Punisher with Dolph Lundgren Which even though how fun it is it is beneath Gossett's talent Iron Eagle Likewise and Toy Soldiers with Keith Coogan. I reminded him of this movie which I said he had actually worked twice with Dolph Lundgren. His reply was of YIKES forgot about that one for good reason. Yes indeed.I had seen CoverUp back when it came out back when I was 18 and for the most part didn't remember it leaving much of an impression in one way or another. Now years later on rewatch all one can say is how truly grotesque the movie is in it's ineptitude. Part of the problem is that it has Dolph Lundgren. I know someone might get the impression that am taking a swing on an obvious target but I do want to say that Lundgren has always been far more likable in presence than Seagal. CoverUp has Lundgren basically run around wussified and not even once throwing a punch until near the end of the movie. It is nothing short of hilarious when Lundgren tries hard to convey emotion in which he flexes his eyebrows and speaks in the same monotone he did in any other movie he was in. Indeed Lundgren seems half asleep the whole time even when being interrogated by Louis Gossett Jr and he won an Oscar for playing a drill instructor. Then of course there is Louis Gossett Jr who plays the role so by the numbers you could intertwine this with any other movie he has done. Although Gossett Jr manages to provide an unintentional laugh in how he goes off in a huge speech about Not starting your own revolutions as you see FIT! It is a parade of bad acting in which Gossett Jr comes off the best and Lundgren coming off second best. Not good The whole movie itself is just a bunch of useless talk about who is planning on killing whom despite the fact we know all of this and in its content the movie fails to really come up with a credible reason of what is going on and what the bad guy truly wants to accomplish. In other words it is slow dull and just plain bad. People rack on The Punisher that starred both Lundgren and Gossett but at least that movie moved. CoverUp just remains inert in the moronic plot threads it weaves. The tagline of this clunker says If the lies don't kill you the truth will... Well if the truth doesn't kill you watching this movie will. out of 4Bad".

Louis Gossett Jr is here reliable as always.The plot here is incredibly simplistic and predictable. It's annoying that Cover up never really explains why and how something are happening here.

	schema:headline " Zulawski explores shamans and sexuality";
	schema:reviewBody "Like most Zulawski films Szamanka is most notable for the camerawork. As usual the camera moves around fluidly and Zulawski working with his usual DP Andrzej Jaroszewicz frequently employs some unusual angles that greatly complement the film's offkilter tone. Also as usual for this Polish director the acting style is stylized in a rather unique way as the principle characters behavior is always extreme or at the very least exaggerated. While the film is in many ways typical of Zulawski I was surprised to see that most of his directorial characteristics while present were relatively subdued almost as if he was attempting to make his films more accessible to a mainstream audience not that there's anything mainstream about the film's narrative. The plot of Szamanka focuses on the very physical relationship between Michal an anthropology professor and a nameless psychotic woman who claims to be a student and works at a meat packing plant. As the film opens Michal has discovered the corpse of a shaman preserved in the ground for thousands of years. Michal whose own brother is Catholic priest becomes obsessed with the shaman and the girl in equal measure. It's difficult not to draw a parallel between modern priests and ancient shamans here as Michal's mystical communion with the shaman's corpse eventually leads him to consider becoming a priest himself. Michal also appears to be somewhat torn in his love life as he must choose between his fiance the cultured daughter of his employer and the diametrically opposite student whose own inability to conform to the rules of society is apparent in her proclivity for petty theft and her difficulty dealing with her mother and young children. So it seems that the central question of the film is whether Michal should embrace man's primal nature and continue his relationship with the shamanastic mad woman or return to modern civilization either with his fiance or through the priesthood. Yet all these thematic concerns are oddly de emphasized as the film is too often composed of repetitive sex scenes. Typically of Zulawski the film ends with some rather insane acts and what appears to be a rather large explosion. All in all this was a rather uneven film which raised some interesting themes but didn't explore them with much depth instead focusing overmuch on an odd sexual relationship. Still Zulawski's style is interesting enough on its own to make up for some of the film's flaws.".

Szamanka is reminiscent of The Piano Teacher and Last Tango in Paris but where Michael Haneke is subdued and restrained Zulawski is quite the polar opposite. Hanekes ID unleashed if you will. Frantic camerawork and extreme performances sometimes bordering on the laughable but still held together in some strange way. I also remember feeling the same way about Jack Nicholsons performance in The Shining the first time I watched it overplayed but still exactly within the boundaries of the movie and the vision. The cinematography is truly impressive adding to the sense of doom and despair with its deep rich blacks. I always admire Zulawskis use of the camera here he excels in the use of Steadicam and he manages to make the most out of the locations and the superb sets with his eye for staging's angles and timing. Zulawski seems to be like in many of his other movies very interested in extreme ways of behavior the limits of speech and expression. Here he treads a psychological minefield creates a unpleasant but still fascinating journey toward the climax of an obsessive and doomed relationship. Not for everyone but if you enjoyed if that is the right word lets say if you were intrigued by the aforementioned The Pianist and Last Tango you would want to see this one. Zulawski is one of the most interesting European directors alive today I hope he will be active again in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Andrzej Zulawski's adaptation of Manuela Gretkowska's controversial screenplay tells the story of an anthropology professor Michal's Boguslaw Linda who as the movie progresses develops two overwhelming obsessions. The first one is a mummified 3000 yearold perfectly preserved body of a Shaman he and his colleagues have recently dragged out of a swamp and the second  an enigmatic student Iwona Petry he meets by chance at Krakow Railway Station. In exactly a minute after they meet they have passionate but joyless sex The Last Tango in Paris style. The girl whose name we'll never learn has been known as The Italian  she is not an Italian she just used to work at the Italian Restaurant and make the best Pizza in town or so she says. She emits some primitive dangerous sexuality  she is unpredictable swift and reckless. Very soon she and the professor are engaged in the affair that grows dark and explicit and the movie enters In The Realm of Senses territory which prepares you for a very predictable and if you ask me ridiculous ending. Between plentiful and boring erotic scenes including the butterscene from the above mentioned Last Tango in Paris but with no butter Michal tries to solve the mystery of the Shaman remember it is his first obsession? There is one absolutely comical scene with Michal and his colleagues chanting and dancing around an indifferent mummy. There are also some young men running the streets of Krakow screaming and firing the guns I believe that it is supposed to represent the director's comments and criticism of the Polish Politics  but he lost me there. By the end of the movie Michal realizes that he must run from The Italian because as he correctly guessed she is death but the sexually voracious and violently disturbed girl has another plans for him...I don't know what to think about this movie  is it an underrated breathtaking masterpiece of brutality explicit sex and passion that know no boundaries and no mercy or just a most pretentious ridiculous badly edited and absolutely not original piece of cinematic garbage I've ever seen? The more I think of the fact that I had been smiling laughing and giggling through the entire movie and I don't think that it was an expected reaction on this horroroccultadult drama the more it makes me lean to latter. Perhaps if I'd never heard of or seen The Last Tango in Paris In the Realm of Senses The Piano Teacher I would've been in awe but I've seen them all and Chamanka did not tell me anything new about obsessivepossessive lovepassionhate that inevitably leads to selfdestruction and death. Oh no wait the creators of the movie threw in some nice and spicy elements as irrationality necrophilia mysticism and wow! cannibalism but the dinner served ala Dr. Lecter did not shock me on the contrary I found it laughable. I know that Zhulavski had been in trouble with the authorities in Poland during the Communist era and the obvious assaults on conventional morality Catholicism and Polish censorship  can be clearly seen in his film but that did not make it more interesting for me either.".

	schema:headline " Contemporary classic!";
	schema:reviewBody "Bulworth was released quite a few years ago but it is still if not more relevant today. It merges two cultures one being the rich white class culture and the other being the urban lower class culture and ends up with many universal ideals. The story's hero is Jay Billington Bulworth portrayed brilliantly by Warren Beatty. I think some people have a problem with the fact that he is...well more or less insane but that is possibly the most important thing about the character. You could call him insane but if you look at it more romantically perhaps he is posessed by the spirit of social justice a mere vessel for the truths that need to be told. He is a character unaware of the significance in what he is saying. To him if he's not completely insane he's simply a man who broke down and decided to tell it like it is ala Peter Finch in Network but with rapping and rhyming. There's something actually kind of mystical about all this.Since it would be way too preachy if that's all there was to the story there's some other aspects that make for an entertaining viewing. Bulworth in his depression and anxiety hired a hitman to off him so his family could collect the life insurance. Once his speeches and raps become a success this is obviously a big problem since he wants to live again You should never make life and death situations when feeling suicidal. There is a love interest with a girl named Nina played by the lovely Halle Berry. You don't know if you can trust her and her intentions are unclear.There is also a fine supporting role by Don Cheadle who plays a business man who uses young children to sell drugs. His character does bring up some valid points and we're forced to really put ourselves in his shoes. He's doing what he feels is right but ultimately the ends don't justify his means.With a movie that has so much going on it would probably be difficult for the filmmakers to figure out a way to wrap everything up right? Unfortunately yes. Bulworth ends pretty abruptly and leaves with the film's message being halfassedly shouted at the screen. The last act is a huge flaw in an otherwise perfect movie.Bulworth is a hilarious comedy and it heralds something truly special and unique. It is not a film to be taken for granted or forgotten. It's a quintessential example of a 'contemporary classic' for our generation. I have no doubt that over the next decade or so people will want to revisit it and examine the politics and the cultures it should be studied in classrooms it should be valued. I loved Bulworth!My rating 910".

Warren Beatty's Senator Jay Bulworth lays down the smack the reason the working man in this movie the working class is cleverly disguised as hiphop mavens doesn't have a voice is he doesn't have the sway or monetary bullocks to buy a voice. Words aren't worth a penny unless you're worth billions. And of course from the first instant this divine fool's failure is certain and imminent Big Business what with its grimy fingers perpetually immersed in the U.S. Government's proverbial tub of crunchy Jif would never allow a politician like Bulworth to succeed at the risk of the working class' newfound capacity to leech the power from the insurance companies and tire manufacturers.Beneath the sometimes dark comedy Bulworth has a lot of insightful and painful comments to may about our often hypocritical and ineffectual government. These observations are made satirically but effectively. This is not a heavyhanded work. One thing that hampered Bulworth at the boxoffice was its portrayal of the man in the black community. People didn't get it. They were offended especially many liberal white people. Beatty was in no way making fun of AfricanAmericans by showing a very streetwise group. His point which I thought was fairly obvious was that many people will behave in an antisocial way in a society that is largely indifferent and often hostile towards them. I think that's almost a nobrainer. Bulworth is that rare politician who has soul. I agree that Warren Beaty's rapping was sub par but who cares? Bulworth makes a powerful statement that in order to transcend problems of crime poverty racism and political corruption we are going to have to take a cold hard look at who we really are and what is really happening around us. Accepting other people particularly from different racial and economic backgrounds has to be more than just an insincere speech act. It must be an act of good will that is grounded in practical reality.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

But this is the finest example ever made.   Warren Beatty should be very proud of this masterpiece.   Not only for the guts it took to so brazenly confront the modern political process and how it affects race relations the film industry education medicine and so on but also for the fact that he wrote it produced it directed it and starred in it. Any one of those jobs can be a supreme undertaking and here he has accomplished all four with integrity wit humor intelligence and undeniable brass.   It is quite simply impossible to watch this movie without being repeatedly shocked at the depth of its honesty.   The supporting cast is also excellent and Don Cheadle stands out as LD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bulworth may have been filmed in the MTV quick edit way that some find unfitting for an Oscar worthy production but aesthetics aside its contents are right on the mark.Anyone who claims Beatty'sBulworth's analysis and solutions to political problems are dated must be living under a rock. As we speak Bulworth's claims that white people have more in common with black people than with rich people are proved to be completely accurate as we look at the devastating aftermath of hurricane Katrina. Though New Orleans' population consists largely of blacks and ethnic minorities those who were left behind had ONE common denominator they are infirm either economically or physically i.e. they are POOR or HEALTH CHALLENGED. The TVimages show poor white people among the many poor blacks. Poverty is what sets them both back. Bulworth dated? You must be living in a socioeconomically comfortable cocoon.If anything Beatty proved with this both hilarious as bluntly accurate brilliant movie to be a visionary. He puts his finger on where it hurts most the complete corruption of the system the handclapping backslapping deals between interest groups and politicians turning the last group into mouthpieces for selfish agendas. The hypocrisy behind the photo ops look at Bush yesterday on the news posing with hurricane victims the empty rhetoric the feigning to be there for the people when really they're only there for themselves.People who cannot come up with more than this is socialist rhetoricpropaganda comments are obviously deaf dumb and blind to the realities of modern day politics and therefore deserve to be duped by the leaders they so willingly blindly wish to trust believe and follow. It really is true folks Tax payers tax payers take it in the rear. Wake up and smell the dung for goodness sake!Now for the movie itself. Some have commented that Beatty as an affluent middleaged by now senior citizen WHITE man cannot possibly understand what ordinary people go through. Think again. Beatty has been in politics for the Democrats for decades. He is one of the very few rich DEMOCRATIC guys who actually gives a damn about the less privileged of our society. Being rich does not equate being unable to educate oneself nor does being white. Beatty's always had many contacts and friends in the black community with whom he exchanged ideas and concerns.I'm colored and found nothing about the movie stereotypical or racially offensive AT ALL. Those who do including blacks are missing the larger picture this movie is trying to paint. Bulworth is not intended as a white Messiah for the stereotypical hoodlum blacks. He is a metaphor and as a wakeup call he NEEDS to be an extreme. The movie would not have worked if Bulworth had been a black senator a young senator or if Bulworth had met a white single mother Starbuck's employee. When you want to reach people you have to wake them up you have to make them sit up take notice think and start discussing what they have just seen. THAT's exactly what this movie in THIS chosen format with these characters does. It completely serves its purpose. Unfortunately those who oppose the movie are even unaware that their criticism is a credit to this movie for it apparently made them think even if they arrive at mixed up not understanding conclusions.Bulworth is not perfect but its imperfections are easily forgiven. The movie keeps moving without a dull moment in it. Beatty is hilarious and totally enjoying his part and his freedom? addressing everything that's wrong in this sick society with a zeal and energy that many guys half his age must envy. I love the fact that this is the first movie in which Warren dares to look his age. He has never been afraid to ridicule himself in past movies. Anybody who's into Beatty knows that horseface Carly Simon's You're so vain most definitely is NOT about him. The rest of the cast is simply fantastic too. Oliver Platt is ribcrackingly funny as the concerned confused and finally mentally broken down campaign manager Murphy. He elevates the term spindoctor to complete new heights! Joshua Malina campaign aid Feldman is almost as funny. Platt and Malina have some hilarious scenes together. Old Beatty favorite veteran actor Jack Warden is solid as ever. Halle Berry's character could have used a bit more humor but she does a good job. Yes it is a bit of a stretch that the gorgeous Nina would fall for the used to be gorgeous too but not so much anymore aging Bulworth but to state that without looking deeper into how she comes to her choice is to ignore a significant part of the movie. At first she doesn't know what to make of this seemingly confused man. But as she follows him his actions his words his attitude she discovers that he is sincere. That combined with him being in a position in which he could actually make a much needed difference in society makes her change her mind and fall for him. It's not like this young girl Nina has some geriatric preferences in the romantic department! Ariyan A. Johnson and Michele Morgan are amusing as the two enthusiastic new Bulworth VOOOOOOLUNTEEEEEEEEEEEEERS. Paul Sorvino Richard Sarafian Don Cheadle are all solid. Yes the turnaround of L.D. in the end is too quick in the making but the alternative would be a much longer movie so that's one of the very few weaknesses in the script. Last comments  NO Bulworth does not only speak in rap once he's started rapping.  NO Bulworth is not some aging actor's ego trip. It's a wakeup call to America.  Never knew a 60 plus year old white guy could look so hilariously cute in hip hop gear.  Let the spirit take hold of you and let it lead you to take action now that Bulworth has been silenced.......".

	schema:headline " Brilliant Warren Beatty Performance Overlooked by Oscar";
	schema:reviewBody "In BULWORTH Warren Beatty gives one of his funniest and most outrageous performances. This sharp political satire is even more timely now than it was in 1998. This is a marvelously subversive movie on several fronts politics race economics Hollywood itself! Beatty stars as a fading senator from California who is so burned out he arranges for a large insurance policy and then hires a hit man. He's at the end of his rope personally and professionally. He's losing in a primary election to a young gun and has nothing left in his life. After days without sleep or eating he is dragged off to a rally at a Black church. He starts to read his usual speech but almost in a state of delirium he starts answering questions HONESTLY. He enrages the Black congregation with his brutal answers but somehow feels buoyant. Outside the church as the mobs surround him he runs into Halle Berry and her friends and they all take off in the limo.This starts a voyage of discovery for Beatty. Of course at this point Beatty is also running from the hit man. His new honesty unleashes a desire to live. They arrive at a Black hiphop club where Beatty drinks smokes pot and is transformed by the loud urban rap music. The dance scene with Beatty and Berry is remarkable.Next stop is a speech at a fancy Hollywood hotel filled with film executives. Beatty makes many comments of how Jews run Hollywood becomes rich but turn out a crappy product. Next comes a debate with his political opponent and finally an interview. The new Beatty parrots back much of what he has heard from poor Blacks but of course he has always known the truth. His sense of freedom from the backroom politics of Washington is exhilarating and his new voice reaches the masses of disenfranchised voters. His comments about the media and how it is controlled by corporate America is more apt now during the Bush administration than ever before.Beatty is brilliant and this ranks as one of his very best performances. Berry is actually good as well in her premovie star mode when she still bothered to act. Oliver Platt scores as the political aide. Paul Sorvino is a lobbyist for the insurance industry.Jack Warden Helen Martin Don Cheadle Christine Baranski Florence Stanley Laurie Metcalf Sean Astin Isaiah Washington Nora Dunn Joshua Malina William Baldwin Hart Bochner Armelia McQueen and Jackie Gayle costar.Filled with humor political insights and topnotch performances. This acid look at politics in Amerca is more timely now than ever. Bravo to Warren Beatty!".

	schema:reviewBody "BULWORTH 1998 12Starring Warren Beatty Halle Berry Don Cheadle Oliver Platt Isaiah Washington and Christine Baranski Directed produced and written by Warren Beatty   108 minutes   Rated R for pervasive strong language drug use sexual references and brief violence By Blake FrenchI have seen a lot of movies in my time but I have never seen anything as witty as twisted as entertaining as outrageous or as original as Warren Beatty's new political satire Bulworth. It is at times funny but at others very dark. I can't recall ever stating that a serious comedy is one of the years best films before. That was then this is nowand Bulworth is truly one of the better film's of 1998. As the movie opens a US senator named Jay Billington Bulworth hires a hit man to kill an individual of his desire. The hit man wonders exactly who this person is in which a man of such power wishes to eliminate. As it turns out Bulworth has paid this hit man to kill his own suicidal self. If I'm not dead by Monday I'm canceling that check. Bulworth states firmly.This is were the outrageous humor begins. During a campaign speech at a local African American church Bulworth goes seemingly nuts. He begins to tell the citizens the truth about subjects in congress that most politicians would never think of revealing to the general public. His representative Dennis Murphy who cares only about getting Bulworth elected almost faints in shock and disbelief. But you have to understand these are the last days that Bulworth will be experiencing life so why not reveal secrets release envelop pushing information and start up controversy with the nation with his last breaths.Never make life of death decisions when you're suicidal explains Bulworth during one of the film's more invigoration sequences. He is talking to a woman named Nina whom he met nonchalantly during one of his presentation speeches. The two of them fall in love. Too bad Bulworth has not taken his own advice typed above for his death is near. But is Nina who she appears to be? Is his wife Constance Bulworth having an affair with another man? Is Bulworth's demise in the near future? All suitable questions that will all be answered when you see the movie. Parts of the film do not work. For instance the subplot involving Bulworth's wife who is adulterous just isn't detailed enough nor are the characters introduced for us to even consider this anything but a gimmick. True the affair does symbolize chaos preoccupied in his household and establishes another reason for him to be suicidal. Still it's too small for a movie that offers so many good qualities.  Bulworth has a detailed opening that provokes empathy for our main character Jay Bulworth. We learn of an external problem Jay being involved in a heated presidential campaign and an internal problem Jay being suicidal and calling a hit on himself. The structure only goes uphill from there and that is hard to do. Both conflicts are evolved with Nina Bulworth's sense of honesty the hit man's presence and several character  plot twists in which someone is not who they appear to be.Along with some very dramatic and meaningful moments found in Bulworth also contained is dialogue that is smart witty and at times hilarious. The first shock value sequence is truly outrageous and the films unabashed sense of eagerness only gets more perverse the film is rated R for appropriate reasons mostly coming from Bulworth's style of life he becomes involved with. The situations we're facing here are quite controversial but Warren Beatty directs the film with a certain humorous touch. He uses effective but bizarre camera angles and a hip cinematographer that creates aggressive chemistry between Beatty and Halle Berry during their party animal scenes together. The performances in Bulworth entirely demonstrate that Warren Beatty is not only able to direct write and produce well but also that capable to lead an all star cast including Don Cheadle Oliver Platt Isaiah Washington and Christine Baranski into an Oscar worthy overall appearance level. All of these things contribute to making Bulworth is of the better films of 1998 and I recommend it highly.   Brought to you by Twentieth Century Fox.".

This movie was exceptional.If you don't like politics this film might not be for you. Or maybe it would be for you even more since all it does is attack the political system. Warren Beatty stars as a Seantor who is sick of all the lies and crap in Washington so he takes out a life insurance policy and hires a hitman to kill him. After partying with some ghetto people including Halle Berry he sees the error of his ways and tries to call the hit off. The rest of the film follows this path.I liked the storyline of the film but more so I liked the nuggets it dropped along the way. The claims of politicians using minorities the reality of drug culture the fact that greed controls health care in this country. I found myself agreeing with almost everything in this film though the part about the elimination of all races went too far. The ending was also exactly what I expected it to be  and what I felt it should have been. Only they added an aspect I hadn't considered and I think it made the film so much better. I'm being vague so as not to give anything away. Warren Beatty rapping is both comical and annoying. But if you look past his wack skillz and listen to what he has to say about corporations big oil TV networks and more you'll get so much more out of this film. I'm also not a fan of Halle Berry but she was probably the best person for the role so I'm okay with that. Hooray for Oliver Platt and Sean Astin both looking very slim in this movie.Not the best film you'll see this year but highly recommended just the same.".

The result is unsurprisingly imbalanced. The plot follows Democratic Senator Jay Bullington Bulworth a man who has become so jaded by the American political system that he has taken a contract out on his own life after purchasing 10 million worth of life insurance. This all takes place leading up to his campaign for re election and so with a new reckless go for all outlook on life he starts speaking the truth. As a rap. Yes a rap. Warren. Beatty. Rapping. Politics. Rap. Ping. Strangely and really bloody unexpectedly it works! Most of the time... Kind of. I mean how well would you expect something like that to work? In a sophisticated satire? The context is sort of there he begins rapping to appeal to the disparaged and AfricanAmerican community where most of the focus is directed during this film. Most of what is said by Bulworth pokes holes in the financial support that insurance companies offer to candidates on both sides of the water usually so as to enlist a vote against bills that force these companies in having to extend free health care or other such coverage to yep AfricanAmericans. Not everything that he says sticks actually to be honest I didn't even follow some of the logic he was spouting. But maybe I just don't have sufficient understanding of American politics. At any rate the script is at it's best with moments of total uninhibitedness Everybody just got to keep fcking each other till we're all the same colour. and when it takes its time to make a point as opposed to just dropping the N word incessantly.Actors Beatty's not much of a rapper. Well that's alright I suppose. I'm a white boy from Tasmania so who am I to judge? What's important is that he makes us believe Bulworth's erratic and quixotic frame of mind which he does most of the time. It helps that when he can't he's usually operating on one or more mindaltering substances. And his chemistry with the sexy and savvy Halle Berry is palpable making their connection surprisingly touching on some level.Direction Beatty has never made a bad film. He's been in a few to be sure Love Affair Town  Country but he has yet to direct a film of subpar quality. Here he applies a basic yet effective formula to filming Bulworth immersing us in the unfamiliar settings that the eponymous character himself is amongst and juxtaposing us in a way that makes us empathise. We feel as out of place in these night clubs and ghetto back streets as Bulworth but the stiltedness slowly subsides to suggest a gradual ease that he begins to feel. Nothing to get excited over but wellexecuted with appropriate measure.Potential for repeat viewings My second viewing and I would happily watch it again... In a while. Some might be put off by the endings but I like them the first one seems a little phony and too neat until the true ending reveals itself adding a dignified poignancy to the film. I feel I've not said enough about the humor in this film and I should point out that it is very funny. Not the laugh out loud sort of funny that some prefer the humor is not obvious not brazen or expectant of hearty bellows. But it is quietly amusing requiring only a wry grin or occasional chuckle to be fully appreciated. And joy of all joys most of the time it is very very clever. Far cleverer than me at any rate.".

	schema:reviewBody "My friend didn't really like this movie all that much claiming that he couldn't really relate to the AfricanAmerican subculture but what I really think is that this movie is directed to minority people in general and is quite anticorporate.The movie is focused around incumbent senator for California Senator Bullsworth. The movie opens with him watching his campaign trailers and crying. It seems that the weight of his position has finally fallen on him. We learn that his wife really doesn't love him anymore and he has asked a hitman to kill him. Suddenly he turns on the political system and begins to drag it through the mud. The first speech is at a Negro church and when he is asked questions instead of giving a sugar coated noncommittal answer he tells them the truth. They have no money and thus do not matter. Soon he turns on the corporate sponsors criticising their manipulation of the political system by throwing lots of money in the right direction.Thus senator Bullsworth throws away his lifestyle and delves into the Negro community. He attacks the corporations that run the nation and supports the under powered minorities. He even turns his teeth on the drug pushers seeing them as evil pawns of the faceless corporations.Basically this movie is Bullsworth's epiphany. He wants to die at first and with this he has his epiphany  the realisation before his death. Throughout the movie we know that he is going to die because even though he is popular he cannot get away with making the statements that he is making. He is being incredibly controversial and such a stance can never last that long. It rocks the boat way too much and as such can't be allowed to succeed. In the America of the movies things cannot change too much and in fact if it has happened before hand things will be set straight. I guess this then shows the tragedy of society that when a saviour arrives he will be killed because those in power don't want to give it up.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Bulworth' is a brave film which I think is even more relevant now than when first released. What happens behind the scenes? Senator Jay Bulworth sees those string pullers and is sick of idiots being naive enough to believe they don't exist. What's a man who had noble intentions to do when he is reduced to cynicism? Hire a hitman to kill himself. What to do while waiting for that trigger to be pulled? Ruin whatever credibility you might have gained in your thirty years of public service. Beatty is brilliant as 'Bulworth' who is a surprising hero. We root for this guy and feel devastatingly sorry for him. Why? He's really nothing but a tremendous jerk.The scene where he tells an African American Church congregation to put down the malt liquor and chicken wings and support someone other than a running back who stabs his wife might be the most racist humor I've ever seen on film. 'Bulworth' is a film about self destruction but the beautiful thing about it is that Jay Bulworth intends to bring down bits and pieces of the establishment down with him. We feel sorry for Bulworth because we know he was someone who was an idealist and who has over the course of many years sold out. If he is to die why not go out in a blaze of glory? These bizarre outbursts on Bulworth's part are portrayed beautifully by Beatty. There is a brilliant mix of catharsis and madness in Bulworth who ends his racist tirade merely saying that was good with a breath of relaxation.The film isn't without it's faults. It's brave but there were moments I wanted it to go braver. Where do we want to lead Bulworth? It seems the more appropriate thing to do would be to bring Bulworth to a pinnacle of madness. Instead the opposite happens and Bulworth regains his senses in the form of a love interest. Why? What does this do? For one thing the relationship between Halle Berry and Warren Beatty seems tremendously awkward and forced. What would any woman see in Jay Bulworth? The man has obviously lost his mind. Furthermore Beatty was too old at this point to play a love interest in this fashion. Part of the charm of 'Bulworth' is that this man is supposed to be over the hill. I'm not saying a sexual subplot was uncalled for but not a genuine love story. Let Bulworth crash and burn. What would have been far more interesting is if they had explored Bulworth's relationship with his wife which is only a political marriage. Wouldn't it be funny for Bulworth to enact his frustrations on this woman who has become nothing more than an actress for his boring campaign commercials? I think so.'Bulworth' has a charm and it is very different. Not surprisingly my criticisms of it stem from the conventional moments. The scenes where 'Bulworth' spit in the face of conventional political norms are on par with some of the great political satires".

	schema:headline " The Most Brazen and OvertheTop and Hilarious of the Late '90s Political Satires";
	schema:reviewBody "What this satire on modern civic affairs boils down to is a politician who can no longer bring himself to repeat the phrase America is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium. More times than he could possibly count he has repeated the same empty Pavlovian signals the same hollow BS the same crap. Now he sits in his office playing one of his dumb TV commercials nonstop. He has not eaten or slept in three days. He is sick to the black heart of the American political process. Bulworth isn't just comprised of the candidate making caustic jabs like an anarchist Jackie Mason. There's enormous significance in much of the dialogue written by Beatty with a credit to the commentaries of American culture by such as Noam Chomsky. Beatty takes aim at the fable about how government is spendthrift and industry is effective by holding that government runs Medicare for a quarter of the expense scooped away by insurance companies for same quality health care. However why don't we have national health care like every other First World country? Insurance payoffs Bulworth is just too elated to announce.Warren Beatty's Bulworth makes me laugh and cringe and it does admirable work. It hits you that if all politicians were as forthright as Bulworth the flimsy scaffolding of our system would crumble and we would have to start all over again. Like its contemporaries Wag the Dog and Primary Colors but much much more straightforwardly the movie conveys that essentially everything expressed in public by a politician is spin. Spin control is only the term for spin they're called on. Bulworth is a former Kennedy liberal like Beatty himself an incumbent senator from California who is charged by an opponent as being old liberal wine trying to pour himself into a new conservative bottle. The humor to Bulworth is that liberal and conservative Democrat and Republican are no longer monikers that signify much an illusion that has become an everdeepening divide in the two parties since this film's release Nevertheless when it comes to national health care for instance the insurance companies have had both parties at their beck and call.Bulworth is done for. He loathes his job and his life and has recently misspent millions in the market. So he submits a contract on his own life and flies back to California believing he has three days to live. His approaching demise invigorates him with a sensation of abandon Finally he is liberated to say precisely what he thinks and that's what he does. In a black church he notes Half your kids are out of work and the other half are in jail. Do you see any Democrat doing anything about it? Certainly not me! So what're you gonna do vote Republican? Come on! You're not gonna vote Republican! Let's call a spade a spade!

When Bulworth asks Nina where all the black leaders have gone her response is as astute and persuasive as a year's plethora of editorials. Though when the movie depicts black culture as inevitably more genuine and honest than white that's an excess impulse. The utility of blacks as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor is a tired clich in white liberal soapboxing. There is even an enigmatic old black man who trails Bulworth around chanting abracadabra that I think is supposed to be cryptic worldlywise maxims. It's better when Bulworth disregards political correctness and says what he believes inconsiderate all the same as when he suggests that the answer to racial hardships is for everybody to eff everybody else until we're all the same color.Bulworth is not a perfect movie nor could it be. It's a little uneven and takes too many chances. I don't believe the love plot between Bulworth and Nina. It's a reprocessing of the long burntout movie clich that a man in a struggle for his life can invariably find time in three days to fall in love with a woman half his age. However that particular charge is miniscule in comparison to the effectiveness of the rest of the film. Beatty tarries very close to home and in the tone of the film as well as its Clintonera contemporaries like Wag the Dog and Primary Colors it epitomizes political problems in the US that since their time have grown into much different much uglier problems. Bulworth works like a scream of agitated comedic mania. It's about a sort of prototypical figure who appears more and more to signify the cyclical American condition the guy who's mad as hell and isn't going to take it anymore. Interesting how in the decades since we heard those words in Network we've completely ignored why they were said.".

	onyx:emotionText "What this satire on modern civic affairs boils down to is a politician who can no longer bring himself to repeat the phrase America is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium. More times than he could possibly count he has repeated the same empty Pavlovian signals the same hollow BS the same crap. Now he sits in his office playing one of his dumb TV commercials nonstop. He has not eaten or slept in three days. He is sick to the black heart of the American political process. Bulworth isn't just comprised of the candidate making caustic jabs like an anarchist Jackie Mason. There's enormous significance in much of the dialogue written by Beatty with a credit to the commentaries of American culture by such as Noam Chomsky. Beatty takes aim at the fable about how government is spendthrift and industry is effective by holding that government runs Medicare for a quarter of the expense scooped away by insurance companies for same quality health care. However why don't we have national health care like every other First World country? Insurance payoffs Bulworth is just too elated to announce.Warren Beatty's Bulworth makes me laugh and cringe and it does admirable work. It hits you that if all politicians were as forthright as Bulworth the flimsy scaffolding of our system would crumble and we would have to start all over again. Like its contemporaries Wag the Dog and Primary Colors but much much more straightforwardly the movie conveys that essentially everything expressed in public by a politician is spin. Spin control is only the term for spin they're called on. Bulworth is a former Kennedy liberal like Beatty himself an incumbent senator from California who is charged by an opponent as being old liberal wine trying to pour himself into a new conservative bottle. The humor to Bulworth is that liberal and conservative Democrat and Republican are no longer monikers that signify much an illusion that has become an everdeepening divide in the two parties since this film's release Nevertheless when it comes to national health care for instance the insurance companies have had both parties at their beck and call.Bulworth is done for. He loathes his job and his life and has recently misspent millions in the market. So he submits a contract on his own life and flies back to California believing he has three days to live. His approaching demise invigorates him with a sensation of abandon Finally he is liberated to say precisely what he thinks and that's what he does. In a black church he notes Half your kids are out of work and the other half are in jail. Do you see any Democrat doing anything about it? Certainly not me! So what're you gonna do vote Republican? Come on! You're not gonna vote Republican! Let's call a spade a spade!

	schema:headline " A fairly daring satire.";
	schema:reviewBody "Bulworth is not a film that could have been made by just anybody. Though many people probably share a lot of the same viewpoints expressed in the film it probably took someone of Warren Beatty's clout to actually sit down and write it all out then believably pitch it to a studio. Bulworth is a biting satire of politics as usual. The film does itself a favor and never takes itself too seriously. Some of the names of real politicians that get thrown around tend to date this film but we're still debating virtually every issue it brings up.The film's first half hour is its best. It begins in the office of California Senator J. Billingotn Bulworth Beatty. It is nighttime and he sits alone watching a series of his own commercials airing just in time for the upcoming primary. Senator Bulworth is crying like a baby as each commercial repeats the same empty platitudes over and over again. It is obvious that he has been advised to sound like a centrist even though that is not where his heart lies. On the walls of his office are pictures of Martin Luther King Malcolm X and Bobby Kennedy. People who died for their beliefs. Bulworth is just selling his out to get reelected and the whole process has become more than he can bare. Later on that morning we see Senator Bulworth pay a man to put a contract out on his life. He feels he has nothing left to live for and he wants a big insurance settlement to go to his daughter after he is killed. He is planning on being hit once he returns to California to campaign. Once Senator Bulworth gets back to his home state things take one wild turn after another.We see the Senator now feel free to express exactly what he feels in public. He lambastes the congregation of a black church for rallying behind O.J. Simpson and tells them not to expect anything good to come their way until they can offer more money to elected officials. Later on he shows up at a party full of Jewish Hollywood types and basically tells them to stop making such crappy movies. He follows three young black women into an after hours club in South Central L.A. and basically learns how to rap overnight. Yes! From this point on Senator Bulworth begins rapping his views in public and understandably causing a major fracas wherever he goes. Making things worse for his stunned advisers is the fact that a CSPAN crew is following him around everywhere so all of this eccentricity is being broadcast all over.The plot takes many twists and turns. Some work and some do not. Bulworth falls in love with a young black woman named Nina who is not what she seems to be. He still has a contract out on his life throughout the whole film as well. Once he starts speaking what's really on his mind he decides he doesn't want to die after all. The trouble is he cannot get the hit called off due to other complications. The film spends its last half hour in the hood of L.A. where it seems to ramble a bit too much and lose the sharper focus it had in its earlier scenes. The conclusion is a bit unexpected but I liked it. I liked it quite a bit I must say.The acting is exceptional. Beatty is what he is. Halle Berry is so freaking lovely as Nina! There are numerous cameos from famous media types and the entire cast is solid from top to bottom. The film doesn't strike all the right chords but it hits enough of them. No matter which side of the political debate one finds themselves on wouldn't it be nice just to hear a politician say what heshe truly believes? 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that regardless of your political leanings it's hard to not at least find 1998's Bulworth appealing because of the simple fact that the movie succeeds because to me in all instances it shouldn't have. Any movie that features a middleaged star Warren Beatty was 61 in '98 Democratic senator who's running for reelection and uses raps to voice his views to his constituents gets an automatic A in my book.I must confess my love for hiphop and its fusion with politics as attributed to such infamous landmark rap groups like Public Enemy or Boogie Down Productions and Beatty's raps seem so improvised you'd think he'd have a career as a rapper. In Bulworth the film and Beatty show us the dark underside to American politics  it exposes the lies the corruption and seemingly lack of morality apparent on all political fronts. If Bulworth were released in today's volatile times Beatty would receive every ignorant nasty liberal and socialist tag conceivable.Democratic senator Jay Billington Bulworth Beatty in a Golden Globenominated performance has reached the end of his rope. The spark of his love for politics has finally fizzled out. He hasn't eaten or slept in three days he's on the verge of a nervous breakdown. In desperation and at one last attempt to lend weight and meaning to his hapless existence as he embarks on a whirlwind reelection campaign he puts a contract out on his own life a weekend research project is what it's called.I've not heard of many politicians who would dare say and do some of the things that I see Bulworth do in this film. It takes balls sorry to be so blunt to do this especially at the expense of your career and your life as a politician. How many times can a speech start out the same way We stand at the doorstep of a new millennium... Beatty is amazing with this movie and especially with its script coauthored by himself and Jeremy Pisker which got an Oscar nomination in 1998.Bulworth stuns his colleagues and the masses with his radical new views many of which are in fact Beatty's own. His top political adviser Dennis Murphy Oliver Platt is shocked greatest of all as he's left to frantically pick up the pieces of Bulworth's rampage and try to save his own job his wife who throws the cameras the best phony smile I've ever seen from a politician's spouse climbs into the bed of another man and Bulworth eventually finds love and comfort with Nina Halle Berry an innercity L.A. activist.Bulworth starts to dressdown the part of the rapping rhyming politician who speaks the blunt truth about our American system of politics especially with regards to the AfricanAmerican community about how the Democratic Party doesn't really care about blacks and how the Republicans are screwing us over in their pitiful attempts at trying to relate to our problems by exploiting us.Bulworth is an extremely vulgar and laughout loud satire that breaks the rules at every corner. Beatty is excellent in a comical and certainly inspired performance that defies standard Hollywood conventions Bulworth's greatest muse are his constituents who come to include an innercity tough Don Cheadle and his soldiers. His script and this film in general are one of the most original pieces of political satire I've seen in recent years.In the aftermath of the 2004 election you would think that a movie like Bulworth will turn heads everywhere on both sides. As I stated earlier some may give this film a lot of nasty socialist labels that ignore the simple and true fact that American politics is in trouble. If only the analogous but factoflife comparisons between Martin Luther King Jr. and Bulworth's life didn't prove true...1010".

Some scenes are terrific others just terrible trash.Halle Berry plays anything but a likable lead nor are the characters people you can root for except for Oliver Platt in the first half of the film. Then he totally changes.Nonetheless this is Warren Beatty's film anyway. He dominates it and is what makes the movie fun. Knowing him and knowing this was political I expected bigtime Liberal propaganda but didn't find any heavyhandedness there.For a comedy there are way way too many fwords even in the music if you want to call it that. Despite that the film has some charm if it's possible to use that word in a film this profane. Beatty's rap lyrics were genuinely funny no matter what your political persuasion might happen to be. An odd film.".

	onyx:emotionText "I wasn't exactly sure how to rate this film and I bet others weren't either. It's difficult to say but fascinating to watch. Some scenes are terrific others just terrible trash.Halle Berry plays anything but a likable lead nor are the characters people you can root for except for Oliver Platt in the first half of the film. Then he totally changes.Nonetheless this is Warren Beatty's film anyway. He dominates it and is what makes the movie fun. Knowing him and knowing this was political I expected bigtime Liberal propaganda but didn't find any heavyhandedness there.For a comedy there are way way too many fwords even in the music if you want to call it that. Despite that the film has some charm if it's possible to use that word in a film this profane. Beatty's rap lyrics were genuinely funny no matter what your political persuasion might happen to be. An odd film.";

Of course simply declaiming the political message would have sounded preachy. Instead Bulworth does a wacky inyourface by delivering the message in unmistakable yet entertaining fashion. That's done by having the senator succumb to an alter ego brought on by mental exhaustion over his planned suicide. Serious messages are then wrapped in comedic contrasts. No more suit and tie for the new Bulworth. Instead he looks like he went shopping in the dark at a charity ward. In fact the now truthtelling hipster appears his real self suddenly breaking through the conventional faade. At the same time watching him defy deadening media clichs amounts to a jarring hoot. And after romantic pursuit of an eyecatching Black woman Berry he learns daytoday facts of ghetto plight by staying with her family. And when not speaking truth to power at White fundraisers Beatty's Bulworth uses his newly acquired hiphop to rhyme out the message in catchy rapper fashion. Either way it's one of the cleverest approaches to undercutting deadening political authority that I've seen.No prettyboy Beatty here. Pushing 60 he's haggard looking throughout doing little to compensate until the end. Of course that's the way it should be given the emphasis on message. I suspect it's a movie the lefty actordirectorproducer has long wanted to make. And make it he did in spades.".

Warren Beatty has written directed and starred in a timeless ode to the fact that our fascist state is so behind in health care and taking care of the poor.Obscenity? The rich is getting richer and richer and richer while the middle class is getting more poor Making billions and billions and billions of bucks well my friend if you weren't already rich at the start well that situation just suckscause the riches mother fcker in five of us is getting ninety fckin eight percent of it and every other motherfcker in the world is left to wonder where the fck we went with it.Yes we are reminded by this film that we are all at the mercy of the rich. They rape the riches of America and enslave the rest of us. It's hard to take especially by those who would excuse their behavior because they are waiting for their in the Promised Land. I'm giving them entrylevel positions into the only growthsector occupation that's truly open to them right now. That's the substance supply industry. They gonna run this sht someday. They gonna have the whole empire. Man y'all don't give a fck about it. You greedyass politicians. That's what you tell me every time that y'all vote to cut them school programs every time y'all vote to cut them funds to the job programs. What the fck how a... how a young man gonna take care of his financial responsibilities workin' at motherfckin' Burger King? He ain't. He ain't and please don't even start with the school sht.

It's the same sht in politics.We wonder why we have a problem in this country when we have an education system that is no better that is was before Brown V Topeka and we keep sending the poor to fight so the rich can get richer.Sure Bulworth is a political movie made by one of the most political people in Hollywood. It stings and it hurts those who are the object of the numerous political barbs contained therein. It hits at Democrats and Republicans  all politicians are equally to blame for the mess we have.You have to love Warren Beatty for having the courage to make this. It had some other greats here too in a huge cast. Halle Berry Sean Astin Don Cheadle Oliver Platt and others including cameos by Al Gore and others.I've given you a taste. See more if you dare.".

So sayeth the gospel according to Warren Beatty.This film is the most agonizing midlife crisis I've ever had to the misfortune to witness.  After a fairly interesting opening ten minutes the picture nose dives into an endless deafening gangstaclub scene where Warren Beatty's transformation from Senator to Drugged Out Rapping Whitey is complete.  Suprisingly there's no scene with the good Senator loading the backseat of his limo with bass heavy speakers so he drives around and annoys the hell out of everyone within earshot but I'm sure he considered it. There just wasn't enough time.  He had to run around on drugs rapping the truth to the uninitiated and that's not just the fat cigar chomping insurance monsters who were probably slum lords in a previous life.  It's the audience too.  We don't know anything.  They don't know anything. Nobody knows anything except for Mr. Beatty and the kids with the guns. They know.  And they're going to tells us how it is.Every frame of this miserable wretched godawful mess was the worst kind of torture I've ever endured.

It opens in that garden spot community of Cavity Rock California in the northern part of the state where the local paper has won a contest by being declared the best small town newspaper in the USA. That contest carries with it the distinction of having their star reporter one Homer Smith played by Robert Young the appointment of foreign correspondent to cover World War II personally.Previous to getting the news Young is watching his favorite film star Marcia Warren on the screen. It happens to be a scene from Maytime with Jeanette MacDonald singing Les Filles Des Cadiz. In the film MacDonald had gone to Europe to make a film three years earlier and the outbreak of war forced her to flee to North Africa from France.In the meantime Young gets torpedoed in the Mediterranean and finds himself on a floating piece of wreckage with a garrulous but mysterious Englishman played by Reginald Owen. They're forced to split up but Young's given a message for someone in Cairo by Owen who tells him he's with British Intelligence. Of course Young meets the movie star girl of his dreams in Cairo and what follows is a comedy of errors in which each believes the other is a spy. The enemy does have a dastardly bit of business cooked up but that's for you to watch the film to find out.As a satire on spy films Cairo is uneven. Some of the stuff is brilliant some of it trite. One of the gags involves Jeanette's ability to hit a high C because that opens certain doors. Even the bad Nazi lady Mona Barrie says why don't we just have doorknobs like everyone else. The master plot itself is kind of dumb. It's an elaborate scheme but it only involves the destruction of one troop transport which it the long range scheme of things seems a waste. But what really makes Cairo worth watching isn't Jeanette so much as Ethel Waters. Ms. Waters is playing a maid but she's quite a bit more than that as Jeanette's girl Friday and personal assistant. She's not subservient in the least. And of course she gets a couple of numbers to sing with her style contrasting quite nicely with Jeanette. Ethel sings the Harold ArlenE.Y. Harburg tune Buds Won't Bud and in grand style. Jeanette's highlight is a song about the Lady in the Harbor the Statue of Liberty. She sings it in grand bravura style and I'm sure brought many a tear to the eyes of GIs when this film was shown abroad.Fans of Jeanette will love this film others might find it amusing but only in spots. And fans of Ethel Waters shouldn't miss it.".

The film stars Robert Young Jeannette MacDonald Ethel Waters Lionel Atwill Eduardo Ciannelli and Reginald Owen.Part of the problem with Cairo is you're not sure what you're watching  musical comedy drama what? It's a comedy with music but a bit unsure of itself. Young plays Homer Smith a newspaper reporter who suspects the famous singermovie star Marcia Warren of being a Nazi spy. She suspects him of being one as well. The best scene occurs when they go out for an evening manage to get away from one another and each go back to MacDonald's house to search the other's room. There's also a joke with her high C which inadvertently opens a secret passage.One of the assets of Cairo is Jeannette MacDonald who was so beautiful and here she's in good voice and very appealing in her performances. Ethel Waters is wonderful though she certainly could have done more. Young was never a topflight movie star but he does okay. MacDonald is excellent very charming and funny.With a little work on the script this could have been an excellent film. However it looks like it was rushed out as a propaganda movie and done on the cheap. The film has some great in jokes. When Marcia Warren and Homer Smith question one another they learn that they are both from California. She's from the north he's from the south. Both denigrate where the other lives. Finally Smith says to her Have you ever been to San Francisco? Once she answers with Gable and Tracy and the joint fell apart.".

The movie is also a mustsee  or rather a musthear  for its songs the best of which is the fastpaced medley with the King's Men and the final spectacular Cairo. This is the only place you'll hear it! It was never recorded. In fact the songs are by far the movie's chief attraction. At this point I disagree with good old George Addison. He feels that what he describes as a silly lame story is allowed to run too long and that Miss MacDonald's acting in the comedy stretches is both arch and reachmedown. Furthermore it will not please her fans who are used to a much more serious MacDonald. Not that I personally object to a tongueincheek approach. It's just that her timing is all wrong. Weak injokes do not help. Admittedly Ethel Waters is even worse and her traycarrying shuffle and MacDonald's response are in remarkably poor taste to say the least. Another embarrassing incident involves Robert Young in a tedious 'dark house' in which Young ends up dripping wet under the piano. Van Dyke's direction seems as tired and listless as the dated overlong at 101 minutes plot.".

However his adventure is shortlived when his ship is sunk. While floating about the Mediteranian he meets up with a spy Reginald Owen and they eventually decide to separate. The spy asks Homer to deliver a message to a lady in a bar in Cairo in case he cannot make it and this drops dopey Homey into a nest of Nazi spies. Now this is VERY obvious and it's a tribute to how stupid they made his character that he had no indication that they were enemy agents. However the Nazi lady spy decides to send Homer on a wild goose chase and tells him that a famous American actress who just happens to be in Cairo is a Nazi! So Homer applies for a job as a butler for Marcia Warren Jeanette MacDonald so he can spy on her! There's a lot more to the film but none of it works well because the film keeps getting interrupted by songs. The MacDonald ones are typical for herwith LOTS of highpitched operatic stuff that would make most folks ill. I know I found myself using the fastforward button whenever she began singing. The other problem is that Homer and Marcia seems incredibly stupidyet they somehow defeat the Nazis and save the world! Unfunny forced and dumb. Perhaps my score of 3 is a bit charitable.".

	schema:reviewBody "The comedymystery or comedythriller is a peculiar genre. Bob Hope used to make a lot of these but I think they have become extinct which is all to the good. It's a combination that guarantees some awkwardness and tastelessness with its jokes about death and in the case of Cairo a wartime picture whose villains seek to bomb an aircraft carrier and kill 5000 Americans a great deal.This kind of movie also gives a lot of license to the lazy writer. One has the feeling watching Cairo that a lot of bad jokes as well as sloppy and absurd plotting were let through in the name of irony. Robert Young plays an American newspaperman more unobservant and naive than the average tenyearold boy the movie wants to make sure you see that even the dimmest viewers realise he is screwing up. Jimmy Stewart might have been able to invest even this awful role with charm but Robert Young was made for the part of the dumb cluck with nothing left over. I have read that Louis B. Mayer puzzled once asked someone how someone with no sex appeal and nothing else could be a star. I share his bewilderment.Jeanette MacDonald of course sings ravishingly particularly the silky ballad The Moon Looks Down on Cairo but she looks much older than Young she was several years older but looks as if the difference were much greater. They have one kiss when he is cold and wet and she wraps a blanket around him. To call it maternal would be to credit it with more passion than it has.The one bright spot is the shamefully underused in this film as in Hollywood in general Ethel Waters. She sings one number Yip Harburg and Harold Arlen's delightful Buds Won't Bud and gives the movie the punch and zest it otherwise lacks. But the choice is oddit's a sweet little reflective number and is here given the powerhouse treatment.I was for many years curious about this movie and thought it particularly difficult to findit was never shown on TV. This may have been because of the scene in which Young accidentally fires a gun and immediately a few dozen soldiers rush out with their hands up shouting We're Italians! We surrender!".

At the time the story had great impact in the people all over the world because the evidence of their innocence was total and in many countries there were demonstrations against such terrible injustice.

Gian Maria Volont as usual and Riccardo Cucciolla offer one of the most touching and beautiful dramatic interpretations I have ever seen. This movie was recently released by the best not in quantity of titles but in their quality Brazilian distributors called Versatil. The DVD is completely restored in widescreen and full of Extras showing footages of this infamous trial. The musical score of Joan Baez and Ennio Morricone is another attraction.

As we see that Nicola Sacco and Bartholomeo Vanzetti two Italian born men and devout anarchists were executed due to their anarchists beliefs.Murder was gruesome in Brantree MA but it was their beliefs and the Red Scare that really not just divided a nation but divided a whole entire world.Case that still haunts us in the twenties haunts us today and for the future. As the tag line says If it happened once it could happen again! The late great Riccardo Cucciolla and late great Gian Marie Volente in the respected Sacco and Vanzetti roles. Were made as scapegoats as they could not get a fair trial as the criminal justice system also looked at them being Italians which were in the minority at the time.Sacco was the quiet family man shoemaker and Vanzetti was more of the spokesman fish peddler of the two and more of the talker. And maybe would had been a college professor if he had a college degree had it probably not been for his beliefs or being Italian. That they are portrayed to be. As the case also takes a toll on their families along the way.Cyri Cusack as a bullying prosecutor steals the movie. As he wants to just get them to the electric chair asap it seems over their beliefs. Despite the worldwide protests over them Cusack's character finally gets his wish.A case that should be studied all over the world!".

	onyx:emotionText "This case still affects not just in the socalled Roaring Twenties but also of today and of our future. As we see that Nicola Sacco and Bartholomeo Vanzetti two Italian born men and devout anarchists were executed due to their anarchists beliefs.Murder was gruesome in Brantree MA but it was their beliefs and the Red Scare that really not just divided a nation but divided a whole entire world.Case that still haunts us in the twenties haunts us today and for the future. As the tag line says If it happened once it could happen again! The late great Riccardo Cucciolla and late great Gian Marie Volente in the respected Sacco and Vanzetti roles. Were made as scapegoats as they could not get a fair trial as the criminal justice system also looked at them being Italians which were in the minority at the time.Sacco was the quiet family man shoemaker and Vanzetti was more of the spokesman fish peddler of the two and more of the talker. And maybe would had been a college professor if he had a college degree had it probably not been for his beliefs or being Italian. That they are portrayed to be. As the case also takes a toll on their families along the way.Cyri Cusack as a bullying prosecutor steals the movie. As he wants to just get them to the electric chair asap it seems over their beliefs. Despite the worldwide protests over them Cusack's character finally gets his wish.A case that should be studied all over the world!";

	schema:headline " A dark chapter in the history of the USA";
	schema:reviewBody "My current obsession with Italian actor Gian Maria Volont eventually brought me to Giuliano Montaldo's Sacco and Vanzetti an excellent courtroom drama where Volont and Riccardo Cucciolla play two anarchists unjustly tried for murder while it becomes obvious they're in fact being tried for being anarchists lefties reds whatever in a country that never had any love for them and in a time that was perhaps the second worst time to be an anarchistcommunistsocialist in America after the McCarthy years. This movie is set a few decades before that but the hysteria and strident violation of civil rights is the same.Montaldo does a good job directing the movie  for instance the blackandwhite opening sequence with the cops making a raid on an Italian neighbourhood rounding up men women and children in front of their buildings spanking innocent people and basically acting like vicious animals is a powerful sequence that immediately sets the theme of abuse of power. Then we have the courtroom scenes with Cyril Cusack playing a fierce DA seeking to send the two anarchists to the electric chair Geoffrey Keen playing a clearly bigoted judge and Milo O'Shea as the defense lawyer who is systematically humiliated bullied and discredited because he's doing his job too well. When these three actors share a scene you can see sparks fly off the screen! Ennio Morricone provides the music which is melancholy and elegiac and Joan Baez contributes with some excellent ballads that are positioned in key moments of the movie. These two together make the score for this movie one of the best I've ever heard.Gian Maria Volont is of course excellent his performance is showier and more furious than Cucciolla's. But then their characters also have different personalities. Whereas Volont's character Vanzetti understands the mythical dimension of his person realizes that his death will turn him into a symbol of freedom for the new generations and he's fine with that Cucciolla plays Sacco an ordinary man who wants to live and who is having trouble accepting his new condition as a man charged with murder. Cucciolla received a prize in Cannes for his performance in this movie over Volont and I have to say it wasn't undeserved. His subdued reserved performance was the right touch that makes him the focus point of the viewer's sympathies.Sacco and Vanzetti is a great movie a beautiful movie that tells an interesting episode about American history that is often ignored  the racism discrimination and suspicion against immigrants. Like any other country the USA has an official history that is more mythology than truth that is inevitable to all nations in their construction of a national identity but I'm glad there will always be movies like these to continue to deflate the myths and reveal the truth. I just hope there will always be viewers for them too.".

There's no feeling of what the country was going through during the politically turbulent 1920s when anarchists communists and other radicals were being deported en masse. The film relies on courtroom proceedings that are confusing rather than enlightening.

In its genre probably the best thing to hit the screens since Capra rounded  them up over half a century ago.The story itself is nothing extraordinary. Set in Washington it is a simple tale of love between lobbyist Sidney Wade and widow President Andrew Sheperd. Flung into love they both encounter obstacles as both opposition and political differences tear them apart. No need to worry though all is well that ends well. And Reiner is not the one to slip one on us.What makes this film shine above most are not the development of characters or the underdeveloped political statements. Its the achievement of giving audiences 90 minutes of pure bliss. Douglas is lovable as president Beattys spouse makes you jealous as always J. Fox never misses an opportunity to display huge talent and Dreyfuss is just the kind of guy you love to hate. Add a dose of victorious political correctness and top it of with a final speech that raises the hair on any kinds of neck but rednecks and you got your evening made.Enjoy !".

	schema:reviewBody "Is there a genre that Rob Reiner can't work in and make successful?  He captured comedy beautifully with The Sure Thing.  Music was brilliant with This is Spinal Tap.  Horror?  How about Misery?  Courtroom drama was awesome with A Few Good Men.  And now we have a political dramacomedy.  There is nothing this man can't do.This movie works inspite of people's claims that it is too political.  Well you know what it's about the president of the United States of America there's going to be a bit of poiltics in it.  And guess what guns do kill people so to have an issue at hand here that deals with gun control is applaudable.Okay that's out of the way let's talk about the film itself.  Because it is wonderful.  It is funny well acted and it is written with a good ear.The cast in this film is one to be envied by almost everyone except Oliver Stone and Robert Altman who seem to get everyone to do their films.  But here we have Douglas as the president Sheen as his aid Michael J. Fox Samantha Mathis Annette Bening as Sydney Ellen Wade and in my favourite performance Richard Dreyfuss as the sniveling weasle Senator Bob Rumsen.As the story goes the president's character gets questioned when he  a widow  finds a girlfriend in Sydney Wade.  The issues are handled wonderfully here.  Nothing is really tiptoed around as the script writer  Aaron Sorkin  writes a brave script about what is right and wrong with being the president and having a girlfriend.I personally liked the politics in the film.  I enjoyed how Shepherd decides to ignore the critisism leveled at him until the very end when he gives one of the best written speeches I've ever seen in film.  And when he flexes his authoritative muscles you feel his power you feel that the president has spoken.  And I was moved.  This is a great film and one that should be checked out for sure.  I also found it to be interesting that the character in the film that tries to get the issue of gun control brought to the forefront is Michael J. Fox.  He is Canadian and we don't have problems with guns here.  Is it a coincidence  probably  that he was chosen to play this role?  Or was it done deliberately?  Interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great feel good movie about a charismatic essentially very decent fictional U.S. President played by Michael Douglas in an extremely likable role. It's a political story as well as a love story. Douglas is both commanding  assured in his presidential role and charming  endearing in his romantic role. If anyone has not yet seen this movie you'll discover you're in for an unexpected treat. There's something here for everyone...romance comedy politics and drama. Andrew Shepherd is a youngish popular President soon up for re election. Pressure is being put to bear on him to consolidate his administration's high poll ratings by pushing through a moderate crime bill which totally lacks Republican party support yet is considered too weak by the Democrats. Meanwhile he finds himself attracted to Sydney Wade an environmental lobbyist who is seeking legislation to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. Shepherd has been widowed for three years and currently needs an escort for a State Dinner in honour of the President of France. He invites Sydney to this function and during this  subsequent encounters the pair fall in love. Trouble ensues when Shepherd is torn between the politically expedient crime bill and the environmental legislation he has promised his new love interest. In terms of romance there is the ongoing love story between the widowed President and the young lobbyist Sydney charmingly played by Annette Benning. This lovely and intelligent lady is quite smitten but at first obviously a bit overwhelmed by it all feeling awkward and uncertain as the President's date. Sydney looks absolutely radiant at the state ball as she is swept off her feet by this handsome leader of the free world. Their chemistry proves to be electric the dialogue clever and the potential sexual situations quite tasteful by modern standards. Naturally the course of true love never does run smooth so it goes without saying that additionally this unusual fishbowl courtship would have some unique problems as politics and public opinion intrude upon the couple's personal life.A certain built in comedy natural for a dating President makes this romance all the more enchanting. For instance when Andrew attempts to buy his sweetheart some roses can't you just imagine the national crisis that all but ensues? Despite his position as Head of State Andrew likes to do his courting the old fashioned personal way. During his initial phone call to Sydney she believes he's one of her friends pulling a prank which of course results in some hilarity.Naturally this tale is ripe with politics and some reviewers even claim that the film is something of a precursor to TV's West Wing. Shepherd faces the dilemma of being forced to choose between the crime bill that his party is after him to push versus Sydney's particular environmental cause. Not only party politics but there is waning public support to consider. Needless to say the President has no lack of advisers around who are more than eager to state their views giving at times unsolicited advice. Martin Sheen plays his Chief of Staff and Michael J. Fox is cast as his Domestic Policy adviser. Shepherd must also contend with mud slinging by a nasty unscrupulous rival Senator portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss who calls into question both Shepherd's family values and his girlfriend's activist past. By the way any liberal political bias presented in this movie proved totally inoffensive to me. I definitely didn't sense that the producers had a nefarious grand agenda here.Drama wise there's a touching close relationship depicted between the President and his charming young teenage daughter Lucy and a definite sense of his loneliness following the death of his wife from cancer. Also Shepherd is confronted with the choice of keeping his promise to Sydney versus salvaging his political career. His Oval Office moral dilemmas are not only relevant to the Presidency but can be extrapolated to any person in any career.This film delivers a powerful message about both personal and presidential integrity. At one point there's a moving speech that is inspiring for anyone but may give American viewers in particular cause for reflection about the real significance of their country's Presidency and the qualities they might want to look for in the person elected to that office. Personally I was practically ready to start flying the Stars and Stripes and I'm not even American! Whatever the nation involved pity we don't have more Andrew Shepherds in political life today.".

With a top notch cast and production values The American President is the continuation of an old Hollywood tradition of films where nobility wins out in the game of politics. While that might seem like a bad thing the fact is the film is all the better for it.First off there's the cast. Michael Douglas gives one of his finest performances as President Andrew Shepherd. The same can be said of his love interest and costar Annette Benning in her performance as lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade. Together they have a strong chemistry whether it be the film's comedic romantic or dramatic moments. Then there's the supporting cast. Martin Sheen Anna Deavere Smith Samantha Mathis David Paymer and Michael J. Fox give fantastic performances as the White House staff with Sheen and Fox in particular getting moments to shine. Richard Dreyfuss gives a delicious performance as Presidential contender Bob Rumson. Even in the small roles the actors like Joshua Malina and John Mahoney give good performances.The film's production values are just as strong as its cast. The White House sets are excellent and give the feeling of being in the real place. The same can be said of virtually all the sets in the film. Also of special mention is the score by Marc Shaiman especially in the opening credits of the film. Then there is the script by Arraon Sorkin. Sorkin's effortlessly blends together the elements of a good romantic comedy and a good political based film to create a hybrid of the two. Unlike other attempts at mixing comedysatire with a political film that often end up failing to be successful as either such as the more recent film Man of the Year for instance here it works. In one scene you can have a speech about something political and have a romantic comedy scene the next. The result is that the styles don't clash but rather compliment each other nicely. It's easy to see where the genesis of Sorkin's later magnum opus The West Wing came from.The American President is a first rate film. With its top notch performances excellent production values and a first rate script it's hard to beat that. The only shame of the film is the fact it didn't any major awards because it definitely deserved to.".

	schema:headline " Tries to do both falls flat";
	schema:reviewBody "Rob Reiner used to put out some darn funny satires.  Unfortunately for this film he didn't even try.  On the one hand is the syrupy fluff story of a widowed president falling in love with an activist.  In other words a chick flick.  Then it switches gears by ramming leftwing rhetoric down your throat and attempting to make itself an important film.  Not only can the fluffier aspect not mesh well with the serious portion but it also effectively alienates half the audience as well as everyone else who went in expecting a light romance and got a nice helping of propaganda instead. I'm amazed this later shaped into the West Wing but at least that series is not hampered by trying to do too many things at once. While still leftwing in rhetoric the weekly format allows it to switch gears more effectively and thus makes itself more palatable for entertainment.  Trying to cram that into a movie fails miserably.  If you're looking for a good light presidential comedy go rent Dave.  If you're looking for something more meaningful skip this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "The American President can't decide whether it wants to be a syrupy fairytale romance or an antiRepublican rant.  The film ends up with a foot in both camps which makes for a very awkward and uneven tone indeed. Though the current administration scares me silly I used to have quite strong conservative leanings and I felt patronized and irritated by this movie's constant simplistic criticism of rightwing values.  It attempts to defend Clinton by presenting a sanitized version of that particular President.  If you're going to defend Clinton then REALLY defend him don't do Clinton lite with a lite version of his scandals.  The Republican characters are all as you might expect dumb as bricks and it's up to Michael Douglas to call a press conference and blast them all for being prejudiced fearmongers.  Way to go Michael. Now I don't mind political commentary in a film if it's at all well done. But this film stereotypes liberals and conservatives alike and has about the sophistication level you'd expect from a political treatise written by a pdoff 15yearold.The movie is hypocritical too because it creates a very passive and flighty character in the form of Sydney Ellen Wade Annette Bening annoying as all Hell in this movie.  Wade takes a deferential reverential and generally submissive posture towards the President which certainly undermines this film's claims to politicalsocial Enlightenment.  The woman's a chattering nitwit who supports that most popular of causes  environmentalism  instead of expressing her opinions on a really controversial issue like abortion for example.  In short she's about as feminist as lowriding jeans and her attachment to the President becomes a sort of Disneylike tale of wish fulfillment based entirely on a powerful man.  Eeww. Believe it or not this was my exgirlfriend's favorite movie nice to know that good taste continues to thrive in this day and age eh?.  When I complained that the politics alienated me she screeched back that it was the story she liked not the message.  What story?  What message?  This whole thing can be boiled down to the statement It would be nice to date a Democrat President.  And it would be death to date a Republican one presumably.  Pathetic.".

And how unlikely these thing don't usually go together.What makes it work? Everything! I know deep down that this isn't a masterpiece a Citizen Kane or Godfather kind of movie. But it is in its own way perfect. It's funny as can beendlessly witty or sarcastic or actually cleverly funny. It's acted to a T including of course the two leads Michael Douglas in his alpha male with a personable side and Annette Bening in her utterly charming and disarmingly sharp warmth.It's almost impossible to appreciate the huge list of side characters who are first rate through and through even in their very brief roles. Richard Dreyfuss might be the least of these since he plays an obvious stereotype. Michael J. Fox is funny and quick and Martin Sheen is quasipresidential as he needs to be since of course via West Wing he later becomes the president.But not here. This is the story of Douglas and Bening. It presages the excellent British version  in its own way Love Actually with Hugh Grant and an equally big cast of excellent extras but that was more purely feelgood or feelincrediblygood and this one eight years earlier actually has a political axe to grind.In fact I'm going to guess that one reason for the slightly deflated ratings is the conservative audience didn't really like what the president stands for here and though it is just a movie it's easier to root for the cast when they tend to agree with you. And agree in emphatic eloquent ways. There is a speech Douglas as president gives toward the end that comes out and boldly takes a simple stand for decent liberal values. He's confident clear and unwavering. And if you agree with that kind of thing I do you want to say hurrah.And you want our own darned president to say what he believes so simply and with such firmness.Of course all of this is simplified and made too easy. Luckily it's not only about politics. In fact it's a comedy or manners you might say the protocol of who to behave with and near the president being fodder for great laughs just as much as the Victorian plays and movies had fun with the same twists of expectations. No wonder it morphed into a hit television seriesthough oddly enough the humor gets minimized. Maybe the same kinds of jokes wear themselves out.Rob Reiner is maybe our most astute politically astute director at least when there is a sense of humor required. He cut his teeth in every way with the best working with and under Norman Lear in years of shooting and performing as Meathead in All in the Family. It shows here. He has a real knack for timing for turning absurdity to wit and for warmth. He probably got some of that from the Smothers Brothers too. If you like this don't stop hereReiner has many other good or possibly great movies many getting better reviews than this one.But here we have The American President deceptively simple in its title. This is above all a really cozy movie. You want to watch and you want to be there. At least for a couple hours.I sound foolish liking this silly movie too much but there you have it.".

And this is all directed by Rob Reiner the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge power and presence required to make a first class film. Of particular note are David Paymer Michael J. Fox and Anna Deavere Smith all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film. Paymer is the perfect foil to Fox and Anna balances them perfectly giving a unity to the staff presence in the film. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of 'normal' events in the White House during the romance. We are not excluded or merely clued in but we participate in all the activities of the President which makes the film more realistic and visceral. The flow of the film is exceptional since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us and the cinematography is amazing. The sets are perfect. Rated PG13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity this film is far from offensive in its delivery its demeanor or its presentation. A classic which will enhance any collection.".

Some of the political aspects were strange and confusing but that's just the nature of politics is it not?The story is actually rather original at least I think it is.  It's basically about a widower president that decides it's time to move on with his life and pursue other opportunities if you catch my drift.  The story is very well done from start to finish and really has a lot of good things to say about politics the media relationships and what not.All the cast members involved did a fantastic job.  I'm not a huge fan of Michael Douglas not really sure why but he did a superb job and played a VERY likeable fun president.  Someone that you would really like to know. Martin Sheen also played an extraordinary Chief of Staff for the president and also played a very likeable guy.  Michael J. Fox did an excellent job with a role that I didn't expect great things from.  Michael deserves a great deal of credit for his role in this film.  Annette Bening...WOW!  She did a great job with her role and looks better than ever throughout the entire film.  I really liked her character she also played a very warm and likeable character.  Samantha Mathis had a somewhat small role in the film but nonetheless a very important one.  She really did a great job with her role and also looks fantastic throughout the film.  Finally Richard Dreyfuss.  He also played a very small role but an extremely important role and did a great job.  While he wasn't a very likeable character he wasn't supposed to be liked he played it perfectly.  Some other great supporting cast members include David Paymer Anne Haney Nina Siemaszko Wendie Malick and John Mahoney.I should also mention director Rob Reiner.  This guy is just great he really does a fantastic job directing his films.  This is another great film to add to his already impressive list of credits.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that likes lighthearted comedies andor just romantic comedies.  This really is an excellent film and ought to be seen.  I hope that you will enjoy the film as much as I did. Thanks for readingChris".

	schema:reviewBody "The American President was the source of the later dramatic television series success The West Wing. Apparently statist influencers in the U.S. have become so successful at warping the real by spin that many people could not understand this seminal film especially those incompetent reviewers who masquerade as professional critics.

All this widower president wants at the beginning is a date with a feisty environmental lobbyist later he wants her as a girl friend and vice versa with a a chance to explore their growing relationship. This simple human dignity is compromised as a right by the opposition party's leading candidate who uses innuendo and false headlining to undermine the man's public popularity and threaten two vital bills both the president and the lobbyist are trying to get through a stonewalling Congress. Rob Reiner directs in a serious and lyrical way dialogue and character revelations that in lesser hands might have been slow or worse in my judgment the pace never falters for an instant. Aaron Sorkin 's memorable script takes in issues personalities levels of relationship and supervision that I believe were both difficult and rewarding with uncommon precision and skill.

This centrality leading to unforgettable scenes is a quality only the best films possessThe Guns of Navarone The Fountainhead Gone With the Wind and Bend of the River for instance. In a comedy this is a rare achievement therefore. Marc Shaiman's music is unobtrusive and occasionally moving Gloria Gresham's costumes and the production design by Lilly Kilvert aid the film's hardwon credibility. Cinematography by John Seale and Art Direction by John Warnke are outstandingly believable.

	schema:reviewBody "No offence to Michael Douglas but I'm not a fan of his movies but in The American President I thought he was brilliant and enjoyed watching him in the movie. He makes the character very charming warm and compassionate.This film was really the first to show the audience an insight into The White House and what it is like for the President all the problems and dilemmas he has to go through and the expectations ordinary people have for their elected officials. In this film Michael Douglas plays the President who has a daughter and has had to juggle his job with raising his daughter after his wife died and the public have been sympathetic to him but a threat comes along in the guise of Sydney Ellen Wade played by Annette Bening who Andrew Shepherd takes an interest in and wants to have a relationship with but soon the relationship is under scrutiny and everything from his and her pasts are used to undermine them.What I find interesting about the film is that American schools teach their students about their government. I think the UK is lacking in this as there is no effort to teach kids about their government and as a result they don't care about politics and that is a shame.The film is intelligent and yet Rob Reiner does it in such a way that anyone can understand what is being said and you don't need to have an degree to gasp what lies beneath the words.Richard Dreyfuss plays a right pantomime villain in this I found myself hissing at him every time he came on the screen and he really played him well as this smug unscrupulous person who uses muck to discredit Shepherd's character but can't discredit the president's policies.Annette Bening is just great in this. She is funny and beautiful and has some of the most amusing scenes. Scenes such as her trying to walk out the wrong door in the oval office and not knowing the President was on the phone and her thinking it was a prank.I have to say I love Michael J. Fox in this Personally I think he had some of the best lines in the film. His character looks up to the President and you see him wanting his idol to speak up and tell the American people the way it is and not the way Rumson is telling it.Martin Sheen is the President's adviser in this and then went on to become the President in The West Wing.A fine cast inspiring writing especially at the end and a talented director made this film so popular with the audience.".

President Andrew Sheppard played by Michael Douglas engages in several conversations and even arguments about what it means to be in his position and how that affects the way he serves his constituents the American public.  His last speech rings true besides his views that favor obviously to the left of the political spectrum he makes honest comments about how politicians win elections and how that affects their ability to do their job.I consider this movie to be a basic cinematic course in understanding the American Presidency and political elements that invariably surround it.  It may come off as a leftwing liberally biased film but it makes no confusion about the fact that whether they are Democrats or Republicans politicians have their flaws and unscrupulous methods of keeping their position of power including the President himself.

	schema:reviewBody "There have been a lot of changes in American politics since this was released but at the time Rob Reiner was probably motivated to produce this because of the election of Americas first babyboom president a couple of years earlier. In doing this he attempts to shed some light on the complex political system in Washington DC perhaps for a new generation of Americans but certainly for those who are fascinated by American politics. It's not just the political horse trading that goes on for votes or even the power and influence that lobbyists hold but also how the manipulation of polls ultimately determine policy making. More importantly by the 1990's the baby boom generation who were immersed in the social changes and civil rights movements in the late 60's and early 1970's either as liberals or conservatives were now in government either as democrats or republicans. Therefore the script for the American President reflected the cultural clash of that time period playing out in national politics during the 90's.For example in the USA the American left want to expand the role of government in all facets of life even though very few people demand this. They focus on global warming and international agreements over climate change and attempt to control inner city gun violence which is really drug related as well as promoting gay marriage. None of these issues concerns or benefit the urban middle class the rural blue collar working class or average voter who are the ones playing by the rules and are trying to get ahead.On the other hand the right complain about the demise of moral standards and the strains on the traditional nuclear family. Yet they are often unable to live up to the high standards that they preach and are caught out having extra marital affairs flirting with collage interns or chasing congressional page boys. Military service is the most honorable thing a patriot can do but many of them and their immediate family members find better or more lucrative things to do than serve themselves and are happy to send others over seas to do the fighting. Illegal immigration is a real problem but often it is disclosed that many people that they hire as nannies and gardeners don't have a valid green card. Lastly big government is good if it's spending that they want! None of these although embarrassing indiscretions for what they proclaim to stand for affects the quality of life of the middle class either. Americas' first baby boomer President not only never served in uniform but avoided service in the Vietnam war he experimented with drugs and over the years fooled around with other women while at the same time being married. His ambitious wife aware of these affairs not only shrugged this off but was determined to get involved in policy making in the white how and was quite happy putting the political boot in. This was all in sharp contrast to the traditional nonpolitical role the first lady tended to take. The right did not like this type of relationship and it became a political issue at the time.What follows is largely a cosy easy going romantic comedy and the film touches on a few of these hot button political issues. The fictional President here was Andrew Shepard Michael Douglas a single parent a former history professor and governor from the state of Wisconsin. Elected by a small margin largely on the back of sympathy because his wife died during the campaign he also had the burden of receiving a very small winning percentage of the vote.This time the ambitious woman is Sydney Ellen Wade a pushy sassy feminist heavyhitter from the lobbying and political consultancy world of Washington DC. Having taken a fancy to Wade the widowed Shepard seeking intimacy has to fight off republican criticism that he is dishonoring the white house by having a relationship with her while not being married. If only Reiner was to know what was to later be disclosed in the real white house a couple of years later!! This is red meat for his political opponents but he refuses to be drawn into something he regards as a private matter. However the attacks on his character and the campaign to bring Wade down by portraying her as a radical or extremist eventually takes a political toll consequently his job approval numbers go into free fall.Also during this there is an subplot when Shepard has to respond to a terrorist act linked to Libya. Because of his lack of military experience and needing to look tough for domestic political purposes he orders a retaliatory attack on the Libyan intelligence building in a decisive and proportional response. On this occasion the unlucky recipients on the receiving end of a smart bomb are the janitors working the night shift. The intelligence agents presumably responsible for the original terrorist act know that it is coming and are setting up shop somewhere else. Shepard is not sure of the real benefit of this but gives the order knowing full well that he is beholden to the domestic political reality of not wanting to be seen as weak.In the end Shepard comes out swinging and seems to get the upper hand over his political enemies although in this case the movie ends as soon as gets the last word! Never the less it's still an entertaining and watch able movie with a fine supporting cast i.e. Michael J Fox Annette Benning and Martin Sheen. No doubt this inspired NBC's the  West Wing and in all intensive purposes could easily have been a pilot for the series!".

More importantly by the 1990's the baby boom generation who were immersed in the social changes and civil rights movements in the late 60's and early 1970's either as liberals or conservatives were now in government either as democrats or republicans. Therefore the script for the American President reflected the cultural clash of that time period playing out in national politics during the 90's.For example in the USA the American left want to expand the role of government in all facets of life even though very few people demand this. They focus on global warming and international agreements over climate change and attempt to control inner city gun violence which is really drug related as well as promoting gay marriage. None of these issues concerns or benefit the urban middle class the rural blue collar working class or average voter who are the ones playing by the rules and are trying to get ahead.On the other hand the right complain about the demise of moral standards and the strains on the traditional nuclear family. Yet they are often unable to live up to the high standards that they preach and are caught out having extra marital affairs flirting with collage interns or chasing congressional page boys. Military service is the most honorable thing a patriot can do but many of them and their immediate family members find better or more lucrative things to do than serve themselves and are happy to send others over seas to do the fighting. Illegal immigration is a real problem but often it is disclosed that many people that they hire as nannies and gardeners don't have a valid green card. Lastly big government is good if it's spending that they want! None of these although embarrassing indiscretions for what they proclaim to stand for affects the quality of life of the middle class either. Americas' first baby boomer President not only never served in uniform but avoided service in the Vietnam war he experimented with drugs and over the years fooled around with other women while at the same time being married. His ambitious wife aware of these affairs not only shrugged this off but was determined to get involved in policy making in the white how and was quite happy putting the political boot in. This was all in sharp contrast to the traditional nonpolitical role the first lady tended to take. The right did not like this type of relationship and it became a political issue at the time.What follows is largely a cosy easy going romantic comedy and the film touches on a few of these hot button political issues. The fictional President here was Andrew Shepard Michael Douglas a single parent a former history professor and governor from the state of Wisconsin. Elected by a small margin largely on the back of sympathy because his wife died during the campaign he also had the burden of receiving a very small winning percentage of the vote.This time the ambitious woman is Sydney Ellen Wade a pushy sassy feminist heavyhitter from the lobbying and political consultancy world of Washington DC. Having taken a fancy to Wade the widowed Shepard seeking intimacy has to fight off republican criticism that he is dishonoring the white house by having a relationship with her while not being married. If only Reiner was to know what was to later be disclosed in the real white house a couple of years later!! This is red meat for his political opponents but he refuses to be drawn into something he regards as a private matter. However the attacks on his character and the campaign to bring Wade down by portraying her as a radical or extremist eventually takes a political toll consequently his job approval numbers go into free fall.Also during this there is an subplot when Shepard has to respond to a terrorist act linked to Libya. Because of his lack of military experience and needing to look tough for domestic political purposes he orders a retaliatory attack on the Libyan intelligence building in a decisive and proportional response. On this occasion the unlucky recipients on the receiving end of a smart bomb are the janitors working the night shift. The intelligence agents presumably responsible for the original terrorist act know that it is coming and are setting up shop somewhere else. Shepard is not sure of the real benefit of this but gives the order knowing full well that he is beholden to the domestic political reality of not wanting to be seen as weak.In the end Shepard comes out swinging and seems to get the upper hand over his political enemies although in this case the movie ends as soon as gets the last word! Never the less it's still an entertaining and watch able movie with a fine supporting cast i.e. Michael J Fox Annette Benning and Martin Sheen. No doubt this inspired NBC's the  West Wing and in all intensive purposes could easily have been a pilot for the series!";

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Douglas who is most well known for his enormous skill in playing stolid villains or regular men who become desperate because they manage to get themselves in way over their head puts off these characteristics to play the part of the President of the United States and he delivers a towering performance in this role. The story is based on the fact that President Andrew Shephard Douglas will soon be facing reelection an election which may be compromised by the fact that he is developing a romantic interest in an envorinmental lobbyist named Sydney Ellen Wade played beautifully by Annette Bening. Matters are complicated by the fact that Shephard's wife died just before he was elected in the first place and his cabinet members particularly Lewis Rothschild played by Michael J. Fox are urgently trying to persuade him not to date during the election.One of the strange things about this movie is that it's kind of ironic that no one has really made a political film like this that centers around a romance involving the President. Indeed watching a man as powerful as the U.S. President using his powers to flirt with someone that he has a crush on okay that sounded pretty dumb. Maybe no one's done it before because it sounds ridiculous in writing! trying at the same time to persuade her that he really is the President. While it doesn't exactly SOUND like it would make the greatest film this premise has resulted in the exceedingly superior romantic comedy that we see in The American President.The performances in the film are spectacular throughout but it's actually the script that deserves even more attention than the actors' performances which is a rare distinction in a film. I think that the reason that The American President succeeds so well as a political film as well as a romantic comedy is that both elements are so realistically presented. I think it was Roger Ebert who praised The American President for approaching and handling real issues such as gun control and the environment instead of sidestepping this and trying to present a President who is not taking any certain stands on any certain issues that might cause the film's audience to like him or the movie less.  The love story one of the easiest things in the cinematic medium to completely screw up is done brilliantly here largely because of the occupations of the two subjects that it centers on as well as the excellent script. The movie has a nearly endless amount of comments to make about the American Presidency the way that the public sees the office and the restrictions that it places on its occupants. There is a pleasant irony between such things as President Shephard's ability to get Wade on the phone when she doesn't even have a phone of her own hey I'm a poet and I didn't even realize it but his complementary inability to even bring her to the house for a nice innocent dinner. President Andrew Shephard is faced with the unfortunate task of trying to appease the American public retain his position in the White House convince Sydney Ellen Wade that he is who he says he is and that he is genuinely interested in her and provide for his own romantic happiness with the added conflict that if any one of them fails all of the others are likely to fail as well. It's true that this being a rather lighthearted romantic comedy we already know how the film is going to end but brilliant dialogue a fascinating story unusually interesting characters and a tense political atmosphere prevent the material from getting boring just because we really already know how it's going to turn out in the end. Besides that the romance in the film is so well done that that element alone makes it worth watching. There's a scene in the film when President Shephard and Wade are dancing in a crowded dinner hall and she asks him what people are going to think about the whole situation wondering who that woman is and why the President is dancing with her. In an example of the brilliance of the script as well as the reason that the romantic plot of the film succeeds so well Shephard responds Sydney Ellen Wade because she said yes.'  You see romance CAN be done right sometimes.".

He soon discovers the horror of what is in the boxes while he is pursued by a murderous gang.It's always very refreshing to see movies from countries with little cinematic output. And that's exactly the situation in the case of 7 Boxes which showcases the cinema of Paraguay. It shares the Latin American energy that so many other films from that part of the world have. But it also does feel specifically Paraguayan with convincing and realistic characters and a very authentic setting. It's a crime thriller but it does differentiate itself from many other films of that type where even the chief bad guy is at least a little sympathetic. He does what he does ultimately for his sick son. He ends up going down his path because he cannot afford the medicine. He like the other characters is motivated as a result of the socioeconomic situation in which he cannot escape. The movie suggests the hardships and poverty of the lives of the characters can result in some harsh choices.The acting from the entire cast is good all round. The two kids at the centre of the story hold things together very well while there are some memorable characters in the periphery such as the bungling kidnappers. There is a good mix of suspense and comedy while the direction is stylish when it needs to be taking time to get to know the characters as well. The film ends with all of the strands of the story coming together in a satisfying finale. And when it ends you can't help hoping there will be more films from Paraguay.".

If that was the case I'd be subjected to the best campaign or best overrated generic masterpiece of lately. Truly I cherish independent cinema distributors because they allow the opportunity to catch a gem like 7 Boxes to stimulate our senses and restore the belief that there is actually magic in the movies.The very dynamic and creative story never fails to capture or interests grabbing from the very beginning as it establishes the mood introduces the main characters the exotic setting and lights the fuse that will lead through a breathtaking and explosive ride and quite a fantastic ending.Here is a world full of poverty audacity competition and the desire to survive regardless of the mean. People appear to be hungry because they're not afraid to gamble their very existence for a few dollars. We see the basic activity at the core of the film an exchange of services. Be there and make a few bucks so you can buy a sandwich a hot dog or a very coveted cell phone. Victor a young man is one of those people who offer to carry your merchandise with their makeshift wheelbarrows. By pure look he appears to get a chance make a delivery that will bag him a 100 dollars a fortune in his world. Everyone including him understand there must be some shady in the nature of the merchandise. One just doesn't ask questions because it usually leads more complicated and dangerous situations.As we expected many people set their eyes on the merchandise and through a plot line that appears a bit complicated and a bit contrived at first we get going and this is where the film explodes with an originality sorely missing from American movies. This had origins on some very exciting planning and every detail appears to be fleshed out leaving nothing unattended. In the end no matter how impossible the turn might seem it makes complete sense.The seven boxes soon find their way in and out of the boy's hands and the butchers who asked for their delivery soon find themselves in a more dangerous situation because of a misunderstood conversation that invites other parties to become involved in the twisted search for the boxes. Soon we have some shady characters transvestites some clueless policemen a very interesting Korean Romeo abused girlfriends some feral street children and well the mysterious content of the boxes.Everything about the film shines with originality and it throws sparks at every turn. The editing and imaginative camera work shows us that there is still hope for those who have an eye to blend clever writing with dynamic camerawork not relying too much on technique or special effects or the overuse of colorful language. What is fresh here is how a simple metaphor referring to merchandise or a certain food can take some shadings. At times we fear its mention and at others we can't stop laughing at the reference.I found that setting the film in the slums and in the middle of this market teaming with all kinds of transactions dealing with food items or even human trade never appears to overtake the solid acting by all the performers. Unlike films that trying to much with their verbosity and reliance on a naked body a flash of a cleavage or a loud soundtrack that if any detracts us from the action 7 Boxes looks inside the characters by showing us what they yearn giving us real relationships and showing the warts in the characters. The young people have grown a thick skin because they live in their own version of hell and we see the inside of kitchens the division of classes as a young couple can't make payment for the medication that might save a child's life and how normal a robbery appears where it's shown for what it really is without calling too much attention to itself telling us watch how fantastic my direction and my writing is. We never forget it is a movie but it is so well directed and acted that it never loses that authentic touch.Most important we arrive to the conclusion with a full realization that every deed has a consequence and that evil is contagious and affects even those who might appear to be innocent. We learn that information is valuable and that no encounter is to be considered meaningless. A look is really worth a thousand words and necessity is truly the mother of invention and creativity both in the movie and the way a movie is made. It appears that working with limited resources and not having the most recognizable faces in the world might actually produce better results.A few years ago a little film called Slumdog Millionaire gave us hope the silver screen muse was alive and kicking. As of late it appears the muse lives mostly in foreign films. Hopefully it will be make a return to American films so we can enjoy a true golden era again. Bleaching the color out of a film padding the conversations with unnecessary convolution doesn't make the movies better and Shakespeare himself wrote for the masses and I am sure he knew how the four letter words of his time but somehow we fail to find them in his plays making it obvious that they are not essential to the success of the piece.

	schema:headline " An excellent movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Who said all movie series become worse with every installment? Lethal Weapon 4 is probably the best fourth movie in a series ever. I find it incredible that the magic is still there. The main characters still feed of each other and their friendship both on set and off set is clearly felt in every scene they have together. Mel Gibson has finally laid the ghost of his wife to rest and is as chipper as ever. He does this without seeming truly obnoxious even though that is a part of his character. In fact he seems more likable in this film than he did in all the previous films. Danny Glover reprises his role from the previous movies and that is not a bad thing because the Murtaugh role is the best of his career. Rene Ruso returns in her part and although it has been cut down considerably its still a decent role. Joe Pesci is also back and this time around he gets to add some depth to the character something that was missing in the previous film. Chris Rock is decent. He isn't much of an actor but he is pretty funny and fresh. His part also adds a little something to the allround comedy of the film but if you want to know what it is you will have to watch the movie yourself. Jet Li is the villain in this movie and while he is the weakest villain in the series acting wise he is definitely the most menacing.The action is still brilliant despite the fact that the actors are getting older. The story is decent for a fourth film and the overall execution is brilliant. I actually prefer this film to the second and third of the series because I find it to be more entertaining overall.

	onyx:emotionText "Who said all movie series become worse with every installment? Lethal Weapon 4 is probably the best fourth movie in a series ever. I find it incredible that the magic is still there. The main characters still feed of each other and their friendship both on set and off set is clearly felt in every scene they have together. Mel Gibson has finally laid the ghost of his wife to rest and is as chipper as ever. He does this without seeming truly obnoxious even though that is a part of his character. In fact he seems more likable in this film than he did in all the previous films. Danny Glover reprises his role from the previous movies and that is not a bad thing because the Murtaugh role is the best of his career. Rene Ruso returns in her part and although it has been cut down considerably its still a decent role. Joe Pesci is also back and this time around he gets to add some depth to the character something that was missing in the previous film. Chris Rock is decent. He isn't much of an actor but he is pretty funny and fresh. His part also adds a little something to the allround comedy of the film but if you want to know what it is you will have to watch the movie yourself. Jet Li is the villain in this movie and while he is the weakest villain in the series acting wise he is definitely the most menacing.The action is still brilliant despite the fact that the actors are getting older. The story is decent for a fourth film and the overall execution is brilliant. I actually prefer this film to the second and third of the series because I find it to be more entertaining overall. It cuts down on the seriousness even though its still there and adds a lot to the comedy and this is a very good choice.All in all an excellent film. Highly recommendable for all fans of action movies and the series in particular.810";

Also Murtaugh Glover is about to be a granddaddy to a baby by his oldest daughter and she is secretly married to Detective Butters Chris Rock which everyone is keeping a secret from him.Add to this the fact that both they are now taking on one of the most powerful crime syndicates in the world the Chinese Triads in an effort to stop slave trading and money laundering. The task of a bad guy this time goes to Jet Li who made his American debut atleast from an American Film Company in this movie. Yes this is the movie which launched him here in the states and he deserved it.This movie is as good as the rest of them though nothing beats part 2 in my opinion. Lethal Weapon 4 really hits home on a lot of subjects such as facing responsibility to coming to terms with who you are. And it ended the series in a way that makes you smile and love it even more.I give it a 9 out of 10.".

It was enjoyable to see the characters we love deal with the inevitabilities of aging and the fierce loyalty of friendship. Some of the mystery is gone and it feels like a pair of comfortable shoes. But aren't those shoes your favorite ones? It was interesting to see the development of Lorna and Riggs' relationship as well as the growing up of the Murtaugh kids. It makes you feel like you're catching up with old friends at a reunion! Plenty of action and the incredible work of Jet Li make this movie a favorite at my house. Overall a great wrapup to the series and a lot of fun for long time fans. Worth seeing! If the language is a real issue watch for it on TNT and enjoy the edited version.".

My favorite part of the movie is where Joe Pesci has a little argument with Danny Glover and the constant mistakes by Mel saying the name of Cris Rock's character are hilarious. The roof top jumping and the last fight with Jet Li was also great. So if you haven't seen this get some some money from your parents and go and rent it!!!".

It is quite entertaining and fun to watch with some very great actors that have some very great chemistry between each other.Mel Gibson and Danny Glover fit like a glove and Joe Pesci is perfect as the comedy relief not being like the recent side kicks we always see that are so obnoxious we want to punch them. Mr. Pesci is a very talented actor and he always makes me laugh whether it's Lethal Weapon 4 or Raging Bull and Casino.Rene Russo provides Mel's love interest yet again and though I found the marriage thing a bit of a throwin it was still good for the story. It provided some laughs at the end of the film.Chris Rock stars in one role where his character is not completely annoying or loudmouthed mainly because he wasn't extremely famous yet and had only been on SNL and a few small roles in film... Joes Pesci and him throw back and forth a few insults and jokes and bounce off each other which helps me welcom Rock a bit more.Jet Li's first American film I believe proves he can be a quite and intriguing character which later helped him get roles in films like Kiss of the Dragon and The One.Another thing about this franchise is that director Richard Donner directed all four films and it's always good to use the original director for a sequel rather than a lesser director as we have countless examples of. especially horror films!From the opening jazz music we have come to love Lethal Weapon provides enough entertainment and fun to keep one entertained and it's definitely worth watching. I hope they stop while they're ahead and do not make another Lethal Weapon film because it's rare for a film series to still be entertaining and imaginative after these many sequels. 35 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "By this point in the series it seems that they just aren't trying as hard with these films which is kind of a shame. The Lethal Weapon series is really a good group of action films but part 4 doesn't really seem to take itself seriously. It clearly had the biggest budget and probably some of the most elaborate stunts and action scenes as well as some of the most exciting such as that thrilling freeway chase scene but many of the other elements of the film have deteriorated badly. I think that with the addition of Chris Rock while he delivered a satisfactory performance as far as the role that he was playing caused the film to detract into too much goofy comedy which unnecessarily diverted attention away from the surprisingly interesting smuggling plot involving illegal Chinese immigrants and counterfeit money. Joe Pesci was just as funny as ever which is probably the reason the Chris Rock actually took away from the film as a whole. Pesci is all the comic relief that a Lethal Weapon movie ever needed and Rock is another substantial addition of comic relief that just isn't necessary. Danny Glover and Mel Gibson work great together for the fourth time I'm beginning to wonder if they couldn't go on with this great duo forever. And of course Renee Russo is back with her and Riggs picking up with their quirky relationship right where they left off at the end of part 3. But the person who really steals the whole show is Jet Li. Man I thought Jackie Chan was fun to watch! Even though it's not all exactly real this guy pulls out some unbelievable martial arts moves that give Lethal Weapon 4 a muchneeded boost of energy. I wonder how long it will be before Jet Li and Jackie Chan come out with a movie together. Probably never because if they worked together no one could touch them and if they were enemies neither of them would be able to end up as the loser or the bad guy. Oh well we can still hope right? Even though the 4th installment in the Lethal Weapon series is not nearly as good as any of the previous three it still remains a quality action film despite its many weaknesses.".

Every franchise or film series comes full circle and the Lethal Weapon series is no exception and the Lethal Weapon series goes out with a bang with this film. NowLethal Weapon 4 since it's release has divided fans with some loving the film and some hating the filmI fall right into the former category because I liked this film and the other Lethal Weapon films for what they arethrillingAction filledfunny movies. Right from the explosive opening Lethal Weapon 4 is a film filled with Action and great laughs taking what worked in the first three films and adding it to this film. LW4 is funny and is probably the lightest of the films in terms of Comedy and Humor with the characters RiggsMurtaughLeo and Butters and the moments and dialog between the characters is hilarious and memorable. While LW4 is an ActionComedy the film at it's heart is about getting old and change especially with Riggs and Murtaugh because Riggs and Murtaugh have been through a lot of things throughout the series getting into crazy adventures and even though the two have survived and had success Riggs and Murtaugh realize that they are not getting any younger and success won't come as fast. The change comes when Riggs realizes he's going to be Father with Lorna ColeRene Russoand Murtaugh being a GrandFather of Rianne'sTraci Wolfeand realize they can't be cops and take risks forever. Each sequel introduces new characters throughout the series. In LW2 it was Leo Getzin LW3 it was Lorna Cole and in this film it is Lee Butters and Wah Sing Ku. Lee Butters is a character who works with Riggs and Murtaugh and brings laughs and one liners and is the opposite of Riggs and Murtaugh and is the new generation of cop. The character will divide viewers some will like him and find him funny while others will feel that Butters doesn't belong in the film but I like the character for his laughs and loudmouth energy. The villain Wah Sing Ku is pure evil and is physically the most challenging bad guy Riggs and Murtaugh have ever have to face because Wah Sing Ku is so quick and can take your head in one second without hesitation and he doesn't have to say much words because he is that menacing. Every time Wah Sing Ku shows up a there is tension all around and you will feel like something is going to happen when Wah Sing Ku is around. LW4 like the other films moves at a wonderful pace and never slows down until the end. The Action and fight scenes are great and each Action scene is raised to a higher level each time and there is suspense and nice build up to each Action scene. The ending of the film is excellent because it is filled wonderful ActionLaughs and heart and will have viewers smiling at the end and it is a great cap off to this excellent series.The cast does amazing jobs in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover do excellent jobs one last time as Riggs and Murtaugh once again having great chemistry. Joe Pesci is hilarious once again as Leo Getz and has great scenes with GibsonGlover and Rock. Rene Russo is fantastic as Lorna Cole and has good scenes with Gibson. Chris Rock is great and funny as Riggs and Murtaugh's new partner Detective Lee Butters. Jet Li is menacing and believable as Wah Sing Kuone of the villains of the film. Kim Chan is wonderful as Benny Uncle Benny Chana Chinese crime boss. Steve KahanCapt. Ed Murphy Mary Ellen TrainorDr. Stephanien WoodsDarlene LoveTrish MurtaughTraci WolfeRianne MurtaughDamon HinesNick MurtaughEbonie SmithCarrie Murtaughand Eddy KoHonggive good performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is excellentwith Donner always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and energy especially with the Action scenes. Great directionDonner.The score by Eric ClaptonMichael Kamen and David Sandborn is great and intense and matches the tone of this film. Another great score from ClaptonKamen and Sandborn. There are also songs by WarWhy Can't We Be Friendsand Eric ClaptonPligrim. Wonderful songs.In final wordif you love Action films and the Lethal Weapon franchise you will love Lethal Weapon 4an Actionpackedhilarious conclusion to a great series that is well worth your time. Highly Recommended. 9.510.".

The villain Wah Sing Ku is pure evil and is physically the most challenging bad guy Riggs and Murtaugh have ever have to face because Wah Sing Ku is so quick and can take your head in one second without hesitation and he doesn't have to say much words because he is that menacing. Every time Wah Sing Ku shows up a there is tension all around and you will feel like something is going to happen when Wah Sing Ku is around. LW4 like the other films moves at a wonderful pace and never slows down until the end. The Action and fight scenes are great and each Action scene is raised to a higher level each time and there is suspense and nice build up to each Action scene. The ending of the film is excellent because it is filled wonderful ActionLaughs and heart and will have viewers smiling at the end and it is a great cap off to this excellent series.The cast does amazing jobs in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover do excellent jobs one last time as Riggs and Murtaugh once again having great chemistry. Joe Pesci is hilarious once again as Leo Getz and has great scenes with GibsonGlover and Rock. Rene Russo is fantastic as Lorna Cole and has good scenes with Gibson. Chris Rock is great and funny as Riggs and Murtaugh's new partner Detective Lee Butters. Jet Li is menacing and believable as Wah Sing Kuone of the villains of the film. Kim Chan is wonderful as Benny Uncle Benny Chana Chinese crime boss. Steve KahanCapt. Ed Murphy Mary Ellen TrainorDr. Stephanien WoodsDarlene LoveTrish MurtaughTraci WolfeRianne MurtaughDamon HinesNick MurtaughEbonie SmithCarrie Murtaughand Eddy KoHonggive good performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is excellentwith Donner always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and energy especially with the Action scenes. Great directionDonner.The score by Eric ClaptonMichael Kamen and David Sandborn is great and intense and matches the tone of this film. Another great score from ClaptonKamen and Sandborn. There are also songs by WarWhy Can't We Be Friendsand Eric ClaptonPligrim. Wonderful songs.In final wordif you love Action films and the Lethal Weapon franchise you will love Lethal Weapon 4an Actionpackedhilarious conclusion to a great series that is well worth your time. Highly Recommended. 9.510.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is about as entertaining as a movie can get! You can tell by watching this movie that cast and crew worked together as one big family. A lot of cast and crew members of the first three Lethal Weapon movies returned in this movie. That is the biggest power of the movie.The story itself actually is quite weak messy and not always easy to follow. This is due that the story was still being written during production and all the scene's had to be shot in chronically order in order to finish the movie in time. But this seriously is one of those movies were the story is of no importance at all. The true power of the movie is in the characters and their relations. There are some incredible fun sidetracks in the story and some amusing dialog.Additions to the cast for this movie are Chris Rock as an highly enjoyable police officer and new partner for future Lethal Weapon movies ? and Jet Li in his first American movie as the new main villain. Both were really good and enjoyable in their role. I dislike both actors right now actually but at the time of Lethal Weapon 4 they were still two unknown actors therefor there is no reason to dislike them in this movie for me. Another fun role is played by Kim Chan who's character involves at least one hilarious scene.Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are still amazingly good and fun together after already three Lethal Weapon movies and are truly a golden screen duo. Other welcome returning actors are Rene Russo and Joe Pesci. It's funny I normally don't like Rene Russo in movies but this is one of the few I can stand her in. Joe Pesci is fun as ever as hyperactive Leo Getz.The movie also features some topclass action sequences and fights making this movie not just one of the most entertaining but also best action movie's of the last couple of years. The movie's opening is just great! Maybe even better than the well known opening for Lethal Weapon 3.Seriously one of the most entertaining movies of the last couple of years.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Well they were right it's awesome or at least it was back in '99 when the disc came out back when not everyone had a DVD player. It's still topofline for picture and sound. When bullets are flying around you hear them from all five speakers. It here it almost seven years later and we still find many films without this kind of excellent surround speaker participation.The Lethal Weapon series this being the fourth and last of them was popular because of the combination of action comedy suspense romance and drama. For me they wore thin because the characters were too loud  always shouting at each other too profane too smug too much Liberalagenda and there was too much action. Things needed to slow down here and there and give the viewer a break now and then.This sequel is no exception although it was a little tamer than the first three Lethal Weapons that is until going berserk again in the final few scenes one of which  the hospital scene  was totally unnecessary. To be honest some of the action scenes in this movie were amazing even if they had no credibility. You just have to suspend belief and enjoy some of the outrageous scenes in here.As usual there are the leftwing agenda plugs unwarranted cheap shots at the NRA it's okaytohaveababyoutofwedlock etc. etc. Although the couple does finally get married a rabbi performs an irreverent quickie ceremony another slam on the seriousness of marriage.With all that goes on in this film as in the three previous LWs you are worn out by the end. If you are a fan of this serious this last sequel should please. I thought it was the best of them.".

As the movies went on each new Lethal showed that was a harmless crush. Martin Riggs who lost his wife because he was a cop is afraid of getting married again for fear of losing Lorna. My favorite portion is seeing that Martin Riggs after so many times of being the tough hero needs Roger Murtaugh at the finale to finish the battle. Also you finally see the clenching speechgiven by who else Leo Getz that makes Martin run for the altar with Lorna. Lethal Weapon was the start of a partnership when they were paired together. Lethal 2 built on that relationship when Riggs admitted some things he never said before you find out more about Victoria Riggs death. Lethal 3 tested it when Murtaugh was going to retire and his kid's friend was killed by him. Lethal Weapon 4 finally made it a family by well you just have to watch this to see and hear the ultimate ending line to a film. All in all a great movie to watch.".

	schema:headline " Flaws this profound are rare in a relentlessly mediocre film.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie has some strong points.  Jet Li is a phenomenal athlete and fairly menacing screen villain.  Several of the actionfight scenes are well choreographed.  Chris Rock has a couple of good scenes especially the cell phone discussion with Joe Pesci.  But the movie suffers from such deep flaws that one has not only the disappointment of a poor film but of a director and actors who know that star power and their franchise will carry them along and who just don't care anymore.Just some of the problems I noticed in no particular order1  One of the major events in the movie is the promotion of Riggs and Murtaugh to the rank of captain.  There are two major problems with this plot point.  First though it hardly matters in this avalanche of the improbable their promotion isn't just implausible it's ridiculously improbable.  They are supposed to have done so much damage that the city's insurance carrier will no longer insure the police.  So they are promoted off the street.  But since there are no open spots for Lieutenants they are promoted one rank higher.  Excuse me?  They do so much damage that the city loses its insurance coverage and they can't even be taken off street duty? Are all cops on the streets?  But that could be overlooked if it were not for the second problem  The promotion does apparently nothing.  The only effect of their promotion that we see is that they are called captain and sir.  They keep their same desks their same duties their same partnership.  Do Captains even have partners?  So why since it doesn't do anything do we even have the promotion subplot in the movie?2  I know I'm going to sound like a prig for mentioning this but I was really repelled by the level of casual brutality and harassment Riggs and Murtaugh show.  They don't even have to wait for proof or even reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing they simply destroy property ruin a business beat people up shoot them etc.  These are clearly rogue cops and it may be a sign of the formula of the movie failing that we notice it.  It is not as though any actionmovie heroes are textbook cops but this movie is unforgivable in forcing you to notice it.  Perhaps more disturbing is that Riggs and Murtaugh are joined in this adventure by Lee Butters a younger cop played by Chris Rock who is just as casual in his brutality as the older cops.  He also casually cocks and brandishes his gun at Leo Getz played by Joe Pesci apparently just so you can tell that being a bad cop isn't restricted to the older jaded officers.3  Big secrets are kept in ways that suggest that the characters haven't seen each other since the last film.  Riggs and Murtaugh are the closest of partners the earlier movies make it clear that they think of each other as family.  But Murtaugh never mentions that Trish his wife is a successful writer?  Maybe he is embarrassed about what she writes but would he never have mentioned in the early days that she had written something that she was sending off to a publisher that it had been published nothing?  But perhaps given the example he sets he should not be surprised to find that his daughter has never revealed that she has been dating a man has fallen in love has married him and is carrying his baby.  She has also never mentioned his name or occupation.  And this after making much in the last three films about Murtaugh as the devoted family man.  That's a betrayal of the characters and it's revolting.Now more briefly4 Women escape hostagetakers but don't run to alert neighbors or call the police but remain in area to be recaptured.5  Renee Russo's character Lorna Cole devolves from the third movie's smart cop to a broad farce of sappy stupid pregnant woman stereotype with some martial arts thrown in.6  They seem to have entirely forgotten here the first movie's point that Riggs is an outstanding martial artist.  He doesn't get beaten up because he is getting old.  He gets beaten up because the writers have again betrayed the character.7  The Chinese villains are supposed to be dastardly killers using their cars to push their victims in their cars conveniently stopped at railroad crossings into the path of conveniently oncoming trains.  But it is a quite silly form of execution not because it relies on the unlikely coincidence mentioned but because all it takes to thwart this method is to hit the gas.  The path ahead is clear when you're getting pushed just go with it and the train will pass behind you.8  Murtaugh's very quick to suppose given basically no evidence that Butters is gay and attracted to him.  Nice sleuthing.9  Simplistic smug moralizing on guns and slavery.  We're clearly supposed to feel uplifted by Murtaugh's opposition to slavery.  Good for you Rog.  Are you against murder and cruelty too?  If Richard Donner is a filmmaker who botches a film this badly why would I trust him for moral guidance?Of course there is the usual runofthemill action film weirdness windows are made of a supremely fragile material which looks like glass but which is effortlessly broken by the protagonist's fist and cars on the LA freeway that do not swerve or slow down when following a man on a inverted table being dragged by a sheet of plastic from a prefab house.  But these aren't really faults of the movie so much as a stupid turn the genre has taken.  It is a rare action film these days that doesn't fall into these traps.All in all Lethal Weapon 4 is a movie worth watching only if you don't care about film or about yourself.".

Murtaugh and Riggs are getting older and it is starting to show. Their new opponent a super butt kicking member of the Chinese mob trying to get his brother over to the US. This movie starts out with a bang as an insane pyromaniac is burning up the town then the story goes to the whole Chinese story. The comedy is great as Chris Rock makes for an excellent new character and the dentist scene is very funny. The action includes a very good car chase and numerous fight scenes with the highlight being between our heroes and a very ticked off Jet Li character. This fight alone made the movie worth it as it is very exciting and you really worry for our two officer's lives. It is not perfect however as once again it sort of has more of a television episode feel rather than a theatrical movie but it still doesn't take away from the enjoyment I got from this film.".

He is beginning to be disillusioned by the legal system he represents and is repeatedly forced to release people who are clearly guilty due to legal technicalities setup to protect the innocent.  When the torture and murder of children comes before his court he is forced to release the suspects leading him to join a select court of Judges who are self appointed to a shadowy group that pass judgment behind closed doors before employing a hitman to carry out the sentence.  However it doesn't take long before developments show Hardin the limitations of this alternative version of justice.The story here is in two parts.  First we have the investigation side where Detective Lowes and others try to catch the child killers but we also have the side with Hardin and the other Judges.  The latter allows the film to debate the issues of justice and the legal system using the former as the catalyst for the debate.  Both strands are fascinating when separate however when the two come together for the conclusion it doesn't quite work.  The film is then forced to pick a side and manages to fudge it a bit and lose it's way.  Up until then it's a great piece of work that makes intelligent argument both in attack and defence of the legal system.  The film is still relevant today  in the UK we recently saw the alleged Lawrence killers walk free despite overwhelming evidence due to technicalities  in fact it is probably more relevant than it was then.The cast are roundly good  Douglas is good despite his slight scout style character.  Holbrook does one of the best performances I've seen him give and Kotto adds some real class.  It also gives small roles to Gless and David Proval Ritchie in The Sopranos.  The only weak link are the bugeyed performances of suspected murders Monk and Cooms who are almost like cartoon characters at times.Overall an intelligent film that manages to hold a clever debate before blowing it with a hamfisted conclusion.".

	schema:reviewBody "When The Star Chamber was released to theaters in 1983 the movie bombed at the box office. I was lucky to see the movie in its second week of release. I have seen the movie several times on cable TV and video and even though the movie had some good ideas it was ruined by turning it into a mindless sometimes laughable action thriller. The story by Roderick Taylor with the script cowritten by Taylor and director Peter Hyams rose slightly above the usual vigilante movie clichs. The movie asks what if some judges frustrated by the law that they are supposed to uphold took matters into their own hands? Despite strong evidence that would incriminate the accused the judges have to reject the evidence on technicalities freeing the accused individuals.Though the film has a strong cast I though Michael Douglas was a little too young to play a judge he was 39 at the time the movie was released. Hal Holbrook is essentially playing the same role he played in Hyams other what if? conspiracy thriller a few years earlier Capricorn One the veteran judge who is involved in this conspiracy and gets the Douglas character involved. Yaphet Kotto does what he can in the underwritten role of the L.A. police detective investigating the case. Sharon Gless is wasted as Douglas' understanding wife. Veteran character actors Don Calfa and Joe Regalbuto Frank Fontana from Murphy Brown played the unsympathetic cartoon criminals who are on the Chamber's hit list. Only James B. Sikking's performance as a victim's father who finds himself in prison when he tries to take the law into his own hands came through. It was a very sympathetic and heartbreaking. In retrospect it's interesting that Sikking played the SWAT commander on Hill Street Blues when the movie was released. Hyams' films including 2010 The Presidio Outland the previously mentioned Capricorn One even the Jean Claude Van Damme flicks Timecop and Sudden Death are interesting to look at. The Star Chamber is no exception. But many of his films tend to disappoint and sadly The Star Chamber is also on that list.Update July 2006 The current DVD cover of the movie is misleading. It has Michael Douglas holding a gun. In the film his character never used a gun. What's up with the 20th Century Fox marketing department trying to mislead potential viewers of this movie?".

As it happens it only scratched the surface of the issue worse than Magnum Force did ten years earlier.It starts really well in painting pictures on how a young judge Hardin gets sick of a legal system in which he has to set heavy offenders free on the grounds of mere technicalities. At the same time parallel story unfolds of a secret judging panel that keeps an eye on Hardin as its potential new member. The horror is at its full when another false trial produces real catastrophe and Hardin on his free will finally gets introduced to the panel and we learn that judges have their own idea of fighting crime on basis of vigilantism. No lawyer's tricks no technicalities just crimes verdicts and a silent assassin to execute offenders.This is where the story begins to dissolve. Just when we are about convinced of absurdity of the system and possibility that its carriers are willing to bent it the main character gets second thoughts about what he got into and is now equally willing to bring the whole thing down for the sake of morality. This was something that totally missed the point and led directly to a flawed ending of a movie.Hardin now gets in the position of trying to salvage criminals he first condemned as he finds out they were not guilty of the alleged crime after all. He also learns that his fellow vigilantes aren't as willing to correct the mistake as he is because they know there are other crimes those villains did commit. Nevermind they will later be proved right the vigilantes are now rendered enemies in Hardin's and viewer's eyes.Since the assassin is already well on his way and needs to be stopped by no other than Hardin the movie gains an unnecessary action momentum. A character of a police investigator is also added to the plot only to help Hardin bring about everybody to justice.I would like the movie to have gone the other way with vigilante society intact and the character of Hardin matured into their worthy member after learning a valuable lesson of living with one's mistakes. Even the police investigator could have been revealed as another vigilante executor. This would really have been mind provoking as we would have never known how far the conspiracy went.What we got instead is a pale copy of Dirty Harry flick Magnum Force with Hal Holbrook even repeating his role of a vigilante leader.".

All the vigilante scenes happen in 30 seconds with some unknown sunglasswearing white guy. And when they uncover three suspects behind one of the movie's main criminal cases? We're TOLD about their arrest by a third party. There were a lot of little things that didn't quite work for me at least The first loophole that Douglas rules on made no sense both logically and legally. All yes ALL of the criminals in this movie no matter their crime are ridiculously strung out on drugs. The top secret star chamber is located in somebody's house in a room lined with open windows. Yeah I'm being nitpicky but I was really disappointed by this one especially given the cast. And why couldn't the judges stop that last hit? They clearly had time and there was no explanation as to how it would compromise their identities. Anyway hope this helps somebody. Thanks.".

It misses its chances for greatness due to predictability and a lack of credibility but while it's playing out some people such as this viewer may not mind too much.Michael Douglas in one of his earliest star vehicles plays Steven Hardin a young judge who's frustrated by the legal system with which he has to work. Far too often criminal scum are able to escape just punishment due to legal technicalities and savvy defense attorneys. Stevens' cagey witty mentor Benjamin Caulfield a marvelous Hal Holbrook eventually reveals to Steven the method he and some fellow judges have employed to deal with the situation review old particularly infuriating cases make judgments and pass sentence utilizing the services of a hired gun.This is certainly slick stuff well made technically with efficient direction by Peter Hyams and it's at least smart enough to provoke some debate. For example what would you do let the 10 guilty men go free or let the one innocent man get executed? It includes some fairly exciting foot chases as well as one brief and decent car chase in a parking garage. The climactic sequence in the abandoned building is appropriately atmospheric. And Michael Smalls' music score is haunting and effective.Douglas is good in the lead but it's the men in the major supporting parts that truly shine besides Holbrook Yaphet Kotto scores as a dedicated detective and James B. Sikking is touching as the father of a murdered child. Sharon Gless has little to do as Stevens' concerned wife. The cast contains an impressive Who's Who roster of character actors including Joe Regalbuto 'Murphy Brown' and Don Calfa The Return of the Living Dead as a pair of goofy creeps as well as Jack Kehoe Larry Hankin Dick Anthony Williams David Proval Robin Gammell Matthew Faison Michael Ensign Jason Bernard and Robert Costanzo. David Faustino 'Married with Children' plays one of Douglas's kids and Douglas's own reallife mother Diana plays Caulfields' wife Charles Hallahan The Thing 'Hunter' appears uncredited as police officer Picker.The movie does move along quite well getting off to a good start but not concluding as strongly.

Soon he's approached by his friend Hal Holbrook about joining a group of judges that meet in secret and decide to dole out vigilante justice to criminals who the legal system failed to prosecute.Mature thoughtprovoking thriller with an excellent first half but man does it fall apart in the end. The basic problem is that the entire first half of the movie is spent building up to Douglas joining this group. So a lot of time is spent on making us emotionally invested in WHY this group is necessary so we're on board with Douglas. But then almost immediately after joining the movie pulls the rug out from under itself and Douglas regrets his decision. Then we get a pedestrian climax involving a chase and shootout in a warehouse. All of that passion shown towards caring about the victims in the first half is tossed out in favor of the movie suddenly caring more about some dirtbag drug dealers who are clearly guilty of a lot of terrible crimes but maybe not this particular one they're to be executed for. Sorry but emotionally it's a tough sell.The cast is terrific with wonderful character actors in roles big and small throughout. The writing in the first half is also really good. But boy the way it falls apart and so abruptly is such a downer. I'm still giving it a decent score of 7 because when it's good it's great but be forewarned that it's a movie that chickens out on its own premise.".

Overall  if you want to spend your time on intelligent entertainment this movie is a nice choice. I give it 410. It's more of a drama  so don't expect action or thrills.";

Insisting that the garbage in which a gun used to commit a series of murders was still considered private property until it was comingled with everyone else's garbage in the body of the truck led to Judge Hardin's Michael Douglas decision that the evidence thus obtained was inadmissible. However it seems to me had the contents with the gun been dumped wouldn't the defense argument have been that there was no way to prove the gun came out of a particular garbage can? Unlikely as that might have been there's your classic reasonable doubt.Then when Monk and Cooms had their case thrown out on a technicality they reacted as if they actually had been guilty but got away with it. But since it was later revealed that they were not the ones who killed the boy with the bloody sneaker there was no reason in hindsight for them to have had that particular reaction. And what about that bloody sneaker? If they were not the real killers what connection did that sneaker in their car have with the story? Absolutely none. So why was it even there in the first place? With all that I thought the original premise of the story was pretty good. What decent law abiding individual hasn't gotten fed up with the convoluted outcomes that result from slimy lawyers working the system to portray criminals as victims? With a little more work this one could have been an effective psychological drama pitting vigilante judges against hardened criminals who got what they deserved even if it meant circumventing the law. But next time give us a Judge Hardin that's not so angst driven about a mere technicality like Monk and Cooms being innocent. You know those creeps had to be guilty of something.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original star chamber was an English court under Henry VII around 1490 and was established in order to prosecute wealthy and powerful individuals whom the lower courts could never have convicted. In this movie the star chamber is made up of 9 people  neatly distributed along racial and gender lines  who have decided to sidestep the law in order to administer justice. Can the law really be so blind as it is shown to be in the three cases we first see Judge Michael Douglas dealing with? If so then the law sir is a ass to quote Mr. Bumble.Douglas gets sucked into the secret panel of justices when a vacancy occurs. A couple of murderers who have gotten off on technicalities are offed once more and terminally by a courthired assassin. None of the members of the star chamber seem to know who he is because when it is revealed that they just sentenced two innocent men to death they have no way of stopping the assassin from carrying out his assignment. I wonder how that works. What I mean is who is the intermediary between the star chamber and the shooter? How does he get paid? And who pays him? The movie never explains just how this machinery works.Michael Douglas plays a conscience stricken bourgeois which is his forte. He's pretty good. Probably the best performance is Hal Holbrook's. He's a grayhair fashionably styled avuncular type of judge who is Douglas's mentor and who calls Douglas Kiddo a term I haven't heard since elementary school. He's just about equaled by Yaphet Koto as a detective whose role in the story is unclear. But Koto is always reliable. The greatest FACE in the movie belongs to the guy who plays the criminal Monk. He gives a firstrate imitation of a nervous wreck. His hair is the kind of growth you might imagine taking place somewhere inside your sewer pipe and his eyeballs dominate the screen.The plot however cops out. It develops a bit of rather challenging ambiguity then dispenses with it. The bad guys are not simply murderers. One of them combines all the most loathsome crimes that are thinkable. They kidnap young boys drug them have them perform in pornographic movies torture them then deliberately kill them. If they didn't exist it would not be necessary to invent them.By the end the movie has turned into another action extravaganza taking place in one of those abandoned warehouses with chains hanging from the ceiling and holes in the floor. The assassin shows up just in time to save Douglas's gluteus maximi. Then as he turns the shotgun on Douglas himself he is shot from behind by Yaphet Koto there for no particular reason. We don't find out what happens to Douglas or the rest of the star chamber. A lot of things are left hanging.The only conclusion we can draw from this movie is that the law is a set of rules that people have agreed to live by. That applies to formal law and to the informal star chamber. And since the law is a set of norms drawn up by people and people always disagree with one another and make mistakes no law is ever going to be perfectly satisfactory. A compromise is always necessary. It's the kind of natural selection process by which the law evolves piece by piece. The problem illustrated in this movie is that some people those who form star chambers for example are unwilling to compromise because they feel they have a monopoly on justice. They KNOW absolutely what is right and what is wrong so they don't feel it necessary to compromise. Compromise is a peculiar word. As Margaret Mead pointed out it carries different connotations in the USA and Britain. In the UK a compromise is when each side gets a little something out of the deal. In the USA when you compromise you lose.".

It may cause you to think a little.The theme is not a hot topic todaycriminals set free because of loopholes in the law. But on another level there is current relevance. The system exists for a reason even if it is not perfect.Our current political leadership is ignoring the constitution. Proclamations are now lawlike with dictatorships.The Star Chamber is a group of judges acting outside of the law. They want to clean up after the system fails and allows obviously guilty criminals to walk free. They review a case in private inspect evidence and then vote on a verdict. If found guilty a hit man is ready to carry out sentence.Young Judge Hardin is drawn in after letting 2 child killers walk free on a technicality. He joins the Star Chamber and asks for judgment on the child killer case. Things do not work out the way Hardin had expected.Acting and photography are striking in this film. Veteran actors give great performances in rich film noir settings. How do you go wrong with Douglas Holbrook and Kotto? Action scenes are filled with tension and excitement. The opening footrace takes the viewer along through neighborhood living rooms and back yards. A car chase puts the viewer behind the wheel. The style is realistic increasing the tension.The final action scene finds Hardin in an out of control situation both physically and in the plot. The viewer slides along with Hardin spinning down an industrial chute to the final showdown.We find out how the judges in the Star Chamber even with their good intentions are a very dangerous group.Watch the Star Chamber and you will be ready to offer a recommendation to your friends. Someone will say that they need help finding something to watch and you will recommend this movie and look like a genius.".

	schema:reviewBody "...I managed to pack into a dozen scenes with the whole period of Nazi tyranny in a convincingly evil way.  Malcolm McDowell about his work in The Passage. When I saw The Passage back in 1981 in Moscow I had no idea that it had been a big flop in the USA where it only lasted a week upon theatrical release that it was considered a bad movie a failure. It would be much later that I recognized very famous and talented actors who were in the film James Matson Anthony Quinn Christopher Lee and Patricia Neal. The film was directed by J. Lee Thompson the Oscar nominated director of highly successful The Guns of Navarone 1961. By the time I was watching The Passage at the theater I had not seen Stanley Kubrick's A Clock Work Orange or notorious Caligula and I did not know what Malcolm McDowell was capable of as a screen villain. I did know McDowell from the Lindsay Anderson's O Lucky Man that also had been released theatrically in Moscow several years prior The Passage. O lucky Man had left a deep impression on me and huge part of it was McDowell's performance as Mick Travis the young naive man with the most charming smile who wanted to succeed in this world. Watching McDowell in The Passage playing the psychotic obsessed Nazi chasing the family of the antifascist scientist across the Pyrenees I was horrified and genuinely scared. Every time he would enter the screen I felt physically sick anticipating some horror act to follow and McDowell never disappointed. I won't argue that the movie may not be a great or even a good one but I do remember McDowell's performance all too well and I could not forget him in the movie for 28 years. Now after I've seen so many movies and memorable performances I realize that McDowell was over the top and judging by his own words he knew it very well and did it on purpose I played this real nasty Nazi who was chasing these people across the Pyrenees. We all knew real early on that the movie was not going to be any great work of art and so I was determined to have some fun with it. My attitude was that if I was going to play a Nazi I was going to take it totally over the top and do it right. I ended up playing the character like a pantomime queen. What I was doing was so far out that James Mason turned to me one day and said 'That's wonderful dear boy but are you in our film? You seem to be doing something different from the rest of us'... If after so many years one performance in a supposedly bad movie stands out and you can't get it out of your mind and you remember the exact day when you saw that movie who you saw it with and how you felt for me it means that the movie was not bad at all.".

McDowell plays a psychotic WW2 Nazi Captain who is in pursuit of a doctor Mason and his family Neal Lenz Clement who is on the run from the Nazi's and is helped by a Basque guide Quinn and two agents LonsadaleBouzuffi to take them across the mountain to safetly.  McDowell turns into a Nazi Caligula as he do sick things and plays it almost in a camp like fashion like wear a chef hat and chops off Lonsndale fingers while cooking and saying chop chop chop chop! Burn a gypsy Christopher Lee alive  saying I'm send him exactly where he told me to go....HELL and rapes Kay Lenz as he wears a Nazi symbol on his underwear!  McDowall also places a black comb under his nose to look like Hitler in one scene!  This film is beyond what McDowall did in CLOCKWORK ORANGE! This is a performance that Mike Myers should look into remaking! The ending is incredible but I can't give it away but the bad guy's death doesn't involve a gun.  Not recommended if you hate this sort of entertainment despite the fact this is one of those all star cast international co productions but the TV print cut out of most of the nasty stuff so check out the TV print instead if you are a fan of the 70's interantional all star cast epics! Others beware!  Great score by Michael J Lewis though!".

Not the most cerebral piece of work but neither is 'The Hills Have Eyes' or 'Nightmere on Elm Street' but they are cult movies.If this was released again I am sure it would get an appreciable following for those with 'Bad Taste' and 'Brain Damage'  even Peter Jackson started with over the top violence  humour!Try and get a copy and see for yourself  don't be put off by these other 'critics'.Mark";

	schema:reviewBody "I'll put a disclaimer right at the top here that states that I do think 1979's The Passage is not a good film. It's a nasty watch full of drawn out sadistic situations and a bleak plot that elicits the hollow response of why to anyone who spends their time on it. And yet it's interesting if only to see the completely bonkers untethered performance by Malcolm McDowell as a maniacally evil SS nazi officer. It's like they gave him a bunch of coke and liquor before the cameras were rolling dressed him up in gestapo digs and set him loose on the other cast members. The story is about a German scientist James Mason being led across a treacherous mountain range by a rugged guide Anthony Quinn. Hot on their heels is McDowell's Captain Von Berkow who will stop at nothing as well as kill maim and intimidate everyone along the way to capture them. That's about all the plot goes for and aside from some gorgeous Swedish locations it's a very unpleasant affair to put yourself through unless like me you're a die hard McDowell fan. His performance is something to bear witness to though like a particularly bad car crash so messed up and terrible that you can't take your eyes off it. Whether he's terrorizing and murdering a poor gypsy village led by Christopher Lee shedding his uniform down to his outlandish SS issue jockstrap and raping Mason's daughter or jovially playing chef as he chops off Michael Lonsdale's fingers with kitchen knives he's a devilishly disgusting monster and one wonders how a performance so brash and obviously over the top slipped through the producer's net. An off putting ugly gratuitous flick that's worth a watch for pure morbid curiosity and to see McDowell truly push boundaries into zones of extreme discomfort.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ask anyone familiar with Malcolm McDowell's movies to name his most outrageous performance and most would tell you to watch Caligula. A few might suggest that his work in A Clockwork Orange fits the bill. Not many would come up with The Passage primarily because it's a largely forgotten film which didn't succeed critically nor commercially even when it was originally released. However McDowell's performance in this movie is outrageously hammy and must deserve some kind of place in cinema history as one of the most bonkers pieces of acting ever seen.The story sounds like a winner. A Basque shepherd Anthony Quinn is approached by resistance fighters during WWII and asked to escort a scientist James Mason and his family over the Pyrennes Mountains into Spain. A deranged SS captain McDowell is the officer sent to chase them and capture them.Alas this film is an absolute failure. For some reason a story which had lots of potential for tension and excitement becomes utterly uninvolving. Part of the fault is J. Lee Thompson's leaden direction. Part of the fault is Bruce Nicolaysen's bubblegum script based amazingly on his own novel which lacks any depth of character and motivation to arouse audience empathy. Part of the fault is the actors' apparent lack of interest in the material. One of the finest British actors that ever lived  James Mason  is left to contend with the very worst role of his career. He barely has a sentence to utter during the entire film and by the end the audience knows precious little more about him than they did at the start. But the biggest cause of failure in this film is the decision by its makers to emphasise the gruesome gory detail. The film is repellent and overthetop beyond all reason. It actually seems to enjoy wallowing in scenes of rape torture and killing but has none of the gravity or seriousness to justify such themes at least the horrific Saving Private Ryan was horrific for a perfectly good reason. Who wants to watch Michel Lonsdale having his fingers hacked off? Who wants to see gypsy leader Christopher Lee being cremated alive? Who wants to see teenager Kay Lenz being brutally raped?I wanted to see The Passage for years and years. With such a great cast such a wellknown director and such a serviceable plot I felt certain it couldn't possibly be a bad film. How much further from the truth could I have been?".

Ostensibly a WWII adventure yarn about a Basque shepherd Anthony Quinn guiding a scientist James Mason his wife Patricia Neal and kids Kay Lenz and Paul Clemens across the Pyrenees and out of the clutches of the Nazis. Sounds a reasonable setup on the surface of it right?Throw into the mix Malcolm McDowell as Von Berkow a Gestapo captain in hot pursuit and yes still sounds reasonable. I mean bang in some tunes and the hills could be alive with the sound of them.However... At sixtyfour Quinn's action man days were pretty much over. Yet out of the cast he manages to be the most convincing character and at least seems the most physically capable. Mason looks frail and doddery at seventy. Patricia Neal looks like she's already died but someone's forgotten to tell her. There is as much chance of any of these people climbing mountains through deep snow and freezing temperatures as there is of me Frenchkissing Jessica Biel on top of an iceberg in the middle of the Sahara desert. Neal especially has difficulty managing a flight of steps she was seriously ill in real life. It's ludicrous.Then to Malcolm McDowell. Not an actor renowned for subtlety here he seems to have been completely let off the leash. His performance transcends all known boundaries of thespian restraint and spins off into a whole other far distant galaxy of pantomime excess. He is jawdropping. This is the most astonishing comedy caricature GestapoNazi madman portrayal ever committed to film. By comparison it makes his work in CALIGULA seem like John Gielgud whispering the poetry of Betjeman in Winchester Cathedral to an audience of the moral majority. If you have no other reason for watching this film then I urge you to do so to marvel at McDowell and his interpretation of Nazi villainy. It'll mess with your head. Especially the sight of his underpants with the swastika motif. He later described it as some of the best work I've ever done. Hopefully he was being satirical.Throw in some violent action throatslittings finger amputations burnings explosions anything resembling a structure that gets shot at blows up rape sodomy a completely histrionic Captain Oates scene avalanches and consistently brainfreezing dialogue and there you have it.It's not a good film but it is a film that provides a good laugh if you're in the right frame of mind  and providing you can stand the mania and sadism.".

Beautifully filmed with exciting sequences of action and overwhelming suspense it features a cast of exceptional actors doing some of the best work of their careers.

Being aware of its bad reputation mostly due to Malcolm McDowell's outrageous contribution as the villain I decided to give it another look when it turned up recently on Cable TV.The film involves a shepherdcumexperienced mountainclimber a rather glum Quinn who's asked by the French resistance in the figures of Marcel Bozzuffi and Michel Lonsdale to take a prominent nuclear scientist James Mason and his family including wife Patricia Neal and daughter Kay Lenz across the Pyrenees to safety in neutral Spain along the way they're helped by a group of traveling gypsies led by Christopher Lee while McDowell is the maniacal SS officer in pursuit.The journey is fraught with problems  mainly caused by Neal's poor health a really thankless role for the Oscarwinning actress with which Quinn has little patience. Eventually she decides to rid them of the burden and goes away to die in the snow Quinn and Bozzuffi feel her emerging from the cabin where they're all sheltered but do nothing to stop her!after which Mason tries to attack Quinn for pushing her to this but falls flat on his face in the snow after only a couple of paces this bit somehow reminded me of a scene from one of the NAKED GUN films in which George Kennedy lashes at a couple of bullies for mistreating his partner and ends up getting beaten to a pulp himself!. Lee then expires in a fiery death at the hands of the sadistic McDowell  except that whatever tension there was here is destroyed by its being continually crosscut with the flight of the central group!However the film's main source of entertainment is McDowell  especially via his campy attire as a chef while torturing the captured Lonsdale his Swastikaimprinted underpants during the scene in which he rapes Lenz and even while mimicking the Fuehrer in front of a mirror parting his hair a' la Hitler putting the black comb above his lips as a makeshift moustache and giving himself the Nazi salute. Surely it was no great stretch for him to go from this to Tinto Brass' CALIGULA 1979! Worst of all though is the climax as a deranged and wounded McDowell turns up at the cabin after having miraculously survived an avalanche he caused himself! and bloodily exterminates the remaining members of the groupwhich transpires to be merely a delirious fantasy  one final folly enacted in his own head and given away really by being intercut with snippets from scenes that have gone on before!  and that he's the one to perish.

Lee Thompson delivers a systematic if quite unpleasant and foolish World War II action thriller with an outstanding cast lead by the hardy Anthony Quinn who was in Thompson's The Greek Tycoon the year before James Mason Kay Lenz Patricia Neal Michael Lonsdale Malcolm McDowell and Christopher Lee. Great cast indeed although everyone looks rather uninterested with the obvious exception of McDowell itchy overblown performance as a sadistic SS Captain. You can see he is having a ball in the role from his delivery of the dialogues and his torturous actions. It's Clockwork Orange set during WW2 but even the dreary context can't hide his humorous shtick.Anthony Quinn stars as a Basque mountaineer that's hired by the resistance to guide American professor Bergson James Mason and his family from France over the dangerous Pyrenees iceswept mountains into Spain. While at the same time being tracked by the dogged coldblooded SS officer Von Berkow.In all wellbudgeted The Passage can be seen as an interesting failure. It wasn't the roughandtumble oldschool war adventure I was expecting. There's so much wrong with it but for some reason it holds you there. Everything but the kitchen sink has been thrown into it without any sort of care. The structure is odd being adapted by Bruce Nicolaysen from his own novel The Perilous Passage. Continuity seems off at times as scenes just don't come together on this missionontherun format. It should be epic but setpieces come across as individual moments in what are routine situations and the wonderful scenery never really comes into play. Thompson's efforts are workmanlike but indistinguishable. The pace is slow action is halfhearted even with its blood spurting barbaric violence and grand explosions and the suspense is ragged with McDowell's random craziness making it worth the buzz. From showing his excellent chopping skills when preparing a meal Chop Chop Chop! revealing his Swastiska jockstrap to Kay Lenz's character before raping her and imitating Hitler by putting a comb above his lip. The tone just feels misguided but tame and cartoonish nowadays it was crude and uneasy at the time. You can see this being a cult favourite and this especially could be favourable due to its very strange trippedout climatic ending. I was very surprised where it went because of how powerful and ghastly the execution was face painting anyone? but to find it actually was only a tease lessen the impact with its multiple versions. The editing was allovertheplace and the finale was the tip of that. Better things can be said about the camerawork where it did flow around the action well enough demonstrating the dark shadowy realism of the predicament. Visually it was glum.The Passage might leave you with a bad taste in your mouth but it's rather transfixing due to McDowell's creepy histrionics that you can't believe what you are seeing.".

And it is but with a twist. They are being hunted by a twisted Nazi pervert. Every scene he is in seems like its straight out of Clockwork Orange.

	schema:reviewBody "Kidnapping movies were really big in the 1970's especially after several highprofile cases like Patty Hearst. The Italian exploitation industry is notorious for taking its cues from the US movies but that may not have been the case here since there was even a bigger kidnapping problem in Italy eventually leading to the kidnap and murder of a former prime minister by the notorious Red Brigades. The kidnappers in this movie though are pretty lowrent types barely connected to the Mafia. Their victim is a very spoiled but perhaps not especially rich teenage girl Rena Neihaus whose parents seem unableor perhaps unwillingto get her back she hints at an incestuous relationship with her stepfather which might have been explored in the sequel to this Oedipus Orca. In this movie the youngest most handsome kidnapper Michele Placido falls for the girl in kind of a reverse Stockholm syndrome with tragic results for at least one of them. The end of movie strangely enough is kind of reminiscent of Last Tango in Paris but with nowhere near the dramatic gravitasThe movie is generally lacking in character development. The film at one point follows the creepiestlooking gangster Flavio Bucci from the The Night Train Murders to his home where he is shacking up with another gangster's wife and her kid but more than character development this seems to be more an excuse for another sex scene. The Placido character has an interesting flashback of him working on a filthy fishing barge which is contrasted with a fantasy where he is piloting a yacht. This movie is very classconscious in the way it has this poor Sicilian boy falling for a rich northern girl the Italian title La Orca comes from the designer outfit she's wearing. Placido is pretty good here but this handsome lightcomplexioned hunk is not too convincing as a lowerclass Sicilian ruffian. As for Neihaus I can't decide if she is a bad actress or is just playing a really obnoxious character she's more Paris Hilton than Patty Hearst. She does get naked several times which judging from the English title was the primary consideration.This movie has a bit of a bad reputation but I don't know why. It's not nearly as brutal as similarlythemed American films like Date with a Kidnapper or The Candy Snatchers. I believe Niehaus' character is underage but the actress obviously wasn't she'd been in Playboy two years earlier. Maybe it offended people that the victim is made so unsympathetic but that doesn't explain why she returns in a sequel. . . I dunno. Check it out for yourself and see what you think.".

When the Governor offers the hand of his daughter to the man who can defeat his wife in combat SaiYuk Fong enters only losing the fight on purpose when he spots who he thinks is the daughter. His mother enters dressed as a man and passing herself as SaiYuk's brother in order to win and in doing so accidentally wins the heart of the Governor's wife. With the Fong's already in trouble for this imaginary brother turning down the daughter's hand things get worse when the Emperor comes to town to expose and destroy the members of the Red Lotus  a group that Father Fong is a key member of.As the plot summary suggests this is a very busy little film with a plot that is very simple but at the same time filled with lots of little things going on. In a way this is a problem because many of these things are by the by and only serve to fill a movie who's basic plot is 'Fong fights with bad Emperor' but here it doesn't matter so much because this patchwork of little events fit well into this basic frame of a story and make the film enjoyable. Each little bit works well to create a film that is actually fun to watch. The script throws up plenty of well written lines  not jokes but actions and dialogue that is witty and fun to listen to. I was caught up in the light tone it had for the most part and really enjoyed it only in the final quarter does the tone turn harder and it is done a bit too suddenly for the film's own good  damaging the sense of fun it had garnered up until then. Aside from this the overall plot is nothing more than a frame and I can understand why some viewers would be bothered by both the lack of firm foundations as well as the comic tone.For me though the comic tone was a big reason I loved it  just like I felt it made Once Upon a Time in China 3 so much fun to watch. With physical action the humour could have been lazy slapstick but it wasn't instead it is witty dialogue woven into the story through funny characters. The physical work is good too  just not for comedy though. The fights are impressive and make good use of the actors' skills as well as effective wirework. Much is made of the fights in trees of Crouching Tiger or the lake fight of Hero but while these look beautiful it is a lot more fun to see the fight here that occurs on top of a crowd of people! There is no one fight that stands out as a really great one indeed the climatic fight is probably the least of the film but generally they are all of a high standard and are great fun to watch. Li is a great martial artist and he makes it all seem so natural and easy he also shows that he is a leading man of great charisma and presence  something that the swaggering 'gangbanger' movies he has made in the US have not allowed him to show. He is likable serious fun and charming and this film shows why along with the physical skills he has become such a star. Siao is just as good and is very funny even with her 'romance' is just filler. Chu is solid as Father Fong the Governor is an enjoyable clown even if the Emperor lacks real menace. Performances were hard to judge for me as I saw the dubbed version but the dubbing is not that bad and while not great actors the voice talent as the credits call them all do well to capture the tone and style of their characters  certainly the dubbing fits with the jocular tone of the majority of the film. Overall this is a really fun film. Admittedly not a really great film but certainly one that I will enjoy watching several times again. The script is funny and witty for the most part and the serious turn doesn't do too much to detract from this. The fights are good and the plot is busy and lively even if some of it is just filler and the actual narrative flow is not all it really could have been. With Jet Li back in people's minds recently now is as good a time as any to revisit this film and enjoy it for what it is  a well written and fun film that doesn't take itself too seriously.".

	schema:headline " A mustsee HK movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Fong Sai Yuk III were the first 2 HK movies I saw though an accident of video recording meant that I had to wait at least a year to see the beginning of Pt I and the end of Pt II. Even in incomplete form the two films were enough to make me an instant fan of HK Cinema after years of disappointment with the Hollywood fare I'd been exposed to. I think they're possibly the best introduction to the territory's movie industry there could be... if you don't love Fong Sai Yuk chances are Hong Kong Cinema is not the cinema for you. It's a rare example of everything coming together if not perfectly then at least very well.The solid script from Jeff Lau is the anchor without which the movie would not have succeeded. In typical Jeff Lau style it bounces all over the place from stupid comedy to high melodrama via a little romance and the obligatory gender confusions and of course leading into the incredibly imaginitive action sequences choreographed by director Corey Yuen and former opera brother Yuen Tak.The production values for the movie are very high if not quite as slick as the Once Upon A Time In China movies they clearly aspire to emulating. Ann Hui is credited as Production Designer here a rare role for the critically adored director. The cinematography from Jingle Ma is top notch framing the luscious sets and costumes and the action very well. The soundtrack from James Wong with regular partner Romeo Diaz seems a little too close to his score for OUATIC in places but mostly does a commendable job.Jet Li has said that Fong Sai Yuk is the character that most closely resembles his real personality from all those he's played. From the small time I've spent in Jet's company I'm not sure his selfimage is entirely accurate but he's probably in a better position to judge than me Certainly Fong Sai Yuk is a very likeable chap the way Jet plays him and you can tell Jet was 100 into the character and the project. Despite this the show is unequivocally stolen by Josephine Siao FongFong as Fong Sai Yuk's kung fu fighting mother. She plays her character to perfection showing a fantastic knack for comedy which I'm not sure she ever got to display in her roles when she was in her prime and also kicking ass in . Sibelle Hu also steals a fair amount of screen as the mother of Fong Sai Yuk's love interest the beautiful Michelle Reis and wife of semivillain Tiger Lui Chan ChungYung? who also shines with an affably overstated performance. Of all the cast Fong Sai Yuk's father Paul Chu Kong? is probably the only one whose performance is rather weak and forgettable. Main villain Chiu Man Cheuk is conspicuously far more charismatic and convincing than in any other movie he's been in apart from The Blade.Fong Sai Yuk could be described as a lighthearted riff on the wirefu wave launched by Once Upon A Time In China. Certainly humour is brought to the front here whilst the politics is pushed quite far to the back. Hong Kong humour can be an acquired taste and the jokes sometimes fall flat in Fong Sai Yuk. Jeff Lau's jokes are generally a bit hit or miss but he aims so wide that it's not surprising. There are some genuinely funny moments though.When it comes down to it the action scenes are what really got me hooked when I saw the movies though. Since Tsui Hark raised the bar several notches above anything people had imagined possible for fight scenes when he made Once Upon A Time In China the Hong Kong choreographers had been engaged in a battle to see who could produce the most inventive and outlandish action scenes. The best of the bunch tended to be in Jet Li's movies and the fights in Fong Sai Yuk are fine examples of HK creativity. Purists will no doubt cry that the fight scenes rely too heavily on wires editing and stunt doubles but I'm sure that Bruce Lee's statement about missing all that heavenly glory applies here. Grandly conceived if not flawlessly executed the fights in Fong Sai Yuk were especially impressive to these innocent eyes that had never seen action Hong Kong style before. How the? What the? Did they just? etc etc. I wish they'd spent just a little bit more time tightening up the camera angles and hiding the obvious doubles better but I can't fault them for ambition. I think the movie won the best action award that year which is pretty impressive for a HK movie made in 1993 the year the new wave style reached its peak.Fong Sai Yuk is definitely a movie that has a special place in many fans hearts even though it does have too many misfired jokes and rough edges to be called a true masterpiece. Still a must see for any fan of Hong Kong cinema though a wonderfully representative example of what makes it so special and unique.Sadly the DVD owner that wishes to watch Fong Sai Yuk is faced with only 3 choices none of which are particularly appealing. They are1. Original Universe HK DVD with Mono sound. One of the earlier HK DVDs basically a laser disc badly transfered to the smaller radius medium. Burnt in subs washed out picture from a dirty print and badly framed such that the picture drifts up and down throughout sometimes cutting subtitles in half.2. Universe Remaster HK DVD with 5.1 sound. New picture transfer that now looks more like VHS than laser disc thanks to excessive edge enhancement but at last removable subtitles that are clear and easy to read. Unfortunately the disc is totally ruined by the worst 5.1 remix ever. Sounds like it was mixed in a bathroom by a monkey with a rat in his head. Crap new sound effects totally mistimed and with completely random levels dialogue mixed to fit listeners on a heavy acid trip and... well it's horrible actually. I tried it for 15 minutes then switched back to the original disc.3. The Legend  absurdly retitled and otherwise Disneyfied release that doubtless looks miles better than either HK disc but is rendered totally worthless by the inexcusable failure to include the original Cantonese language audio and English subtitles. If this is all you've seen you've not seen the movie at all. It's probably cut by 30 minutes and rescored with rap music knowing Miramax's utter contempt for their catalogue and audience.I think the best versions of the movies I have are still the long play VHS copies recorded from Channel 4 in the UK before I discovered DVD to be quite honest. A ridiculous state of affairs for such a classic movie!".

	onyx:emotionText "Fong Sai Yuk III were the first 2 HK movies I saw though an accident of video recording meant that I had to wait at least a year to see the beginning of Pt I and the end of Pt II. Even in incomplete form the two films were enough to make me an instant fan of HK Cinema after years of disappointment with the Hollywood fare I'd been exposed to. I think they're possibly the best introduction to the territory's movie industry there could be... if you don't love Fong Sai Yuk chances are Hong Kong Cinema is not the cinema for you. It's a rare example of everything coming together if not perfectly then at least very well.The solid script from Jeff Lau is the anchor without which the movie would not have succeeded. In typical Jeff Lau style it bounces all over the place from stupid comedy to high melodrama via a little romance and the obligatory gender confusions and of course leading into the incredibly imaginitive action sequences choreographed by director Corey Yuen and former opera brother Yuen Tak.The production values for the movie are very high if not quite as slick as the Once Upon A Time In China movies they clearly aspire to emulating. Ann Hui is credited as Production Designer here a rare role for the critically adored director. The cinematography from Jingle Ma is top notch framing the luscious sets and costumes and the action very well. The soundtrack from James Wong with regular partner Romeo Diaz seems a little too close to his score for OUATIC in places but mostly does a commendable job.Jet Li has said that Fong Sai Yuk is the character that most closely resembles his real personality from all those he's played. From the small time I've spent in Jet's company I'm not sure his selfimage is entirely accurate but he's probably in a better position to judge than me Certainly Fong Sai Yuk is a very likeable chap the way Jet plays him and you can tell Jet was 100 into the character and the project. Despite this the show is unequivocally stolen by Josephine Siao FongFong as Fong Sai Yuk's kung fu fighting mother. She plays her character to perfection showing a fantastic knack for comedy which I'm not sure she ever got to display in her roles when she was in her prime and also kicking ass in . Sibelle Hu also steals a fair amount of screen as the mother of Fong Sai Yuk's love interest the beautiful Michelle Reis and wife of semivillain Tiger Lui Chan ChungYung? who also shines with an affably overstated performance. Of all the cast Fong Sai Yuk's father Paul Chu Kong? is probably the only one whose performance is rather weak and forgettable. Main villain Chiu Man Cheuk is conspicuously far more charismatic and convincing than in any other movie he's been in apart from The Blade.Fong Sai Yuk could be described as a lighthearted riff on the wirefu wave launched by Once Upon A Time In China. Certainly humour is brought to the front here whilst the politics is pushed quite far to the back. Hong Kong humour can be an acquired taste and the jokes sometimes fall flat in Fong Sai Yuk. Jeff Lau's jokes are generally a bit hit or miss but he aims so wide that it's not surprising. There are some genuinely funny moments though.When it comes down to it the action scenes are what really got me hooked when I saw the movies though. Since Tsui Hark raised the bar several notches above anything people had imagined possible for fight scenes when he made Once Upon A Time In China the Hong Kong choreographers had been engaged in a battle to see who could produce the most inventive and outlandish action scenes. The best of the bunch tended to be in Jet Li's movies and the fights in Fong Sai Yuk are fine examples of HK creativity. Purists will no doubt cry that the fight scenes rely too heavily on wires editing and stunt doubles but I'm sure that Bruce Lee's statement about missing all that heavenly glory applies here. Grandly conceived if not flawlessly executed the fights in Fong Sai Yuk were especially impressive to these innocent eyes that had never seen action Hong Kong style before. How the? What the? Did they just? etc etc. I wish they'd spent just a little bit more time tightening up the camera angles and hiding the obvious doubles better but I can't fault them for ambition. I think the movie won the best action award that year which is pretty impressive for a HK movie made in 1993 the year the new wave style reached its peak.Fong Sai Yuk is definitely a movie that has a special place in many fans hearts even though it does have too many misfired jokes and rough edges to be called a true masterpiece. Still a must see for any fan of Hong Kong cinema though a wonderfully representative example of what makes it so special and unique.Sadly the DVD owner that wishes to watch Fong Sai Yuk is faced with only 3 choices none of which are particularly appealing. They are1. Original Universe HK DVD with Mono sound. One of the earlier HK DVDs basically a laser disc badly transfered to the smaller radius medium. Burnt in subs washed out picture from a dirty print and badly framed such that the picture drifts up and down throughout sometimes cutting subtitles in half.2. Universe Remaster HK DVD with 5.1 sound. New picture transfer that now looks more like VHS than laser disc thanks to excessive edge enhancement but at last removable subtitles that are clear and easy to read. Unfortunately the disc is totally ruined by the worst 5.1 remix ever. Sounds like it was mixed in a bathroom by a monkey with a rat in his head. Crap new sound effects totally mistimed and with completely random levels dialogue mixed to fit listeners on a heavy acid trip and... well it's horrible actually. I tried it for 15 minutes then switched back to the original disc.3. The Legend  absurdly retitled and otherwise Disneyfied release that doubtless looks miles better than either HK disc but is rendered totally worthless by the inexcusable failure to include the original Cantonese language audio and English subtitles. If this is all you've seen you've not seen the movie at all. It's probably cut by 30 minutes and rescored with rap music knowing Miramax's utter contempt for their catalogue and audience.I think the best versions of the movies I have are still the long play VHS copies recorded from Channel 4 in the UK before I discovered DVD to be quite honest.

	schema:reviewBody "This early Jet Li vehicle has had rather more exposure than some of his other flicks of the period thanks to Dimension cashing in on Li's success in the US and releasing films from his back catalogue. Sadly Dimension's decision had many fans up in arms as the films were usually recut badly dubbed and had new music added which was inferior to the original's. As far as I can see THE LEGEND is no exception with the level of dubbing being particularly noticeable. It's quite lucky that this film has plenty of comedy as I imagine taking it seriously would be a difficult task.Li plays the role of the Chinese hero with typical ease and gets to do far more comedy here than we usually see in his movies. He fits in with the rest of the actors nicely and his martial arts skills are of course outstanding. The supporting characters are little more than caricatures although saying that they do tend to stick in your mind  faces such as Li's rolypoly assistant or his kickass mother or the weirdly pale bad guy. The plot is confused but the film looks wonderfully colourful something I'd attribute to the surehand direction of Corey Yuen.The best element of the film is of course the action. It's here where THE LEGEND really excels and becomes better than the norm. Wire work is in use here at all times so don't go in expecting realism instead you get scenes of people flying running along on the tops of crowds and performing all manner of gravitydefying stunts. The fights are generally excellent with three big standouts. The first is the kung fu contest where participants lose when they touch the ground when Li joins it it goes on for about ten minutes but never becomes boring. The other two quality moments are the battles with the pale bad guy one halfway through and the other at the climax both are terrifically inventive and packed with imaginative situations. It's the cartoonish action that really bolsters this movie and makes it what it is an unassuming film with fun at the top of the agenda.".

Jet Li is likable as Fong Sai Yuk a genuine hero to the Chinese about whom tall tales are spun sort of like Daniel Boone a young dogooder who seems perpetually caught up in one mess after another despite his good intentions. Veteran action actress Sibelle Hu not surprisingly steals the picture as Fong's future mother in law Tiger Lily a sentimental romantic and kickass martial artist. She winds up accompanying him on his adventure to make certain he doesn't cheat on her daughter thereby becoming a rare thing in the movies  a mother in law who is also an action sidekick! Any of the big set piece fight scenes are worth the rental especially the one early in the movie on a huge and rather unsteady looking tower. Plus there is real humor here which is integrated into the situations rather than tacked on in the fashion of so many Chinese movies. Very entertaining and can be watched again and again.".

Set some time in the past  sorry folks Chinese history is not my strong point  when Empire was all this sees a group of dissidents attempting to overthrow their evil overlords. Jet Li acting as Executive Producer as well as the main star plays Fong SaiYuk a cheeky chappy with amazing Kung Fu prowess who falls in love with the beautiful daughter of an influential businessman and must prove his worth to the judgemental Patriarch. That's all I could really glean from the haphazard plotting but it mattered not one jot as this is all about the fight scenes which are many and varied. Going the Jackie Chan route of making use of scenery this sees Jet leaping about on bamboo scaffolding dancing on rooftops and even fighting on the shoulders and heads of the eagerly watching crowd. Whilst the comedy element quickly becomes tiresome and irritating the action is dazzling though be warned it is all wire work so if that annoys or disappoints this may not be the chopsocky movie for you. Whilst far from great this nevertheless passed the time efficiently enough. Oh and try to get hold of the subtitled version if you can as the dubbed voices on the version I watched are almost unbearable at times.".

	schema:headline " Amazing fight sequences a mustsee for kungfu enthusiasts!";
	schema:reviewBody "Jet Li starred in this film shortly after making Once Upon A Time In China and once again he kicks ass. The fight scenes are truly amazing for its time and film is just brimming with entertainment from start to finish. The story starts off with our cheeky smiling hero Jet Li getting into a fight with some guy over a girl which leads to a sports competition to determine the winner followed by some kungfu ass whoopin. Fantastic. This film doesn't stop on the action and although some of the humour is puzzling at times and the soundtrack and sound effects pure hilarious I am pleased I took the time to watch this. The story consists of Fong Sai Yuk Jet Li being forced into a family marriage his romance with the girl finding out his dad is part of some rebel movement and protecting the whole family then on as they are on the run. Some of the choreagraphy is truly awesome especially in one scene where Jet Li is fighting the evil govner with a small pole wheras the govner has a huge fk off 20 ft one. The action is superbly captured and the stunts are tremendous and the comedy through the film is so cheesy it helps keep the film from not taking itself too seriously. There are a few stupid scenes in this particulary one where Jet Li dresses up as a woman and another one where Mother Fong covers her hair so people mistake her for a man even though she has make up on and still looks like a chick. These are strange parts of the film but keeps it light hearted and I think if I had watched this film when I was a kid I would love it to bits. Kung fu enthusiasts should definately take a look at this for the action and to see Jet Li do his stuff but it's not really one for the mainstream hollywood film lovers. Fans of Jet Li should check this out to see how how he progressed from this to classics such as Twin Warriors Fists of Fury and the undoubtedly magnificent Hero. Mainstream film audiences should also see this so they can understand the truly aweful american martial arts films they have seen over the past decade and appreciate some real skill and finesse from the middle east.".

The fight scenes are well choreographed with a moderate amount of wirework.      If possible get a Hong Kong version that has subtitles rather than dubbing. The American version The Legend is about four minutes shorter than the original and there's a subtle joke that's missed in the American version Sai Yuk is questioned by the authorities for fighting and afterwards tells his friends that he gave an alias. He starts out by saying the alias he gave was Wong at this point he does a stance and the Wong Fei Hung music starts to play suggesting that he used the name Wong Fei Hung another character he's played in films when he completes the name Wong Jing. Now Wong Jing is a famous Hong Kong director who has directed Jet Li in a number of films. He is also called the Madman of Hong Kong for the outrageousnessstrangeness of some of his movies. It's a little inside joke if you know Hong Kong martial arts films. Another scene they cut from the American version is Sai Yuk praying in the morning to protest to his future fatherinlaw his captivity. The American DVD has a better transfer than most Hong Kong DVDs and the translation is pretty good but if you want the whole film then go to Chinatown and get an original.".

It sounds like they should clash but instead they run in and out of eachother with a crafted elegance so that you're always engaged by it.And of course if thats not enough for you there's the fights which are Cory Yuens best to date. The coordination displayed in these amazing stunts is superb and reflects each character marvellously. For example Jet Li's playful and young Fong Sai Yuk is a far cry from his serious and restrained Wong FeiHong from his Once Upon A Time series and so the fighting style is different to reflect that. He moves a lot more playful cracks jokes between punches and it is a marvel to behold.It is one of the funniest and entertaining films out there and is a definite must see for all martial arts fans.".

This often underrated movie is highly recommendable to anyone who likes western movies. Let me add that this movie is NOT a musical in one scene Elvis is opening a door to look into a saloon where a band is playing in one of his awful musical comedies the man would jump onto the stage and perform some tune but here he turns around and closes the door.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was intended as a totally different kind of role for Elvis. It's the only movie in which Elvis does not sing at all the theme song is played over the main titles.  Unfortunately the film doesn't really get off the ground.  Not far off the ground anyway.  It's a real pity too because Elvis could have been superb and the movie a modern classic.  Now it's just an interesting departure in a property sabotaged by substandard production values and script.  Elvis acts well throughout but not as well and convincingly as in the other Western drama that he did 1960's Flaming Star.  The passage of eight years had dulled Elvis' enthusiasm for filmmaking and hard on the heels of the taping of his phenomenal 1968 TV special taped in late June and one year before his July 1969 return to the stage Elvis' mind was on other things.  Elvis so eager in 1956 to get into dramatic roles had become jaded by the fiscal realities that dictated that he squander his prodigious talent to a great extent at least on subpar fare.  Elvis does a competent job in Charro! but at some points he does not really seem to be 'into it.' I find that somewhat surprising because Elvis loved guns horses and playing cowboys and Indians or cops and robbers and the film could have been a blast for him to do.  I'm sure that he enjoyed some of the role's physicality including the horseplay gunplay and fisticuffs but at times he appears bored.  In truth this apparent ennui on Elvis' part is probably less a result of cumulative boredom with and contempt for the path that his film career had taken and more a reflection of him really not being given much to do within the script.  The role could have been a lot grittier and Elvis' character more active and proactive.  The branding scene and subsequent beating of Elvis' character is pretty brutal but other than that most of the film seems sanitized.  Yep it has its violent spots but I think that it would have profited from more of it and more of a menacing feel overall.  It's a spaghetti western man...it's SUPPOSED to be down 'n' dirty violent and unPC.  It's got a definite madeforTV look and feel about it especially compared with the contemporary 'spaghetti westerns' that were so popular and by which Charro! is obviously inspired but even with older Hollywood fare like Shane.  After a promising start Charro! comes across to me as a little bit dull. It has its moments but they're too few and far between.  I wouldn't say that it is a bad film just that it's a wasted opportunity.  Then again the film came so late in Elvis' Hollywood career right at the cusp of his return to where he really belonged  the concert stage  that perhaps it wouldn't have made a difference had the film been all that it could have been.  Still...The ending is a major anticlimax and the entire film just sort of lurches toward denouement.  The key fault is that the story is weak.  It doesn't really go anywhere fast and much of the scripting is substandard.  The cinematography is also extremely unimaginative  the potential was great with those centralArizona locations but it's never fully exploited.  Sam Peckinpah or Sergio Leone would have had a field day.  It's nice to see Elvis wandering around in the desert instead of being filmed against a studio backdrop.  Elvis as always is utterly fantastic when he's being menacing angry or just directing a withering stare at somebody.  His role as Jess Wade is just a little too soft  well what I'm saying is that if his role were more directly like Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name I think it'd play to some of Elvis' greatest acting strengths.  Even without Clint's trademark squint Elvis was always naturally adept at portraying a lot with just a look.  Jesse Wade could still basically be a good guy without being all that nice about it.  Elvis looks cool in this movie too.  He'd have made a great spaghettiwestern hero.  The legend goes that Elvis felt uncomfortable with a beard and that the male members of the crew tried to put him at ease by growing their own facial hair out.  Even Colonel Parker got in on the act.The sad fact is that Elvis is terribly underutilized.  So is everybody else. Just as I think that Elvis' character could have been at least a little harder so could Victor French's bad guy have been...well..badder.  I mean he was bad but he was no Lee Van Cleef.  Overall he and the supporting cast did a good job but they too had little to work with.  The fact that many were basically TV players perhaps only reinforced the TVmovie quality that I sense in this film.  James Sikking later the SWAT leader from Hill Street Blues revels in his role as 'Gunner' and Solomon Sturges is great as a psychotic outlaw.  Ina Balin is also very good but she really doesn't have a big part in the film.  What this film really needed was Sergio Leone directing it with a stronger script.  Think Elvis in the lead of High Plains Drifter   it could have been done and it would have worked but again the material shortchanged the man's potential.  The movie's poster promised a different kind of role...a different kind of man and it was a valiant effort.  I like the film overall but it's far far less than it might have been.  At least they had Hugo Montenegro aboard for the music.  I've always loved the ominous and atmospheric title song.  If only Charro! was a creative progeny of the excellent Flaming Star steeped in a late60s spaghettiwestern sensibility.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was intended as a totally different kind of role for Elvis. It's the only movie in which Elvis does not sing at all the theme song is played over the main titles.  Unfortunately the film doesn't really get off the ground.  Not far off the ground anyway.  It's a real pity too because Elvis could have been superb and the movie a modern classic.  Now it's just an interesting departure in a property sabotaged by substandard production values and script.  Elvis acts well throughout but not as well and convincingly as in the other Western drama that he did 1960's Flaming Star.  The passage of eight years had dulled Elvis' enthusiasm for filmmaking and hard on the heels of the taping of his phenomenal 1968 TV special taped in late June and one year before his July 1969 return to the stage Elvis' mind was on other things.  Elvis so eager in 1956 to get into dramatic roles had become jaded by the fiscal realities that dictated that he squander his prodigious talent to a great extent at least on subpar fare.  Elvis does a competent job in Charro! but at some points he does not really seem to be 'into it.' I find that somewhat surprising because Elvis loved guns horses and playing cowboys and Indians or cops and robbers and the film could have been a blast for him to do.  I'm sure that he enjoyed some of the role's physicality including the horseplay gunplay and fisticuffs but at times he appears bored.

The performances are fine  I would taken a little more time creating this film still everything about it ranges from adequate to professional.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps I was motivated to watch this film not because this wasn't going to be one of Elvis' 60's fluff films but because I hadn't shaved in awhile and this film is famed in the Presley canon for him having a beard and mustache. It was a very good film that kept me interested.Charro! isn't about the eccentric LatinAmerican novelty singer that would be Charo but about Jess Wade a former outlaw who wants to go straight. He rides into town looking for an old flame. Suddenly his old gang led by Vince Hackett Victor French ambush him and forces him to go with them to their hideout. The Hackett Gang have stolen a valuable Victory Cannon from Mexico but are going to have Jess Wade take the fall. To make it even worse for Wade they described him as having a wound on his neck so they hold him down and Vince burns his neck perhaps Charro means burn in Spanish. They abandon him but Wade gets back to town where the people there support him. By chance Vince's crazy brother Billy Roy a brilliant performance by Solomon Sturges comes in and tries to stir up trouble but Wade is there. In the melee Billy Roy shoots the sheriff. While the sheriff recuperates Billy Roy is jailed. The Hackett gang now threatens Wade who's now temporary sheriff and the town to let Billy Roy go or have their town destroyed via the cannon.I found the movie quite intriguing. I wanted to see how Wade would get his revenge on his old friends. The acting is a cut above those fluff films but Elvis still performs in his usual thickasmolassesSouthernaccent way just a bit meaner though. Elvis always had great screen presence but his acting was hitormiss. The Southwest scenery is quite breathtaking no doubt filmed near Elvis' favorite city Las Vegas. The soundtrack is weak Elvis sings the theme song at the beginning but the rest of the music is just generic Western acoustic with that 60's flavour.Still this was a lot better than the Video Movie Guide rated it. Probably the best Elvis film I've seen in awhile besides Jailhouse Rock. Worth a look.".

Victor French has a field day as the obnoxious villain who sets Elvis up. He uses the cannon to wipe out a platoon of Mexican Federale troops during a border crossing. Elvis must have grown progressively tired with making the same old musical comedies with attractive costars where he warbled a song or two. In Charro! Elvis sings only one song the title tune. He isn't shown singing this song. Hugo Montenegro provides an outstanding orchestral score with spunk. Meanwhile French makes an excellent villain who has no qualms about killing. He is prepared to murder members of his own gang. After he captures Jess during a gunfight in a sleepy town and burns his neck with a branding iron to simulate a bullet crease Vince lets the word spread that his former friend stole the cannon. Jess recovers from the branding ropes a horse in the wilderness and then rides back to the town where his girlfriend Tracey Winters Ian Balin of The Comancheros runs a saloon. Furthermore Jess is friends with the local lawman Dan Ramsey James Almanzar and he believes Jess had nothing to do with the theft. No sooner has Elvis arrived in town than Vince's young hotheaded brother Billy Ray Solomon Sturges shows up itching for liquor and woman. Jess captures him and Sheriff Ramsay imprisons him but Ramsay takes a shot in the arm. Ramsay winds up bedridden while Jess takes over as the town lawman. Vince demands the release of his brother or he threatens to blast the town to smithereens with the cannon. Elvis' fans didn't respond to this Spaghettistyle western. Nevertheless Charro! is a good western.The movie Charro! and the novelization that author Harry Whittington wrote are starkly different. For starters Jess Wade and Vince Hackett don't know each other in the novel. Furthermore Vince doesn't frame Jess for the theft of the weapon. Additionally Vince's gang mows down the Federales as they cross the river with their rifles instead of the cannon. Whittington does have the scene when Jess smashes Billy Roy's head against the jail bars. The sheriff died during his fight with Billy Roy in the novel instead of lingering beside his wife in the movie.".

Elvis plays it straight equipped with a beard to fight his former gang of 'friends'  the leader of which is Victor French in a tourdeforce performance. A fine supporting cast which includes Ina Balin and Solomon Sturges turning in two admirable screen performances helps to give Elvis' movie career a boost at this point in the 'Comeback' era of his musical oddyssey. Charro! is a fresh and uplifting western and is a welcome change to hear EP only sing one song in a movie and this one is over the opening credits. Elvis delivers a good character portrayal of Jess Wade and isn't as stereotyped as some of the previous characters from the other films from his mid60's celluloid repertoire. I think any westernElvis fan would view this as more than just a 'curiosity piece' because it does turn out to be quite an engaging 94 minutes. You almost forget that it's the man himself on screen who we are so used to watching being surrounded by Girls Bikini's Cotton Candy and racing cars. The movie also features some beautiful Arizona cinematography. Recommended.".

Had he made this in the early '60's I am sure it would have made for a better film . It is obvious they based a lot of this on the successful Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns but it lacks the sparkle of Sergio Leone direction.Compare Elvis' acting in this to Flaming Star and the difference is sadly noticable.".

Had he made this in the early '60's I am sure it would have made for a better film . It is obvious they based a lot of this on the successful Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns but it lacks the sparkle of Sergio Leone direction.Compare Elvis' acting in this to Flaming Star and the difference is sadly noticable.";

By that I mean real locations for the exteriors which is a switch from the cardboard and rear projection effects of his earlier films. Elvis looks very good here better than some of his previous efforts. He seemed a bid pudgy in a lot of his musicals but in this one he's trim and looks great in a beard. He does seem to sleep walk thru some of his scenes and there could have been more action but it's certainly a better film than some of the video guide books make it. Compare this film with FRANKIE AND JOHNNY KISSIN' COUSINS PARADISE HAWAIIAN STYLE and especially horrible films like HARUM SACARUM and CHARRO looks pretty damn good. If you like Elivs and why would you be reading this if you weren't then CHARRO is a must see. Too bad he didn't make more like this. His next two were pretty bad.

When I was a young girl growing up in England my parents loved Westerns above all else on television. Gunslinger was fantastic and I hadn't seen a man as handsome as Tony Young since I discovered Elvis. I am also a lover of Western films and think that Charro is a darn good movie..great storyline and characters and the music is just great. In fact the song Charro is one of my favorite Elvis songs and I always play it in the jukebox when I go to a certain hamburger restaurant in the Graceland Plaza area near the mansion in Memphis. I am saddened to think that all three of these gorgeous men died relatively young. They left so much behind and made a lot of people happy. May they rest in peace.".

The bearded face does indeed create an amazing transformation of the Elvis persona and is one of the highlights of the picture. It doesn't go far enough though without achieving that flat out Lee Van Cleef mean and matched against an adversary who's also less than sheer malevolence the movie loses much of it's potential.The film's finale in fact seems to blow up as quickly as one of those cannon fired dynamite packets. When Vince Hackett Victor French falls apart and simply gives up what the heck happened to Gunner James Sikking and Mody Charles H. Gray? I mean they just disappeared! Then as the town regroups and Jess prepares for the trip to Mexico Mrs. Ramsey Barbara Werle plants a kiss on him when in just the prior scene she was ready to beat the snot out of him blaming him for her husband's death!

Ina Balin looking radiant and very much like a high school sweetheart of mine doesn't have much to do here as Presley's romantic interest but even that seems wasted by the end of the story. Do you think he ever sent for her?If for no other reason Charro! is worth seeing for a non characteristic look at Elvis Presley in a role that would have served much better at the beginning of his career than near it's end.

Spaghetti westerns were still hot so he thought he had finally found the project he was looking for.This was intended to be a TV movie and Elvis thought this would be an opening for him to take his movie career in a different direction. A TV movie would not rely on the box office to carry it. It failed in the box office since it was not supposed to be released to the theaters and had a TV movie look to it. Colonel Parker did not want him to do TV movies and this was probably a set up to keep Presley in line. Parker was always worried about losing his meal ticket. Presley almost fired Parker he did his TV Special in 1968.As mentioned earlier it was a well made movie that should have succeeded but it was never meant to be released to the theaters. He got to look like a part and he and the movie had a gritty look to it. Charles Marquis Warren was one of the premier western directors then but most of his work was TV so with the supporting actors mostly coming from TV it did not fly then in the theaters. At that time it was hard for actors to do both TV and movies and be bankable. Today that is not the case so maybe Charro was ahead of its time. Elvis could have had a whole new career with this movie if only he had gotten the right support. Maybe he would have lived longer since he would have had a new interest to stimulate him. Rest in peace Elvis.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a pleasant surprise. It was made in 1969 the last year that Presley made movies. It is the only movie of his 31 where his character does not sing. Despite this Presley is able to carry the movie on his acting ability. He is not quite as cool as Eastwood or Wayne at their best but he does deliver a solid and reasonably intense performance.The first half of the movie is fine as it sets up a confrontation between exoutlaw Jess Wade Presley and the gang that he rode with. Vince Victor French the head of the gang is vicious especially to his own gang members but he does care about protecting his idiot brother  Billy Roy Solomon Sturges so he is at least a two note character.In the second part of the movie believability falls apart with the outlaws using a single cannon to threaten to blow up a town. Since artillery range for a cannon at that time was only about a mile one wonders why the townspeople cannot just figure out which direction the cannon shots are coming from ride one mile in that direction and arrest the outlaws. By this time outlaw Presley has been made sheriff of the town apparently a criminal history did not disqualify him on the job application. For some inexplicable reason he chooses to hold Billy Ray prisoner for shooting the previous sheriff but does not arrest his brother gang leader Vince for kidnapping torture and blowing up half the town among other felony crimes. Jess might have thought to study some legal books before becoming sheriff.In the second half the movie loses its lyrical quality and resembles an average hohum episode of Gunsmoke or Bonanza. What this proves is that Presley had the ability to make quality movies but he was not good in selecting his material. Still for Western fans it is reasonably entertaining a grade C entertainment made into a B one by Presley.".

Vince Victor French the head of the gang is vicious especially to his own gang members but he does care about protecting his idiot brother  Billy Roy Solomon Sturges so he is at least a two note character.In the second part of the movie believability falls apart with the outlaws using a single cannon to threaten to blow up a town. Since artillery range for a cannon at that time was only about a mile one wonders why the townspeople cannot just figure out which direction the cannon shots are coming from ride one mile in that direction and arrest the outlaws. By this time outlaw Presley has been made sheriff of the town apparently a criminal history did not disqualify him on the job application. For some inexplicable reason he chooses to hold Billy Ray prisoner for shooting the previous sheriff but does not arrest his brother gang leader Vince for kidnapping torture and blowing up half the town among other felony crimes. Jess might have thought to study some legal books before becoming sheriff.In the second half the movie loses its lyrical quality and resembles an average hohum episode of Gunsmoke or Bonanza. What this proves is that Presley had the ability to make quality movies but he was not good in selecting his material. Still for Western fans it is reasonably entertaining a grade C entertainment made into a B one by Presley.";

	schema:reviewBody "My favorite Elvis Presley movie is Charro! National General Pictures released Elvis' twentyninth movie theatrically in 1969. This explosive postAmerican Civil War horse opera takes place on the Southwestern frontier near Mexico. The Motion Picture Association of America granted it a G rating for General Audiences. All previous Presley films received a G rating. Nevertheless Charro! differs from all other Elvis movies. I am surprised Charro! wasn't given an M for Mature Audiences because of all its shooting and killing. Incidentally he would make only two more films after Charro! The Trouble with Girls and A Change of Habit. Meantime this Presley oater drew a line in the dust. Comparatively the content of Charro! is visually as well as narratively serious. This western qualifies as the grittiest movie the King of Rock and Roll ever made. For example Elvis wore a beard throughout it. Moreover he rode through its entire 98 minutes and never strummed a single song. He did perform the main theme over the opening credits but he did not sing it in person. Obviously Charro! exhibited an Elvis who had stepped out of his comfort zone. This reality oriented western depicted men dying violent deaths while the hero suffered horribly for society's sins. Not only did Charro! bomb at the box office but the movie also alienated Presley fandom. Naturally despite its change of pace the critics panned it. All they saw was Elvis. They did not see the dust the amplified violence and the high body count that complicated this Elvis outing. According to a popular saying if it ain't broke don't fix it Elvis stretched more than his fans wanted him to in Charro! Charro! deserves reappraisal because it dared to be different. Writer  director Charles Marquis Warren saddled Charro! with greater realism and the film never panders for laughs. Warren's credentials as a western filmmaker are impeccable. He created two of popular western television series of the 1950s Rawhide and Gunsmoke. Furthermore he originated The Virginian during the 1960s. Finally Warren helmed over ten westerns for the bigscreen including Charro! Consequently Charro! was forged from the perspective of a veteran filmmaker thoroughly acquainted with the conventions of the western genre. Charro! opens as Jess Wade Elvis Presley rides into a sleepy Mexican village. He enters a cantina and inquires about a woman who is supposed to meet him. Jess gets the surprise of his life when his old nemesis Vince Hackett Victor French appears with two triggerhappy gunmen. They corner Jess in the cantina and a gunfight follows. Jess manages to escape but he does not get far. Another of Vince's henchmen catches him outside as he is leaving the cantina and holds him at gunpoint. Vince explains to Jess that the woman in question Tracy Winters is not in town. He lured Jess into the village on the pretext that Tracy had sent word that she would meet him. Vince is jealous because Tracy was his girlfriend and Jess stole her from him. Earlier Jess had ridden with Vince and his gang of desperadoes. He left the gang to go straight and win Tracy's heart. Vince plans to thwart Jess's dream. Vince has stolen a Mexican victory cannon. Furthermore he has circulated a description of the man that stole it. Naturally Vince attributes the crime to Jess. As further proof of Jess's guilt Vince claims the thief can be recognized by a scar from a bullet that left a flesh wound on his neck. Vince and his men jump Jess wrestle him to the ground and Vince sears Jess's neck with redhot branding iron. After Jess recovers Vince allows him to leave their remote campsite in the desert. Vince reminds Jess that Mexican and American authorities are searching for a man that fits his description. Jess trudges out into the desert dragging his saddle. Eventually he catches a horse breaks it and rides to a small American town. The local lawman Sheriff Ramsey James Almanzar believes Jess when he tells him Vince framed him for the theft of the cannon. Jess sets out to clear his name. Fortuitously Vince's lunatic younger brother Billy Roy Solomon Sturges rides into the same town. He shoots Sheriff Ramsey and Jess takes over for his friend and jails Billy Roy. When he learns about Billy Roy's predicament Vince threatens to destroy the town with the cannon! Jess refuses to cave into Vince's threat despite the opposition from the town.The dramatic elements of Charro! distinguish it from other Elvis films. This rugged western contains duplicity theft premeditated murder torture and mutilation. Vince and his men wipe out an entire Mexican Army patrol as they are crossing the Rio Grande. Vince personally leads these troops into this trap. As villains go Vince is the most unscrupulous dastard that a Presley protagonist has ever faced. Vince displays no qualms about murder. He is prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve his objective. Quite a body count piles up in Charro! Jess's lawman friend dies during the barrage of cannon fire that Vince levels at the town. Elvis Presley never played a hero like Jess. Apart from his beard Presley must submit to torture and mutilation so he will fit the description that Vince has circulated. Nobody ever did anything like this to Elvis. The only thing that differentiates Charro! from Elvis's previous westerns Love Me Tender and Flaming Star is the ending. Elvis survives the fracas and takes Vince and Victory Cannon back to Mexico. In conclusion Charro! qualifies as Elvis Presley's most unusual movie. The gritty subject matter and the death and violence in it set it apart from his lightweight musical dramas.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching CHARRO back to back with FLAMING STAR made for a great Saturday afternoon. The old school Hollywood Western of 1960 had changed so much by 1969 and the spaghetti westerninfluenced CHARRO. What hadn't changed was Elvis' eminent ability to entertain.Charles Marquis Warren who produced wrote and directed CHARRO has an unimpeachable place in the Western pantheon He developed for television both GUNSMOKE and THE VIRGINIAN and created RAWHIDE. Yeah it's obvious Warren was trying to leap aboard the spaghetti western bandwagon with CHARRO and the results are impressive even if he's no Sergio Leone he certainly did a better job aping the Italians than did Ted Post with HANG 'EM HIGH. The legacy of CHARRO for fans of THE VIRGINIAN is the film's influence on the ninth and final season of that series rechristened THE MEN FROM SHILOH which aired in 197071. From the redtinted title sequence to the scruffy furry faced heroes it's all seen here first.The cast is impressive. Victor French just a few years out from playing hapless Agent 44 on GET SMART demonstrates his range and plays with aplomb the megalomaniacal leader of the Hackett Gang a man who could gun down one of his own men and brand another. For those who know French only from good guy roles on LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE CARTER COUNTRY and HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN this film will prove an eyeopener. My own eyes were opened years ago when I caught French playing town taming Sheriff Bo Harker in The Tarnished Badge episode of GUNSMOKE where his badness just blew me away.Solomon Sturges was a standout as Billy Roy the psychotic kid brother of Vince. But I flashbacked to James Best as Billy John the psychotic kid brother of Lee Van Cleef in Randolph Scott's 1959 film RIDE LONESOME. The similarities kept piling up In RIDE LONESOME Randolph Scott uses the psycho kid brother as bait to lure out the big brother has to listen to the kid's threatening taunts of wait till my brother gets here... and in the end even ties the kid brother to a tree. Oh well if Warren was going to steal he at least knew to steal from Budd Boetticher! And Sturges does an outstanding job really upping the antic energy and the tension with his taunts and hysterical outbursts.James Sikking's unhinged Confederate veteran Gunner presages Donald Sutherland's Oddball in KELLY'S HEROES. Sikking made the most of his few scenes and stood out from Hackett's otherwise forgettable gang. And speaking of forgettable the exotic Ina Balin was cast in a thankless role with little to do but take a Grated bath and look on the action with concern. Like Inger Stevens in Dean Martin's FIVE CARD STUD she's the whorehouse madam with a heart of gold. Talk about your tired tropes! RAWHIDE alum Paul Brinegar gets a small role as town barber Opie Keetch. Lynn Kellogg as chorus girl Marcie appeared poised for a larger role that never developed.The story is engaging fast moving and exciting. The cannonfired dynamite attack on the town was startling I jumped when the godless heathen blasted off the church steeple!. The characters are ones you care about and learn details about as the story unfolds. Even the vile Vince Hackett has an inexplicable soft spot for his softheaded brother which gives him depth and hints at an unexplained and painful past. Sheriff Ramsey mentored the misguided Jess Wade and led him out of a life of crime lending weight to their relationship especially when Jess is sworn in as deputy. There's a sense throughout the film that we in the audience are only seeing the tip of the iceberg and that a lot has transpired in these characters' lives before Elvis crooned over the opening titles.Speaking of the rousing theme song it was cowritten by Billy Strange and Mac Davis who wrote several classic Elvis songs including Memories and A Little Less Conversation. Davis alone wrote In the Ghetto.The Hugo Montenegro soundtrack is excellent and heightens the suspense. It could have been billed as its own character since it's almost overwhelmingly pronounced and loud no complaintsI loved it!.Film critic Leonard Maltin dissed this flick with a nostar BOMB rating. Maltin writes Attempt to change Presley's image by casting him in a straight Western is a total failure. Elvis sings only one song. Wow! What this reveals is the fact Maltin doesn't know jack about Elvis. Elvis' first film LOVE ME TENDER was a straight Western as was FLAMING STAR in 1960. Maltin fails to see that CHARRO was returning Elvis to his cinematic roots reverting not changing his image. That Maltin bemoans the fact there's only one song in the movie shows his standard for an Elvis movie is the musical comedies. I enjoy those too but Elvis had long ago demonstrated his ability to play meatier roles. Maltin rejects CHARRO because it doesn't fit his preconceived expectation of what an Elvis movie should be. Okay maybe CHARRO isn't CITIZEN KANE but it definitely deserved better than the blithe dismissal of BOMB.I gave FLAMING STAR a 7star rating and CHARRO an 8star rating. Deep down I know FLAMING STAR was a better produced and weightier movie and features a better Elvis performance BUT... which movie will I want to rewatch again on a lazy rainy Saturday afternoon? CHARRO!".

	schema:reviewBody "The best thing about Gymkata is that it takes itself very seriously. Actual men and women worked on this film with no intention of creating a hysterically abominable failure.  Yet despite a premise that fails to produce anything beyond derisive laughter the project somehow landed financing.Highlights include The Khan of Parmistan a man who looks like Albert Einstein with Carl Levin's combover.  The Town of the Crazies a village of criminally insane people.  A man who severs his own hand for no apparent reason in the aforementioned town.  A man also in that town who wears a cloak with the back cut out to reveal his buttocks.  The oftrepeated location Karabal on the Caspian Sea.  The title card that lets us know when we've arrived at Karabal on the Caspian Sea.  Princess Rubali and her odd fascination with cutlery.  A man named Thorg who has been admired by the hero since Munich.  An actual line of dialogue that refers to a nightmare in hell.  The five punchkick sound effects that get recycled beyond believability.  A character who presumably fell to his death in a gaping barren canyon only to have his fall broken by some trees.  The random placement of gymnastics apparatuses.  The complete lack of resolution to numerous dangling plot points.  Kurt Thomas's wardrobe and haircut. The men working at The Salt Mines who just poke a large pile of refined salt with hoes.  Also we get the privilege of seeing a shadowy government agent push away a gymnastics groupie who tries to get too close to a postdismount Kurt Thomas.If you happen across this movie you must watch it.  Gymkata stands as an example of what happens when no one offers a dissenting opinion anywhere in the filmmaking process.  This is a technique that was later revealed in Joel Schumacher's Batman  Robin.Gymkata fulfills every expectation you may have of a film combining gymnastics and ninjitsu.  Plenty of gymnastics plenty of ninjitsu.  See it with a friend and enjoy its many failures.  All hail Gymkata!".

My own personal favorite parts are the pommel horse in the medieval lunatic asylum the guy saying there is some antiAmerican sentiment going around here immediately before being shot with an arrow and of course the YakMALLA! war cry of Parmistan. Oh yeah the four or five repetitions of Karabal on the Caspian Sea before the place is shown with just that as the caption on the screen.YakMALLA indeed!JP Marat L'Ami du Peuple".

	schema:headline " A Hilariously Bad Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "How this movie escaped the wrath of MST3K I'll never know.  Gymkata is a ridiculous action movie filled or is that empty? with paperthin plots dumb characters and preposterous situations.  But take it from me if you enjoy watching poor yet goofy movies you will enjoy Gymkata a great deal.The action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents at least I think they were government agents to become a spy.  You see his dad was another quasigovernment agent who has gone missing competing in this game called eloquently The Game.  So the gymnast played blandly by Kurt Thomas trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad.Sounds promising doesn't it?  Okay so it doesn't but still that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesn't begin to describe the joys of this movie.  They can be found in the movie's strange details.  Like the gymnast's mysterious Asian girlfriend who doesn't speak for the first half hour of the movie then all of a sudden begins to talk and doesn't shut up for the rest of the time!  Or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break The Game's nonexistent rules whenever he so pleases.  And of course there's our hero's delightful romp through the Village of The Crazies Evidently that's the place's real name!.  Nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there.But where this movie really shines is the action scenes.  Since our protagonist is a gymnast the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of Middle Eastern cities so that our Gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses.  It has to be seen to be believed.One interesting thing of note.  A lot I'd say about half the cast dies from being shot with an arrow.  Interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie.  If these were indeed effects my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds.  More likely this was the film's way of not paying extras.  Nevertheless Gymkata deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing.".

If you watch Gymkata expecting to see a solid performance by an Olympic gymnast then you are missing the allure this film has on so many 2835 year old men that secretly rent this title at least once a year ... for a good laugh.  The movie is funny because it's so bad and takes itself so seriously.  Enjoy it.  Stop analyzing it as of it were ever intended to be a cinematic masterpiece.  Bad movies deserve good ratings because they are so unintentionally funny.  So rent Gymkata Glitter and any movie with Julia Stiles sit back relax and marvel at the unintentional comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mullet Wars at its best man.  As expressed numerous times anyone that loves laughing at movies who appreciates camp value mullets bad acting extremely poorly acted sequences bad fight scenes indiscernible plot configurations and yes THE MULLET you will love this movie.Everyone around here is giving such glowing remarks about the camp value of the film maybe its high time we talk about just why this movie is BAD.  If you're in the mood for an epic adventure action movie do NOT see this one with hopes of coming out with your testosterone cravings sated.  Such is the curse of bad kung fu movies without genuine kung fu artists.  Why did this movie fail dismally at its objective?  Well I can think of a few reasons off the top of my head.  First off as alluded to this is an actionepic type of movie with definite parallels to Enter the Dragon.  Martial Artist chosen by government to go to some isolated little known area of the world to help the United States' cause by outwardly competing in some kind of competitiongame.So given its obvious reaching for Enter the Dragon memories you would think Clouse would have made an attempt to grab some good actors the kind of martial artists that could easily impress the audience with their moves. So who did they get?  All white guys including an olympic gold medalist in gymnastics Kurt Thomas.  So where in the martial arts action epic genre some directors sacrifice acting talent and bad english for superb martial arts Ninja 3 The Domination a bad movie with some pretty good martial arts and other directors sacrifice superb martial arts for well spoken english boyish charms and great acting ability David Carradine and Jeff Cooper in Circle of Iron a mustsee if you love martial arts genre whacky movies Clouse has in this case sacrificed acting ability of all variations for bad english and horrible martial arts sequences.Why else is this movie an utter failure at its objective?  Well part of the magic of Enter the Dragon was its theme of Shaolin martial arts.  This especially at the time was kind of a popular mystical topic that few understood but most everyone thought was cool.  In this way anything Eastern involving mysticism or fighting is a veritable well of immediate movie value hence the 80's ninja craze.  The problem with this movie is it gave the feel of a popular mystic subject without using any of the popular mysticism that gives this type of movie instant entertainment value to moviegoers regardless of accuracy.  The biggest attempt at this might be the name gymkata because it sounds kind of Eastern and the premise of mixing western and eastern styles.  But in actuality this premise is little better than a line in the movie because there is NOTHING else in the movie to support it.Why else?  Bad sequences choreography and directing.  When I think about this movie and Enter the Dragon I can't help but think that Clouse truly just was not trying with this movie.  Its the only way to explain his complete inept job of directing this movie.  The subplots are bare and underdeveloped.  The premise of the movie surrounds a game whose rules and dynamics are completely indescernible baffling and plain dumb.  As previously expounded upon the coincidences in this movie are terrible such as the infamous pommelhorse town of the crazies scene.  My honest guess is that after Kurt Thomas won the gold medal some money grubbing crazy producer the kind responsible for making 7th sequels and whatnot decided to capitalize on gold medal fame by starring a gymnast in a martial arts movie then proceeding to blackmail Robert Clouse into directing such a film and Clouse in his attempt to get back at his blackmailer sabotaged his own film by putting a bunch of badacting white guys who can't fight in a martial arts genre movie sticking in poorly developed subplots such as the love story between the princess and the gymnast and overall making a movie that any director would sit back watch on the big screen take the ONLY copy of the film lock it in an iron chest and bury deep within the earth's core.".

So be it. I liked it. The cheesy element made it work in a weird way. The locations were authentic from what I remember and the action was pretty good. The scenes that stick in my mind are the crazies in the village very funny but almost creepy. I remember when he entered there were creepy noises I was 11 yrs. old in '85. Also the flagmen dressed in colorful uniforms pointing the way to the next obstacle. I liked this movie and I remember it as a late night classic on HBOCinemax in the 80s. I hope cable brings it back with this release. If not I will purchase it.Call me Snake".

We in the theater swore up and down that Mel Brooks was playing the Khan... He always uttered some nonEnglish interjection that we promptly forgot UPDATE it's yakmalla! replacing with Uff da! when imitating him during and after the film and followed it up with My people!I recommend this in a double feature with Phenomenal and the Mask of Tutankhamen.

It even comes prepowdered so his hands won't slipthey think of everything!A high point of the film is the Khan himself and his pronouncements from the balcony. We in the theater swore up and down that Mel Brooks was playing the Khan... He always uttered some nonEnglish interjection that we promptly forgot UPDATE it's yakmalla! replacing with Uff da! when imitating him during and after the film and followed it up with My people!I recommend this in a double feature with Phenomenal and the Mask of Tutankhamen. Think you need an Abdomenizer? Nopejust watch these two movies.";

Sure if you're a movie critic who has watched every film ever released since 1896 you'll probably think this is puerile rubbish.

This movie wasn't the best made but it was the best thing to show what you can do to combine the best moves to make the ultimate martial artist! Gymnastics champ Kurt Thomas plays Jonathon Cabot a gymnast who is approached by a federal agent to participate in a tournament called The Game. Many other competitors from all around join but only one would win. He put his skills to the test when the princess Tetchie Agbayani get kidnapped. When he arrived with the other competitors there's more sinister things going on. The king's right hand man Zamir Richard Norton  is plotting to overthrow the king with his coup. If it wasn't for Cabot's gymkata skills he would never have made it far. However other than Zamir he had to deal with a treacherous competitor Thorg Bob Schott. He kills one of the other competitors  while Zamir and his army do the rest. This movie could have been made better. The quality was bad but the plot was excellent. Kurt's gymnastic skills are one of a kind. I don't agree with the critics on this movie I seem to enjoy it well enough. 2 out of 5 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "There's much more to this film that meets the eye. Director Robert Clouse with the help of a sharp powerful and precise script did a brilliant job of merging two viewpoints as different as the Eastern philosophy of martial arts with the western culture of achievements and rapid success. Our hero Jonathan Cabot has to deal with the success of being an Olympic superstar as shown in the first moments of the film but deep inside all he longs for is to live the normal family life he's been denied as we can see in the scene where he reflects on his father's photograph. To achieve this end he spares no effort and even for such an accomplished athlete as him it is no easy task despite being helped by experts from the East and West.And then we meet the Princess. Mere words can not convey the feelings of tenderness when these two characters meet. John is vulnerable and looking for someone to love but the princess will show him that we are most vulnerable when we open our hearts. I believe Tetchie Agbayani achieved a pinnacle in the history of acting with her subtle yet powerful portrayal of the modern woman who is afraid to love openly yet longs for romantic fulfillment. However these two characters soon find that they were meant to complement each other. Here is when Clouse's mastery of the film medium shows most other films would have given us a long pointless scene full of sex. But Clouse shows admirable restraint instead showing us the passion these two people share for each other in a way that invites us to contemplate how love can bridge cultural differences. In a sense it is nothing more than the tale of Romeo and Juliet modernized. He must fight to avenge his father and bring hope to his country. She must help him even at the risk of betraying her nation and her father because she knows it will be best. Clouse brings us a sharp critique of the shallowness of modern relationships.Then after some exciting scenes in varied mideastern locals we see how our hero despite his extensive training and mastery of the lethal arts does not reject help from unlikely sources. It is a complete surprise to see his mentor appear and save him and this establishes a bond of trust furthering the moral of the movie. Not before long we are then shown to the beautiful country of Parmistan where Richard Norton does a fine job of portraying a villain with a tender side and Buck Kartalian shines as the benevolent ruler of a small country torn between tradition and modernization. The scenery only serves to further enhance this impression accompanied by exemplary photography.In short this film is an almost perfect portrayal of personal growth and the triumph of love and hope over adversity. Truly a mustsee for aspiring actors directors and screenwriters.".

A lot of long drawn out pauses and pseudoartistic shots with very little character development. The story was decent enough with the war in Beirut as a very dim backdrop at best I was disappointed to not have been drawn into the conflict at all  there were occasional shots of tanks and a few scenes filmed in a basement with the sounds of artillery. Had there been a reasonable amount of character development I might have cared more about what happened in the end. All of the Men in the film seemed to be characterised as selfish and cold and most of the women seemed helpless with the exception of the aunt who was an incredibly unlikable tyrant.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm quite surprised to see so many people writing negative things about this film. I don't know what they were expecting from a film called The Dungeonmaster released by Empire this isn't supposed to be Citizen Kane people but for those who enjoyed the minute in the 80's where Sword  Sorcery films were being dropped into theaters every weekend and disappearing the same weekend this splendid little number provides a nice twist on the formula.Watching it today it does seem a bit clunky and dated but the special effects remain quite impressive considering the technology and budget the filmmakers had to work with. There is a lot of imagination at play here and it's delightful to watch each of the segments unfold. John Buechler's undead makeup in the Demons Of The Dead segment is particularly excellent and his lord of that underworld is a great piece of puppetry. People who watch a film like this and criticize the execution of such a prop are obviously forgetting that even Yoda looked like what he a was a rubber puppet until George Lucas spent millions of dollars digitally enhancing his effects.Though most of the segments fall squarely into the realm of Fantasy the Slasher and Ice pieces are great nods to classic horror subgenres. The brevity of each segment keeps the film moving along at a brisk pace and no matter how engrossed you become in one piece of the film you're assured that there's going to be something interesting around the corner as well.Enough can not be said about the greatness of Richard Moll's performance as Mestema. Moll is a joy to watch and he seems to take great delight in chewing up the scenery and delivering the surprisingly strong dialogue he is fed. His cat speech is a classic and I can't imagine a better character or actor to deliver such a great piece of wickedness. Sparring against him our Paul Bradford makes a fine hero and the verbal interplay between the two of them is well written and executed.One thing I haven't heard mentioned extensively is the music in the film which is uniformly great. It's unlikely that a soundtrack ever circulated but upon rewatching this I found myself plotting my own transfer of the audio to CD. Of course a strong number by W.A.S.P. Tormentor which appears on their selftitled debut LP helps in that regard. But even without it the score alone would make for excellent listening should anyone ever have the foresight to rescue this film and its supplements from obscurity.It seems so petty to overtly criticize a film that never tries to be anything more than an enjoyable way to spend 80 minutes. To that end The Dungeonmaster succeeds magnificently. The 80's was a time when films like this flourished and comparatively this is far more professionally made and creatively executed than the overwhelmingly poor caliber of directtovideo fare we are subjected to these days.DVDs are cheap to produce and release and because of this there are a lot of truly unwatchable films in circulation that deserve to languish in the scarce VHSonly netherworld The Dungeonmaster currently occupies. In fact if I could pick one film to be plucked from the past and given a loving DVD remaster it would probably be this one and its digital absence is one of the only reasons I still have a VCR.Anyone familiar and comfortable with this sort of material will have a hell of a lot of fun watching this film. After all that's ultimately the point of The Dungeonmaster so it shouldn't be graded or scrutinized with the same stringent detail we apply to serious or important cinema. Those looking for thoughtprovoking social discourse breathtaking cinematography or Oscarcaliber performances will hate this film and that's okay because they aren't the demographic for The Dungeonmaster.However for anyone who enjoys the giddy pleasure of a wellconstructed Bmovie The Dungeonmaster is well worth seeking out. If that's you then prepare for battle Excalibrate. Mestema awaits you.".

It's more like a collection of shorts much like an anthology movie. But the main characters remain the same throughout all segments and there is an ongoing story present.If you like your 80's cheese fantastically melted then you're going to have more than a mouthful with THE DUNGEONMASTER. Jeff Byron plays computergeek Paul with a computer called Cal installed in his... glasses no less with a beautiful girlfriend. Absolutely for no reason at all he and the girl suddenly get zapped to another dimension where Mestema reigns. Mestema Richard Moll with evil makeup very appropriately acting the part is some devildemondude who is just bored out of his wits and decides to have some fun by subjecting Paul to seven challenges. This is where the fun begins!THE DUNGEONMASTER simply is an excuse to display as much 80's special effects wizardry and cram as much horrorscififantasy you can in one movie. All segments are utterly pointless. The whole movie is for that matter  I think the point is If Paul loses one of the challenges Mestema gets the girl. Or something. But what matters is THE DUNGEONMASTER is just too much fun. Especially if you still carry the child within as they say and allow yourself to be amazed and entertained by this old school SFX extravaganza.We've got a claymation giant made out of stone. Trolls. Zombies. A little devil puppetdude. A werewolf. Blackie Lawless and his band W.A.S.P. performing. A serial killer. PostApocalyptic mutantbikers. Animated dragons. And much much more... I ask you How can you not have fun with this film? Also go take a look at the full crew involved in the making of this film. We are talking the preFull Moon dream team here Charles Band Richard Band David Allen John Carl Buecher Patrick Manoogian Ted Nicolaou...I admit when people should give this a first time watch in this day and age they'll probably call it a bad movie. But if you grew up on silly nonsense like this there really is no substitute.So yeah I should call this a guilty pleasure but I honestly love this flick. So don't hold my rating against me.".

I think this is one of the better movies Charlie did in the 80 era. The original title was Ragewar  The challenges of Excalibrate. This film had a few problems in post production due to what I think was lack of funds. The editing shows that it was rushed a bit the seven challenges that Excalibrate played by Jeffery Byron has to face in order to save his girlfriend is out of sequence a cording to the start and End credits. In results of this post production mess up some of the transitions to the different challenges seems rushed and the part Cave Beast directed by Peter Manoogian give me the felling that something is missing and got left on the cutting room floor. Then I got my Lightning video Laserdisc edition of Dungeonmaster I was surprised to see that the opening dream sequence was cut from it. I own a UK. Entertainment in Video. VHS tape I purchased about 8 years ago. Here is the relative long Dream sequence included. As shown in the end credits. I remember thinking back then that it was odd for Charlie to include an opening sequence in Cinema Scope. Fans would know this is unusual for him in the old Empire days. However I must say that this opening in Cinema Scope do the film credit and give it a sort of prospective look. Everybody has a favorites part of a movie. Mine in this one is the Heavy Metal sequence. Directed by Mr. Band him self. Here is just such a cool performance by W.A.S.P 1980 Rock Group. All in all This is a highly entertaining film and should be viewed frequently by anybody who has a love for those old scifi  horror films.".

I see in the real world that you can now start buying a commercial available model.Considering the fact that the movie does originate from the 80's when computer based special effects were actually very few and far between. In general the story lacks 'n few elements but from an action perspective the movie did deliver the goods. I through that at the time the concepts was very unique even to this day this movie remains a favorite on my list.The soundtrack was very much classic scifi and you end up with a good feeling of good vs evil at the end of the movie.

I see in the real world that you can now start buying a commercial available model.Considering the fact that the movie does originate from the 80's when computer based special effects were actually very few and far between. In general the story lacks 'n few elements but from an action perspective the movie did deliver the goods. I through that at the time the concepts was very unique even to this day this movie remains a favorite on my list.The soundtrack was very much classic scifi and you end up with a good feeling of good vs evil at the end of the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched this film again after a very long time. The only other time I viewed this film is when it was released as my parents took me to see this one in the theater. Why we went to see this is beyond me but while this film is quite bad it is still rather cool we saw kind of a random film like this in the theater. Back in the day movie theaters did not just do Hollywood blockbusters week after week during off times they would show more obscure films like this. House By the Cemetery is another I had the fortune of seeing in the theater or misfortune. I watched it again and was amazed at how short it was. That is the best thing to be said about the film it was very short. It was done by Charles Band though of Full Moon fame so I guess it should not have been that surprising seeing as how many of his films clock in at under 1 hour and 20 minutes. Heck if you do not sit through the credits here the thing will clock in under and hour and ten minutes! The film is very random as they had multiple directors for reasons unknown as it really is not an anthology and it is not as if the story is vastly different in the 'segments' if you will. Just seems like a film that seemed like a cool idea in someone's head but as they filmed they quickly realized they really did not have all that much material to even make it.The story starts with a dream sequence at least on the DVD I got. I for the life of me do not remember this sequence from years ago. However the lead girl gets fully nude so I am thinking perhaps this was not in the cut I saw back then because that is something I would have remembered. Kind of like how I remembered Trash dancing in the graveyard in Return of the Living Dead. It then switches to a tech geek and establishes his relationship between he and a girl with a throwaway line about him being in an experiment that made him fully integrate with his computer and which seemed to have no real bearing on the story. Then they are both transported to a realm where Bull oh I mean Mestema sends the hero to do different challenges. The hero must clear all seven or Mestema will have he and the girl's souls! The challenges are random and do not really seem like they have any reason to them! The first is in an icy museum where the figures come to life the second a cave where the hero must battle the dead the third a Wasp concert the fourth battling a giant and little people the fifth the hero must stop a serial killer. This one seems so out of place and is the longest so I'm guessing it was needed to be so long to pad the film a little and save some money as it inexplicably took place in the real world. The sixth made no sense as it was the hero throwing rocks at a troll creature and for reasons unknown lasers were shooting and finally a road warrior type area where they use some vehicles that looked left over from the set of Megaforce. Inbetween the challenges the hero would debate Mestema they had to do something to fill the time I guess.So this film is random and it just does not work very well. The challenges just are not set up well as there seems to be absolutely no purpose to any of them except the serial killer one. That is like the only one where any kind of rules are established. The most vague is that one where he is having a rock fight with a troll. Richard Moll is not as good here as he normally is in roles like this and the hero is a complete nobody. Still all this negativity I am throwing at this film and I still have to say it was very quick. Not like it was a painful shot. It felt like a very short film I have watched a few films where the running time is short like this but they still take forever. Not this one I am guessing the randomness of the challenges helps this as at least you are seeing new stuff every few seconds.".

I admit I didn't expect an awesome computer superhero but still how can someone like Dungeons  Dragons but not wish they could 'link up' with a computer in there glasses that can seem to magically control anything electronic? And another reviewer mentions Mythbusters umm which do you think came first and where do you think he got it from?Anyway I really enjoyed myself I thought it'd be a campy 80s wizard movie and it opened with a computer whiz that can control anything using his computer and seems to be always connected to it. I admit the description on IMDb is a bit misleading he's not spending too much time with his computer he's basically one with his computer. I mean if Lois was jealous and told Superman to give up his powers because she was insecure about where he was flying to and what he was doing with his x ray vision would that be fare? The only part I didn't like was the dinner scene where we first meet his girlfriend and hear her complaints but in the end she realizes she has an awesome man and Cal is just a tool.I wish we had learned more about the experiment that lets him 'link up' and what that really involves and why Cal is so powerful and maybe where Mestima really comes from but otherwise I loved all the different sequences the main character and especially Mestima. How can that be over acting he was very convincing and everything I wanted him to be.I'm so glad I found this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "What the hell? Seems to me this movie only ran for an hour! Ah well at least the experience wasn't too painful in that respect. Well I would say that this is a film aimed at kids except for the fact it opens with a scene of a woman stripping naked and being captured by mutants! Nothing is too weird for a film that comes from Charles Band's Empire Pictures a studio renowned for making rubbishy movies before it went bust and was of course replaced by Full Moon instead. Apparently this film is based on the oncepopular Dungeons  Dragons game although you wouldn't realise from watching it.Basically this is a film which exemplifies the '80s the special effects are plentiful but cheesy and tacky the monster suits look rubbery the moronic humour is unwanted and the acting is generally wooden. Most of this takes place in the dark to either a be atmospheric or b to hide the edges of the sets. I would bet on the latter. The film's hero is played by the unremarkable Jeffrey Byron who doesn't convince for a second and his character is even worse. To show how dated this film is he has a talking computer which helps him out via a wristpad ! and special computerised glasses which can withdraw money from a bank machine. It's pretty poor.The action begins almost straight away with Byron being transported over to a firelit netherworld where his girlfriend hangs in chains for the rest of the film. The big bad wizard Richard Moll from SURVIVOR tries really had to be scary but his efforts go in vain instead he just looks ridiculous and rather camp. From then on Byron must battle seven dangers in a bid to rescue the girl. These seven segments are so short that they can't really even be called segments as they have no story  they just show Byron battling various enemies. I find it hard to believe that seven directors were brought in to direct each of these few minute sequences! My favourite segment is the Stone Canyon Giant one in which Byron finds himself up against a huge statue which suddenly comes to life to kill him. Yep it rips off JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS again but here they fight with lasers. Pretty bad but at least the stopmotion animation is cool even if only on screen for a couple of moments. The second segment is entitled Demons of the Dead and as you would guess it's a horrorthemed one. Byron here fights a hideous gargoyle creature pretty good effect from John Carl Buechler who also directed and some disappearing zombies. After a brief interlude with some animated dragons which seem to have come from a Disney film ! there's a plot less heavy metal scene there just for the hell of it directed by Charles Band go figure. After a fight in an Ice Gallery where Byron and his character's girlfriend fight reanimated ice statues of historical killers an idea later echoed in WAXWORK the longest segment arrives in the form of Slasher. I probably liked this one the best as it actually has partlydeveloped characters in it and some okay action. It's still below average though.Another interlude shows a demon head in a flame special effect  cool stuff. Then the film stoops even lower as Byron lobs rocks at a demon in a cave the Cave Beast apparently and things are rounded off with an inevitable MAD MAX 2 ripoff scene involve chasing dune buggies. The only interest of these scene is that cult dwarf actor Felix Silla from BUCK ROGERS IN THE 25TH CENTURY appears in it for a minute. There's not really much else to say about this film only that I wish it had continued in the same vein as the opening.".

Many of its contributors left because they were underpaid and some were even injured while filming their anniversary movies. Anyway I was first interested in this movie because it was apparently one of the lowest rated movies ever reviewed on the website. I think the last time I checked it had a score of 2.2 but now it's 4.1. I'm sad that it still isn't at 2.2. This movie is just plain bad. It tells the story of some evil wizard who traps a guy and his girlfriend in some other dimension where he forces the guy to complete seven challenges. The funny thing is that each challenge actually had a different director work on it. It's amazing that a collaboration this big could make something so bad. The dumbest part is when he has to complete a challenge by fighting Jack the Ripper the Wolf Man and a samurai while using an exploding ice crystal belonging to Albert Einstein. Yes that really happens.It's times like this that make me wish TVTropes still had a page on I Am Not Making This Up. The acting and dialogue are amazingly cheesy and the effects look just plain stupid. Nearly every action scene in this film is idiotic and makes no sense. There's even completely random scenes that serve no purpose at all like him firing a laser at the negative of a demon or making dragons fight. It's so repetitive as he just uses a laser to beat every enemy. This film is an utter waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. ".

It in fact doesn't seem to have a coherent plot at all and just leaps from sketch to sketch showing off the amazing skills of the stop motion animators involved or more often to show off the boom mike which keeps dropping into view. It's got 2 stars rather than one purely because some humour can be gleaned from the ridiculously over the top performance of the man playing Satan Brian Blessed looks calm and composed in comparison and the repeated inclusion of that boom mike.".

This film had some merits to it one of which being one of the easiest movies that I have ever given the MST3Ktreatment. Its extremely funny. The villain is an odd hooded individual named Mestema. I kept saying Coolfrom Nesteama! during his scenes. There was a rather gruesome scene when he was alone in a darkened room and appeared to be doing something..uhh...well I'd rather not say. The hero a computer nerd who jogs in pink boxer shorts and changes Don't Walk signs and makes illegal bank transactions with his wrist computer is apparantly having some sort of sexual relationship with his computer. They dont show it thank God but its implied somewhere along the line in the beginning of the movie...Anyway he's transported to a computer dimension to fight the villain why I don't know. Along the way he meets bearded midgets hobbits? killer wax dummies bad fraggle rockstyle monster puppets zombies that bear a striking resemblence to Marty McFly and Doc Brown from Back to The Future and some stupid Star Wars robot rejects.He is an incompetant whiny idiot in other words.

I went with my mother wife and son and we all enjoyed it very much.My 20yearold son who was not accustomed to this type of dark humour was quite startled at how murder was portrayed in an offhand humorous way. I felt it was a revival of a genre going back to the Wrong Box 1966 and before. This film does not dwell on the violence the gore the sentiment or the psychological aspects of murder. It seems to be standard fare for most films but it didn't seem appropriate here.As much I respect Rowan Atkinson as a comedian I was concerned that this film would be in the Mr Bean or Black Adder vein. In fact I was pleasantly surprised to find that Rowan Atkinson is a very good actor. Most of the time he played his role as an absentminded vicar in an understated and sometimes quite touching way. Mr Bean fans will have their moments. There's also lots of innuendo combined with more subtle humour.Maggie Smith is as ever excellent. The rest of the cast play their archetypal characters or in the case of Patrick Swayze's caricature well.Though I was able to predict the overall plot the story is entertaining and there is a gentle message about marital problems the generation gap and hypocrisy. The scenery mainly in the Isle of Man and partly in Cornwall is stunning.I recommend it highly.".

	schema:reviewBody "Niall Johnson's 'Keeping Mom' is a delightful black comedy. Russo and Johnson's innovative screenplay the pleasant score and the surprising cast and the dark humour is brilliantly put together. At the same time the characters are very identifiable. After all Grace is just a mother who's protecting her children Gloria just wants her husband's affection Walter just wants to excel in his 'profession' and Lance is a sleaze you might have met once. Yet the story cleverly takes them to extreme ends that results in murder infidelity and voyeurism. Pretty much all the actors are cast in roles you have never seen them play before. Kristin Scott Thomas is the heart of the film as the director himself stated and she performs very naturally. While Atkinson has played Reverend earlier he actually delivers a very subtle performance where he downplays the comedy unlike his regular inyourface comedy sketches. He is proving to be a versatile comedian. I loved how Patrick Swayze makes fun of his iconic status in an indirect way. The actor is excellent as the jerk and it has been ages since he has been in something worthwhile. Liz Smith is fun to watch as the annoying and nosy flower committee member. Emilia Fox is very good as the nonchalant killer and Maggie Smith is hilarious! This lady has never let down and she is a complete delight to watch as she goes on 'protecting' her family. 'Love the actress! The location shots are amazing. The fictitious town looks lovely yet the director manages to successfully bring out the coldness and boredom. The stunning cinematography deserves mention too. 'Keeping Mom' is a small but wonderfully innovative film that had me laughing all the way.".

I thoroughly enjoyed myself! I was especially impressed by the performance of Rowan Atkinson who plays a more downtoearth character than I'm used to seeing him play and I think it suits him very well. He doesn't reduce the good reverend to a clown but makes him sweet realistic and lovable. Kudos also to Kristen Scott Thomas who gives Gloria a heart and the ever so amazing Dame Maggie Smith who gives Rosie a soul. Bottom line I recommend it wholeheartedly!".

I was first introduced to Rowan Atkinson in the 70's and have only seen him in silly caricature  a caricature of himself type roles and I love him in these roles. But he did an amazing job as a serious thoughtful bordering on glum Vicar and was absolutely believable as his journey and his attitude changed ... I would never have put him in such a role but he really pulled it off. I was also surprised pleasantly at the intense spiritual undertones okay at times overtones woven throughout this most enjoyable film. It was interesting to see a movie use religion as a backdrop for such a deep look into what in my humble opinion is clearly a nonreligious aspect of human spirituality.".

It tickles the funny bone and there is double entendre galore so it keeps you on your toes all the time. Ah that British sense of humour which I so miss....I honestly believe that the top billing of the film should go to Maggie Smith and not to Rowan Atkinson. Dame Maggie as usual stole the scenes whenever she appeared. Whether dishing out advice on sex to Father Walter Goodfellow a pun p'haps? or helping young Goodfellow at school Dame Maggie just enthralls us with her screen presence with enunciation of every syllable. As Sister Mary Clarence Whoopi Goldberg said of her in Sister Act What an indomitable woman. Rowan Atkinson was in all honesty excellent. I was so used to his Mr. Bean persona that I forgot how his voice sounded like. His characterisation of the parish priest of Little Wallop was just wonderful. There were a few romps in the film but the one scene that took my breath away with its sheer simplicity and romance was when he kisses his wife gently on her shoulder making her realise that he had come back to her after all.I think that all the actors even Mrs. Nosey Parker a rather doddering busybody were excellent.Two thumbs up.".

A friendly very exportworthy British comedy Keeping Mum is a throwback to guilt free sinister joys that were in much greater fashion before everyone decided to let their films guide their morality. Nothing has recently personified this old fashioned fun spirited creepiness as affectionately as Maggie Smith's vibrant performance for her semicuckoo housemaid with a few secrets of her own. With a delightful perceptive supporting cast the plot may not exactly pull you in especially the first half but will nonetheless keep pleasant spirits anchored as the real fun takes hold. Rowan Atkinson in particular portraying a character not unlike his famous bumbling priest in Four Weddings and a Funeral gets to exercise more of his subtle comedic chops then usually seen and the ensuing awkwardness that radiates whenever he is on screen is sweet and endearing. Despite the obvious tone of an utmost fictionalization I suppose Keeping Mum will still take a few hits for it's portrayal of religion and murder but anyone seriously trying to analyze the lack of morality on this one will have missed the whole carefree point. The characters might have been completely unbelievable by the time this thing is over but the nature of this kind of entertainment does not beckon one to take offense to that.".

	schema:headline " One of the best British movies! Ingenious!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Keeping Mum is a delightful new British movie full of black humor that was recently seen in movie theatres all across Europe. It is a mixture of comedy thriller and a family movie and caters for all tastes. The movie begins with a beautiful young pregnant woman who is caught on the train blood dripping from her leather trunk. It turns out that squashed inside are the woman's unfaithful husband and his lover both of whom she has killed. After this horrible discovery we see the young woman being brought to prison. 43 years later WalterGoodfellow played by Rowan Atkinson is reverend of the small idyllic town Little Wallop with a total population of 57. A goodnatured person he always helps and cares for the needs of his parish and always says yes to annoying elderly ladies such as Mrs. Parker who are more in need of attention than in need of help. The only person he says no to is actually his wife Gloria Kristin Scott Thomas when she tries to seduce him. The fact is Walter is so busy writing the perfect sermon that he not only neglects his wife but is also fully unaware of the life of his children. His daughter Holly played by gorgeous starlet Tamsin Egerton leads an adventurous sex life which his wife can only dream of right under his nose and changes her boyfriends so quickly that the family can hardly keep up with their names. His son Petey on the other hand leads a rather upsetting life being the favorite target of a cruel lot of school boys. Finally adding to all these problems Gloria longing for a man's attention begins an affair with her golf teacher Lance Dirty Dancingstar Patrick Swayze a selfloving philanderer who also has an eye on her daughter. Last but not least the Goodfellows lose their sleep and last nerves because of their neighbors' barking dog.Clearly the atmosphere at their home is not the best and therefore the Goodfellows decide to get the help of a housekeeper. And with Grace Hawkins Grand Dame Maggie Smith they seem to have made the right choice  for one after another their problems begin to disappear. Literally. Suddenly the barking dog is gone and shortly after the dog's owner leaves for down under and it is not Australia... Just days after Grace's arrival the life of the Goodfellows becomes happier because she encourages Walter not only to brush up his sermon with jokes What is the difference between a prayer at church and at a casino? At a casino you really mean it but also his sex life. Petey's torturers turn into victims themselves and leave him alone. Gloria's affair with Lance doesn't fit into Grace's familyoriented view of the world so he too vanishes from view... Keeping Mum is full of witty dialogs and unexpected turning points with lots of funny moments. Although the audience knows who Grace is from the beginning the story still bears many surprises. The movie works so well mainly because of discrepant awareness the advantage the audience has over the characters. Reverend Goodfellow for example is left in the dark until the end about the true identity of Grace. The hilarious thing is that he believes that the name of their housekeeper and their sudden happiness upon her arrival is a sign from God. A couple of his neighbors may see that differently... Nevertheless the humor never gets too dark and the murders are all comprehensible and the murderer lovable. One incredibly funny and at the same time thrilling moment is when after finding out about Grace's past Gloria and Holly inspect the big trunk in Grace's room. Gloria begins to worry about Lance's whereabouts and calls him. In an instant his cell phone rings right next to them in the trunk. Horror struck they hide under the bed. Grace comes into the room takes the phone sits on the same bed and redials the number. When Gloria's phone rings right there under the bed! she with no other options left answers it and Grace asks in her sweetest voice Would you like to come up from under the bed? This movie outstands not only by its genius screenplay by Richard Russo the Pulitzer Price winner for fiction in 2002 and Niall Johnson but also the cast could not have been chosen better. The story focuses on a small group of people and the few actors have been very well casted. Full credits have to be given to the absolutely incomparable twotime Oscar winner Maggie Smith she seems to be the jewel component of every good British movie and the diamond of this one. Rowan Atkinson makes a brilliant appearance as the Reverend although it is unusual to see him play a rather normal role and leave the funnier parts to Maggie Smith and Kristin Scott Thomas. It is a pleasant surprise for the audience that still associates Atkinson mostly with his role of Mr. Bean or the flopped Johny English. His desperate and neglected wife Gloria was perfectly portrayed by Kristin Scott Thomas. Not to forget is the appearance of Patrick Swayze as an enticing American playboy. Those who loved him in Dirty Dancing will rather shudder than heave a sigh this time when they see him wearing a tanga. A big joker was also to cast the smaller parts with unknown but remarkable actors. The recently voted hottest British actress Keira Knightley should be on guard because here comes the beautiful and talented Tamsin Egerton. Egerton with her fresh stunning looks is one of the new British faces to remember and makes a wonderful appearance as the nymphomaniac teenager Holly. Keeping Mom is one of those movies that leave the audience with a smile on their faces and in a good mood. What more can we ask for?".

	onyx:emotionText "Keeping Mum is a delightful new British movie full of black humor that was recently seen in movie theatres all across Europe. It is a mixture of comedy thriller and a family movie and caters for all tastes. The movie begins with a beautiful young pregnant woman who is caught on the train blood dripping from her leather trunk. It turns out that squashed inside are the woman's unfaithful husband and his lover both of whom she has killed. After this horrible discovery we see the young woman being brought to prison. 43 years later WalterGoodfellow played by Rowan Atkinson is reverend of the small idyllic town Little Wallop with a total population of 57. A goodnatured person he always helps and cares for the needs of his parish and always says yes to annoying elderly ladies such as Mrs. Parker who are more in need of attention than in need of help. The only person he says no to is actually his wife Gloria Kristin Scott Thomas when she tries to seduce him. The fact is Walter is so busy writing the perfect sermon that he not only neglects his wife but is also fully unaware of the life of his children. His daughter Holly played by gorgeous starlet Tamsin Egerton leads an adventurous sex life which his wife can only dream of right under his nose and changes her boyfriends so quickly that the family can hardly keep up with their names. His son Petey on the other hand leads a rather upsetting life being the favorite target of a cruel lot of school boys.

Being on the nontheatrical circuit it's always a slow process obtaining films released by Entertainment Films. However I had a feeling this British comedy would appeal to our mature audience including myself!. I was right a very popular choice...and it was worth the wait. To be honest anything featuring Maggie Smith or Judi Dench can't fail at the Century and as expected Maggie steals the show as usual in this picture with a very restrained but humorous portrayal of the mysterious new housekeeper to pastor Rowan Atkinson and his errant family. Atkinson also does well underplaying nicely in his role but typically funny in the village soccer match. Also a very emotional scene when he delivers his speech at the conference. I certainly won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen this very dark comedy but I will say don't miss the very start of the film as this is obviously of great importance to what follows. Another Brit success!".

The plot is clever but what really makes this movie shine is it's cast. Rowan Atkinson as the stuffy but sweet and oblivious Vicar was a joy nobody could play the sleazy golf instructor so well as Patrick Swayze doesI'm still trying to forget him in that red...well let's not go thereand Maggie Smith is absolutely brilliant. Ditching the strict Professor McGongall from the Harry Potter films for a moment she is absolutely adorable whenever she is on screen. Even when she is discussing her multiple acts of homicide I still want to give her a hug. Of course there is the deeper message of not looking a gift horse in the mouth and counting rather than questioning your blessings but anyone who has the twisted sense of humor that I do will just love the lighthearted approach this film takes to murder.

Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is the lighting.  This movie beautifully employs many different colors shades and intensities of light which set the mood and lend a unique feeling to the film itself something different than the 'normal' movie lighting we are generally subjected to.  Vin Diesel brings his character to life in an excellent manner skillfully avoiding the routine portrayal of the hardened criminal.  After all the film is about Riddick's Diesel's character personal journey so thankfully Vin doesn't drop the ball.  The remainder of the cast with the exception of the talented and gorgeous Claudia Black were unknown to me but all turned in marvelous performances animating the diverse characters with unique quirks and mannerisms.  Pitch Black is a perfect example of making a great film with out the resources of an excessive budget.  The special effects are more than adequate but at the same time they are by no means the sole focus as in many high budget 'blockbusters'.  It's a great movie because it uses Science Fiction as a medium to tell an engaging provoking story rather then telling a mediocre story to use the flash of Science Fiction.".

Rarely do actors fit to their roles this well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelness and sense of responsibility for Johns.

If anything she very much reminds me of Andrea Osvart see her as the Hungarian assassin Gilda in the film Two Tigers.Now if these two ladies ever appeared together in a film I would drop everything and go check that out in a heartbeat . . . but I digress.In any case I have no trouble with granting 8 stars to Pitch Black.".

Pilot Fry after a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere when she almost jettisoned the passengers takes charge of the group and enlists the help of convicted murderer Riddick to lead them through the darkness to the escape ship  he's the one with surgically enhanced eyes that can see in the dark.   But it's really not that simple  every character is complex threedimensional with conflicting traits so you never quite know who's good and who's bad.The performances are uniformly superb  Radha Mitchell shows Fry steeling herself for leadership overcoming her own fears and trying to prevent further bloodshed while Cole Hauser as the man taking Riddick back to custody shows he has his own agenda and his own idiosyncratic standards. But the film belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick  he has the most magnetic screen presence I've seen in years.   For much of the film his face is in shadow and he doesn't actually say a great deal but he draws your attention all the same.  Sometimes he draws your attention by not speaking  or by not moving.  And Diesel doesn't trivialise the character as could so easily be done by giving him a heart of gold  Riddick is still one mean and vicious man as they approach the ship  he just lets us glimpse those first tentative steps from caring only for the self to caring for others.Technically the film is very good.  The lighting effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum  the overbright triple sunlight and the pitch darkness.   Special effects showing both Riddick's and the monsters' points of view add to the suspense as do sound effects of the monsters flying and using ultrasound to see the monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and suitably frightening.  Editing is so tight it's almost jarring at times  there is literally no padding in this film no fades no time to reorient yourself.From the opening shot to the end of the credits you have to keep your wits about you.   Every scene every line of dialogue every single camera shot is important.   See it three times to understand it all.My only caveat is about the science  the solar system as shown in the model is impossible planets revolve around suns not vice versa.   However that doesn't affect the human story so I haven't taken points off for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me waste a moment of your time to explain how I approached this film. 1st I dismissed the trailers out of hand because the film appeared to be an uncredited remake of Aliens which I consider to be one of the weakest films in the Alien series. Stupidly continuing to dismiss the film after I heard positive things about it from people whose opinions I trust I missed the theatrical run completely. I then became hooked on Farscape in its 3rd or 4th season at the time and found Pitch Black on cable one night around bed time  so I said oh why not at least it has Claudia Black in it. Soon I recognized Keith David and began to realize that Vin Diesel Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act why this should surprise me I do not know. I was captivated. I have now remained captivated for four years. I just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time and I still love it.This is not an art film not an independent and its not entirely original but where it fails to break a lot of new ground it utterly succeeds in providing interesting realistic characters harddriving action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot and nonstop entertainment an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects. Sound to good to be true? Don't take my word for it... see it for yourself.The film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel introducing the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would go on to star in the somewhat Riddickulous Chronicles thereof which I also enjoyed though recognizing its rather huge flaws and is now something of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic so big and so interesting to watch that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor but a smart one too. Checking out the DVD version of Pitch Black with the audio comments on might just blow you away.The film is about the crew of an intersystem transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crashlanding in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic Mitchell but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities  a bounty hunter with secrets Hauser and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark Diesel. Is that all? Of course not  the planet is inhabited and the inhabitants are hungry.As unoriginal and improbable as some of this may be Pitch Black is beautifully filmed well told and very nicely performed. Don't expect to learn anything and don't expect to have to think a whole lot but do expect to have fun with this modern scifi action classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must say that I didn't expect much sitting down to watch Pitch Black but I got a lot back in terms of excitement and pure fun. It's the type of flick where you can just lean back relax and have a great time just being entertained. This isn't a deep film by any means. Everything that it offers is either recycled or ripped off of other movies such as Alien Predator or such. But when I watch a ripoff I want it to be good and this ripoff is great. It opens with a galaxy of stars. Some of the greatest films of all time open with this type of scene  2001 Star Wars Alien Predator. A ship is cruising through space when inside the entire cryogenically frozen crew is awoken. The ship has been hit by something. They crash land on a nasty little planet with three suns. Everyone flocks out of the ship when they find that their prisoner transport Richard Riddick Vin Diesel has escaped confinement. They scan the desert planet in search of him and eventually find him but they have no way of getting their ship to fly again. They search the planet for water and civilization but it seems that everyone suddenly disappeared from the planet not too long ago.Then they find out that every 22 years the planets line up in a solar eclipse and the entire planet turns pitch black. There also happen to be hoards of aliens that thrive in darkness living on the planet  what are the chances? They happen to be on the planet right as the eclipse happens  what are the chances? And Riddick has a rare talent  he can see in the dark  again what are the chances?There seems to be a lot of coincedence in this movie but a film like this isn't out to get Oscars for originality or believability. It's there to entertain the audience  it does so with ease. Vin Diesel is a big gorilla of a man with no acting talent whatsoever. But I've got to say if there's anyone who can fit the part of a trashy homicidal felon it is Diesel. Listen to him mutter He did not know who he was fuing with. Great stuff.The aliens in this movie are a mix between hammerhead sharks those from Alien and Predators. They've got long horizontal heads like a hammerhead the quickmoving agility of the aliens and the stealth of a Predator. I assume David Twohy director and writer of the movie didn't expect audiences to believe his creatures were truly something never seen before. At least I hope not.Aliens Redux might be a better name for this movie but then again it is better than both the second and third Alien films put together. In a time when apparently ended series are getting revived  Terminator 3 Alien 5 Predator 3 Alien vs. Predator  Pitch Black stands out as a new series altogether. Two more sequels are planned. Let's just hope they don't get carried away. I can just picture it twentyfive years from now Aliens vs. Predator vs. Pitch Black Aliens The Fight of the Year.Fight of the Year title may be shared with the upcoming film Freddy vs. Jason vs. Michael vs. Leatherface vs. Norman Bates vs. Alien vs. Predator vs. Terminator vs. James Cameron vs. Barny the Dinosaur.45.".

The actors are amazing Radah Mitchell High Art Love and other.. as Fry is truly a joy to watch on screen while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so captivating that you are dying just to hear him speak again.The look of the movie is breath taking the contrast of blues yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is amazing.

	schema:reviewBody "Pitch Black was a complete shock to me when I first saw it back in 2000. In the previous years I was repeatedly disappointed by all the lame scifi movies Ex STARSHIP TROOPERS and thought that this movie wouldn't be any different. But to plainly put it This movie freaked me out... in a good way. I wasn't aware that I was still afraid of the dark till I watched this movie I must have buried my fear in the back of my subconscious when I was a kid and it rightfully deserves to stay there.The alien creatures sent shivers up my spine the individuals who designed them have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to come up with something so impressive and grotesque. I loved how the writers gave each main character a history and showed their flaws and strengths without much confusion.Riddick's Vin Diesel gift for escaping out of any impossible situation and putting up a hell of a fight was jaw dropping. At first you figure him out to be a coldly intelligent villain but in some brief moments you can see something humane behind his animal side. But as soon you discover it he does something maliciously devious. He certainly keeps you guessing right up to the very end. I didn't know whether to despise or admire him... he's definitely a lovehate type of character.Johns Cole Hauser was a perfect example of a character that puts up a good front but through a need for greed shows his real intentions and what he's willing to do to survive. John's knack for knowing what buttons to push and the right words to say makes him as devious as Riddick.Fry Radha Mitchell is a character who as Johns so nicely expressed looked to her thine own ass first before considering the consequences. But what's endearing about her is that she quickly realizes the errors of her ways and tries desperately to pay penance even while endangering her life when others discarded all human values and went for the dark hills running.Jack Rhiana Griffith simply wanted to have a hero and was the first one out of the whole group to look for that hero in Riddick through a child's eye good can be seen through the thick clouds of evil. I thought it was absolutely priceless when Jack shaves his head in ode to Riddick you know what they say Imitation is the best form of flattery.Imam Keith David like Jack has the ability to see good in any evil. He uses philosophy to carry him through the hardships that he meets and when time permits he rationally grieves his losses and then soldiers on. In a way he served as a morale booster for the survivors even though most of the characters acted as though they weren't listening.The casting for this movie was positively perfect. Each actor shined brightly in their role and their talents blended wonderfully onscreen.This movie may have had a small budget but the director's leadership and the actor's performances made the movie work and allowed the audience to use their imagination instead of letting some outrageously expensive Special Effects do all the work for them. This movie is a definite SciFi classic. Watch it and judge with an open mind for yourself. It will be well worth it.".

The direction is taut.Quibbles. Soundtrack is very derivative in spots. To keep the George Lucas comparison going it's partly dumbed down John Williams.

Vin Diesel's character Riddick's unusual skillset is not explained enough for my satisfaction.But heck none of this was enough for my willing suspension of disbelief to get more than a few spare cables cut. If you don't normally watch SF movies this is definitely one to consider and if you like SF horror this is a must see  in fact true horror buffs might find it tame.I am variable in how squeamish I am.

The story is engaging with good special effects. But the most amazing is the direction and the perfect casting of unknown actors and actresses. Pitch Black brought the attention of the audiences to Vin Diesel in his first success Radha Mitchell from Everything Put Together of the same year is perfect in the role of Carolyn Fry and the always efficient Cole Hauser and Keith David have also great performances. The noncommercial conclusion is also a plus of Pitch Black. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Eclipse Mortal Mortal Eclipse".

The CGI is great  mostly seamless Diesel is a real sexy antihero and the dialogue really keeps things moving. Vin Diesel is a rare one that can pull off the stunts of an action sci fi thriller and not come across as a large block of wood with a toothy smile. I went after this movie when it came out following the career of Claudia Black from Farscape and found a new favorite in Diesel  but still waiting to see Black in a more substantial role. Now all that being said no film is without flaws and if you have watched enough sci fi or horror then the 'plot twist' at the end was lined up for us from the beginning but I for one didn't care in that I fell hook line and sinker for Riddick and wanted to find out what he would and wouldn't do and it was such a delicious way to get there. I'm greatly looking forward to Chronicles of Riddick and if you have the where with all to follow a character and not just a blockbuster then go check out Dark Fury too. It is a great segway and though brief is a good character study.".

Then things go downhill again as you realize that the survivors are all a bad actors apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath and b almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monsterfodder. Hell half of them don't even speak English preventing the audience from getting to know the characters at all. You feel as if you were watching Deep Blue Sea meets Silence of the Lambs minus the good bits. And unfortunately the entire thing tries to hard to be Crashed on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter during the daylight scenes. Vin Diesel is a great actor  but he is no Anthony Hopkins and he frankly annoys as the smart hypercool psycho. There is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor  but apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes or so...But then things take a turn. I can't exactly pinpoint the moment but soon the movie gets a lot better. It also feels less chopped  the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a showstealer. By the time the first monsters appear the film is actually quite enjoyable. By the time night falls it is great. Thrilling horrifying and exciting. And even the character development of most main characters is welldone. If you can just sit through the poor bits at the start you're in for some GREAT entertainment. Besides the visuals are eyecandy and I honestly admit I love the colour and the tone of this movie. 710 could have been 910 if only....".

Freak meteor storm cause a a commercial transport airship to make landing on an unknown planet . Then the spaceship and its survivors are marooned on a planet with three suns and apparently no life and where mysterious events spread across the land . The greatest danger facing our crew has been the planet's best kept secret...until now . Later on  the crew to be aware the planet is full of bloodthirsty creatures that only come out to feast at night . But then  they learn that a monthlong eclipse is about to occur .Creepy and gory SciFi with thrills  chills  suspense and some familiar elements . This is a pretty good as well as scary movie with violent events  intriguing incidents  starked outdoors  and chilling scenes . This is a peculiar rendition of The only come out at night in which some passengers  pilots  bounty hunters and prisoner discover that very nasty hunting creatures attack after dark and the planet is in for a total eclipse . Interesting screenplay from Jim Wheat  Ken Wheat and David Twohy . The film developed from David Twohy's unused idea for Alien 1992  involving a space prison . The fantastic alien creatures are perfectly designed by Patrick Tatopoulos they have three phases of evolution 1 embryonic  little harmless Bioluminescent beings 2 youngish  which fly in flock to hunt and finally 3 adult  big gray creatures who are able to kill other members of the species to eat . Vin Diesel gives a hardass acting  as usual  as a convicted killer who has nothing to lose . Nice support cast such as Radha Mitchell  Cole Hauser  Claudia Black  Lewis Fitzgerald  Simon Burke  John Moore and Keith David . Thrilling and stirring musical score by Graeme Revell . Colorful cinematography by David Eggby who shows splendidly the desert landscapes from Queensland  Australia . In fact  the hot desert where they filmed was actually about 50F they were misting water on the actors to make it appear as if they were sweating . As desert scenes filmed in the same location used for Mad Max  beyond Thunderdome 1985 .The motion picture was well written and directed by David Twohy  it had a 60 days shooting schedule. David is an expert writer and director of splendid SciFi movies . As his first picture was the acceptable Timescape . He also wrote Warlock Waterworld  a script for Alien 3 in 1988 but it was rejected . Back in May of 2000  Fox Studios once inquired for his availability to write and direct AVP Alien vs. Predator  but turned down the offer due to scheduling conflicts . David subsequently directed Below the successful Pich Black and its sequel  The chronicles of Riddick 2004 in which the wanted criminal Riddick arrives on a planet called Helion Prime and finds himself up against an invading empire called the Necromongers an army that plans to convert or kill all humans in the universe  it stars  Colm Feore  Thandie Newton  Judi Dench  Alexa Davalos  Karl Urban  Linus Roache and again Keith David .

Most of them are pretty bad and Pitch Black which is utterly unoriginal could easily have been too. Instead it's a cool characterdriven yet actionpacked dark thriller. An interplanetary space transport crashes on a desert planet with 3 suns and apparently perpetual daylight. Like Alien the film begins by exploring the handful of survivors. Like Lifeboat it gradually divulges that some of them have things to hide. Not Riddick Diesel an escaped murderer being returned to prison by bounty hunter Johns Hauser effectively icy  sleazy. When perpetual day suddenly turns to perpetual night the creepycrawlies come out to kill rend  chow down on Fresh Human. To survive the others must accept Riddick who is tougher than all of them and has had a prison shine job on his eyes that lets him see in the dark. But Riddick must also overcome the hatred he has for all of his own kind a rage that he covers under a cool wry facade of independence. Will Riddick eventually sacrifice the others to ensure his own survival or maybe even just for one universal upyours to the human race? Diesel has a starmaking role making a repugnant character sympathetic giving us fleeting glimpses of Riddick's sadness  loneliness while never ever detracting from his granitesouled strength. Several other actors have more work to do in this film than most action flicks but they are all up to the task. The guiltridden pilot Fry Mitchell a dark refreshing break from the buttkicking babe stereotype begun with Charlie's Angels holds the others together while Riddick comes  goes. Mitchell has a steeliness  style that belies her blonde cuteness and holds up well opposite both the brawny inyourface Diesel  the taut cool Hauser. David as a Muslim space pilgrim brings religious faith Because you do not believe in God does not mean God does not believe in you to counter the others' anger despair or wry selfishness Look to thine own ass first. The dark percussionheavy score is perfect for Pitch Black's visual effects which are somewhat less spectacular than recent Star Wars but more effective a background rather than a replacement for the action. Pitch Black is as entertaining as any old Saturday matine much better suited to our knowitall times without the condescension  stereotyping to which Hollywood is usually so devoted.".

It shows us one of the truest glances into the depths of human nature we've ever been given in popular culture when people are pushed to their limits there's nothing that won't do to survive but they will only survive if they work together. Though the plot is a little lacking and a bit cheesy at times the filmography is wonderful. The cameras are used in much the same way as a master artist uses their brush  as a means to make the viewer see what was going on in their head. Pitch Black's camera styles range from jerky blurred action shots  often shooting back and forth between the eyes of two people  to sharplycontrasted colortoned shots of the harsh desert climate. The movie is quite simply put beautiful. I give Pitch Black a solid ten out of ten. Not only is it one of my personal favorites but it's an excellent film as well.".

Of course the survivors are not alone and are soon in a battle for their lives against strange batlike aliens.What works here is the writing and character development. Vin Diesel is surprisingly good as the clever and philosophical Riddick. He's a dangerous convict turned reluctant savior. The supporting cast does a great job of bringing dimension to characters that could easily have been overly simplistic. What drives the movie is the constant uncertainty about the main characters' true motivations. Riddick is particularly hard to figure out and in the end it's hard to say he's really a good guy. His character is far more complex than that.The special effects are strictly mediocre but the director seemed to understand this. So the creatures are mostly kept in shadows helping to avoid those That looks so fake! moments. The actual design of the batlike creatures is clearly inspired by Giger's design for the movie Alien. They certainly could have been more original but they get the job done. At least the special effects people decided to ripoff an alltime classic movie monster design.The story moves along at a good pace never feeling too rushed or too slow and keeps the viewer on edge. It's usually pretty obvious who the survivors will be in this type of movie where characters are being picked off one by one but this one surprised me a little at the end. Overall this is a good effort and far better than a lot of big budget scifi action movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "A nice twist on the Alien formula with a surprisingly good script and a great performance by Vin Diesel. Riddick is one of the most likable antiheroes in recent memory and in this film he's given equal doses of hero and villain. The exposition is nearly perfect introducing all the characters very well and setting up the story adequately. It moves a little too fast after that though bypassing a lot of the story in favour of quick kills. Still the visuals are solid and the direction is quite innovative  I liked the high contrast showing how bright it was on the planet. Diesel carries the movie but Radha Mitchell is pretty solid opposite him. Some pretty nice gore scenes too. Just a pretty good creature feature.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel Radha Mitchell Cole Hauser Keith David Lewis FitzGerald Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby. The year 2000 was awash with scifi movies not all were stellar of course but siting at the top end of the scale was this Twohy's super slice of actionhorrorscifi cake. Right from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship Hunter Gratzner which as it happens is plummeting through space. The ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer Caroline Fly Mitchell after coming out of hyper sleep manages to crash land on a nearby planet. Only a handful of passengers survive the crash including infamous convict Richard B. Riddick Diesel but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party a deadly alien species a species that can only operate in the dark. Pity then that an eclipse is due... Okies so lets get the obvious out in the open right away Pitch Black is a variant of Alien one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of Ridley Scott's game changer. Yet this is still a fresh movie a lesson in low budget film making with grace style blood brains and balls  the execution grade A from those involved. It's maybe surprising given the synopsis to find that it's a very character driven piece with Twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed  and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. One of the universe's baddest criminals a spunky lady officer having to take command a morphine addicted bounty hunter an Islamic priest and his young companions a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. It's the not so wild bunch but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts. The narrative strength comes via Diesel's hulking convict he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! The group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival but can he be trusted? What is his ultimate ulterior motive? Riddick is the pe to Fry's foil it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. These crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights that Mitchell sexyvulnerablehardsmart and Diesel moodybeefygravellymenacing are bang on form helps no end. As does the work of the tech department. The setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of scifi films that of an unbelievable world. Twohy Eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns of a scorched barren landscape with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum scifi impact. While the effects work belies the budget check out the preeclipse sequence. What of the creatures themselves? They are legion a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats they smell blood and move at high speeds and like Riddick they have special vision in the dark it's the light that they are afraid of thus this gives our survivors a glimmer ahem of hope in how to stave them off... The science and logic is hokey but so what? This is a classy and taut scifi film brought about by a very under valued director one that puts many a bigger budgeted Hollywood production to shame. Come the finale where there's still time to have your draw dropped you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 910".

However there are very many exciting stories of the Hungarian history unfortunately there are very few movies about them. This one commemorates the heroic freedom fighters of Budapest. The Hungarian title Szabadsg szerelem in English Freedom and love is a historical reference to a poem of Petfi Sndor the famous poet and revolutionist of the Hungarian revolution and war of independence of 1848. You must see this movie to understand peoples of Central and EasternEurope and their history. They are all victims of the worst and perhaps the cruelest dictatorship ever in the world. I love this movie. And after that I must say I'm proud to be a Hungarian.".

This was truly a great moment of the 20th century worldwide history and maybe the greatest moment in the whole history of our nation. But remember the revolution of 1956 is not a movie. This movie intends to display this glorious event fit to Hollywood images but trust me it deserves more than that. Maybe you catch this movie than next week you forget it.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about the uprising of the citizens in Budapest against the Russians in 1956 and the subsequent symbolic water polo match in the 1956 Olympics.This movie is powerful and words can hardly describe it. From the beginning the tension between Hungary and USSR is already very visible in the film. Patriotism build up quickly leading to the uprising of the Hungarians. The initial optimism is portrayed in an effective manner and the viewers certainly connect wit the characters with their sense of pride and achievement. Though the romance between the leading characters seem to have a weak foundation the subsequent portrayal is strong. They are willing to risk their own life to protect another.The plot is told in a precise and direct manner. The shooting scenes are highly graphic possibly to remind the world what terror they have gone through. The persistence of Viki is remarkable. Her efforts in resisting the Russians is brilliantly portrayed and viewers get to connect with the uprising through her. On one hand the promise of a free Hungary drives them forward but on the other hand the well equipped USSR army showers them with bullets and grenades that obliterates all hope for a brighter future.The final water polo match has such a symbolic meaning. Even though the Hungarians are losing the war they can beat the enemy in other ways. Hope and glory are invested in the water polo team. Through tight editing the match is so powerful and breathtaking that my heart pumped with every one of their moves.I particularly find the ending very well done. With the same national anthem we see the transition from despair in prison to glory in the sports hall. It is such an emotional scene so intense and so moving.I completely lost count on how many explosions this film has. In fact I think it must be the film with the most explosion scenes I have ever seen. The budget for this film must have been astronomical.From my Hungarian friend the movie is historically accurate. Is it right to die for a glorious cause? As this film points out at one juncture He didn't die for the country. He died because he was killed by a machine gun. This film is thought provoking. Are freedom fighters pursuing an impossible dream? Have they given up their lives for nothing? This is an exceptionally powerful film. It is compelling touching and the most importantly crystallises the spirit of the humankind's desire for freedom. It easily becomes one of my favourite films in recent years.".

	schema:headline " An unhappy ending...";
	schema:reviewBody "To those who are familiar with the end result of this true story it is certainly not a happy ending. In 1956 Hungary was ruled by communism. Russian communism to be exact and it was a few brave souls out of thousands that gave up their lives for a dream  of freedom.I am an American currently living in Hungary and I felt very privelged last night being able to see this film. There I sat in an auditorium with a theater screen set up and a projector as well watching this film in a city of only 13000 approximately one third of which sat all around me. I felt honored and very happy to know that I was in this country watching this film amongst so many people who were celebrating an event that took place fifty years ago here in this very country.The film centers around a water polo team in the year 1956. It was in this year that people began to take up arms. They decided enough was enough. Communism had ruled for far too long by this point  but the tragedy was that it was to remain that way for a much much longer time. At the end of the second world war the Russians decided it was their turn to rule Hungary. They took it off the shoulders of the Germans who had now lost and Russia was the new Hitler. The star of the film is member of the Hungarian water polo team and they become finalists in the Olympics that year. From the beginning of the film until the end  we see the Revolution through the eyes of this young man. How he falls in love with a women who is one of the leaders of the revolt and finds himself fighting for his country alongside her.Though it was a bit slow at times and it was in Hungarian  it's a film that in some ways you don't even really need to speak the language to understand. Although I'm semifluent in Hungarian it was still very difficult for me to follow the dialogue. However you can understand what's happening in the film without a knowledge of what they're saying. A lot of explosions fighting guns love scenes and arguments  it's quite apparent most of the time what's going on.I would say that acting wise it's a Hungarian made movie. The actors are not the creme of the crop  but certainly better than your average Joe. The direction was brilliant however. And I was quite amazed by the camerawork  and stage direction. Filmed on location in Budapest and it's quite obvious it gives those who have walked down some of the famous streets and squares chills down their backs with the knowledge that there were protesters and gun play in those places all those years ago. Now these streets and squares are famous tourist attractions. Although I hate to give in to the selfpity most Hungarians carry around with them I have to admit that the film does make you feel sorry for them as a people. First world war two and then this. It was as though they were to never catch a break. Which might account for some of their cultural behaviors even today. The communist mentality still seeping through. It is all apparent in the film why they go about their ways the way they do.It is an interesting film and a good historical reference. If anyone can find this with English subtitles or subtitles for whatever language you speak it might be good to see it just so you know what actually happened in 1956 and how as much as the Hungarians fought for their freedom life is not a movie and the outcome was very realistic. They lost.A final note. After the film a lady who was in the car with me on my home said something that I'll never forget. I mentioned that in the movie I thought it was funny how someone got so excited because they'd heard on the radio that the Americans were coming to save them. And I said...I didn't think that was true since I don't ever recall the Americans coming to the Hungarians aid. She said softly and sadly as though it were my fault No. You didn't come. You didn't come. A sad yet memorable historical and noteworthy event in world history. And of course in Hungarian history.".

	schema:reviewBody "I may not be objective since I'm a Hungarian and a patriot and especially after the very sad 50th anniversary this was some kind of relief for me.First the bad then the goods... Dob Kata is the only bad thing happened to this but she's really bad. I never appreciated her  never saw any movie where she didn't pose in lingerie  but after this I have to say she has to run around in lingerie because in clothes there's nothing touching in her nothing that makes you believe what she says no emotions on her face whatever. She cannot act that's it.But the movie had so many strong appearances and so many talented people behind the cameras that you easily forget about Dob. Ivn Feny is no surprise he's been in the Jake Gyllenhal movie Jarhead before which I didn't like though and he can act. He's enjoyable here not his best and not the best in the movie though.Kroly Gesztesi is phenomenal in his role as the coach one of the most likable characters here. The other of the greatest performances is brought by Sndor Csnyi. He's wellknown for his leading role in Kontroll and he simply outshines everyone here as well. The leading lady  after Dob's failure  is surely Viki Szvai Eszter in the movie Dob's best friend. She's playing so easily you can believe she's not even playing it's her true self... I liked the character so much thanks her playing that the loss of her was one of the saddest moments for me though it was almost obvious what has to happen to her.Vic Armstrong did a great job with what he had... The few tanks and other limitations didn't stop him to recreate what was happening on the streets of Budapest. You'll be scared by thinking it through it's so real...Kriszta Goda's second movie direction here makes you need to see the first as well. She did an amazing job here.After all I was touched and touched is such a clich when talking about this movie and the story behind it.1956 means something for everyone who has at least a little percentage of Hungarian blood in hisher veins... either you were here afterwards and saw the aftermath either you live here now as young and have the same needs feelings for freedom or you're living abroad and were raised on stories about Hungary and how your family had to live run through the border while they were shooting at them... Or you've heard about the story you know someone who's Hungarian. Or even reading about it here and seeing this movie it'll change you a little bit in what you think about Hungary. I hope less people will laugh at those cheap jokes by comedians on the US national TV after seeing this little history lesson.No matter how many stories you've heard it's not like being there and seeing this movie will bring you back as a watcher you'll understand them more and appreciate them more. After leaving the theater you'll surely believe the people who died on the streets or in the AVO prisons were true heroes. Makes you feel the need to do something patriotic as well...Thus I hope everyone of you goes out to see it internationally. After so many touching movies about American history here's your chance to see how those in the Eastern block struggled and fought for their lives. It's totally different and I hope it'll bring difference.Wanted to give a 10 but 1 coz of DK.".

After the conquest of this revolution with the help of Soviets a tragic new dictatorship fell over my fatherland for another 33 years which was full with lying and falsification of history. It was terrible to survive this period. Unfortunately the Western countries did not give any help to overcome the Soviet aggressors although in their feeling they sympathized with our revolution. This film gives some kind of gratification for all of these sad decades. It clearly shows that the truth and the moral victory was on the side of Hungarian revolutionists.

	schema:reviewBody "Water polo in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics was more than just sports to Hungarians whose country was just going through an antiSoviet uprising that was subsequently violently crushed by the Soviets when the Games were about to begin in the pool the small country was able to show to the world that they hadn't lost their national pride and power despite the oppression by their huge occupier. Written by Joe Eszterhas of Basic Instinct fame among others Krisztina Goda's film is set shortly before the Olympics when the Hungarian water polo team is preparing for the tournament amidst political unrest in Budapest. The team's star player Karcsi Szab Ivn Feny is looking forward to his big chance to shine in the eyes of the world but has to rethink his attitudes upon meeting a beautiful antiCommunist student activist Viki Falk Kata Dob. Being associated with her cause in public might cost him his position in the team but he soon understands that closing his eyes from the country's problems is no longer an option.The style of the film is as Hollywoodesque as can be the constantly playing music by Nick GlennieSmith ranges from bombastic to sentimental always carefully following the conventions of epic movie scores. The plot is also somewhat predictable and includes all the scenes one expects to find in a classical war cinema tragic deaths recklessly brave resistance battles against almost indestructible enemy tanks a woman crying over a dead body on a street and an ohsoromantic artistic sex scene between the lead couple whose fragile romance blossoms despite the turmoil everywhere. However the big budget also shows in good ways the sets props and costumes look authentic and the explosionheavy action scenes are well created and directed. I also liked the brownish and bluish tones of the cinematography and the visual style in general.Despite the athleticsounding premise the movie is not really a sports film as water polo is only played at the beginning and the end. The main purpose of the film has obviously been to commemorate the brave nation's patriotic efforts during the revolution and to remind audiences that war spectacles are not Hollywood's prerogative only. While the team's story is worth telling I think the overall style is way too obvious in its emotional manipulation and the general heavyhandedness hurts the film's chances to work as a truly affecting piece of cinema. On the surface it's an enjoyable war film though and can be enjoyed by fans of the genre.".

The movie is not a history film not a documentary it's the story of Viki Kata Dobo and Karcsi Ivan Fenyo who fall in love in this fast moving always changing setting. We love the smooth lines of Kata Dobo's face and we are a fan of her not because of her talent  so no complaints here... however Ivan Fenyo excels throughout the movie and I'm looking forward a lot seeing his next title. Sandor Csanyi brings his usual very good form.The movie is very authentic all spots filmed at the proper reallife original scenes buildings streets with reallife original guns tanks costumes. I guess this movie must reveal a lot of emotions for people who were part of the revolution of Budapest 1956. Hungarians raised againt the communist dictatorship but the Red Army occupied the country and steyed in Hungary until 1990.As for waterpolo scenes you can expect the best as all pictures were filmed with the national league of Hungarian waterpolo players a World 1 team!This is a must see for waterpolo fans for people in CentralEuropean studies and all those who have a Hungarian relative. Or see it just for the beautiful surroundings of Budapest. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Nobody likes to be cheated against in sports especially so when participating in national level events and worse having a supposedly neutral referee awarding dubious decisions that work against your favour even if it's clear cut they're either receiving some kickbacks or are genuinely blind. To the Hungarian waterpolo team playing against their occupiers the Soviet Union in the 1950s it meant bowing to rough tactics and having no respite at all.Perhaps what took me by surprise is how rich the production values are for this movie. Like films set against an historical backdrop such as Black Book Lust Caution and the likes Children of Glory never scrimped at fleshing out the masses who got themselves involved in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution where a simple protest in a university spiralled into armed resistance involving thousands marching through the streets showing their dissatisfaction of mistreatment by the Russians and the usual chants of Russians Go Home!.While on a macro level it introduced us to the era of Soviet occupation in most of the eastern Europe bloc this is essentially also a love story between a national hero of a water polo player Karcsi Szabo Ivan Fenyo and student activist Viki Falk Kata Dobo. Naturally their relationship doesn't start off smoothly with a clash of ideals given that Karcsi is in a privileged position for his value to the country in sports and having more to lose if the status quo is changed. For Viki it's change that she and her fellow student leaders want to initiate no matter how small their actions are but soon enough it became a hydra that went out of control giving them a little victory before the big sledgehammer of a retaliation when any typical authoritarian regime respond with their military might.I guess with those in power and having those who privilege themselves under such conditions change will always seem threatening be it to current lifestyles or fear for their lives. It might appear selfish as demonstrated by Karcsi's mother in self preservation constantly reminding Karcsi of his duty to win medals for his country and not to mix with negative influences such as Viki associated with trouble for her bearing of arms and being part of the inner circle of the change movement. But we know love can't keep these two apart right?What made Children of Glory a delight was besides the scenes of historical value and its recreation of street battles it had possibly the first waterpolo sports game in a movie I had watched and filmed it with plenty of excitement that you can't help but to cheer the Hungarian team on as they battle for pride and for their countrymen's struggles back home as they meet arch nemesis Russia during the 1956 Melbourne Olympic games resulting in what was a bloody match in the pool. I thought this segment was very well shot though you had to really sit through the film to be rewarded for a segment toward the finale.Wonderful acting rich costumes and sets together with a blend of history to lend some narrative gravitas make Children of Glory an excellent movie on many fronts. I like it enough for it to make it to my highly recommended list and contender for the top 10 movies of the year list.".

	schema:headline " Feels like a Hollywood movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Even if a person generally dislikes foreign movies they could still enjoy Children of Glory because if feels very much like an American film and it leans very heavily on familiar archetypes to tell the story. For example the protagonist is a very typical movie hero who is initially reluctant to join the rebellion but ends up being thrust into the conflict and then heroically supports the cause because he realizes that it is a noble effort. He has an annoying little brother that idolizes him and wants to be more grown up until emulating his brother gets him into trouble and he realizes that he just wants to be a kid. He has overbearing mother and relates more to his grandfather who seems to have the sensibilities of a much younger man in that he supports the youthled rebellion. Karcsi and best friends have a falling out but reconcile by the end of the movie and the film's love interest initially dislikes Karcsi but they develop a romance over an unrealistically short period of time. These are all elements straight out of a Hollywood movie. An average person could watch this film without subtitles or any prior knowledge of the Hungarian Revolution and still easily follow the story because they've seen it so many times before in other popular revolutionary movies like V for Vendetta or Braveheart.These familiar elements could also work to the films detriment. If a person was expecting a more subtle and stereotypically artsy European film they might think this movie is too clich and that may be a fair criticism. Nothing in the movie is really surprising. Everything plays out exactly as you would expect but that doesn't detract from the emotional core of the movie. Although the movie's themes of oppression and freedom are treated the way they are in most films they still feel very effective and emotionally stirring. The characters are portrayed well enough that the viewer wants them to succeed and is invested in their story. Even if some of the things happening around them are a little clich you still want to follow them on their journey and see where it takes them. The film is set in 1956 but this is not the fruitful post WWII baby boomer 1950s that America was experiencing. Hungary looks much more impoverished under Soviet rule. It seems more like the 1930s or 1940s where there was an economic depression or strict rationing. It's clear that even before it became a war zone Hungary was not doing very well during this time. The film itself opens with a water polo tournament that establishes the Russians as Karcsi's rivals and sets up the tension between the Soviet Union and the countries that it controlled. The Hungarians do not like the Russians and the Russians seem to view the Hungarian team with disdain. In the locker room the tension explodes into a fist fight the same way the tension would explode into a full blown revolution later in the movie. This is reminiscent of a lot of athletic movies that use the featured sport as a microcosm for society so social issues can be explored on a smaller scale. Remember the Titans used football the explore segregation and racial integration and Children of Glory uses Olympic water polo to explore rebellion and Soviet oppression is Central Europe.Aside from Karcsi the other main character and protagonist was Viki a leader in the student protests that would turn into the Hungarian revolution. She is the reason Karcsi becomes involved in the revolution as he is romantically pursuing her when the protests turn violent and he gets caught up in the action. She's a more competent member of revolution than Karcsi and her authority seems to carry a lot of weight in the rebellion. She is often shown being in charge of large groups of people whereas Karcsi doesn't know what he's doing a lot of the time and begins the movie willfully ignorant about the protests and learns about what's going on along with the audience. While Karcsi is depicted as the primary protagonist Viki is clearly the hero of the film. She often is often the only person willing to stand by her convictions and not give up on her cause motivating the other rebels in the process. The violence in the move is graphic in a very effective way. Gunfire is significantly louder than the rest of the audio and when people get shot with higher caliper guns parts of their bodies explode where the bullets hit them sometimes exposing the bone underneath. This is especially graphic because the first shot hits a defenseless older woman. The Soviets have the Hungarians significantly outgunned so the battles result in a lot of Hungarians being killed including bystanders and people not directly involved in the revolution. This heightens the threat of the Soviets as not only oppressors but also murders. While there are relatively few battle scenes in the movie when they do occur it feels like there's a lot at stake. The threat of violence is never treated lightly and has dire consequences for the characters and for Hungary. Children of Glory is an extremely accessible film about the ideas of freedom oppression and patriotism. It sheds light on a historic event most Americans don't know about and most importantly it tells a compelling story.".

I think the film was executed beautifully the sets the costumes the props everything fit perfectly so no problem there.I think the acting was also generally good Csanyi never disappoints Gesztesi comes through as always etc. However the two lead characters could have done a better job  both Fenyo and Dobo have a difficult time conveying emotions. Fenyo usually looks like a bored android and Dobo  well whatever.The biggest problem is the inane writing. The plot is just a cheap TVmovie template predictable clichd and often gratuitous. What's even worse is the dialogue. It's comicbook level sometimes even worse. I was at the point of leaving the theatre after several badly written lines that would have looked out of place even in a highschool essay.Anyways go see it for the pictures and for the great background story if you are not familiar with Hungary's shining moment in 20th century history. But don't expect profound entertainment or a thrilling story.As often history is the best playwright. Too bad the human ones didn't live up to the job.".

For me the most important part was the ending of the movie when the Hungarian national anthem plays pictures showing to very different places and I turned to my friend who is a born Canadian watching the movie with me You can understand now why we have tears in our eyes when our nationalanthem plays...

I recently read James Michner's book on the 1956 revolution so I was pleased to see the movie following the historical accounts very closely. The water polo matches were very believable and incredibly filmed from all angles! I have only seen water polo on TV during the Olympics but these scenes were gripping. I wondered if the actors were real water polo players. I don't understand why this sport is not more popular in the US. It is fast paced and very grueling physically.

It turned out to be nothing short of a wellbalanced historically correct film that arouses great curiosity about what went on in the streets of Budapest and elsewhere in Hungary in October and November 1956 and in my mind provokes enormous sympathy for the Hungarian civilians at the time and the country in general.Director Kata Dobo has had every good reason to use certain elements familiar to commercial western films. It is an important story that should reach a wider audience. Far too many probably know little or nothing about these events. The Olympic games and the need for love are parallel stories in the film which we all understand and yet are not melodramatic. This leaves us to grasp just what the turmoil of revolution secret police reprisals and finally the deaf ear of the West was about. I can imagine the Hungarians involved in making this film have put their souls into it. The least we can do is to listen this time to what they have to say. The film once over I can't imagine anyone not getting the message.It is inevitable that a film portraying a revolution without the massive and often excessive funding of western films can only show examples of key ingredients  the Molotov cocktails conviction and doubt Russian brutality divided loyalties chaotic emergency services daredevil teenagers family divisions honesty and deception. These true aspects come across not only sufficiently but well especially one of the most noteworthy of them the women at the forefront of the fighting. The modest colouring is in tact with the time and the mood. The observer is carried from one realistic scene to the another as quickly as the bewildering swiftness of the revolution must have unfolded at the time.At the time in fear of making the cold war colder the leaders of the West with President Eisenhower at the top of the list support for the Hungarian cry for freedom was shamefully guarded but as the scenes from the Melbourne Olympics demonstrated public opinion was not unguarded. This film presents an excellent opportunity for some to recall what really happened in Hungary in 1956 for others a first insight. Luckily the jury of the Berlin international film festival seized the opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't know that 'Insomnia' was based on a Norwegian movie of the same title. Otherwise I would have watched the original film first. What convinced me to watch this one was the cast that included three supertalented actors and the director Christopher Nolan 'loved his 'Memento'. Thus my comment is pretty much just about the movie rather than how it compares to the original.There's really a lot to like about. This isn't merely a 'catchthebadguy' thriller but a character driven psychological drama. It starts as a who done it then turns into a how done it to why done it to what are you going to do about it. While it is the complex characters that stand out the details of the murder cases are very well presented and the layered twists add well to the plot. 'Insomnia' is fascinating to look at. The production design is of very high quality and the cinematography is breathtaking. The attention to detail and the emphasis of the visuals that make the viewer experience Dormer's sleep deprived world is stunning. Incidentally I was watching it very late at night and perhaps that is the best time to watch it.Nolan's style of execution is remarkable. Daylight is used very effectively as a character of its own. In a way it's the antagonist of the movie that leads to Dormer's mental 'deterioration'. It's a dark movie set in constant daylight. Then there's the clever use of fog and floating logs which in a way act as pathetic fallacies. Blood also plays a symbolic role. The quietness of a cold and gloomy Alaska is both intense and chilling.Al Pacino proves again what an excellent actor he is. It's amazing how he eerily looks the part with bags under his eyes a clumsy gait stooped shoulders and a continuous expression of fatigue while he dives into the depth of an extremely complex character. Robin Williams skillfully downplays his part as the latently manipulative Finch as he takes advantage of Dormer's vulnerability. Hillary Swank brings an air of freshness as the rookie detective who also has to make a difficult decision towards the end. Maura Tierney makes very good use of her few scenes.On the flip side it may seem as though 'Insomnia' loses focus in some scenes as it appears to derail. Of course there are different ways of looking at this. The ending feels rushed and is very predictable. Also Williams's Finch could have been more developed considering the important role he has. Nonetheless it's a wellmade film. I intend to watch the Norwegian version to see how it compares but on its own Nolan's 'Insomnia' is a fascinating experience and the cast and crew deserve all the praise for finally putting it all together.".

Robin Williams plays a troubled Alaskan writer.  Without giving anything away INSOMNIA is definitely worth it.  Some may see it and be disappointed.  One way to steer away from this failure is think of INSOMNIA as a psychological thriller rather than a Shoot 'em up thriller. INSOMNIA is story about loyalty and human emotion.  Don't get me wrong the movie is thrillpacked but let's just sayYou don't need blood and gore to make the audience members be on the edge of their seats which I was. INSOMNIA hits all of its points including acting directing screenwriting and cinematography.  It's a first class thriller with great characters.  On a side note...Pacino is worthy of an Oscar for his performance Williams is equally excellent and Swank also deserves recognition for complete scope of acting.  A job well done by these three actors and especially the man behind the curtain Christopher Nolan!".

	schema:reviewBody "One doesn't expect to feel claustrophobic in Alaska but that's exactly the effect when watching Insomnia. The primary story is about the police investigation of the murder of a highschool girl in a small Alaskan town. Through the pull of old acquaintances and political necessity two LA homicide detectives Pacino and Martin Donovan are dispatched to the scene to help the locals. The political necessity concerns a graft investigation in which the two LA detectives are key suspects. One is thinking of copping a plea so they are spirited out of LA to avoid the investigative light. Then they find themselves in the 24hour day of the Alaskan summer where the two plot lines collide the murder investigation and the graft. And what a collision it is. The insomnia of the title is suffered by the Pacino character who can't sleep during the movie's 7day span. And each day his eyes are more sunken he's groggier less focused. This parallels his descent into guilt remorse and desperation. But to provide any more details would be to give away key plot elements. Insomnia is gripping and it's best to see the movie cold.The acting especially Robin Williams as the key suspect in the child slaying is top notch. Williams is made for these roles he should kiss the suckup feelgood stuff goodbye for good. The photography is excellent Alaska never looked so ominous and the direction delivers the goods. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " a masterful psychological thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Like the 1997 Norwegian film on which it is based Insomnia' is a superbly crafted crime thriller one that is more concerned with the psychological complexities of its main character than with the minutiae of the criminal investigation itself  though the details of the case are fascinating in their own right as well.Al Pacino delivers his finest performance in years in the role of Detective Will Dormer a seasoned homicide investigator brought in from Los Angeles to help solve the murder of a seventeenyearold high school student in rural Alaska.  The problem is that back in L.A. Dormer is facing some heat of his own from LAPD's Internal Affairs Division which is beginning a probe into the propriety of some of the veteran's actions on the job.  Back in Alaska while on a stakeout to nab the possible killer Dormer becomes disoriented in the fog and ends up accidentally shooting and killing his longtime partner a colleague who Dormer had just learned was planning to cooperate with the IA investigation back home thereby bringing about the possible ruination of Dormer's career and reputation.  Caught off guard by this sudden turn of events Dormer suddenly finds himself in the unfamiliar role of perpetrator looking for ways to cover up a crime' rather than unravel it.  One of the compelling themes of the film is its insistence that only a very thin line separates those who commit crimes from those whose job it is to uncover and prosecute the wrongdoers.Dormer is stunned to find how quickly and easily he can cross over that line.  The outstanding screenplay by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjaerg really knows how to get into the minds and emotions of its characters particularly in the case of Dormer who turns out to be one of the most psychologically complex and fascinating figures we have encountered in the movies in a long long time.  Here is a man who has built his name and career on knowing how to unravel complex crimes always priding himself on being one step ahead of the criminals who are so convinced they have left no traces behind which could point to their guilt.  Yet now Dormer finds himself in the same boat as he anxiously looks for ways to hide the fact that he shot  even accidentally  a man who had the power to bring him down.  As the story develops Dormer whom we assume at the start is innocent of the charges for which he is being investigated by Internal Affairs begins to seem less and less innocent and more and more capable of doing just exactly what it is he is being accused of.   Yet the triumph of the film is that Pacino and the screenwriters never let us feel we know all there is to know about Dormer.  He is truly a man of mystery so tightly coiled that even he doesn't know or understand all that is going on in the deepest darkest recesses of his psyche.  By setting the film in the summer near the Arctic Circle the filmmakers are able to provide a natural phenomenon to help aggravate Dormer's potentially psychotic condition. Like Mersault in Camus' The Stranger' Dormer becomes strangely disoriented by the oppressive effect of the sun though in this case it is the lack of a night that drives Dormer crazy through insomnia.  As the virtually indistinguishable days and nights pass without sleep Dormer begins to suffer from delirium and hallucinations making it all the harder for him to separate truth from fiction fantasy from reality and  most importantly  right from wrong and morality from immortality.  When the killer reveals to Dormer that he saw him shoot his partner Dormer finds himself faced with the ethical crisis of turning the culprit in or of bonding with him as partners' in mutual criminality and guilt.  Here again the onceclear and distinct line between investigator and criminal suddenly ceases to exist.Pacino stoopshouldered and craggyfaced  the prominent bags under his eyes a physical testimony to his weariness and sleeplessness  plumbs the very depths of this infinitely rich and complex character.  In fact there is nothing less than an outstanding performance in the entire film.  Robin Williams brings an air of restraint and understatement to the part of Walter Finch the killer who plays a catandmouse mind game with the sleepless intellectually vulnerable Dormer exploiting Dormer's weakened state to his own advantage.  Hilary Swank brings a warmth and compassion to her role as Ellie Burr an eagertoplease detective who has long idolized Dormer and his work who also has to make an emotionally wrenching choice near the end of the film.  Finally Maura Tierney makes her few scenes count as a sympathetic innkeeper whom Dormer turns to as the person who happens to be handy at the moment when the need to unburden his soul spontaneously arises within him.As the film's director Christopher Nolan establishes and maintains a mood of quiet intensity throughout the course of the film.  Helped by the stark but somewhat oppressively gloomy beauty of the Alaskan outpost setting Nolan makes us experience the same sense of unease and disorientation Dormer himself feels.  Nolan has chosen to punctuate his film with a series of highly charged intensely dramatic confrontation scenes between Dorman and any number of the other characters in the film.   The film never wanes in interest for even a moment of its running time.It is an enormous pleasure to see a film as intelligently conceived and executed as Insomnia.'  Kudos to everyone involved with making this such a rare and fascinating movie going experience.  But the greatest thanks goes to Al Pacino himself.  He has never been so good.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really looking forward to this film and I'm glad to say that I wasn't the least bit disappointed.  First of all I was glad to see Al Pacino on screen again.  It seems like it's been a while since I've seen him on screen.  I think the last film he was in was Any Given Sunday.  Pacino yet again delivers a brilliant performance strapping the audience in for a wild ride through the emotionally scarred mind of Detective Will Dormer.  It seemed like I could feel his every emotion throughout the course of the movie.  Because this is a characterdriven story that revolves around Dormer his pain anguish and guilt on account of accidentally taking his partner's life constant insomnia and subsequent threats by his nemesis played by Robin Williams as a writer of trashy detective novels who's fascinated by Dormer and blackmails him by threatening to spill out the secret of Dormer shooting his partner.  As for Robin Williams he is fully convincing as the reclusive novelistmurderer of a 17yearold girl.  I suspected from the trailers that he'd play a serial killer.  I wouldn't exactly classify his character as a serial killer but he is the antagonist and a murderer and Williams plays the role perfectly never underplaying it and never overplaying it.  He could've went overthetop playing a totally ruthless killer who cackles at the thought of murdering someone in cold blood.  Though he's not our sympathetic character you do feel sympathy for him at times.  And I like how the story creates this little catandmouse game between the two characters each one plagued by skeletons in the closet.  Oscarwinner Hilary Swank delivers another fine performance and I was stunned to see how amazingly attractive she looks after having seen her genderbending role as Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry.Christopher Nolan is the acclaimed director of Memento and he scores yet again with this beautifully constructed thriller.  I was intrigued from start to finish.  Nolan's use of lighting is dark and murky wonderfully setting the noirish tone.  Nolan shows great promise as an upandcoming director and with a good outlet he can possibly become the next Kubrick. I greatly look forward to seeing his next project whenever that may be.I recommend Insomnia to anyone who loved Nolan's previous Memento or anyone who simply enjoys a great multifaceted mysterythriller that will keep you guessing at every turn.  I think it's too early to vote this movie as one of the best films of 2002 but it's a possible candidate.  We don't see too many great films anymore and whenever they're out there it's good to take advantage.My score  9 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I used to think that nobody could come close to Robert De Niro when it comes to who was the best actor in Hollywood but as the years went by he started to pick some real Turkeys and a in the mean while an old hand was gradually taking the crown from De Niro and that is Al Pacino. In Insomnia he has picked another cracker of a film that although not fast paced is brilliantly acted and is very watchable. Hilary Swank is superb as is Robin Williams and its refreshing to see him taking a serious role instead of sentimental trash like Patch Adams but as per usual it is Al Pacino who steals the show. He plays an insomniac Cop who gets intangled in a murder case and gets into trouble after accidently killing his partner . I cant think of an actor who looks more tired than Pacino anyway so he was perfect for the role. The story is OK but to be honest the film is more about the performances than the plot. 8 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Obvious comment  This movie kept me wide awake";
	schema:reviewBody "After Memento' I  and a lot of others  eagerly awaited to see what Nolan would do next. Could he repeat the success? No. Could he still do a decent movie a cut above the rest? Yes.It's all about a killer. A top detective Dormer Al Pacino along with his partner Eckhart Martin Donavan is called in to assist in a murder in remote Alaska. They're assisted by the local police officer Ellie Burr Hilary Swank who is a big fan of Dormer. Well and good. The two detectives have a secret shared between them which allows for some creative character building friction. You want a twist? Got it  there's a few. Firstly there's the whole insomnia' element  Alaska is in a 24hour sun period which Dormer cannot adjust to. Therefore he's constantly awake and as the hunt continues getting more and more tired  and more and more likely to mistake. Speaking of mistakes  he makes a big one which I can't reveal but which has dramatic consequences not to mention character introspecting and building. This allows the movie to take a path which is somewhat unexpected for a bit especially when we see how far Dormer is willing to go. It's all let down a bit by a final fifteen minutes which is if nothing else too dully Hollywood predictable. Oh well.So the script's good but not excellent. Certainly not a patch on Memento' as it has none of its mystery or suspense. It's essentially a copbadguy story with the insomnia twist and doesn't feature any spectacularly memorable moments. So why is it above average? The performances help for one. Al Pacino is the perfect person to play an insomniac  his drooping eyes are suited to Dormer. Yes he does his usual appearing to sleep through his roles but it suits the Dormer character and so he's well chosen. Swank is a bit disappointing  it's not a fault of her acting abilities but more of a character that seems decidedly underdeveloped. All we know is that she's a fan of Dormer but out to prove herself and make a mark. Not original. Robin Williams is of course the most talked about actor here casting himself against type as a villain. He's remarkably restrained. I normally loathe his comedy' roles and kept expecting him to burst into goofy gestures and rambling nonsense but he keeps himself in gives himself a quiet dignity undercut with a credible sense of menace. It'll make his role in One Hour Photo' interesting to see. His character is also reasonably interesting let down again by the weak finale.So how does Nolan master editor work out here? He's good. There is a nice repeated image that like elements of Memento' only makes full sense later on. There're some great cuts and moments indicating Pacino's extreme fatigue  still camera work sound being drowned out and so forth. Certainly Nolan knows how to do his visuals and work with the beautiful Alaskan and British Columbian landscape to create stark images which are of course also metaphorical. His use of lighting  a necessity in this movie  is good and a nice contrast with light being used where dark would normally be the enemy. It's his work along with the actors that lifts up the movie into the well worth watching' category.I was in the end a little bit disappointed with Insomnia'. It's not half as clever as Memento' presumably having to pander more towards typical Hollywood sensibilities it appears that it deviates from the original to make it more audience friendly. The lack of a stronger script is offset by some fine acting and assured direction. I look forward to seeing what Nolan does next just not with quite the same eagerness as I did before this. 810.".

	schema:headline " An intense character study set against a psychological 'cat and mouse' game... that";
	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Nolan succeeds once again at mastering a suspenseful script into a truly superb film. Nolan Memento creates a complex and carefully construed tale that has plenty of intentional misdirection that is quite convincing.Al Pacino plays another one of his droopy detectives in a role that is quite unoriginal if placed in other films. Yet what separates this role from others is his portrayal of L.A. Detective Will Dormer actually has some 'meat' attached to it. Pacino plays a detective with a history of successful apprehensions yet he has flaws just like any other person and they come back to haunt him. Relocated from Los Angeles to Alaska he is sent in hopes of capturing a killer who murdered a local schoolgirl.Judging from the previews premature assumptions can be made labeling the film as another simple 'catandmouse' thriller. Instead those conceptions will be lost soon after the haunting opening credits emerge and we are transplanted directly into a deep and complex character study set against the backdrop of a local homicide mystery in a small Alaskan town. The film's antagonist For those who have seen the film  is he really the villain or the catalyst for Pacino's ethical debate? is a local writer portrayed by Robin Williams. This is Williams' second villainous role in his trilogy of films Death to Smoochy One Hour Photo that aims at diversifying his resume. Williams impresses as he juxtaposes between an innocent victim of a mishap and between a calculating and conniving murderer. Director Nolan has assembled a terrific cast as this complex plot unfolds at a frivolous rate. This is a film that a discerning viewer will admire and a viewer with a short attention span will loathe. Nolan tosses us with one set of objectives and midway through the first act we are sitting in on an entirely different film. Adjectives such as formulaic and conventional should not be associated with a film such as this. Nolan has completely revitalized the tired genre of the murder thriller with his sleek direction and picturesque photography.Nolan first had conceived of the idea upon viewing a Norwegian film of the same name directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg. Nolan seems to have taken the flaws of the original and improved upon them in a sleek feat of filmmaking that leaves much to be questioned about its' brilliance. One viewing is not enough to internalize the level of sophistication Nolan has created with this brilliant film.Hillary Seitz's first attempt at writing a screenplay is solid but must be understood that the conception was not hers. Still her script contains some juicy scenes that benefit all our characters in this film. Three Oscar winners Pacino Williams and Hillary Swank highlight this film and with good reason. At first glance the cast seems informingly incongruent yet with time all explains itself. Swank's performance as Detective Burr seems unnecessary right up until the final moments in the film. Yet this is all of the resolute brilliance Nolan lends to this film. This film succeeds on several levels of cinematic bravura. David Julyan's haunting score coupled with intense subliminal flashes match the films' dark tone and Cinematographer Wally Pfister Memento captures the majestic beauty of the Alaskan sea front.As aforementioned a thrilling chase of a murderer can be expected when introduced to the film. But not long after we are delving into a debate that has a positive fix on morality. A battle between a person's conscience and his actions are truly at the forefront of this intellectually intriguing and complex thriller. Despite its' disappointing anticlimactic finale the film still has enough zest and brilliance to make this film a true testament to the skill of Director Nolan.Giancarlo's Rating ".

	schema:headline " A great psychological thriller a mustsee for Pacino fans";
	schema:reviewBody "Since the release of Memento which I honestly haven't seen yet Christopher Nolan has become a rising star in the world of film directing. And he finally shined with both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight which revitalized the Batman character and established it as the most popular and even putting him above Spiderman. The fact is Nolan is among the greatest filmmakers in the world and he is going to keep making new classics for the years to come and I'm already looking forward to Inception in 2010. In 2002 he directed a remake of the Norweigian film of the same name called Insomnia and I gotta say it's the best psychological thriller I've ever seen and it even surpasses The Silence of the Lambs big time.The premiseA highly known and highly accomplished Los Angeles detective named Will Dormer Al Pacino is sent to a town in Alaska to solve a murder case involving a 17 year old girl. But his partner Hap just revealed to him that he's planning on testifying against him because he knows about Dormer planting evidence to gain a conviction on a previous case. And all that guilt fear and the midnight sun that is constantly shining sends Dormer a whole week of no sleep insomnia. And Dormer starts to lose his concentration and his reasoning. Al Pacino has been known for dominating every movie he's in and stealing the show from the other actors and he totally does that in here. And it also seems that he was perfectly cast in here because he has the look of a guy who hasn't slept in days. And that might be due to his facial appearance with the dark circles under his eyes and his wrinkled face and he even looks tired the moment he gets off the plane at the beginning. And the more days that pass he looks more and more fatigued. And I wonder if Pacino really kept himself awake during filming or if he's really that good as a method actor. Although fatigue is the main emotion that he demonstrates here his feeling of guilt is masterfully shown after he accidentally kills his partner in the thick fog while they're chasing the killer. And we as the audience wonder if it was really a mistake or if he shot him on purpose to shut his partner up and prevent his testimony. And Dormer even does some extreme measures to cover up what really happened. At the end the question is never answered and we're left wondering about his morality and how ethical of a cop he really is. And also the scene when he confronts the victim's boyfriend whose a smartmouth always doing his fk the world act and he really shuts him up. I personally thought that was pretty darn cool and he really fits into the mind of Will Dormer and gives one of his finest performances ever.Robin Williams who plays as the girl's killer is known for doing comedy roles and he should start listening to everyone's advice and stick to doing dramatic or serious roles because he is WAY better when he's doing the kind of acting he does in Insomnia. He actually doesn't start showing his face until about halfway through the movie and spends the first half either hiding his face or giving sinister yet strangely nonthreatening phone calls to Dormer. And it turns out that he saw Dormer shoot his partner and spends the rest of the movie blackmailing him and forces him to pin the murder of the girl on someone else. Hilary Swank gives perhaps the 2nd best acting performance and once again Nolan casted her perfectly as the detective who idolizes Dormer. I guess it has to do something with the way Swank's mannerisms are like. And she's totally believable as the character who looks up to Dormer and she seems like she wants to impress him all the time. And she cuts Dormer some slack even though he gives a vague explanation for an incident involving an officers death. Having a trio of former Oscar winners really helped the film here and also was the masterful direction of Nolan he makes the scenery of Alaska somewhat peaceful yet disturbing. And as all psychological thrillers go...u have to keep the suspense and tension going though the whole move....otherwise what's the point? At first you can feel the tension between Dormer and his partner and then between Dormer and the killer. This is simply the best psychothriller I've ever seen and if you think that The Silence of the Lambs was something wait 'till you see this!".

	schema:headline " Christopher Nolan does it again!";
	schema:reviewBody "First off Christopher Nolan is one of my biggest influences when it comes to film and screen writing. With films such as Following and Memento both of which reached cult following levels he is well on his way to a successful Hollywood career. Then today came his 3rd film was released Insomnia. Based on a 1997 Norwegian film written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjrg Insomnia is a true work of art in the world of film.Christopher Nolan takes all that was the 1997 film and brings it to the next level using his own style of directing a musical score with shades of Memento and an all star cast. Al Pacino and Robin Williams pulls out the greatest performances of their careers in the past decade if not in their ENTIRE careers in my eyes. Pacino once again excels in the role of master dective while Williams takes this chance to show his dark side and he does it so well. I can only hope that this is a rebirth of Robin Williams and as it stands with his upcoming film One Hour Photo which he once again plays a dark psychotic role it seems to be just that!

	onyx:emotionText "First off Christopher Nolan is one of my biggest influences when it comes to film and screen writing. With films such as Following and Memento both of which reached cult following levels he is well on his way to a successful Hollywood career. Then today came his 3rd film was released Insomnia. Based on a 1997 Norwegian film written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjrg Insomnia is a true work of art in the world of film.Christopher Nolan takes all that was the 1997 film and brings it to the next level using his own style of directing a musical score with shades of Memento and an all star cast. Al Pacino and Robin Williams pulls out the greatest performances of their careers in the past decade if not in their ENTIRE careers in my eyes. Pacino once again excels in the role of master dective while Williams takes this chance to show his dark side and he does it so well. I can only hope that this is a rebirth of Robin Williams and as it stands with his upcoming film One Hour Photo which he once again plays a dark psychotic role it seems to be just that! Hilary Swank also pulls out what is the greatest role of her career.Insomnia brings you in as an audience with it's perfectly woven plot with a film noir feel to it just as Nolan's first two films. It is a rollercoster ride of drama and suspense as you watch Al Pacino from the very beginning unravel and the rest of the story and his past catches up with him.

The changes though are both subtle and significant and intriguingly as American as Sam Spade when the mise en scene gets moved to Alaska actually shot in Vancouver. Significantly there is less sex and more morality.Hilary Swank's character is more naive than her counterpart Martin Donovan's character's role is more central to the story and of course Robin Williams gets more screen time than his original counterpart as the conflict is less in the lead's mind and more on the screen as a duel. The plot twists are done differently so I shamefully got confused between the two movies.While not as overwhelming as the original I do think this version should rank right up with the great detectivecopdoestherightthing movies and the plot makes more sense than The Big Sleep.originally written 6162002".

	schema:headline " This film will give you Insomnia!";
	schema:reviewBody "Who doesn't love Al Pacino? Anyone.....Come on..... there at least should be one hater! Guess there is not. Al Pacino is loved by everyone who has seen him as Michael Vito Corleone in The Godfather Trilogy or the ruthless Tony Montana in Scarface. These films were the highlights of his career and even though he isn't as memorable as Will Dormer in Insomnia it is hard not to give him an honorable mention. Insomnia is referred to as a Cat and Mouse thriller and it proved that it is one because of the whole chase thing between Will Dormer a cop and a local writer who goes by the name of Walter Finch a man who is under the suspicion of killing a teen. This is proved even more when there is an actual ground chase between them two on the logs in the flowing river. That scene was full of heart pounding action and added a bit of intrigue that made you appreciate the film a little bit more. The film would have been unknown to me if there weren't the three Oscar winners Al Pacino Robin Williams and Hilary Swank that made this thriller for what it is also if Christopher Nolan hadn't directed it. He is truly a great director. Steven Spielberg has to watch out for the might of Nolan. Al Pacino was absolute and admirable in Insomnia therefore making him the best actor in the whole film. His role as a tough cop was fascinating and hypnotizing. Robin Williams who portrays Walter Finch was not as great as Al's however he still doesn't disappoint. This is not Robin Williams best role but it MIGHT be his most evilest role in his Evil Trilogy. Hilary Swank's character Ellie Burr made you think that she was unnecessary but as the film reaches its climax you realize that she plays an important part. Swank's performance could not rival against her other roles in Million Dollar Baby or Boy's don't Cry however she is agreeable but not fun to watch. The films chilly or spooky atmosphere is the best in any movie I have ever seen so far. It just makes the films setting really homesweethome. The scenery at the beginning was beautiful as the plane flew over the ice and glaciers of Alaska.In Nightmute Alaska seventeen year old resident Kay Connell is found murdered. As a favor to the local Nightmute police chief two Los Angeles Robbery Homicide police detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart are called in to assist in the investigation. Although renowned in the police world both Dormer and Eckhart are facing some professional issues back in Los Angeles. In Nightmute Dormer has a major case of insomnia due to a combination of the incessant midnight sun and from a secret he is carrying. This insomnia is causing him to be delusional. Something he is not dreaming about is that the murderer has contacted him informing him all about the murder and the fact that he knows everything that is going on with Dormer. They begin a symbiotic relationship in keeping secrets for each individual's benefit. But ambitious young local detective Ellie Burr might piece the story together on her own.".

	schema:reviewBody "Al Pacino is an L.A. cop who's come to Alaska with his partner to investigate a brutal homicide. Hilary Swank is the Alaskan detective who admires his work and methods. Robin Williams is the killer they're hunting down. All three are Oscar winners by the way and deliver performances that are definitely worthy of an Oscar. Throughout the film Pacino's character's mind wreaks havoc the Alaskan town is so far up north they get white nights I.e. the sun doesn't set for half the year. As a result he cannot sleep.With Insomnia Christopher Nolan joins my list of directors I admire. Insomnia owes much of its stunning success to the directorial choices Nolan makes. The most difficult task of the movie is this how exactly can you show the audience Pacino's increasingly disoriented sleepless mindframe without boring them? I think Nolan handles this expertly.The cast deliver stellar performances in particular Robin Williams. His character is undoubtedly psychotic. What a temptation for Williams to steal the show with a display of angry shouting of pure psychopathic hostility of maniacal laughter! But no. He avoids this and goes for a far different touch. His character talks of extremely disturbing things in a very calm matteroffact way making his performance far more bonechilling. As much as I love Williams' comic roles I have to admit he's practically unrivalled in serious acting.Another thought although this is a film I like to consider a thriller it is very much like a film noir as well. Personally I love the plots of film noirs but I can't stand the relentless usage of shadows and dark lighting. Insomnia shatters these guidelines. It is a very dark film with lots and lots of light. The effect is interesting to say the least.This film is a thriller and consequently I'm choosing my words carefully in order to spoil as little of the film as possible. I highly recommend seeing this film I was blown away. Insomnia is also very deep powerfully invoking themes of guilt and restlessness. I do not regret buying this film I confidently call it a great movie.Note Apparently Insomnia is a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgrd. I haven't seen it but if it was anything close to as good as this film whoever does see it is in for a real treat!".

However later he gets a call from the killer who saw the whole thing and is holding it over Will in return for him framing someone else.   With fewer options and Ellie investigating the shooting Will finds himself unable to sleep in the 24 hour sunshine and getting increasingly strung out.Better known as part 2 of Robin Williams proving he can do more than just sentimental crap I was looking forward to seeing it.  I haven't seen the original film so I can't contrast the two and say which is better  I could only judge this on its own merits.  I found the film to be a very enjoyable thriller that was very atmospheric.  The story itself is quite intriguing and is at its best when Will and Walter are playing cat and mouse games with each other.  The main investigation and the investigation into Hap's shooting all add to the intensity.Although it is quite slow at times it is actually well paced  some fast paced exciting moments but mostly dialogue driven scenes that are just as exciting.  The direction is excellent and the whole film has a bright crisp feel to it.  The final shot of the film is powerful yet still with the protagonists frozen against a background of lake and mountains.The film's main driver is the strength of the performances.  Williams is excellent I was never sure what to make of his character because Williams kept him complex enough to hold the interest.  Pacino is also great.  He actually looks dog tired progressively through the film.  Like Williams his character has enough meat on it to be of interest and when either of them was on the screen my interest was guaranteed .  Swank had a difficult task to play opposite Pacino in the majority of her scenes but she really holds her own.  Donovan is good but brief but to be honest it is Pacino and Williams' film the whole way.Overall this is a classy little thriller that has more than enough going on to keep it interesting.  The plot is well written so that it avoids a simplistic goodevil approach and the performances bring the welldrawn characters to life.".

Hilary Swank was decent enough but her role demanded none of the skill that won her two welldeserved Oscars. The movie makers should have skipped Swank's price tag and spent the money on better support because most of it is merely televisioncaliber.The script is a pretty good one if you like thrillers of this sort although it's been done to death by now. Nolan's direction throws in some admittedly breathtaking outdoor scenery while the more intimate scenes are no better than average. The score by David Julyan is decent enough but I can't really recall anything particularly interesting or memorable about it.On the whole the film is a perfectly acceptable thriller though it falls into the trap of placing more emphasis on stars than story.

What a waste. Robin Williams gives   surprisingly  the best performance of the project which should be a real warning. Little is made of the fact that he is a writer of detective stories.

We are supposed to wonder? Will Nolan have a film life worth living? We wonder.".

While people who don't enjoy the Nolan brand of cinema will mark Insomnia as their favorite from Nolan. Simply because this movie is a remake and while has many of Nolan's signature styles it is not as evident as it is in his other superior works IMHO.Nolan's movies from Following to Inception is built around the concept of duality. Insomnia has a similar theme running through it that of Al Pacino's character living the life of a honest rolemodel while still doing things reprehensible thus showing two sides of life. Al Pacino and Robin Williams are in supreme form and the cinematography by Wally Pfister is gorgeous. But the 'quickness' that is associated with other Nolan movies even BB is visibly absent in this one. It is by no means a bad movie but the slow burn of the thriller does dampen the effect. Not a must watch but an intriguing thriller that well matches its Swedish inspiration.".

You can't forget this one however because it sticks in your head and won't come out. The cinematography is superb and the lines are in several places quite unique and memorable. I will always remember at the end feeling Dormer's Pacino insomnia. Literally feeling it. And obviously I've been there. I once went eight whole days without a night's sleep. Don't ask me how but I did. And after that much sleeplessness it begins to mess with you. I have only seen about ten minutes of the original film on which this film is based not because I got bored and turned it off but because I didn't realize what I was watching. If I had I most certainly would have watched the whole thing. Robin Williams was an illogical but certainly credible deserved and welcome addition to this film and anyone who says he plays something other than what he actually plays didn't pay close attention. He is always good for an unexpected performance. Do yourself a favor study this film. Really study it. A true work of art if there ever was one on film.".

It takes a short while to get used to Robin in a serious role but it works so well. Pacino is worth the price of a ticket on his own too. He makes such a good cop because he is an experienced actor. Small town life here is worth noting with everyone knowing everyone else and complications don't exist. Life is predicable and repeats itself making you wonder if that is what everyone has in common who lives there? The entire little town seems to be fenced in with mountains but does have ferry boat waterway and sea plane access as well as long stretches of highway all scenic as a plus. I bet the air there is as clean as you can get it. Good movie to snack on as the story unfolds or have a sandwich ready to go with a tasty drink. One thing that bears noting is the way Pacino has trouble literally keeping his eyes open as he is acting out not being able to sleep for days.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is arguably one of the best murder mystery movies I have seen since Laura 1944 The Silence of the Lambs 1991 and many of Alfred Hitchcock's movies as well as being one of the best movies that Christopher Nolan ever directed as well as one of the police movies that I have ever seen. The movie stars Al Pacino as William Dormer a Los Angeles a detective on the force for 30 years and couldn't sleep whose partner is a young detective named Hap Eckhart Martin Donovan who are sent up to Alaska to help a local police department in a small town called Nightmute in order to solve the case of the murder of a teenage girl. As soon as Dormer and his partner arrive they meet a young police detective who happens to be a big fan of Detective Dormer's work named Ellie Burns Hilary Swank. Dormer also happens to be a good friend of the police chief there whose last name is Nyback Paul Dooley. As soon as they get there things start kicking up to speed the policemenwomen find the supposed killer in the fog but weren't able to get him and as a result Dormer's partner dies under strange circumstances. During that case Dormer meets a crime novelist named Walter Finch Robin Williams who claims that he killed the girl and that Dormer killed his partner. Pacino Williams and Swank really deserved Oscar nominations for their excellent work in this movie and it is also worth noting that Pacino played an LA cop in 1995's Heat that was another great performance but he had to deal with another acting titan in Robert De Niro.The movie isn't the best movie that Christopher Nolan directed but it is movies like this that are the reason why I consider him to be the modern version of Alfred Hitchcock Nolan would eventually direct great films like Batman Begins 2005 The Dark Knight 2008 Inception 2010 The Dark Knight Rises 2012 and Interstellar 2014 all of those films were masterpieces and this one is right up there with them. I was very impressed with this movie especially with Hillary Seitz's screenplay that wasn't adapted from anything but man did it work. The movie was brilliantly executed and is one of 2002's very best films.".

A movie directed by Christopher Nolan is a movie about a mysterious murder that in a remote town in Alaska lacks the resources in law enforcement to solve it so two detectives from Los Angelas are flown in to help solve it. Yeah so its a pretty basic who done it type movie besides the whole Alaska thing.But what I love about this movie is the realism that Christopher Nolan is famous for. Even before he was known for Batman his movies had that amazing look Nolan is famous for. The cinematography is incredible. Its like a travel brochure for Alaska! Its simply amazing. The story is great. It leaves you in suspense wondering whats going on but in a good way. And not to spoil anything but the reason its called INSOMNIA is its filmed in the part of summer where the sun never sets sort of the same as the movie 30 days of night. It just adds to the films allure.So if you like great crime movies in the Who done it genre and you haven't seen this flick? Where have you been!?! Its time to track this movie down and watch it. You will be in awe. Especially if you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's other work or like the actors Al Pacino Hilary Swank or Robin Williams.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem it seems for so many Miike viewers is that their expectations build up from viewing earlier films. And then they expect all of his films to meet those expectations. And then whine and bitch when he confounds them. Why can not you all accept each of his films on it's own terms? Why would you expect DOA 2 to be like DOA 1? If you do you don't know Miike and his approach to movie making.The DOA TRILOGY is it seems to me Miike's meditation on the relationship between seemingly opposing energetic masculine 'forces'. In the films these forces are characterized in various ways 'good''bad' 'light''dark' 'white''black' 'social''antisocial' policegangs Yakuzatriad bla bla bla. And in this respect the trilogy is a meditation on mantoman relations in general in our world today. In the first film like positive and negative electrons the personifications of these forces eventually annihilate one another in a cataclysmic explosion that destroys the planet that really messes with the audience's mind.In the second film the embodiment of these forces are brought back together to explore the possibility of their working together as a positive conjunction for a 'greater good'. They are also shown here to have originated from more or less the same source. Their relationship here is glossed with 'gay' overtones. A theme in more than a few of Miike's films. But it would seem that the 'world' is unable to accept such a relationship such a 'love' if you will and the world eventually hunts them down and destroys them. This inevitability suffuses the whole film with a melancholic dread. Even in the lightest and yes Funny moments you are aware that fate is stalking this AppolloDionysius pair relentlessly to bring them down. And of course the 'Furies' do descend on them in a bizarre contemporary incarnation only Miike would have been able to think of! and do destroy them. Though this time with a whisper and not a BANG. In musical terms DOA 2 can be seen as a kind of 'apache adagio' a dance of death.So many people commenting on Miike's films here talk about his 'slow' moods as if 'slow' is a bad word. If you are a speed freak then I guess 'slow' is a bad word in your vocabulary. But it is to Miike's credit that he so obviously understands that some of the more profound of human experiences are lived in 'slowmotion' and can only be expressed and appreciated artistically in that mode. One has only to see some of his filmed interviews to know just how much he appreciates the 'slow' and 'still' in human experience. He is after all the product of a Zen culture. The two protagonists Takeuchi  Aikawa obviously know they are doomed. So they are doing their utmost to genuinely savior their remaining days. Much of this time is spent in a lush verdant countryside rather than in the city. And we are given the opportunity to savior their experience with them at their own pace. If one will but go on the trip with them it is a delicious beautiful bittersweet painful sad trip you feel lucky to have been allowed to trail along on.I would characterize DOA 1 as being a trip for the groin and guts. DOA 2 as a trip for the heart. And DOA 3 as a trip for the mindintellect. It was a stroke of genius on Miike's part to realize that he could introduce 2 characters in one film. Kill them off at the end of it. And then reanimate them in a second and then a third film with more or less totally different stories. And still have all 3 films truly be about those 2 same characters. And do it in such a way that they only reach full development at the end of the third film. Undoubtedly DOA 1 is the best of the 3 films. And all 3 films can and do stand well on their own. But it is equally true that the WHOLE STORY only gets 'told' by the trilogy.".

However it more than makes up in subtlety  it's nuanced to the point of lyricism. Who would expect that Miike can spin a tale of a quest for the lost innocence of childhood soccer games in the rain sharing bowls of noodles on the ferry full turtlelion costumes for a kindergarten play and still sell it as a sequel to the yakuza audience? Yes you could read it as cheesy and boring but then again you could say the same about that other angel movie  'Wings of Desire'. The two characters follow the 'given a second chance at life' path blazing a trail of benevolent executions that add up to nothing. If 'DOA' is the incessant present with its avalanche of impressions updated at a rate high above the processing limit and 'DOA Final' is the ironic future of Malthusian power politics then 'DOA2' is the trip in the past at an impossibly high cost.".

Once again Miike masterfully blends a multitude of genres and uncompromisingly challenges his viewer. Dead or Alive 2 is at its core a humanistic drama which is definetely not what fans of the first one came to expect. Instead of choosing the easy way forward not that there was an easy way left after the first one and simply remaking the first movie he has changed everything to the delight and surprise of the viewer. In the beginning it appears to be simply another Yakuza flick with no connection to the first one except for Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi but quickly you realise that this is something completely different. It is a warm tale about childhood friendship and since everything is seen through childrens eyes the movie is filled with magic and wonderous moments leaving you truly uplifted and touched to the bottom of your soul.

	schema:headline " Another great movie from Takashi Miike";
	schema:reviewBody "Dead Or Alive 2 is a name only sequel to Takashi Miike's breakout Yakuza movie Dead Or Alive. Lead actors Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi made such a good impression together in the original that they just had to be brought back for another round but here they play different characters in far different circumstances in a movie that is very different from its predecessor. In fact it's pretty different from any other movie I can think of which is an accomplishment that Takashi Miike seems able to produce time and time again.The DVD case tries to sell the movie as an ultraviolent gross out pic which Takashi Miike is certainly capable of producing and which DOA 1 was to a degree. In fact this is rather a misrepresentation. There are a few scenes of violence and they are typically extreme but they are few and far between and really just serve as a backdrop for a fairly mannered and whimsical character driven drama.Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi grew up together in an orphanage on a remote Japanese island where they had good times and were the best of friends. But Show Aikawa is taken away to Osaka as a teen and the boys do not see each other until many years later when they are both grown men. They meet up again on the island where they grew up both on the run from the Yakuza. They chat play games and contemplate what life has made of them.DOA 2 has certain similarities with Takeshi Kitano's brilliant Sonatine as gangsters are forced to take Time Out in an idyllic location and regress towards childhood. Miike makes the movie his own though and the characters in particular stand out as unique and surprisingly likeable. The movie is usually billed as a comedy and there are many very funny moments but there's an underlying tenderness and melancholy behind it all too. It's a movie that definitely has the heart that Miike movies are sometimes unjustly accused of lacking.Show Aikawa undoubtedly steals the show from costar Riki Takeuchi this time around being far more animated and interesting. Takeuchi is brilliantly deadpan and stoic but that doesn't work as well for him in this movie as many of his others. Both actors make their characters believable and engage the audience in their fates well though. Look out for an absolutely brilliant cameo from director Shinya Tsukamoto too.DOA 2 is another uniquely Miike movie full of little moments and details that showcase that imagination and intellect which I dare say are unparalleled in modern cinema. It's a much less stylised movie than DOA 1 but probably more substantial probably more rewatchable. A highly recommended movie.".

I say this having not seen it for quite a while 'Gozu' is probably a better comedy and 'The Agitator' or 'Shinjuku Triad Society' are much better serious films.Also before trying to rip to shreds Asian movies like this Old Boy  others i think you guys should take the initial decision NOT TO WATCH THE FILMS IN THE FIRST PLACE and stick to the films that you know you will like...

Miike isn't out for easy answers anyway but after a sort of bizarre meditation on the loss of the innocence we all have in youth and how it can become uglier and without meaning.

Nostalgia comes back tenfold as they reunite with another old friend and Miike actually crafts sentimental scenes in this middle chunk that work somehow because they don't feel very cheap. Then as if trying to cleanse themselves of their old crimesyndicate ways they work at a playground helping out kids and they even put on a demented play involving goofy innuendo with Cinderella and various animals.This play scene is juxtaposed with the sprawling yakuzatriad warfare that breaks out back at home and it's here that Miike has not only for my money the best sequence of the film but one of his best sequences to date. The play Mizuzki Shu and the others put on is immature and a little crude but shown to be all the more innocent and playful when compared to the manic multiple murders that occur between the two gangs as bullets fly blood flows and bodies contort all over the place as neither side really comes out victorious or with many members left. It's Miike leashing out his wicked noholdsbarred style but also the goodness on the other side of the coin and it doesn't get much better for a fan like myself. On the other hand Dead or Alive 2 following this sequence gets weirder by the minute and sometimes not always for the best. With the focused narrative flow given for the MizukiShu story where they decide to come back to the mainland and keep going with their killings for money in unselfish reasons there's another subplot involving I'd guess the other killers out to kill them. But it comes off muddled and even with Miike going for enjoyably crazy images like a midget walking on stilts or the fate of a character named Jiro it suddenly felt as if Miike was getting off track of what was working best.But if anything DOA 2 tops the first one by delivering the goods on substance just as well as the style. Miike is always out for experimentation with his editing and transitions and usage of a symbolic intertitle Where are you Going. And isn't above getting some touching last scenes with Mizuki and Shu on the boat Takeuchi by the way is one of Miike's best actors even if it feels very sudden that could be forced by another director but through him feel compassionate to their doom. While Miike and his screenwriter don't quite get deep enough to make this a great film about lifelong criminal friends and he's still into getting laughs out of depraved acts of violence and bizarre sex i.e. that giant penis in a couple of scenes it's surely one of the better yakuza movies I've yet to see to go past its limitations and make it a movie where the main characters aren't just cardboard cutouts meant for shouting dialog and dying at a clip.".

	schema:headline " Miike has done it again";
	schema:reviewBody "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSMiike Takashi once again has surprised everyone. He has created a sequel that has nothing to do with its predecessor. The main characters are still played by the same actors Aikawa So and Takeuchi Riki but their roles are very different. Here they play long separated boyhood friends who meet again when Takeuchi assassinates a racketeer Aikawa has been hired to shoot. Wanted by the Japanese Yakuza and the Chinese Triad they returned to their hometown an island in the South of Japan. There they meet another long time friend Kohei played Endo Kenichi who is now married. Through flashbacks we get to know about their childhood which was spent in the local orphanage run by Japanese Christian priest. Contact with the present children of the orphanage makes them take the decision of going back to the main island and work as professional killers. The money they will get will be used to buy vaccines for the children in the Third World.There are only a couple of references to the first part. One happens when Aikawa surrounded by Chinese gangsters pulls out a brick from his back. The other during a play for the children of the orphanage where Aikawa dressed up as a kappa a mythical Japanese creature a hybrid between a man and a tortoise has a cyborg arm. These scenes recall the amazing ending of DOA.Compared to its predecessor DOA 2 birds is quite a light film to Miike Takashi's standards in its dealing of violence. Violence Miike Takashi's style doesn't appear until the second half of the film. Takashi has become a cult figure for taking violence to extremes and mixing it with dark humour. In Europe he has become immensely popular thanks to films like Audition the mention Dead Alive and pretty soon Ichi the Killer which I am sure will become a cult film soon. Even though Miike Takashi has said in many interviews he doesn't give much thought to his films that doesn't mean that they are just purely entertainment. What many seem to overlook maybe due to their fascination with violence is that Miike Takashi's films contain some interesting themes recognising the existence of certain attitudes. For example attitudes towards sex. In DOA was bestiality actually the making of those sort of films Shinjuku Triad Society abounds in gay sex Ichi the Killer and Audition deal with sadomasochism. In DOA 2 Birds we get a quick glimpse at necrophilia. Takashi acknowledges the existence of these sexual practices without criticising them whether perverse sexist or politically incorrectWhereas the beginning of DOA is a relentless bombardment of images of drugs sex and violence DOA 2 BIRDS opts for a milder opening. Tsukamoto Shinya uses Chinese and Japanese Mild Seven packets of cigarettes to dramatise the struggle between Chinese and Japanese gangs. Tsukamoto crushes cigarettes representing gangsters being mowed down. That was certainly a blow to those who expected an opening similar to DOA. It is very funny though.It is already known that Takashi likes challenging audiences and DOA 2 as said earlier is a good example. Another challenging sequence is the above mentioned children's play which is intercut with shots of a fight between Chinese and Japanese gangs this time for real. The play even tough for children is sexually explicit but absolutely hilarious too. The crosscutting between the fight and the play is so fast paced that you find yourself laughing at Aikawa displaying his penistorch or Takeuchi dressed up as lion masturbating at the same as heads are chopped off and rolling on the floor or a dead woman being raped. Takashi seems to be teasing the audience as they realise they are laughing and cannot stop at the carnage on the screen. This makes it a very uncomfortable sequence to watch but very clever too.Miike Takashi also seems to question the action of the hero when they decide to help children in the Third World and their recently gained status of angels another Takashi's surprises in the film. Takeuchi vomits blood continually. The more he kills the more he vomits. To save children they have to kill gangsters Aisakawa at one point says that the world is better off without them who were once children too. This is done in a brilliant sequence at the end of the film. There is a showdown on a rooftop between Aikawa and Takeuchi and three gunmen. Both heroes badly injured are lying on the ground and see how the 3 gunmen changed into children pointing guns at them. Takeuchi stills has the strength to shot them death. The scene ends with a shot of five children laying dead on the rooftop covered in blood. This is a brilliant persuasive sad and poetic metaphor of why there should not be any killing for any reason.Miike Takashi's films are not just entertaining but are loaded with ideas which might no be fully developed due to his attitude to his material but are nevertheless quite interesting and challenging.".

	schema:headline " Bursts of Miikelike violence punctuate  get this  a quietly moving film about friendship and nostalgia!";
	schema:reviewBody "Dead or Alive 1999 was a straight to video policeYakuza crossover that opened with a rockvideo style montage and climaxed with a scene of jawdropping implausibility. It took on the clichs and characteristics of the usual police dramas that we're familiar with but infused them with all manner of bold and brash directorial flourishes and much in the way of attention grabbing shock sequences from the sight of a stripper drowned in a paddling pool of excrement to a vicious gun battle that brings about the end of the world. This follow up  which takes the same lead actors from the first DOA and drops then into a whole new setting as entirely new characters giving us a sequel in the thematic sense alone  tones down much of the first film's explicit giddiness in favour of a richer story with humanity empathy and depth.As a result those new to the films of maverick director Miike Takashi might find this semisequelfollow up to be something of an understandable departure from the typically brash and attention grabbing style put forward in his more widely seen films such like Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q both 2001. Those with some familiarity however will be aware of Miike's more sensitive side from films like The Bird People in China 1998 Rainy Dog 1997 White Collar Worker Kintaro 2000 and the Great Yokai War 2005 which are certainly not troubling the 'Disney' studio when it comes to wholesome family entertainment but at least show Miike to be a filmmaker capable of blending his tendencies for overthetop action and cinematic excess alongside emotional depth and intelligent character development. Hell even parts of the violent Yakuza epic Agitator 2001 and the first hour of his masterpiece Audition 1999 show a director capable of dealing with fully formed threedimensional characters and a slowbuilding story that drags you in.Like those films Dead or Alive 2 offers bursts of the typical Miikelike violence to punctuate what is essentially a quietly moving film about friendship and nostalgia focusing as it does on the characters Mizuki Sho Aikawa and Sawada Riki Takeuchi childhood friends that grew up together in an idyllic island orphanage who find themselves after many years of not seeing each other hit men hired to assassinate the same man. What follows is a combination of routine Yakuza crime drama  as the inevitable gang war erupts between two warring factions of Yakuza looking for answers as to who sanctioned the hit and why?  and a lyrical coming of age story  as the two men eventually find their way back to the island where they first met and meet up with old friends and reminisce about days when life was much more simple. The juxtaposition between these two worlds is handled perfectly by Miike who shoots the film through the eyes of his child characters even when we're in the company of their adult counterparts. This gives us a film that is visually unique rich in colour and filled with surreal abstractions and overexaggerations some of which are disturbing in their darklycomic absurdity.Some of it aims to shock as much as the first DOA with one sequence showing dead bodies being molested by a couple of hoods while one sequence shows a dead body with an exaggeratedly large penis. Once again Miike indulges in his love of playing around with Japanese censorship issues ala Visitor Q and Agitator by partially blurring out the offending image which would have been enough to render the joke useless had the appendage in question not been the size of a tree trunk literally. The joke is repeated again during one of the film's key sequences in which Mizuki and Sawada entertain the kids at the orphanage with a slightly lewd and colourful pantomime performance that is intercut with an incredibly violent gun battle that erupts between the two warring gangs. Other scenes are just as memorable and less shocking such as the beautiful sequence in which Mizuki and Sawada spend the day with their old orphan friend Khei who has stayed on the island as a fisherman and now lives the good life with his childhood sweetheart Noriko climbing fences playing football and generally running wild in the rain.The later part of the film is more surreal and enigmatic with the duo returning to the mainland and becoming hit men for good taking down mob bosses and donating the money they steal to charity. They even grow angel's wings tying itself into an old childhood memory and relating to the birds of the title and envision themselves as children blowing away these corrupted grownups. The film even has a great supporting performance from cult Japanese film maker Shinya Tsukamoto Tetsuo Tokyo Fist A Snake of June as a magician who sets the wheels of the story in motion recalling his similar appearance in Miike's earlier film Ichi the Killer 2001. Dead or Alive 2 Birds for me takes everything that we love about Takashi Miike's particular style and combines it with a story that works and characters that we can believe in. This for me is easily the best of the DOA trilogy and a minormasterpiece to rank alongside the likes of Shinjuku Triad Society 1996 Audition 1999 Gozu 2003 Visitor Q 2001 and The Bird People in China 1996.".

What follows is a combination of routine Yakuza crime drama  as the inevitable gang war erupts between two warring factions of Yakuza looking for answers as to who sanctioned the hit and why?  and a lyrical coming of age story  as the two men eventually find their way back to the island where they first met and meet up with old friends and reminisce about days when life was much more simple. The juxtaposition between these two worlds is handled perfectly by Miike who shoots the film through the eyes of his child characters even when we're in the company of their adult counterparts. This gives us a film that is visually unique rich in colour and filled with surreal abstractions and overexaggerations some of which are disturbing in their darklycomic absurdity.Some of it aims to shock as much as the first DOA with one sequence showing dead bodies being molested by a couple of hoods while one sequence shows a dead body with an exaggeratedly large penis. Once again Miike indulges in his love of playing around with Japanese censorship issues ala Visitor Q and Agitator by partially blurring out the offending image which would have been enough to render the joke useless had the appendage in question not been the size of a tree trunk literally. The joke is repeated again during one of the film's key sequences in which Mizuki and Sawada entertain the kids at the orphanage with a slightly lewd and colourful pantomime performance that is intercut with an incredibly violent gun battle that erupts between the two warring gangs. Other scenes are just as memorable and less shocking such as the beautiful sequence in which Mizuki and Sawada spend the day with their old orphan friend Khei who has stayed on the island as a fisherman and now lives the good life with his childhood sweetheart Noriko climbing fences playing football and generally running wild in the rain.The later part of the film is more surreal and enigmatic with the duo returning to the mainland and becoming hit men for good taking down mob bosses and donating the money they steal to charity. They even grow angel's wings tying itself into an old childhood memory and relating to the birds of the title and envision themselves as children blowing away these corrupted grownups. The film even has a great supporting performance from cult Japanese film maker Shinya Tsukamoto Tetsuo Tokyo Fist A Snake of June as a magician who sets the wheels of the story in motion recalling his similar appearance in Miike's earlier film Ichi the Killer 2001. Dead or Alive 2 Birds for me takes everything that we love about Takashi Miike's particular style and combines it with a story that works and characters that we can believe in. This for me is easily the best of the DOA trilogy and a minormasterpiece to rank alongside the likes of Shinjuku Triad Society 1996 Audition 1999 Gozu 2003 Visitor Q 2001 and The Bird People in China 1996.";

	schema:reviewBody "The best way to describe Miike Takashi's style would be Don't expect anything. It's not even Expect the unexpected because most of the things we don't expect...are somewhat expected simply because it's hard to fathom what we haven't seen before that we would actually WANT to see. Who wants to actually see necrophilia in a film? Who wants to actually see children being subjected to enough sexual innuendo to give Mary Whitehouse a heart attack? Who wants to see a person left for dead and eaten away by flies? Nobody really thinks about those things so even when people tell us to expect the unexpected there are certain things we won't even consider. This gives Miike the perfect opportunity to completely screw with the audience's preconceptions on what is and is not acceptable in film. I stated in a review of Dead or Alive Hanzaisha that Miike's use of shocking imagery plays with the audience not only by the shock itself but by the banality of it. The characters in his films have little or no reaction much of the bizarre and crazy things that are happening around them. Their indifference translates to us in a sense...so what should be shocking becomes less shocking and more confusing...and sometimes the confusion wears off too to the point where we don't care it's just par for the course. And in Miike's world it is.So here we have a sequel that is not really a sequel at least not literally. Dead or Alive 2 Tbsha begins completely differently from its predecessor so immediately the audience is confused. We thought we had Miike or at least the Dead or Alive formula figured out right? Wrong here we begin not with a frenetic ultraviolent intro we have a humorous little scenario about Chinese Triads vs. Japanese Yakuza being explained to hitman Otamoko Mizuki Aikawa Sho now sporting blond hair by a magician Tetsuo director Tsukamoto Shinya turning out a funny little cameo. Just as Mizuki is about to pull a hit his job's done for him by one of the target's henchmen. He finds out that it was his childhood friend Sawada Shuichi. What ensues is a slowpaced trip down memory lane as the two return to the place where they grew up meet up with another friend who stayed behind and rediscover the innocence they lost so quickly. The two decide to return to Tokyo to pull off hits together donating all their profits to vaccinate children in thirdworld nations.Like the first film Dead or Alive 2 Tbsha has a great deal of slowpacing with a great deal of beautiful scenery similar to Kitano Beat Takeshi's Sonatine. While the action is not entirely lacking it does not have the frenetic pace and hipbizareness of Dead or Alive Hanzaisha. Instead action scenes are played with a great deal of symbolism. There is a scene of a YakuzaTriad gang war being interspersed with scenes of Mizuki and Shuichi performing a play for children which is hilarious considering the abundant sexual innuendo in the play but nobody apart from the players seems to get it...and the kids love it. There is a recurring motif of seeing the main characters as both adults and the children they once were with the phrase Where are you? popping up occasionally. In the confusing almost David Lynchlike ending it changes to Where are you going? Does violence beget violence? Is innocence truly lost when we grow up? And is it ever truly too late to get it back?Thematically it's similar to Dead or Alive Hanzaisha with both beckoning the question of what is acceptable and unacceptable in human behavior and is there ever a point to give up? The recurring element in both movies is that of whether or not to quit. The question seems to be answered with a resounding no. None of the characters quit and in the end it ultimately destroys them for better or for worse. Is Dead or Alive 2 Tbsha any less confusing and any less what the hell? then its prequel? No but while one relies on ultraviolence and attitude the second one relies on emotions and symbolism. Two different approaches to what ultimately are the same themes. Aside from this and the actors there's not much of a connection between the first and second Dead or Alive films but...hey it's thoughtful storytelling Miikestyle.".

	schema:reviewBody "Boy that Miike never makes the same movie twice! An amazingly prolific 4050 movies and counting! and innovative director he continues to surprise with this his sequel to his loveitorhateit 'Dead Or Alive'. The first surprise is despite the title it has absolutely no relation to the first movie so each can be viewed completely independently of the other. It does feature the same two main actors Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi but they are playing totally different characters. The second surprise is the movie itself which is not only vastly different from 'Dead Or Alive' but is pretty freakin' far out in itself! But this is Miike World and if you are even vaguely familiar with his work you know to expect the unexpected! I must admit my first viewing of 'Dead Or Alive' threw me for a loop and I found it very difficult to come to terms with it. But a subsequent viewing and seeing 'City Of The Lost Souls' has got me more into Miike's groove and I think helped prepare me for whatever was in store. Aikawa and Takeuchi play hitmen who grew up together as orphans. Not having seen each other since childhood they don't realise that their lives have taken similar paths until they are both hired to kill the same person. The consequence of that hit is that they both end up on the run caught between the Yakuza and the Triads and independently return to their childhood home where they rekindle their friendship. After an idyllic catching up period a section of the movie which gets it compared to Beat Takeshi's 'Sonantine' a movie it only superficially resembles the two decide to combine forces and use their earnings as assassins for hire to help starving and sick children worldwide!. Now this is just the half of it! To attempt to describe 'Dead Or Alive 2' is a waste of time it has to be seen to believed! All I can say is whatever you think of Miike he is a true original and is currently doing things that NOBODY else anywhere is doing. He just doesn't play by the same set of rules as everybody else. Now sometimes this means the results aren't exactly to my taste but I still respect him for trying to be innovative and unpredictable and whether he succeeds or fails I recommend his movies wholeheartedly. 'Dead Or Alive 2' is a pretty good jumping on point for beginners His modern horror classic 'Audition' is his most satisfying movie but much more conventional than most of his work so hardly representative. P.S. I loved 'Tetsuo' director Shinya Tsukamoto's cameo as an eccentric magician in the opening scenes!".

	schema:headline " One of Takashi Miike's most realistic nostalgic and appeasing movies";
	schema:reviewBody "Just like Rainy Dog the second instalment in Takashi Miike's Black Society trilogy the second part of Dead or Alive is the most introspective part of the trilogy. It's essentially a drama carried by two superb lead actors with Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi who develop great chemistry on screen elaborates on the characters' identities in a harmonious and nostalgic vibe and features exotic natural landscapes on a remote island that contrast the big city life and define the smooth atmosphere of this movie. The movie is surprisingly relaxing for a Takashi Miike film without getting completely rid of the filmmaker's quirky trademark scenes. The brief moments of violence and sexual innuendo are probably even more efficient because they are quite short and concise this time.Dead or Alive 2 Birds opens and closes with Takashi Miike's excessive action sequences but the main part of this film focuses on the character development of two contract killers who realize they have grown up together and been childhood friends and who decide to work as a team for a good cause in order to rid the world of pitiless criminals and donate their money to buy vaccines for children in developing countries. Aside of the facts that both movies focus on Japanese crime syndicates and its associates and that both movies feature the same main actors this film is completely different from the first movie in terms of atmosphere characters and story. Aside of a few experiments with flashbacks and some minor religious symbolism this is also one of Takashi Miike's most realistic movies.It's possible to dismiss the quirky first part and adore the more mature second part but it wouldn't be surprising to dislike the first movie for its exaggeration and the second one for its realism. Personally I appreciate both movies for what they are but have a preference for the first part because I thought it was addicting from start to finish while the second instalment had a few minor length in the middle section. Takashi Miike fans should watch and purchase all three parts of the excellent Dead or Alive trilogy anyway.".

	onyx:emotionText "Just like Rainy Dog the second instalment in Takashi Miike's Black Society trilogy the second part of Dead or Alive is the most introspective part of the trilogy. It's essentially a drama carried by two superb lead actors with Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi who develop great chemistry on screen elaborates on the characters' identities in a harmonious and nostalgic vibe and features exotic natural landscapes on a remote island that contrast the big city life and define the smooth atmosphere of this movie. The movie is surprisingly relaxing for a Takashi Miike film without getting completely rid of the filmmaker's quirky trademark scenes.

After reflecting on their past lives they decide to team up and use their talents in killing for good... upsetting the crime syndicates they used to work for.This film is far sillier than the first with special effects that make this have almost science fiction qualities which were absent from part one other than the final shot and maybe a few minutes leading up to that. Is it supposed to be a fantasy of sorts? With Miike you never really know.Perhaps the most bizarre fantasy element in the entire film is the inclusion of footage of starving African children. Apparently this is to symbolize that by taking on the bad guys those in need will now be saved. This is of course pretty much nonsense if you think killing a mob boss somehow helps starving children in Africa. And using actual footage rather than actors seems a bit insensitive. But again Miike does not really concern himself with making sure his audience is not offended.Dead or Alive 2 is a sequel in name only with its only obvious connection to the first film being the return of the lead actors. Because they are playing different roles it does not seem to make sense to give this film the same title. But Tom Mes does find there to be a thematic connection. As he notes The ethnic rootlessness... is replaced here by the genealogical rootlessness of the orphaned child. True enough though with rootlessness being a common Miike theme this does not make the Dead or Alive series unique in that way.Although Arrow Video had Tom Mes record commentary for all three Black Society films and the first Dead or Alive he mysteriously does not provide commentary on parts two and three of Dead or Alive. In fact the special features seem to be primarily focused on the first film which is a bit of a shame even if we can all agree it is the most iconic of the series.".

'Almost' for Miike does entail having sex with corpses children plays with fake dildos or horribly disfigured faces so it does offer its share of unabashed brutality. Nonetheless unlike the first part which was channelling the story with a plethora of ideas dark humour and violence this time around we get a more sombre character story revolving around two killers Mizuki Okamoto Sh Aikawa and Shuuichi Sawada Riki Takeuchi.On a highly paid job to kill a Yakuza boss in order to initiate a Yakuza  Triad gang was Mizuki is surprisingly cut to the chase by Shu a former friend with whom he grew up with on a remote island orphanage. No harm done no love lost the two reunite and travel down to where they used to be best buds to take time out from grim reality and delve in picturesque countryside locations.For a movie featuring cartoonish gags like pulling out an enormous brick from behind your back DOA Birds belies all expectations creating in the opening act when it slowly transgresses from being a yakuza thriller to a buddy flick drama with surprising emotional pull. Albeit based on an overly convoluted somewhat symbolic script which makes repeated watches almost a necessity it builds relations between characters much better than almost any Miike movie. Both Mizuki and Shu are less of a joke and more true dramatic protagonists even if Miike is unable to refrain from some goofing around much appreciated and surprisingly tactfully done. Nonetheless the elements of gore and blood do seem out of place and forced as if the director's style got the better of him and he was unable to refrain from adding a couple odd borderline scenes.As the first part saw the world destroyed when opposing forces collide this time around the black and white birds cooperate with other at one time killing evil by performing evil for the benefit of doing good a minus and a minus make a plus? eventually garnering the status of avenging angels. Even they however are not invincible when furious adversaries bring death but unlike in the first part death is more heartfelt cathartic and meaningful also due to deep relations between the dying men. The shootout finale is especially gripping  a shot of five corpses of boys lying dead on a rooftop suggesting that violence is nothing more than childish behaviour by lost grownups necessary but so banale and basic in nature. A telling broader explanation to the reasons between Miike's graphic comic and cartoon influenced grotesque brutality? Nonetheless much lighter in tone poetic and more emotional than the other DOA movies and the absurdist dramatism may make it the best of the trilogy contentwise even if severely flawed with certain aspects of its presentation.".

	schema:reviewBody "You'd be hard pressed to find a sequel more different than the original than DOA 2 Birds. It is not connected with the original in terms of plot although the same actors reprise similar roles. It reminds of the style of the original in certain places however it's overall a sweeter more heartwarming movie embedded with sudden bursts of violence. The plot is simple but very effective. Two hit men find themselves on the run after doing a hit on a local yakuza family. It turns out they are actually childhood friends and they go back to the island they grew up to hide from the police and vengeful yakuzas that are looking for them. The first half of the movie is startlingly peaceful coming from Miike of all people carrying a sweet air of nostalgia as the yakuzas revert back to a state of childhood fooling around like they used to when they were kids. Flashback shots only add to the touching humane feeling. Loss of innocence can be a very manipulative theme but it is in very good hands here as Miike pulls it off surprisingly well.But seeing as this is a Miike film violence and psychotronic weirdness can't be totally absent now can it? Of course not. There are sudden bursts of violence that become all the more chilling as they are juxtaposed with the serene feeling that precedes them. Intercutting is used to great effect in a scene where Miike cuts back and forth between a bloodbath shootout between yakuzas and Chinese triads and the two hit men performing in a small stageplay for children back at their island. There's almost a surreal quality to it as we see Riki Takeuchi bumping around in a big lion suit.I have to say that Miike had the opportunity to make a great drama at the point where the true identity of the two hit men is discover by the pregnant wife of their childhood friend. But Miike being Miike he simply refuses to play it straight. Instead the second half of the film is weirder more confused and slightly confusing in tone but goes the extra mile to add to what makes DOA2 such a unique experience. Certain scenes such as a Mexican standoff that involves a midget and three hired goons that only communicate with each other through cell phones are as mindboggling as they are awesome. Or what about the wife that discovers her TV star husband dead and hugs his giant penis it's pixilated so prudes have nothing to worry about with forlorn sadness? And I haven't even mentioned our two hit men donating the money they get from whacking people to pay for vaccines for children in Africa. In the end it's Miike through and through.If the comparison has to be made the verdict is that DOA2 is simply different than its predecessor. Personally speaking I enjoyed it slightly more. It lacks the anything goes insanity of the first but makes up for it in other ways. There IS action to be found it's just not the main attraction. Instead it's a weird poignant touching occasionally violent film aimed more at the heart and soul than the gut.".

That a bank robbery resulted in the death of a guard has made the revolutionaries fugitives from murder charges.This political thriller in which the FBI has finally zeroed in on the robbers because Sharon Solarz Susan Sarandon has decided to turn herself in devolves into a formulaic chase with helicopters and frantic cell calls but along the way has some engaging dialogue Yeah we all died. Some of us just came back. Donal Fitzgerald played by Nick Nolte often given in the repartee style of screwball comedy without the comedy.I am most surprised at director Redford's political restraint given his inclination to preach baldly in previous films and in his personal life. The Company You Keep smoothly combines the pacing of a race for survival with the consciousness of a moderate liberal trying to show the unglamorous effects of sins like excessive ambition and murder over a lifetime. In its favor the film does not overdo its sympathy for the kids of these radicals although Brit Marling as Rebecca Osborne would make anyone cry over her so innocentlooking she is.While the film tends to emphasize the personal effects on lovers and families to the exclusion of the Weatherman history it still is instructive about the radical movements decades ago. Although the theme of the ramifications of keeping a secret are parsed by Grant in a toocontrived monologue the point is well taken for each secret revealed adds another layer of punishment for all even children.If Redford weren't so wrapped up in nostalgia and stuck to the hardcore reasons for some very bright people's stupidity this could have been a soaring achievement of documenting history in dramatic form. As it is it's a smart thriller that has some lessons both political and personal for all the audience.".

It is sort of a retrospective of an activist's two lives  one he abandoned once he crossed the line the other the stolen life he built afterward. There is a price one pays to the public through the court system. There is also a private price or a personal price one also pays. In both casesthe focus is more on the private price he foisted off on loved ones to avoid paying his public price for his acts.The reader must understand that Sloan was guilty of some felony activities but NOT the murder of the bank guard. His crimes if caught were worth some jail time but not a life sentence for murder.People should watch this just so they could consider the idea that actions they might start can easily spin out of control leaving them with consequences they might be forced to live with for the rest of their life and MORE IMPORTANTLY exact an even worse price upon all their loved ones.This is a VERY tightly packed movie hardly a word that isn't important to the development of the plot. Watch it closely. This movie does need a bit more tension and rage at one particular point but that's about the biggest flaw I saw.Just so you know Redford 76 is playing the role of a late 60 yearold and there are very important reasons why he has a young daughter. Now it is up to you to see this film and figure out why.By the way this movie has a lot of great talent in it and they each do very well for themselves and the presentation of the movie's theme.

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Redford stars with a wonderful cast of golden oldies in The Company You Keep a 2012 film.Redford plays Jim Grant an attorney and widower who is contacted by a friend to help a former activist Susan Sarandon. Now a housewife she has just been arrested for the murder of a bank guard during a robbery many years earlier. At that time she was a member of the notorious underground Weathermen group which protested the Vietnam war the killings at Kent State and were part of the violence and chaos of the time. She was intending to turn herself in but the FBI got to her first.Grant says he can't help but that puts an ambitious reporter Ben Shepard Shia LeBoeuf onto him. It doesn't take long for Shepard to find out that Jim Grant is in reality Nick Sloan part of the Weathermen who has changed his identity. GrantSloan goes on the run leaving his 11yearold daughter with his brother Chris Cooper. This tells the reporter that Sloan is not intending to go underground and take on a new identity or he would have taken his daughter. Shepard thinks that Sloan is thing to clear his name once and for all and is trying to locate other Weathermen in order to help him.The cast includes besides those listed above Julie Christie Stanley Tucci Sam Elliot Nick Nolte and Brit Marling.I had two major problems with this film which was actually good if not terribly suspenseful. The first is I was around during the era talked about in the film and the second thing is I remember what Robert Redford used to look like.This film I believe is supposed to take place in the present day yet everyone talks about these events that occurred thirty years ago. Well not to be picky but thirty years ago is what 1981 since the film was made in 2011. Youthful uprisings protests against Vietnam the Kent State killings  I'm sorry those happened 4045 years ago. What happened thirty years ago? Dynasty. Ebony and Ivory. Diana and Charles got engaged. Reagan.The second issue I had is this Susan Sarandon Richard Jenkins and Stephen Root were the right age to play aging hippies so is Chris Cooper but he didn't play one Christie I could buy  first of all she's fabulously beautiful and doesn't look her age  and secondly her character was a Jane Fonda type so she would have been active in her early thirties as the character still was an activist. Nick Nolte  I'm not totally convinced that his character was an activist in his late twenties and thirties.But Robert Redford is 76. Now I've read where people think he looks good. I think he looks every millisecond of 76. He's obviously supposed to be playing someone 10 years younger and to me he doesn't pull it off. And the 11yearold daughter  I find that interesting. They cast women as mothers who in real life are one year older than the person playing their sons but no one blinks when Redford or Eastwood have children under ten.Unfortunately those distractions took away from this film for me. If I hadn't lived through that time I could have gotten into it more. I admire Robert Redford I like that he does this type of film but he needs a small reality check. He wasn't a hippie then and he's not an aging hippie now.".

Shepard thinks that Sloan is thing to clear his name once and for all and is trying to locate other Weathermen in order to help him.The cast includes besides those listed above Julie Christie Stanley Tucci Sam Elliot Nick Nolte and Brit Marling.I had two major problems with this film which was actually good if not terribly suspenseful. The first is I was around during the era talked about in the film and the second thing is I remember what Robert Redford used to look like.This film I believe is supposed to take place in the present day yet everyone talks about these events that occurred thirty years ago. Well not to be picky but thirty years ago is what 1981 since the film was made in 2011. Youthful uprisings protests against Vietnam the Kent State killings  I'm sorry those happened 4045 years ago. What happened thirty years ago? Dynasty. Ebony and Ivory. Diana and Charles got engaged. Reagan.The second issue I had is this Susan Sarandon Richard Jenkins and Stephen Root were the right age to play aging hippies so is Chris Cooper but he didn't play one Christie I could buy  first of all she's fabulously beautiful and doesn't look her age  and secondly her character was a Jane Fonda type so she would have been active in her early thirties as the character still was an activist. Nick Nolte  I'm not totally convinced that his character was an activist in his late twenties and thirties.But Robert Redford is 76. Now I've read where people think he looks good. I think he looks every millisecond of 76. He's obviously supposed to be playing someone 10 years younger and to me he doesn't pull it off. And the 11yearold daughter  I find that interesting. They cast women as mothers who in real life are one year older than the person playing their sons but no one blinks when Redford or Eastwood have children under ten.Unfortunately those distractions took away from this film for me. If I hadn't lived through that time I could have gotten into it more. I admire Robert Redford I like that he does this type of film but he needs a small reality check. He wasn't a hippie then and he's not an aging hippie now.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Company You Keep has a startlingly starstudded cast and I was surprised to see that most of them were in small thankless roles. People like Sam Elliott Nick Nolte Chris Cooper and Stanley Tucci have a couple three scenes at most and aren't given much of anything to sink their teeth into. What I think this suggests is an immense respect for Robert Redford  there are very few directors who could assemble actors of that caliber for roles that probably anyone could play. And that respect is merited  with Company Redford proves once again that he is an exceptionally talented director who deserves to be taken more seriously than he is. It begins with the abrupt arrest of Sharon Solarz Susan Sarandon an American terrorist who had been living in hiding for decades since she was connected to a robbery that resulted in the murder of a security guard. Her arrest sparks renewed interest in the case and as a reporter Shia LaBeouf starts to dig deeper a lawyer and newly single father Robert Redford realizes he is about to be uncovered and flees leaving his daughter to stay with his younger brother Chris Cooper while he searches for an unknown something. The foundation of Company is a clever taut screenplay reminiscent of classic 70's American thrillers. It shocks the audience with reveal after reveal always bringing up more questions and arousing more suspicions but does so without a hint of selfimportance and gracefully avoids inflated tension. Redford's graceful direction brings the electric writing to life and creates a suitably foreboding atmosphere  it's gritty but not too dark fastpaced but not so much that it sacrifices plot or character emotional but not saccharine. For such an outlandish plot Redford makes it feel as real as it possibly could. Too many modern thrillers like this try to make every beat into a high emotion scene or build around the twist so it's as dramatic as possibly. Company avoids that  there is a refreshing lack of forced grandeur and in its wake we get a surprisingly intimate film filled with truly fascinating characters and provocative moral questions that the screenplay doesn't answer for us. The cast as expected are uniformly excellent. If there is a weak link it's Shia LeBeouf whose reallife smug vanity suits the character but can only carry him so far when he's up against acting titans. He seems amateurish in his oneonone scenes with Redford and Sarandon even though neither of them give especially domineering performances. Redford is an appropriately sympathetic lead but the supporting actors steal the movie  Susan Sarandon sets the bar very high right from the off. In her two or three short scenes she reveals everything about her secretive stony character her microexpressions tell all. Cooper Nick Nolte Sam Elliott and Richard Jenkins light up their segments with their presences alone while Brendan Gleeson delivers a hauntingly conflicted portrayal. Julie Christie though is the standout. If this has to be her last screen appearance it's comforting to know that she went out with a loud bang playing a character so unlike anything she's ever done before. Her Mimi is ferocious and spirited but her steely conviction can't quite mask the naive little girl who never really grew up hiding underneath. She communicates a world of internal conflict with a simple raise of her eyebrows a pang of regret merely by letting her mouth fall open she's a master of her craft fully realizing her character in maybe 15 minutes of screen time where most of her lines hit the same note. If there's one problem with the movie it's that it's too short. A significant plot point towards the end isn't given the time and attention it deserves considering its weight and implications. It felt like a wasted opportunity for an amazing thematically fathomsdeep ending. However the ending as it is is satisfying and welldone nonetheless and cleanly wraps up an expertly crafted breath of fresh air for the genre. If only it had come out 35 years ago where it would have been right at home and probably would have garnered a better reception.".

The premise here is compelling members of the Weather Underground who are accused of murder after what appears to have been a bungled bank robbery have gone to ground have built lives with varying degrees of success and respectability only to have it all reopened years later when one of them decides to turn herself in. An earnest young reporter at a small newspaper is given or seizes the opportunity to dig into the story and finds out more than he bargained for.There are several problems though. For one the film pulls its main punch and telegraphs that move so early on that the natural tension is never allowed to build. I know that Redford is an oldfashioned movie star and the prospect of his having actually been guilty is perhaps just not in the cards but knowing this in the first few minutes makes the rest of the story rather unsuspenseful. Instead of wondering whether this frankly rather dull single father really did what he was accused of we are left with watching him try to exonerate himself in a crosscountry odyssey that is implausible and often tedious.To be sure there are some fine performances. The scene between Susan Sarandon and Shia LaBeouf in prison as she tries with only limited success to explain herself to a sceptical and ambitious young journalist from such a different era is very convincing.Redford himself though does not really command our attention or interest. If you're going to star in your own movie you should be sure that you really are the best choice for the role. At the age of 76 and yes despite being fit and well put together he really does look his age Redford is at least ten years older than his role would demand. And he has a 12 year old daughter!Moreover he fails to infuse the role with any real passion. Now raw emotion has never been Redford's strong suit. He is just too cool for that. But here is a role that really calls out for something other than his typical calculated rational nice guy approach.As a director Redford is more successful. For movie buffs it's fun to watch the train scene for example how many directors have train scenes anymore? which pays homage to some of the great train scenes from older suspense films like North by Northwest.With this subject matter The Company You Keep could have been an edgy and provocative political thriller with a resonance that makes connections between the student terrorism of the 1970's and the burning economic and social issues of today. The fact is that many of the same underlying problems that led to the formation of the Weathermen  foreign military involvement economic disparities reactionary social policies  remain with us. Instead however the film never really brings itself to confront these issues except in the most oblique and politically correct fashion. It is an opportunity squandered.".

Grant entrusts his daughter to his brother played by Chris Cooper whilst FBI agent played by Terrence Howard is hot on his heels. Shepard suspects Grant is not guilty of the charges but the reporter's quest for the truth unravels secrets Grant has kept for very personal reasons.

	schema:reviewBody "I've just watched the DVD and I have to say I'm puzzled by the description of the film as a thriller by some of the reviews I had read. I was expecting something much better than what the film delivered. It's a very flat movie and that seems to be the fault of script performances and editing. It has the odour of high art film making sententious and vacuous by turns. Let this be a lesson unto you... and The past isn't another country... Ponderous! Particularly I found Shia LeBeouf's performance as the young reporter rather too brighteyed and perky. The character lacked a sense of the growing excitement I would have expected as he started to understand the history of the people he's investigating and as he drew closer to his quarry. It's a very Johnny onenote performance  no development. I was increasingly irritated by a mannerism  his repetitive touching the bridge of his glasses. And why the glasses? So he could deliver the character defining mannerism? I was shocked when I first saw Julie Christie's character appear. I had difficulty in recognizing her. The immediate thought was that plastic surgery is not always a wise choice with a good result. I simply focused on the face and found it impossibly to see the character in the film. It disrupted the movie for me. And the performance was as featureless as the face. At least Susan Sarandon appears to have bypassed on facial reconstruction and with little to do did it well.Redford was simply too old for the part he played. And the final scene as he walked away from the camera with his adopted daughter was very mechanical  the waving hand gestures.All of these actors have been better in other films. Not a must see.kamagla".

I was expecting something much better than what the film delivered. It's a very flat movie and that seems to be the fault of script performances and editing. It has the odour of high art film making sententious and vacuous by turns. Let this be a lesson unto you... and The past isn't another country... Ponderous! Particularly I found Shia LeBeouf's performance as the young reporter rather too brighteyed and perky. The character lacked a sense of the growing excitement I would have expected as he started to understand the history of the people he's investigating and as he drew closer to his quarry. It's a very Johnny onenote performance  no development. I was increasingly irritated by a mannerism  his repetitive touching the bridge of his glasses. And why the glasses? So he could deliver the character defining mannerism? I was shocked when I first saw Julie Christie's character appear. I had difficulty in recognizing her. The immediate thought was that plastic surgery is not always a wise choice with a good result. I simply focused on the face and found it impossibly to see the character in the film. It disrupted the movie for me. And the performance was as featureless as the face. At least Susan Sarandon appears to have bypassed on facial reconstruction and with little to do did it well.Redford was simply too old for the part he played. And the final scene as he walked away from the camera with his adopted daughter was very mechanical  the waving hand gestures.All of these actors have been better in other films. Not a must see.kamagla";

Group members of a radical organization from the 70s living a life with new identities for the last 30 years have to face their past crimes when one of its members surrenders to the authorities. It focuses on Robert Redford's character Jim Grant a single father with a 12 year old daughter who makes a run for it to clear his name from an alleged bank heist and subsequent murder and avoid getting caught at the same time. With some characters being introduced too late in the story it is hard to care or give a damn about the situation in general. As far as the story goes things just fall into place too easily without any interesting obstacles. The main character being on the run or even the reporter's investigation for that matter is just too convenient. I would have personally liked to see more of Susan Sarandon's character her back story what drives her to surrender to the authorities after 30 years and why. Her character is the main catalyst that sets the events in motion but without knowing or understanding her relation to the main character besides the bank heist and what's really at stake it just seems pointless. 125 minutes was too long for this movie especially considering it was just a waste of time. By the end of it I frankly just didn't care.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the Ghent filmfestival 2012. It was not part of the official selection nor the official competition section but rather put in a miscellaneous section called Previews.A considerable part of the story line is about the contrast between a resourceful young journalist who finds out interesting things on his own devices compared with the FBI continuously running behind the facts. Both stories run in parallel thereby creating some weak form of tension but not too much while it is obvious that the eager journalist will win the race eventually. We've seen a plot model like this many times before and variants thereof in the form of an amateur detective versus the police. In other words not very original but it works here only to a certain degree. Some of the time I even found it a bit of a stretch wondering why the young journalist had so much luck in his discoveries.A more interesting topic is how the past comes back to bite our main character. In his younger years when the underground movement where he belonged to undertook several illegal actions each participant could depend on the others to keep things secret. The antiVietnam movement as of 30 years ago probably will not ring a bell with most modern viewers failing to appreciate how radical some such actions were at the time. It went much further than the rather peaceful movements we saw recently like Occupy and the like. In other words we would call them terrorists nowadays. Placing bombs and killing adversaries were tools of the trade when deemed necessary in view of the greater good.Our main character Jim Grant played by Robert Redford starring in his own movie has a new identity since a failed bank robbery where people were killed and video images suggest that Jim shot someone in the process. An eager young journalist happens to unravel some loose ends and partly finds out what has been hidden for more than 30 years. This starts two parallel chases after Jim one by the journalist Ben Shepard and an other one by the FBI. Most of the time we see the FBI always behind the facts might be construed as intentional satire. The route Jim follows as a fugitive looks random at first sight but in fact rounds up a series of former team members to find out who really did the killing he is still accused of. For spoiler's sake I won't go further with summarizing the story line. The basic ingredients can be derived from the above.All in all I found a lot to be desired for a movie labeled thriller. Indeed there is a reasonable amount of tension throughout where one wonders what will happen next. However I saw several things happen that seem far fetched too much for my taste. That applies to Jim's route he follows as a refugee as well as the hunt by journalist Ben. Both are running far too smooth a bit unrealistic given the circumstances. When one looks for a thriller deservedly labeled as such I can think of several better choices.".

The lady in question was 98 years old and going strong. When the subject of Robert Redford popped up she paused as if considering for a moment some complex Newtonian equation and then confided in me shyly he doesn't look the way he used to. Truth is none of us do. Truth is I can claim to have seen every major film starring Redford over the last 50 years except THE WAY WE WERE. And I have tried to watch that one on a few occasions but it aggravates my diabetes. And I don't have diabetes. Anyway going into this film produced directed and starring the almost 80 year old Redford you need to know that this man is considered a deity by many in the industry and his Rolodex is more prized than any at the 3 letter agencies. When Bob Redford sets out to make a film he picks his cast with the same care and precision that Mr. Phelps did in the old Mission Impossible series. Because he has access to just about everyone. Typical of the man THE COMPANY YOU KEEP is subtle and seemingly underwhelming  which explains the toolow IMDb rating. But the film does something that many name studio projects can't manage even with a budget 10x what this costs. It engages. You start the story with Redford and lo two hours later you end it with him. And you don't get bored not even once. And you part company amicably. The old codger can move like a 20 year old when he wants to and it is not much of a spoiler to tell you that for much of the film he is on the run  literally  and setting a pace to avoid capture that would test a man onequarter his age. And even better he sells it the vitality the mobility without CGI. Impressive. Shia Labeouf has done some impressive work since he left the Disney channel not counting Transformers which was just a guilty pleasure but in this picture he achieves a startling amount of audience impact from again a very understated performance. Whether this film attracts a crowd or cult is not the issue. The issue is that Redford once again wanted to show the young upstarts what filmmaking is supposed to be what it can be and once again he has succeeded.".

Hollywood obviously believes length is important if you want to be successful. Entertaining as it was I'm not so sure it was plot that kept me watching as much as the parade of veteran actors on display. A rather disparaging comment and maybe one that should have been reserved for the confusing historical context of the storyline itself. Being of an age that remembers the activities of the Weather Underground I was under the impression that their acts of terrorism had ceased by the time the Vietnam peace agreement was signed in 1973 since the Vietnam War had been the organisation's raison d'etre but in this film the Weather Men are still on a mission as we approach 1980. The film also has amusing parallels with another piece of Redford leftwing theatre 'The Way we were'. In this 1973 film the Redford character a talented screen writer backs away from confrontation with the Communist witchhunt in Hollywood and seeks respectability by compromising his ability and forsaking the woman he loves in the process. His 2012 alta ego also loses his passion for the cause and sacrifices love and a daughter by walking away 'I grew up'. In both films Redford played people much younger than himself. I'm not sure what this says about Robert Redford but I think my wife summed it up when she remarked after watching an early scene in 'Company 'He's not the father of that young girl is he?' Exactly a 75 year old unconvincingly playing somebody twenty years younger while in 1973 film he was a 36 year college student! Anywayenough of Redford who otherwise gives a competent performance. It was good to see Julie Christie again and who along with Nick Nolte Susan Sarandon and Chris Cooper and still capable of teaching the young pretenders a thing or two. All in all and enjoyable and nostalgic evening's viewing.".

The characters say repeatedly that the Weather Underground activities occurred 30 years ago  which would set the film in the early 2000s. Yet a relatively minor quibble the cars are contemporary models early 2010s. What's worse Robert Redford is 78 years old and looks it. Not that there's anything wrong with that but he is quite obviously 20 years too old for the role given that the Weather Underground action occurred 30 years ago according to the script if they let it be 40 years ago he'd be at 10 years too old. Indeed several of these actors are too old for their roles. I applaud Redford for wanting to make a film with aging actors but the discrepancy between the characters' ages and the actors' obvious ages is so great that you really can't get past it. These kinds of things are just not that hard.".

That feels absurd. It gets even more preposterous with the love child twist.Good performances plenty of conversations. Billed as a thriller there are no thrills. There is no sense of urgency. It is directed with no pizazz. It seems like the book might fill in the holes. How did the police chief get that baby? Why did the FBI take the retired police chief in the helicopter?

Seems like it couldn't get made without Robert Redford in the lead and doesn't work with Robert Redford in the lead.The film will have a short theatrical run.

	schema:reviewBody "The Company You Keep 2012 out of 4Robert Redford directs and allstar cast in this political thriller about the past coming back to haunt you. When a former Weather Underground member Susan Sarandon turns herself in for a murder committed thirty years earlier a reporter Shia LaBeouf soon realizes that a local man Redford might have some connection. Soon this man goes on the run and it's up to the reporter to try and find out why and put all the pieces together. THE COMPANY YOU KEEP certainly has some flaws but for the most part I thought it was an extremely wellmade thriller with some terrific performances. As with Redford's previous film THE CONSPIRATOR this here certainly has some things to say about current politics but thankfully none of them come off as preaching. I thought the film's story was actually quite compelling but a lot of this was due to you enjoying the allstar cast. Redford turns in his best performances in ages as he has no problem slipping into this role as a man on the run. I thought he was very believable early on and as all the twists in the story come out the actor still manages to make us care for him and want to see him succeed. LaBeouf probably gives the weakest performances in the film but he's still quite good and comes across well as the young reporter. The supporting cast includes top acts like Sarandon Nick Nolte Sam Elliott Richard Jenkins Terrence Howard Stanley Tucci Anna Kendrick Chris Cooper and Julie Christie. What's amazing is that this allstar cast just doesn't stick out like a sore thumb and all of them fit into their roles so we see characters and not famous actors. I think the one major flaw in the film deals with the FBI manhunt of Redford. I just think these scenes needed to have a lot more tension than they did. I liked the laid back nature of the picture and it's clear that the director wanted this to follow in the footsteps of pictures like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and ABSENCE OF MALICE. This here doesn't quite reach their levels but it's still very much worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sunday Dinner for a Soldier is a class act. From first scene to last it will tug on your heartstrings and make you long for a time in America when people took pride in their country in their families in being responsible without always thinking of themselves first. It was a time when home was where the heart was since so many young men were in Europe or Asia fighting to liberate the world from fascism.The story is about a poor family living in a ramshackled houseboat who have to scrounge for a living but who have big hearts. They want to share their gifts of love friendship and food with a US soldier whom they have been told will be delivered to their house on a Sunday by an aid society. There is a mix up and it looks like he won't show up when all of a sudden God  it had to be God!  brings one to their home by chance. It turns out he is a man from a broken family John Hodiak and he quickly warms to the old grandpa of the house the little children and the eldest daughter Anne Baxter who never looked lovelier than in this film. They quickly become his surrogate family.Exceptional performances by everyone particularly Anne and John who fell in love while making this picture and got married and had a child together. You can sense there was a real attraction there it wasn't just acting. I loved the scene where they danced together in the unfinished dance hall by the sea. Oh my gosh how romantic! Of the children it's Connie Marshall whom you'll remember the most. What a delightful child actress she was she doesn't deserve to be forgotten. I actually sought this film out just to see another film she was in after seeing her give another luminous performance in Sentimental Journey with Maureen O'Hara. She didn't disappoint! This film needs to be seen by more people. How can they continue to ignore gems like Sunday Dinner for a Soldier and put out total junk on DVD every day? It's beyond me. Here's hoping some saner heads will prevail and we'll one day see an official release of this unforgettable film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I feel I have to take issue with the previous comments from a reader who says they cannot understand why previous readers gave it ten stars. This is the reason I am giving it ten stars as my favourite picture that I first saw in the early 50s. The comments made about John Hodiak not appearing until the end of the picture are wrong. When Hodiak does appear he works solid through to the end of the picture. The comments made about this not being a great film as it was shot on the back lot of Fox are rubbish. I have a lot of the backlot stills that were never seen by the public but were kept by the child star Connie Marshall. A lot of work was put into this picture.Sure it was shot on the back lot of Fox. So was Casablanca shot on the back lot of WB and the airport scene at the end shot at Van Nuys airport. That was a great film wasn it? This was child star Connie Marshall's first picture and she was not on the credits as Introducing but among the lead cast. As somebody who has been in the film industry and a film buff all his life I appreciate cinema more that anybody. If you are going to vote on a film learn the history about it and not that it was cheaply made. There was a war on at the time this was made and it was made as fantasy to please the picturegoing public. Looking at the votes given on this site it appears to have just done that.The cinema was there for all of us to escape the outside world and live in a fantasy world for a few hours this picture gave us just that.Top stars great story great music and make believe. A pure gem. I hope I have explained now why I personally gave this a top rating and why it will always be my favourite picture.".

I've always been a big fan of both John Hodiak and Anne Baxter so this was perfect casting in my opinion.

Together they epitomize the wistful longing which is forever associated with the warrior leaving for battle and the loved one left behind. Appropriately Baxter  Hodiak were later to marry in real life. Tragically John Hodiak would die of a heart attack in 1955 at the age of only 41.Old Charles Winninger steals most of his scenes as Baxter's delightfully incorrigible 'Grandfeathers.' Her younger siblings are very well played by Billy Cummings Connie Marshall with her beloved pet hen and little Bobby Driscoll standing on his head in one of his earliest film roles.Two Oscar winning actresses enliven their smaller roles Anne Revere as an outspoken chicken farmer who enjoys a playful feud with Winninger and Jane Darwell as the community's liaison with the local air base. Gravelvoiced Chill Wills plays a friendly bus driver.Near the end of the film movie mavens will recognize silent screen comic Chester Conklin as a photographer and Rory Calhoun as the sergeant who grabs Hodiak's strawberry cake both uncredited.'I'll See You In My Dreams' is the lovely old tune which ties together the romantic elements throughout the film.".

The support roster headed by Charles Winninger features some of my favorite players including Anne Revere Chill Wills and Jane Darwell.While the screenplay always offers top entertainment it's true to say that the story is somewhat unusual. To me that's an advantage. Critics like me get sick of seeing the same old plot with the same old variations time after time after time.In addition to its fine acting this movie is beautifully photographed by Joe MacDonald and very capably directed by the always reliable Lloyd Bacon.

	schema:headline " Reminding us of a time when America knew who its true heroes were.";
	schema:reviewBody "There's something sentimental about the years of World War II a war where world peace was at stake and 90 percent of the world gathered together to fight against three tyrants who wanted to take over and destroy civilization altogether. Motion picture footage popular music and still photography document the romantic side of this horrible war which killed possibly billions of innocent young men and civilians on both sides. It's probably the one war in history that young men went in eager even if reluctantly to wipe out fascism and restore order to a world gone wild.In 1944 alone movie goers got an abundance of touching stories of how war affects the home from the lengthy but outstanding Since You Went Away the tearjerker romance I'll Be Seeing You and the tragic The Sullivans as well as allstar musicals like Hollywood Canteen and Four Jills in a Jeep which showed how celebrities were getting involved to entertain the boys both over there and at home. The majority of the world played cheerleader to the millions of soldiers fighting for home the girl or boy they loved giving them encouragement that they would have something to return to when the war was finally over.Sunday Dinner For a Soldier documents how a struggling poor family on the coast of Florida went out of their way to make an effort to participate in the tradition of inviting visiting military personnel over for dinner to help remind them of what remained back at home while they were on active duty. Anne Baxter is the struggling older sister of four children and living with them is their irascible grandfather a wonderful Charles Winninger who is trying to avoid unwanted attentions by the much married town matriarch Anne Revere. After Revere maliciously rips up Winninger's request for soldiers to attend Sunday dinner as their guests she has second thoughts when she comes across two of the children selling berries in an effort to raise money for the dinner.Chill Wills is delightful as the local bus driver who escorts visiting soldiers all around the town and provides kindly words of wisdom to his riders. Jane Darwell plays the head of the committee arranging these dinners and is bombarded with late night phone calls by Revere inquiring if she's found at least one soldier to attend. By the time Sunday shows up it appears that nobody will appear leaving Baxter Winninger and the three spunky children all depressed. But miracles happen and in this case it's in the form of handsome John Hodiak who happens along the beach near the houseboat where the family resides.There's a ton of luscious subplots galore including one corny but adorable storyline involving the kid's pet hen whom Winninger hates and presumably plucks and beheads in preparation for that Sunday dinner with the unknown soldier. Baxter plays a hard character on the surface but obviously dreams of romance as evidenced in a scene where she dances in the abandoned facade of a long destroyed building which resembles ancient Greek or Roman ruins. Later she repeats the dance with Hodiak who is so kind and a perfect representation of the type of young man any family would love to have as a visitor during a time of war or even peace. Like the other romantic war films I mention above this has a bit of a tearjerking finale that shows off the American propaganda machine at its best. Yet it is filled with hope which is all America could ask for as the war reached its last year.".

The movie could have spent its time developing the Baxter and Hodiak characters using the Florida shanty the kids the gramps and other colorful characters as a backdrop but Bacon frontloads the movie with bathos and the antics of the side characters while trying to sell the notion of two people falling in love over Sunday dinner in a couple of brief scenes. Yeah yeah they really were an item but that's certainly not a given in the story. Bacon has The Soldier looking like he's smitten before he's even met the lady! Maybe it was the pheromones.

So when I looked on IMDb at the reviews for this film I was shocked to see two 10s for such an insignificant filmespecially since although this film is rather cute it's also a bit too saccharine and at times hard to take.

Our hero known only as Smith determines to save the child and find out why Hertz wants the baby dead. At a local bordello he tries to employ a lactating hooker to watch the child but things quickly escalate and this makeshift family is soon on the run. Heavy metal music calms the baby. Why?

Don't go expecting high art...SEU doesn't take itself seriously enough for that. But that's exactly what makes it work. It KNOWS it's over the top and doesn't try to hide it. Clive Owen's Smith character is the Bugs Bunny to Paul Giamatti's Hurtz Elmer Fudd. The film takes the best cartoon elements makes them flesh and still kicks in that over the top craziness. Bad puns that are so bad they're good action sequences that there just for the sake of having an action sequence and the wildest sex scene ever...it's amazing. It's the funniest coolest most amazing mix of stunts bad one liners and paper think plot lines.You get everything you expect from Shoot 'Em Up...and it's all great.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this deliriously overthetop masterpiece of outrageously clever mayhem star Clive Owen is an unstoppable goodguy gunman who is given to asking the question you know what I hate? immediately before letting all hell break loose.You know what I hate? Dishonest hypocritical reviewers like the one sitting two seats away from me at the Shoot 'Em Up screening I attended. Although he made amused grunts and other appreciative noises during the deliciously inventive stunts laughed out loud at the jokes gasped and groaned at all the right gaspandgroanworthy places and generally appeared to be having a grand old time he said afterward that he didn't like the movie.What the hell is wrong with critics like that? Are they afraid the arthouse crowd won't take them seriously if they express appreciation for a film in which a newborn's umbilical cord is cut with a gunshot or a thug gets killed by having a carrot shoved in his mouth and out the back of his head? What you mean Bergman or Antonioni never filmed a lactating hooker tearing out a ring from a Marilyn Manson lookalike's personal area to convince him to talk?Ahem.Although the posters for Shoot 'Em Up resemble Frank Miller comicbook drawings come to life the actual movie has more in common with the work of another comicbook great Garth Ennis writer of such jawdroppingly hyperviolent heroes as Marvel's the Punisher. Although the awful 2004 Punisher movie included some supporting characters and plot points that originated with Ennis it lacked anything resembling his very dark yet fiercely entertaining style. The guy definitely has a way of making vigilantes and their dangerous toys fascinating.Owen plays Mr. Smith  and that's probably not his real name  a guy who is simply waiting for a bus when he gets drawn into one of the wildest most crazyviolent action opening scenes of all time. By the time the bullets stop flying Smith is on the run with a complete stranger's targetedfordeath baby and one hell of a lot of questions.Smith enlists a kinky got milk hooker Monica Bellucci to wetnurse the infant. Despite some tough talk she turns out to be more placidly sensual and maternal than kickass tomboy which makes for a nice change in this kind of movie.Meanwhile a sadistically evil genius appropriately named Hertz Paul Giamatti dogs their trail with a neverending army of hired killers and yes a couple of dogs. Giamatti scores as this badass with brains who is shocked and hilariously furious about how Smith  Company keep managing to survive. Do we suck this bad he says at one point or is this guy really that good?Writerdirector Michael Davis has loaded the film with one unforgettably imaginative image after another spent shell casings bouncing off a pregnant woman's stomach a gun dropping in an unflushed toilet a hand with bullets between the fingers shoved into a fireplace as an improvised weapon. There are showdowns standoffs car chases airborne gun battles and even a shootout in a firearms factory.Best of all the screenplay manages to both glorify in and yet subvert some of the things you'll be expecting. For example it's a megabodycount blizzardofbullets barrage that's actually a plea for gun control at heart. Seriously. Also although it has scenes referencing bits from movies as diverse as Lost Highway The Transporter and even Raising Arizona how's that for range? it still feels fresh and original.And there's one perfectly done little scene that's so poignant you may actually find yourself tearing up. Don't worry though  a hail of gunfire follows very shortly thereafter. Heck a hail of gunfire follows shortly after EVERYTHING in this movie usually including other hails of gunfire!I can't wait to see what relative newcomer Michael Davis does for his next movie but it will be hard for him to top this one. Shoot 'Em Up is a flatout joy to watch. When it was over the first thing I said was I want to see this movie again RIGHT NOW! It's that good!".

After he rescues the kid he links back up with an old flame DQ played by Monica Bellucci. The movie starts out with a bang quite literally and doesn't settle down the entire time. There's a plot somewhere in the movie but if you think too hard it'll disappear in a puff of logic.That being said the gunfights and car chases are stellar. They are lots of fun with ridiculous things going on the entire time.

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't really sure what to make of this movie before I went to the advanced screening. I heard from a friend of mine at the Chicago Tribune she's female and you'll see why that matters in a second and she said It was so stupid! It was like BANG BANG BANG EXPLETIVE EXPLETIVE EXPLETIVE BANG BANG BANG! Then gallons of blood and we move on. For some reason the little boy in me that loved the scene in Predator where all of the soldiers shoot at open woods for a complete minute got very excited. She wasn't kidding either that's just what this movie was. Don't worry about the plot it's not really a concern. Don't worry about the script either the lines are so over the top and shallow that you know a man wrote this script without allowing anyone to comment on it.At the same time this movie is just plain fun. You will find yourself laughing from the moment the movie starts to the ending which you won't be glancing at your watch while waiting for. There are funny lines funny situations and stuff that is so impossible in the real world that you can't help but chuckle. Various moments during the film I found myself applauding along with the audience maybe not for the film but for how writerdirector Michael Davis got our hero out of another situation.The directing as opposed to the writing was done very well especially for a movie like this. If you take the directing too seriously the script won't work which is probably why Michael Davis did both. Clive Owen delivers another strong performance adapting to the cheesy script and outrageous events like a participant in a prank or gag. Monica Bellucci plays the most serious role in the film and still takes to mocking her life and situation in this movie like the rest of them. My favorite character would still have to be the sly Paul Giamatti who is given some pretty crazy situations himself but they are coupled with the only lines of any intelligence or longer than about four words.By the end of this movie I was having a lot of fun watching a plot unfold that I didn't really care about. That doesn't deter the film though because it's kind of like a stunt show you're not really concerned with the story. I loved it and apparently so did most of the audience. It really reminded me of seeing well a live action movie that was more like a video game we even have coordinated colors for the costumes of the bad guys in the various levels. I'd like to use this film as an example to my former favorite critic Roger Ebert as a perfect example of how video games can be construed in the same light as video games because Roger this is clearly a movie made by a large video game fan.".

Firstly its silly and calling the events that unfold over the top is a huge understatement. The film doesn't take itself seriously for a second. The action is almost cartoonist in nature and there are at least 5 jaw dropping scenes and by the end of this film you will never look at a carrot the same way. Like I said its not for everyone some will love it others will loathe it. Regardless of which camp you fall in I think pretty much everyone will agree after seeing this film that the Broccoli family must have been asleep during Clive Owens Bond test screening. This guy has more Bond in his left arm than Daniel Craig in his entire body and the best thing? He doesn't even try like a certain other Scottish actor you may recall. In fact this review is pretty pointless. This is the only film you'll see Monica Belluci get shagged during a shootout. Enuf said. Go watch it".

But for the rest of us who all have that 13 year old immature video gamer still inside you gotta see it. I think Clive Owen might be the first true action star Hollywood has had in a long time.

	schema:reviewBody "I had been looking forward to this movie for months so walking in I had somewhat high expectations. Walking out I felt very satisfied and that I had gotten more than my money's worth.You are going to be hardpressed to find a movie more over the top than Shoot 'Em Up. What Michael Davis does here is take every action movie clich i.e. firing two guns while jumping through the air shooting guns out of speeding cars etc. and takes it to a whole new level entirely. It works namely because the violence here is just so creative. Sure it defies all logic most of the time but I was laughing and having a riproaring time throughout.Clive Owen is perfectly cast as the carrotchomping guntoting smart aleck hero and has no shortage of cheesy puns that score big laughs. The rest of the cast does well but really it's Clive's show.The plot is pretty much nonexistent other than about a half dozen scenes of slightly forced dialogue. The purpose behind these scenes is more to give the audience a couple of minutes to catch it's collective breath between action scenes than it is to develop an actual story. And really if you went to this movie expecting an indepth character drama you picked the wrong film.At a little under an hour and a half Shoot 'Em Up successfully delivers a perfect dosage of action guns and puns without overstaying it's welcome. I'll be sure to see it at least a couple more times while it is still in theaters.Plus it has Mtley Cre's Kickstart my Heart. What more could you ask for?".

Best comment I've read here is entitled Knowingly Absurd SelfConsciously Ridiculous. Hits the nail umm... carrot on the head. That is not only shown in the overthetop action scenes but also in the dialogues when Bellucci asks Owen Is there anything you don't hate? or Giamatti's mobile phone always rings when he is  sorry I'm just busy  killing someone. Clive Owen is better than ever a tired pro explained so little that we don't even find out his character's real name. Just Smith then. Monica Bellucci is over 40 now and perfectly cast as a prostitute whose best days are over but she still is very... motherly. Wouldn't have worked as well with a younger actress. Paul Giamatti is an excellent opponent a lunatic who thinks killing everyone is the best solution for finding peace. There shouldn't be too many movies like this because in the end it's a cynical way of filming and the art of creating characters with a certain depth shouldn't vanish but once in a while a ride like this is terrific fun and a guilty pleasure. Extra point for the powerful soundtrack courtesy of Motrhead ACDC the underrated Midnight Movies and more.".

	schema:reviewBody "I sat in the darkened theatre pondering this question if the 7 teenagers in front of me were having such a great time why wasn't I? Was I missing something here? Did I not get it? I came to the conclusion as the credits rolled that I got it alright. It just didn't work. I glance at the kids in the rising light looking like they just got off a rollercoaster and I understand. I'm not a teenager.This is more of a kid's movie than any of the socalled kid's movies I saw this year. Stardust was an adult oriented fantasy. Ratatouille had distinctly adult oriented humour that no doubt went over most kid's heads. Yet a film that is supposed to be adult Die Hard 4.0 was aimed directly at the kids. And now this the kind of movie I would have lapped up at 15 or so. It has everything I would have wanted back then Gunfire swearing boobies bad puns lots of blood increasingly gory deaths. Oh and er lactating hookers. This is a film that is decadent and racy for the sake of it possibly to have it's prepubescent audience snigger at the use of a rude word. There are those who would frivolously use the word 'satire' to describe this film. Shoot 'Em Up does not even come close to being that deep. In the end it just becomes a pale imitation of the folly it pokes fun at.The plot is nonexistent. I expected this much only I half expected for there to be at least a thread to hold it all together. I was wrong. Instead it has different variations on that cinematic darling the gunfight. We have gunfight while eating carrot death by carrot firing a gun with a carrot gunfight during sex gunfight while birthing gunfight while parachuting and gunfight with no workable fingers with which to fire that's where the carrot comes in again. Imagine if you will an E! Entertainment special Top 1001 movie gunfights and you have Shoot 'Em Up. It's trying to be desperately clever and winds up being desperately generic. Some are even pretty well constructed but others the majority instantly forgettable.There's no character development to speak of which again I expected but these people are literally made of cardboard. How can an audience be expected to be thrilled by a gunfight if they don't care about anyone in it? Furthermore the script is so full of cringeworthy lines it's hard to see why writer Michael Davis may have thought he was being clever when writing them. Clive Owen's mythical charisma is lost on me. I see him at his best in small films such as Croupier or Children of Men in which he actually plays a character but so far his blockbuster roles have been disappointing. His King Arthur was about as stale as they come and his deadpanning in this role feels forced and unenthusiastic. Paul Giamatti looks like he's having fun chewing the scenery but chew the scenery is all he does and try as he might to be menacing he falls short of creating any kind of tension.Director Michael Davis brought us some teen comedies early in the decade such as 100 Girls and Girl Fever neither of which impressed me due to their complete immaturity and their utter tastelessness compared even to the likes of Tomcats. Shoot 'Em Up has done nothing to change my mind about his work. Thanks to Girl Fever I'll never be able to think about Clint Howard the same way again.So to sum up a gormless mess of action sequences starring the 'almost James Bond' with less plot than a Michael Bay extravaganza and a large abundance of carrots. Movies need a certain amount of substance to survive. This had none. A waste of time and money.".

There are those who would frivolously use the word 'satire' to describe this film. Shoot 'Em Up does not even come close to being that deep. In the end it just becomes a pale imitation of the folly it pokes fun at.The plot is nonexistent. I expected this much only I half expected for there to be at least a thread to hold it all together. I was wrong. Instead it has different variations on that cinematic darling the gunfight. We have gunfight while eating carrot death by carrot firing a gun with a carrot gunfight during sex gunfight while birthing gunfight while parachuting and gunfight with no workable fingers with which to fire that's where the carrot comes in again. Imagine if you will an E! Entertainment special Top 1001 movie gunfights and you have Shoot 'Em Up. It's trying to be desperately clever and winds up being desperately generic. Some are even pretty well constructed but others the majority instantly forgettable.There's no character development to speak of which again I expected but these people are literally made of cardboard. How can an audience be expected to be thrilled by a gunfight if they don't care about anyone in it? Furthermore the script is so full of cringeworthy lines it's hard to see why writer Michael Davis may have thought he was being clever when writing them. Clive Owen's mythical charisma is lost on me. I see him at his best in small films such as Croupier or Children of Men in which he actually plays a character but so far his blockbuster roles have been disappointing. His King Arthur was about as stale as they come and his deadpanning in this role feels forced and unenthusiastic. Paul Giamatti looks like he's having fun chewing the scenery but chew the scenery is all he does and try as he might to be menacing he falls short of creating any kind of tension.Director Michael Davis brought us some teen comedies early in the decade such as 100 Girls and Girl Fever neither of which impressed me due to their complete immaturity and their utter tastelessness compared even to the likes of Tomcats. Shoot 'Em Up has done nothing to change my mind about his work. Thanks to Girl Fever I'll never be able to think about Clint Howard the same way again.So to sum up a gormless mess of action sequences starring the 'almost James Bond' with less plot than a Michael Bay extravaganza and a large abundance of carrots. Movies need a certain amount of substance to survive. This had none. A waste of time and money.";

	schema:reviewBody "There was a screening of Shoot 'Em Up during the San Diego ComicCom 07 at the GasLamp Theater. My cousins and I almost didn't get to see it because the nimwitted box office staff decided ticket stubs would be needed to get into the theater even though we had Shoot 'Em Up passes directly from New Line Cinema reps. Because ticket stub holder got in first we ended up sitting in the top seats of the theater which turned out to be a blessing. Clive Owen actually attending the screening and sat right behind my cousin. Hehe!! As for the movie it's one of the best action flicks of the summer. The director wanted to make a John Woo style film and he succeeded with this goal. The gun battles are terrific. Clive Owen plays Mr. Smith. A man in the right place at the wrong time. In the opening scene he watches as a killer chases a pregnant woman into an alley with a gun. Not one to stand and let a woman get killed he takes action to protect the woman and her baby. What follows is a series of misfortunes and narrow escapes as pieces of the plot are put together. Why was this man trying to kill this woman? What does the baby have to do with this crazed hitman play by Paul Giamatti who's after him? Will Mr. Smith's call girl squeeze DQ played by Monica Bellucci help him? All these questions are answered in the movie. Just when you're about to take a breather from the action it revs up again and takes off. Even though the plot is a little thin it's unique as well. I'm not going to give any of it away either. The only real downside is the action isn't realistic in some of the scenes. Things happen to perfectly for our hero whereas in real life he most likely wouldn't have made it to the end of the movie. You know what I'm talking about? The movie is still very fun to view and weighing in at only 90mins it won't take up your whole afternoon. This is a must see for fans of John Woo and action films. I'm going to see it again with the wife when it gets released in Sept. I rate it 810.".

They start their own revolt against the Irish Free State Army headed by Collins.This is an expansive epic historical drama. Liam Neeson leads this with his powerful presence. He looms over this movie like the leading man that he is. The actors are all great although Julia Roberts does stick out a little. It would have been more fitting to have an Irish lass. The movie does try to fit a lot into two hours. Some of it can feel a bit disjointed. Liam Neeson is big enough to tie it all together. It would also be nice for him to have a constant foil. Whether or not he deserves it historically the movie seems to make De Valera Collins' foil. It would be great to fully embrace the conflict and give De Valera more screen time. Make this Collins versus De Valera.".

Anyway Michael Collins is great to watch. The story is heartfelt and the nuances between personal battles and patriotic duty are displayed in a very mature fashion   to what extent will you go for your country? What will you lose? Who will you fight? Why will you do any of it? Who are your true friends? etc. The music is FANTASTIC. Worth renting just for the listen. Of course Neison is great. So is Aidin Quinn when I first saw this movie I thought Quinn was Irish given his name and his performance here. Alan Rickman is Alan Rickman   which is great though he doesn't pull off the Irish thing too well. However given his character Eamon de Valera it isn't really a miscast just takes time to get in.If you can ignore how horrible Julia Roberts is and think about the heart and emotion behind this film while enjoying the awesome score you're in for a treat.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this first in the now defunct Capitol Cineplex in Cork. I was surprised to see so many senior citizens in the cinema. The cineplex was so scummy it had to be something special to draw them in. Some of them might have been old enough to remember the civil war or at least to have had a close family member killed in it. Many of them were clearly moved by it particularly the end with its archive footage. It is a moving film but you have to be careful. One should never confuse history with entertainment and this is not a history lesson. All the major events are there but there is a horrible bias from the director. I don't like DeValera or what he stood for but what was hinted at the end in this movie is a travesty. If such a thing is true you have to prove it you can't slyly hint at it. There are other insidious things such as mortars and carbombs which are clear reference to the 1970s90s Northern conflict. Such weapons did not exist in 1916. To me this is an oblique way of implying that the Provos are somehow the legitimate heirs of the IRA in 1916 which of course they are not. Despite this I enjoyed the movie a lot. The production values and acting was so good it really felt like a timewarp. Neil Jordan is a great director Neeson and Rickman are superb in their parts. Rickman looks so much like DeValera it is uncanny. I even liked Julia Roberts. It looks like she made a fair attempt at a Dun Laoghaire accent and of course it sounded phony. Southside Dublin accents all sound phoney to me anyway so I didn't mind. The best moment was the scene where Collins starts the civil war sitting behind a howitzer aimed at the Four Courts and fires. You can see a huge explosion and bits coming out portico. I actually felt scared that they had damaged this famous Dublin landmark. This won't mean much to someone from overseas but anyone familiar with the Four Courts and the resident lawyers sorry barristers in their eighteenth century costumes would surely enjoy firing an artillery piece at the overpaid clowns. I wish I had a howitzer like that.".

	schema:headline " In spite of the controversy an orthodox view which still fails to convince.";
	schema:reviewBody "As a student of history in Ireland I was both amused and annoyed by this film. On the first viewing I was confused much of it was very powerful especially the 1916 and civil war scenes. My confusion related o the treatment of de Valera who I have always regarded as displaying great integrity and the portrayal of Collins's terrorism which I will come to in a minute. The following fact displays the dubiousness of the basis of this film Director Neil Jordan displayed on the screen a quote supposedly made by de Valera about Collins in 1966 in the fullness of time history will record the greatness of Collins and it will be recorded at my expense. This quote is contained only in Tim Pat Coogan's 1990 biography of Collins he heard it from Collins's nephew who heard it from Joe McGrath a former intelligence operative and sometime Minister who supposedly heard de Valera say it. A thirdhand quote produced verbatim after two or three decades. Someone else below has mentioned historical inaccuracies. I would say that what is more important is that history as it was is presented in a manner similar to the presentation of the quote  halfdigested misinterpreted and as orthodoxy. For example the notion presented by the film that Collins started and organised the highly successful 'flying columns' which carried out devastating ambushes of enemy troops is erroneous. The officers of the East Limerick Brigade started it and it spread to the renowned South Tipperary Brigade and on from there. Then there is the issue of the terrorism practiced by Collins. Was it a characteristic of the War of Independence in Ireland and was it necessary?Shooting of spies was certainly carried out in Ireland. It wasn't initiated by Collins who became Minister for Finance in 1919 NOT Minister for Intelligence though he was Director of Intelligence in the army in Ireland's first independent representative assembly in 750 years. Terrorism? No it was a widely practiced act of war. The two countries were at war. But Collins according to one intelligence expert carried out assassinations of people whose status as spies or traitors has still not been proven.In fact his tendency to target his politcal opponents with his gangs during the civil war calls his whole War of Independence status into question. These facts have a tendency to be brushed under the carpet by his legions of fans and consequently by this film. So too his role in the treaty talks. It is not widely known that the terms accepted by the delegates or terms so similar the difference is hardly worth discussing were already on the table when the negotiations began by virtue of preliminary talks by de Valera  others. In other words what was accepted was a travesty by any standards. It not only legalised partition and was the source of 80 years of further bloodshed but accepted that the rest of Ireland only had status as it was conferred by Britain. Some still believe that de Valera knew that more couldn't be achieved but there is no basis for this and having looked at his papers I believe this is nonsense. Indeed there are indications see Hopkinson 'Green Against Green' that Collins and the head of the delegation Griffith were happy enough with the terms to conspire with Lloyd George and Churchill to blackmail the other delegates into acceptance. What is clear is that both originally favoured acceptance of the original offer  Collins because it allowed the Free State to raise an army yippee!.This is a technical discussion but I wish to demonstrate how the blurring or ignoring of facts can create confusion in a historical film. A lot of people had a problem with the film but just couldn't put their finger on it. It just doesn't add up. I've no problem generally with artistic licence but where the morality of a film rests on its facts it needs to make sense and have logic. Overall the acting was quite good with one or two exceptions  the obvious one being Julia Roberts. Alan Rickman is always a shade over the top for me. Characterisation even of Collins was shallow. Motives weren't really explored except to the extent of Collins saying more or less I am noble because I want peace even though I am a bloody murderer but that is the Brits' fault not mine the Brits saying Look how evil andor incompetent I am and de Valera saying I lack the courage to do what is really necessary I am also weak and feckless and the nemesis to the charismatic hero. The film also does a grave injustice to Harry Boland who was a far more capable and intelligent character than he was made out to be here. There's no denying that the film has power but it's undermined by the script which sometimes borders on the ridiculous and seems to try to cater to the American audience who didn't go to see it in droves. There hasn't been a film made yet about Ireland's past that I have seen which I would recommend so I don't want to be too hash. But if you want to be informed about the time read Macardle's 'The Irish Republic'.".

	onyx:emotionText "As a student of history in Ireland I was both amused and annoyed by this film. On the first viewing I was confused much of it was very powerful especially the 1916 and civil war scenes. My confusion related o the treatment of de Valera who I have always regarded as displaying great integrity and the portrayal of Collins's terrorism which I will come to in a minute. The following fact displays the dubiousness of the basis of this film Director Neil Jordan displayed on the screen a quote supposedly made by de Valera about Collins in 1966 in the fullness of time history will record the greatness of Collins and it will be recorded at my expense. This quote is contained only in Tim Pat Coogan's 1990 biography of Collins he heard it from Collins's nephew who heard it from Joe McGrath a former intelligence operative and sometime Minister who supposedly heard de Valera say it. A thirdhand quote produced verbatim after two or three decades. Someone else below has mentioned historical inaccuracies. I would say that what is more important is that history as it was is presented in a manner similar to the presentation of the quote  halfdigested misinterpreted and as orthodoxy. For example the notion presented by the film that Collins started and organised the highly successful 'flying columns' which carried out devastating ambushes of enemy troops is erroneous. The officers of the East Limerick Brigade started it and it spread to the renowned South Tipperary Brigade and on from there. Then there is the issue of the terrorism practiced by Collins. Was it a characteristic of the War of Independence in Ireland and was it necessary?Shooting of spies was certainly carried out in Ireland. It wasn't initiated by Collins who became Minister for Finance in 1919 NOT Minister for Intelligence though he was Director of Intelligence in the army in Ireland's first independent representative assembly in 750 years. Terrorism? No it was a widely practiced act of war. The two countries were at war. But Collins according to one intelligence expert carried out assassinations of people whose status as spies or traitors has still not been proven.In fact his tendency to target his politcal opponents with his gangs during the civil war calls his whole War of Independence status into question. These facts have a tendency to be brushed under the carpet by his legions of fans and consequently by this film. So too his role in the treaty talks. It is not widely known that the terms accepted by the delegates or terms so similar the difference is hardly worth discussing were already on the table when the negotiations began by virtue of preliminary talks by de Valera  others. In other words what was accepted was a travesty by any standards. It not only legalised partition and was the source of 80 years of further bloodshed but accepted that the rest of Ireland only had status as it was conferred by Britain. Some still believe that de Valera knew that more couldn't be achieved but there is no basis for this and having looked at his papers I believe this is nonsense.

He created a stick for reviewers to hit him with  and boy did the blows rain down on his head. These blows alone might have killed any chance this difficult film had at the box office.It went down like a lead balloon in America which shows that behind the bluster and flag waving most IrishAmerican's aren't really interested in their own history.If only they had stuck more closely to the uncontested facts film writers would have focused on the good things. Which include excellent cinematography good use of filters and first class performances from all bar the allatsea and mostly unneeded Julia Roberts.A perfect example of the Hollywood of today All perfect teeth and good looks but no ability to do characters or accents. I actually cringed while she was speaking in her Irish accent!The producers don't help much either by dressing her in a range of expensive outfits that change between shots Destroying any sense of her being a poor country girl! Indeed scenes of poverty seems to be avoided rather than played upon.Liam Neeson was born to play Collins both physically and temperamentally a dream part for him. There isn't a second that I don't believe in him. Shame there isn't more parts like this for him to play.I don't mind my country being the bad guy in this movie because we deserve it. What we did in Ireland will always be a stain on our history but where is the context? The two countries have always been closely intertwined  not only due to geography but also due to wealth and technology reasons.Also to be understood is that British troops had no experience of civil war or terrorism. They had been fighting wars against a uniformed enemy that stood in front of them. The people that joined up were often criminals or people that couldn't find alternative employment or even wanted a bit of adventure in their lives. Here their enemy dressed in civilian clothes and shot at them in the street often from point blank range and then ran. The people they killed were often Irish police or suspected informers. It was very ugly but it was ugly on both sides.There was also plenty of infighting of the literal variety that was more about gangsterism than Irish politics A side road this film doesn't want to wander down.The film also takes the view that violence was the only path. South African apartheid crashed without the blacks winning any kind of civil war  indeed theirs probably extended the run of the white elite. Times move on to quote Ghandi all tyrannies must fall.... however strong they appear at the time.Despite everything this is an important film and Neil Jordan's best so far. It has too many little truths about power and real politics to be ignored easily and it does expose one Irish hero as a weasel. Watch the film to see which one.A lot of responsibility fell on Neil Jordan's shoulders making this. It is a oneoff deal. It isn't like a book there won't be another Michael Collins film next year. More people  worldwide will gain information about him from this film than any other medium. Therefore the hodgepodge mix of fact and fiction makes me uneasy  especially when so many of the debates and politics that are raised here are still ongoing.".

	schema:headline " Effective recapitulation of Irish struggle for independence but British point of view is sorely lacking";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Neil Jordan was at the height of his fame following his great success with The Crying Game when he was finally able to convince film investors to fund Michael Collins a project which was 10 years in the making. I knew little about the history of the struggle for Irish independence but after seeing this film it propelled me to do a little research. As a history lesson Michael Collins does well in covering the main historical points but Jordan does little in presenting the British point of view.The film begins with the Easter Rising of 1916 a violent protest in Dublin which resulted in the defeat and arrest of the leaders amongst the Irish rebels. What Jordan doesn't let on here is that the rebellion was not at all popular with the Irish people and the tide didn't turn until the British executed the majority of the rebels following the rebellion.Liam Neeson does well in playing Collins as a dynamic strong character but Collins was around thirty when the events of the film takes place and Neeson was about 14 years older. If you're willing to forgive the age difference Neeson is quite believable as the fiery Irish leader who is still regarded as a George Washington figure amongst the contemporary Irish populace.Jordan is at his best when he dispassionately regurgitates the sequence of events that led to the establishment of Ireland as a free state and the resulting civil war. Of particular note are the gripping scenes of escalating violence Collins is a beaten by the Royal Irish Constabulary after speaking at an election rally Collins recruits a squad of killers who murder 14 members of the MI5 Cairo Gang and the ensuing act of genocidal revenge taken by the Black and Tans paramilitary force at a soccer match the IRA attack on the Custom House which Collins opposed as he knew the British would easily win the attack on Collins after the treaty with the British at an antiTreaty Republican rally the offensive against the The Four Courts by the antiTreaty side of the IRA despite Collins' bitter opposition and the ambush of Collins resulting in his death.Also of great interest is the conflict between Collins and Eamon de Valera played by an effective Alan Rickam who early on felt that Collins was acting on his own. The actual split between the two leaders is foreshadowed when de Valera goes to meet President Woodrow Wilson in order to gain recognition of the IRA's objectives and takes Collins' best friend and constant companion Harry Boland with him. Eventually de Valera orders Collins to negotiate the treaty with the British over his objections that he's not a diplomat. And it was de Valera who split with Collins over the terms of the treaty which broke Ireland into two and still had the new Irish Free State swearing allegiance to the Crown.What's most fascinating about Collins is that initially he was regarded as a terrorist by the British but after negotiating the treaty between Ireland and the UK he was now regarded as a moderate. In fact during the Irish civil war the British supplied arms to Collins' forces who eventually defeated the antiTreaty faction. Jordan argues that Collins' targets were either brutal forces of the British intelligence service or Irish collaborators not innocent civilians. Whatever the case Collins who was yesterday's terrorist now became today's dignified statesman.Jordan unfortunately leaves out the British side of the story. Instead they're all evil or supporters of evil. Jordan is not adverse to twisting historical facts to make the British seem worse. The scene of the massacre at the soccer match is exaggeratedno armored vehicle entered the premises and machine gunned people in the stands. A British Court of Inquiry found that the actions of the paramilitary group was carried out without orders and exceeded the demands of the situation. The commander of the Dublin District stated that the firing on the crowd was carried out without orders was indiscriminate and unjustifiable with the exception of any shooting which took place inside the enclosure. Nonetheless it was also true that this inquiry was suppressed by the British government. The King of England and some British politicians expressed their horror at the Bloody Sunday massacre and such a public relations disaster did much to strengthen the hand of de Valera's government eventually leading to the peace treaty between Ireland and England.The killing of the double agent Irish detective who aided Collins Ned Broy also appeared to be designed by Jordan to manipulate the audience into hating the British even more. Broy is actually a composite character of three people. While people were tortured by the British particularly those who were involved in the assassinations of British intelligence agents on Bloody Sunday Broy lived well into his 80s.Jordan's decision to take a few liberties with historical events and characters doesn't seem so bad in light of his overall success in depicting the chronology of events in the Irish fight for independence and its aftermath. Nonetheless aside from Collins and perhaps de Valera most of the other characters in the drama are unremarkable and certainly Julia Roberts has little to do as the love interest between Collins and sideman Boland.While necessary after a while many of the violent goings on in Michael Collins felt more like a docudrama. Only when the conflict between de Valera and Collins heats up can one say that the narrative becomes truly compelling. Again what's missing is the British point of view and perhaps a singular antagonist which could have added to the efficaciousness of this well staged period piece.".

Aiden Quinn as Harry Boland wasn't bad though I would have to quibble about the character but I feel that is more the fault of the writers than him.  And lastly sorry though I am to say it Liam Neeson doesn't even compare to Brendan Gleeson's performance as Collins in 1992's The Treaty even his accent wasn't quite right. For those who would like to know what really happened I would recomment 'The Treaty' Tim Pat Coogan's biography though he is a tad biased and T.

	schema:reviewBody "Neil Jordan's historical biopic about Michael Collins the man who fought for a free Ireland in the early 20th Century has its heart in the right place but it just doesn't work. I'm not sure why it doesn't work exactly because it's got a good central performance from Liam Neeson an intelligent screenplay and handsome production design. Despite all of those qualities however it just sits on the screen like a lead paperweight.One thing that definitely IS wrong with the film is Julia Roberts horribly miscast and giving a lame performance. Roberts is far too contemporary an actress ever to be convincing in a period piece and she's not a good enough actress to fake it.Grade C".

Irishborn Liam Neeson stars as the Irish Patriot Michael Collins. In bringing to life a complex warrior and in competing with the eloquent portrait of a Rebel that American actor James Cagney created in Shake Hands With The Devil Neeson advances no personal commitment to politics. Despite parts in films with Celtic themes Neeson lacks Cagney's allegiances to the Irish cause. In 1999 Neeson joined Ronald Reagan as an Officer of the Order of British Empire OBE.Michael Collin's times were without hope of tributes between the ancient enemies. On Easter Sunday 1916 the Irish Volunteers took over the main buildings in the city of Dublin. Forced to surrender The leaders of the rebellion were executed. Confident that nothing more than the usual silly and flowery speeches would follow the British released the remaining prisoners.In the war that followed Collins paid heed to lessons learned. As a warrior Collins carefully weighed the risks avoided rash moves direct confrontation and pitched battle. Collins organized an effective intelligence gathering operation and penetrated G division of Dublin City Police. After Dail Eireann Irish Parliament declared independence Collins concentrated on a guerrilla war conducted by flying squads which carried out their mission and melted away. Demurely Collins cycled around British police and soldiers in the guise of a businessman blithely imposing a death penalty on friends of the Crown.With success Collins threatened the position of the nascent Irish Republic's president Eamon de Valera.Alan Rickman plays Eamon de Valera the way Collins described him a bespeckled nit picker a marked contrast to the tough but unassuming Collins.De Valera deplored the shotintheback tactics favored by Collins. A plan was laid over Collins' objection for a raid on Dublin Castle. Collins who stressed hit and run and economy of lives predicted a failure on the proportion of 1916. The raid exacted a heavy toll on irreplaceable Volunteers. However de Valera correctly predicted that the raid would prove to be the final blow for British authorities. The burning of the customs house proved to the British that no target however well defended was immune from attack.The Michael Collins played in the Liam Neeson movie  accurately portrays a man devoted to the cause. His strength in fighting a wellentrenched enemy is concentrating on vulnerable points with minimal damage to his own men. When the enemy tires from battles Collins proves not to be as expert in the war of diplomacy and political machinations. Talks in London created an anomalous relationship with Britain Ireland was free or in the Empire depending on perspective. Collins went to London as a hero who had outfoxed the greatest military power on earth and returned home as the scapegoat with a treaty creating a state nominally neither independent nor tied to The Crown but somewhere in a grey zone in between.Anxious to declare victory and restore peace Dail Eireann The Irish Parliament supported Collins. Collins took command of evacuated British posts. At Dublin Castle the symbol of British domination Collins arrived seven and a half minutes late for the change of command one minute for each century of occupation. Collins remarked to the British general after seven and half centuries we won't begrudge you seven and a half minutes. Not shown in the film is the Guardia's protest against the treaty They refused to post their colors until the British left the stronghold an official military insult.Collins would have little time to bask in the moment. Where the revolution ends the civil war begins. IRA units had taken over the Four Courts in Dublin in April. Free State troops The Guardia bombarded the building with British artillery. The Civil War had begun. Michael Collins under the cover of an inspection in Cork area was on his way to a peace parlay with the Rebel rebel DeVelera when his convoy was ambushed. Thousands of people lined the streets of Dublin for the funeral of Michael Collins. His adversary de Valera would later reflect It's my considered opinion that in the fullness of time history will record the greatness of Collins and it will be recorded at my expense. From Da Valera's ascension to power until 1965 Collins remained unperson in the country he helped create. In the Jimmy Cagney movie of 1959 Collins is never named he is referred to as 'The Commandant' and seen only as a shadow. But no stone wall can contain such a legend.The Director Neil Jordan could not have imagined anyone other than Liam Neeson in the lead role. Tall Neeson has the goodbad guy charm the American actor James Cagney believed necessary to such a role the swagger of a street brawler with the deceptive innocence of a boyish face. Neeson assumes Collins' passion a man aflame in his cause yet in fatalistic tears over the aftermath.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is an extraordinary epic and lavish production the film sets of O'Connell StreetEaster Uprising are superb and convincing and a brilliant portrayal of the total paradox that is Michael Collins. Collins is shown as one of the most ruthless evil gangsterterrorists of the 20th century and is utterly relentless in his fight against the British  yet he then rounds it all off by being the great peacemaker and diplomat negotiating a treaty in London and then arguing for peace even at the cost of a partitioned Ireland.  He then fights a vicious civil war against his former IRA comrades aided and armed by Churchill and Britain!  How's that for being Irish?Overall this film is totally brilliant and engrossing.It's also a fascinating look into how the British ruled Ireland with the G Division' political officers gaining information on various people in Ireland and of course the notorious warweary Black and Tans.  The Black and Tans were infamous  and rightly so  yet I don't blame them that much. Four years in the Western Front trenches would be enough to drive anyone mad they were brutalised before they got to Ireland.A good cameo by Charles Dance too as one of the Cairo Gang all killed on the Bloody Sunday massacre.  Liam Neeson is brilliant as Collins of course.  Alan Rickman is sensational as the enigmatic de Valera.The film also has an excellent musical score by Elliot Goldenthal  particularly the delightful Macushla and the funeralcoda at the end.".

No one is shown to be an out and out villian even though extreme violence was frequently used by both sides. This maybe seen by some as being objective and two sided but strikes me as a cop out  and a cowardly one at that. Id have  no problem with the Brits being shown as the bad guys  they did commit atrocities in Ireland at this time  of that theres no dispute  but couldnt have the first half of the film concentrated on this more ? Likewise there was just as many violent atrocities commited by Irishmen on Irishmen following the creation of the Irish free state. Couldnt the second half have been far more brutal in showing De Valera to be a political opportunist only interested in power and using the lives of Irish patriots in order to get it ?Most unforgivable of all is the dilemma faced by the real life Collins of creating an independant Ireland without causing a war with the unionists in the North. Oh yes the majority of people in Northen Ireland want to remain British and a sizable minority would violently oppose a breakaway. Never once does this limp biopic point out that partition is the only optition Collins had to avert an Irish bloodbath. We see Collins going to meet the British government  then it cuts to the next scene a few months later where Collins returns to Dublin with a deal that has split Ireland in two. There is no exposition or explanation as to why Collins HAD TO negotiate partition. Instead Neil Jordan and Co decide its a better idea making a film that concentrates on a love triangle.So what does this piece of Hollywood garbage actually tell us ? Only that Michael Collins called lots of people  Gobs   that Alan Rickman can certainly act  that Julia Roberts and Aidan Quinn certainly cant  and that Stephan Rae would make a good James Bond.".

	schema:headline " Begob another Oirish clich";
	schema:reviewBody "It all looked so promising  at last a bigbudget movie about Ireland's history and actually directed and screenwritten by an Irishman! Tax breaks from the Irish government and thousands of Dubliners willing to work for free as extras gave it an added boost.So what went wrong? First of all we have the Oirish cliches. Take this one. Mr Collins makes a speech on a donkey cart. There were such things as platforms in early 20th century Ireland but let that pass. Then the polis come. Collins gets down from the cart and headbutts someone. Mob take out many hurleys and start headwhacking. The whys and wherefores are a mystery here. It's the modern version of the obligatory barfight scene. For a sense of the lost dramatic potential of such a scene read this report from England's 'Daily Mail' about a mass meeting in Ennis Co. Clare addressed by de Valera in 1917 De Valera's arrival on the platform...was the signal for shattering cheers. In the square and its converging streets he faced 10000 men the remainder stood 'on guard' beyond the range of his commanding eye...As the cheers roared around him De Valera held up his hand. There was instantly a dead silence...He himself said very little. 'I am not here to speak' he cried. 'The time for speechmaking is over. The time to act has come!'And then the story. It is well known that most real lives don't translate very well to the screen so subtelty and imagination must be applied liberally. Unfortunately Collins's true story doesn't lend itself very well to a movie as the story of say Patrick Pearse or amon de Valera would. Their lives had a real straightforwardness that is lacking here. Instead of fictionalising the character which is always necessary in movies Jordan used the actual facts and twisted them which only usually works in history when the historian isn't very particular about the truth. Thus instead of being a valuable asset to the republican movement Collins is the republican movement  so much for poor aul' Cathal Brugha who organised the War of Independence with the assistance of Richard Mulcahy and the constant involvement of de Valera who was the senior surviving commander from the 1916 Rising. Brugha was also a prominent 1916 survivor. Believe it or not Collins was just the 'head of a subsection' as Cathal Brugha portrayed as a raving lunatic naturally famously said. One doesn't wish to underestimate Collins's role but it was almost exclusively in intelligence. Think of how interesting a film based on Collins's espionage might have been instead of the fruitless insistence that he was the Big Fella he really was!Instead of the statesman that he was recognised all but officially as the President of the Irish Republic in America where he toured and raised funds in 191920 de Valera 'becomes' a mere conniver whose only interest is...well it's not explained really but we just know he's evil. He also had a much greater involvement in the War of Independence than he's given credit for and neither he nor Brugha approved of Collins's occasional 'revenge' killings. And so on.As for the cast the standard was poor. Neeson was alright but the others were frankly atrocious. Poor aul' Harry Boland portrayed as a weakling by Quinn was most definitely not killed in a sewer but gunned down in a hotel room by a murder gang. And why was Dev in his 30s at the time made to look old enough to be a grandfather? And let's not mention the woeful miscasting of Julia Roberts...Such a pity really. I'm just waiting until they make a film about someone such as Dev. Someone of such real integrity political wisdom and statesmanlike qualitites deserves a better showing than this as do most of the other people portrayed in a skewed light by Jordan in this film. And by the bye merely from a dramatic standpoint why was de Valera the principal villain and not the British apart from a couple of evil soldiers who were got rid of by bloody assassination or imollation? Err weren't the Irish supposed to be fighting the British? I think we all deserve something better really after so much Hollywood misinterpretation of Ireland.".

	onyx:emotionText "It all looked so promising  at last a bigbudget movie about Ireland's history and actually directed and screenwritten by an Irishman! Tax breaks from the Irish government and thousands of Dubliners willing to work for free as extras gave it an added boost.So what went wrong? First of all we have the Oirish cliches. Take this one. Mr Collins makes a speech on a donkey cart. There were such things as platforms in early 20th century Ireland but let that pass. Then the polis come. Collins gets down from the cart and headbutts someone. Mob take out many hurleys and start headwhacking. The whys and wherefores are a mystery here. It's the modern version of the obligatory barfight scene. For a sense of the lost dramatic potential of such a scene read this report from England's 'Daily Mail' about a mass meeting in Ennis Co. Clare addressed by de Valera in 1917 De Valera's arrival on the platform...was the signal for shattering cheers. In the square and its converging streets he faced 10000 men the remainder stood 'on guard' beyond the range of his commanding eye...As the cheers roared around him De Valera held up his hand. There was instantly a dead silence...He himself said very little. 'I am not here to speak' he cried. 'The time for speechmaking is over. The time to act has come!'And then the story. It is well known that most real lives don't translate very well to the screen so subtelty and imagination must be applied liberally. Unfortunately Collins's true story doesn't lend itself very well to a movie as the story of say Patrick Pearse or amon de Valera would. Their lives had a real straightforwardness that is lacking here. Instead of fictionalising the character which is always necessary in movies Jordan used the actual facts and twisted them which only usually works in history when the historian isn't very particular about the truth. Thus instead of being a valuable asset to the republican movement Collins is the republican movement  so much for poor aul' Cathal Brugha who organised the War of Independence with the assistance of Richard Mulcahy and the constant involvement of de Valera who was the senior surviving commander from the 1916 Rising.

	schema:reviewBody "This past St. Patrick's day I decided to rent Michael Collins.  In the news we were hearing about Ahern Trimble and Adams coming to the US in order to be encouraged by the President to continue peace talks.  The results were not encouraging.  So when we saw this movie and the horrific brutality of it and how once it started it developed its own momentum continuing on and on without reason for over 700  now going on 800  years I could not help but compare Ireland's story of fighting against British authoritarianism to that of India  remembering what I've read about that era and as it was portrayed in Attenborough's film Gandhi.At a time when the fight is still going on in Ireland India  even with all its problems  enjoys over 50 years of independence.Could it be that Gandhi although aware was not as affected by the western spiritual philosophies Judaism Christianity and Islam which propose more of an eye for an eye methodology.  His style of confrontation was not passive resistance as it has often been misnomered but an aggressive campaign to fight the British.  However he did not trade brutality for everescalating brutality as was so sadly dramatized in Michael Collins. Rather he confronted the British savageness not with more savageness but with humanism.  What better way to overcome brutality than to remind your opponent that both of you are human beings.  That although you are willing to die for your cause you are not willing to kill.In the Gandhi film most striking was a conversation with the photographer Margaret BourkeWhite.  During this she claims that certainly Gandhi's methods could not be utilized against someone like Hitler.  He concedes that yes it would be very difficult and that many would die. But hadn't there already been many deaths in the war?Compare this to the hate Michael Collins in the movie has for the British forces because they cause him to become an expert in bloody mayhem.   By participating in the atrocities of war we become demons ourselves and engender such fear in our opposition that they feel justified to respond with even more atrocity.  And that way it can never never stop.".

So my Irish history is rusty and this movie helps fill in some gaps but I think more of the history of these folks struggle should have been shown.Julia Roberts' Kitty Kiernan is character who needed further development or she should have hit the cutting room floor. Why is she involved in the cause? Who does she love Michael or Harry? Is she a country lass or a city woman? Why is she in the film again?

	schema:reviewBody "I guess I learned something about Irish history in this biopic but it was not a moving film although somewhat interesting.  I have the feeling that they threw in a love interest just for the hell of it to draw in a few woman viewers.  It's mostly plotting followed by shooting and it really gets you on the Irish side of things.  You start thinking that the shootings are justified.  Then Collins gets sent to England to negotiate and all of a sudden he's a pacifist.  You don't see what happened in England to make him such but he decides that bloodshed is bad and expressing fealty to the crown is OK if it avoids bloodshed.  I guess the transition happened during the negotiations and Neil Jordan couldn't figure out a way to make those negotiations interesting so you just have to speculate on what happened.So the divided Irish Free State is born because of Collins and eventually we are left to assume that becomes a republic presided over by a guy Devalera who went from ally to enemy after Collins went to England. It's not at all clear how the transition to independent republic came about or when it came about.The movie is a little over 2 hours but it needed more to be good portrayal of history. I'm sure much was left in the cutting room in order to make it a watchable length but the picture as is makes little sense.  And it makes Collins look like a traitor even though he is thought of as a hero and I think that the filmmakers wanted us to see him as a hero.  But he looked like an arrogant fool at the end and I felt no pain when Johathan RhysMeyers shot him to death.".

Not as impressive was Julia Robert's performance of Kitty. Her accent slipped very noticeably during the length of film and the performance felt rather stiff.
